a problem\nThough here's here's a if you take the cash you only get half so you don't get eight sixty eight if you take the cash value if you if you don't have it spread over Twenty years so basically you're getting four hundred and thirty four so after taxes you're four hundred and thirty four goes down to three hundred whether the eight hundred goes down through\nSlender stand the math no lettuce

I thought it was just an interrogation went wrong it was an accident exactly how he saw as a matter of the accidentally shot into these as it happens they\nDrop the bone so happens All right let's get some details now from Molly hunter who is joining us live from Istanbul she's the ABC News foreign correspondent good morning to Mali\nGuys get morning I Wish I had to try and match the grizzly grisly details that are coming out and all sorts of reports right and left Turkish anonymous sources yeah\nWhat what's the would you have any confirmation on this alleged the existence of the audio of his actual killing\n... we jumped on we've we've seen reports about that\nThe last week or so I Turkish officials anonymous Turkish officials have basically been leaking up a storm and we believe it's on president aired on a fight that he's basically thing going if they've been going from kind of daily newspaper the Washington Post the New York times and getting a little bit but he's really ... there's an audio and video\nThat actually proved that democracy as you walk into the contract with health within ... inside the conflict lots of conflicting reports ABC News cannot confirm any of these and really the problem with this guy is it no one thing anything on the record so\nThere was an aid he worked for it a couple of days ago to check the friends that FEMA okay here that forensic team has found actual evidence that he was killed in that conflict well we haven't seen that forensic evidence we've got the audio and video report we've got a reports that say\nHis apple watching and picked up audio the problem with this story in the last thing we know when it's thing any on the record in President airline is letting his Turkish anonymous sources talking\nHey Molly well we keep hearing and we've heard it now I think for forty eight hours that the Saudis are going to claim that yes they killed them but it was an accident it was an interrogation gone wrong when or where it will be some kind of an official statement from somebody\nThat's exactly right so ... can confirm that the Saudis have said they're preparing a report that will say that and according to report it will say that interrogation gone wrong first surfaced step that report with two days ago we expected it yesterday\nAfter secretary of state Mike Pompeo I got back from Riyadh of course he went to a reality that we keep them on you know the crown prince Mohammed bin ...\nHe didn't flee to turkey this morning you know it's present aired on that we're expecting that's their right to come out at some point the Turks are desperate for this Saturday at best up and say what happened because day for the last two weeks that it's actually been trying to put pressure\nOn anyone they can treat us publication paid and trying to put pressure on the White House because they know that the white has actually might be able to kind of urged ... it to get the real story\nWell with the Saudis ... be able to say that with a straight face about interrogation gone wrong if there's actually audio or video of what happened\nI mean that's the question right guys what kind of interrogation\nEnds up like that and what kind of methods were being is that is all this report about the forensic expert and the phone that actually real I think regardless of what the actual grisly details are is that either had it not going to have a hard time saying anything with it ... it gets to the last\nFew weeks they've been telling us that the guy walked out the conflict on his own but they weren't knowingly lying but the last few weeks now to say oh no no wait we actually we did know this guy came in this is what happens if the ... I mean why do we trust but he worked for it if it's the same party official told us that he walked out\n... Molly can we trust the Turkish sources 'cause we know turkey and Saudi Arabia do not get along\nWe can't and that's why this is such a frustrating story gentleman to be on the ground reporting luck I think that at this point it looks like the ... do you have evidence um I didn't tell when you see it and so we need some audio and video and audio gets an actual\nForensic evidence we have law enforcement sources who are part of the investigation team that we can't confirm that there's evidence yet that the the investigation's ongoing I so I really caution\nKind of all of these are for it and reading and all of them and kill we have something solid until we've seen something that ... one of them up\n... alright ABC News corresponding Molly hunter in Istanbul Thanks Molly\n... thanks Molly\nI you know that there's so many bits and pieces here you know the the president came out the other day and said he has no\nBusiness interest in Saudi Arabia ... well now all the stories are coming out of this is feeling says he's dealt with the Saudis but outside of Saudi they weren't in Saudi Arabia says like late ... he sold ... to ... I don't know whatever I mean even Fox News put out all these facts or wasn't like\nThe left was putting this out as he has\nHad business dealings with Saudis but he his statement was not in Saudi Arabia and I and again when he said yesterday well it's a he ... it was the capital of the fence\nInnocent until proven guilty and I think most of the world is already convicted the Saudis are not\nAllowing Molly hunter just said that we have not seen any of the these reports have come out they've been leaked anonymously by Turkish officials but she says we've got no evidence for anything that anyone insane at this point frankly I have no idea what ... doing over there seems to be smiling and shaking hands with everybody\nWell he's got got some criticism for shaking hands with the premise you should look\nA little more serious if he supposedly investigating what's happening\nYou know the New York times and their story this morning in that mode Molly hunter of ABC News said that the uh the Turks are leaking out to the Washington Post the New York times the times story this morning says there's direct linkage between the assassins like dot ... dot as as employees of the the crown prince\nI thought it was interesting we spoke to representative a Congressman Peter king earlier and he actually was with US Senator Lindsey Graham and saying the crown prince if he is directly involved in this should be muscled aside by the Saudi family in a new head of state should be installed in Saudi Arabia\nWhile because you know whenever the Saudis come up with whatever report they're going to come up with which is going to be difficult to say and interrogations gone wrong if there was actual audio and video the bones saw been employed ... ... tactics we know about\nThe CDC is

by idly actually had an opinion that suffer never heard\nThis before from Natalie in I have opinions so tell us what do you think you really are you offended by what Trump said to Stormy Daniels\nWhat bothered me is that he has different standards than the rest of us and it's like I said show called somebody and even if you call me that name and I went to HR and said you know what I was at the ... that show called me of course faith in the office\nKill probably get in trouble well the president though the president has some prerogative is yeah you can get away\nWith the rest of it but one of my\nSon called it a girl in his class of ... he would get called down to the principal's office ... or\nGetting a little too sensitive exactly he got available time here and stone's may break my name's on never hurt me well\nWhat is that a maybe we are too sensitive I agree with that point but at the world we live in now so why doesn't he have to live in the same standards the rest of us\nBecause it's refreshing though it's refreshing we all have to go around everything these days\nYou know this is called pretzel shaping and real and Bartlett do it all the time whenever the

already figure with the money\nGo to our favorite White House correspondent John Carlos and Washington for ABC News a John I I'm just a or can do is roll my eyes a one week it's Kanye now it's horse race it must be a thrill admitted to cover the president down in Washington\n[laughter] well we were just a a look crunching the numbers here at the ABC White House ah both the president\nFor the past ten days we believe has gone on his door Rick media blitz I don't think we have seen a ten day period and all of American history and I'm going back to I'm going back to George okay all the way back\nWeight or as long as it George Washington yeah for president as\nTaking more questions\nFrom ah the news media than this president has I mean it has been an rolling\nNonstop press conference saying all kinds of things I mean he's he's he's just openly pondered where his uh attorney general is he's attacked his a row quite quite strongly is that the fed chairman that he nominated Stormy Daniels space\nThe uh the the whole escapade with um with a Kanye West and the ... but it has been it is it it's been impossible to keep up with\nJohn Wayne and by the way\nDuring this period we haven't seen Sarah Sanders [laughter] I mean there there hasn't been any sign of the press secretary so the theory that we're working on here is it they have hired a new press secretary here at the White House in his name is Donald Trump\nCould well be let me ask you do you think that uh one of the reasons he's out in about so much that he's getting more and more confident that the Republicans might exceed expectations in the midterms\n[noise] well I think that that is part of it is certainly did this all starts after Kavanaugh's confirmed\nSo clearly first of all feels really good about that victory um a he feels that there's he has been shown some good news for the Republicans in terms of the midterms especially I'm On a in the Senate races but even the house races you here\nYou know ... ... ... the ... the Democrats will when the house but you hear even from Democrats a wheel a toning down of the expectations\nYou know they did that though when the house but it will probably be narrowly I mean who knows I mean they've got a lot lot can change in this world and three weeks but there's no question that the environment has improved for Republicans the president knows that and uh he feels like he's got the wind at his back and he is just out there everywhere\nWell I'm Glad we have you on the line John Carlin be sous White House correspondent 'cause the president's waited seconds to go and you can interpret this for me I don't know what he's referring to he says a P headline was very different from my quote and meaning in the story they just can't help themselves fake news and the witch and the idea which have on he's referring to here\nWe're glad you're spending your evening with our replay of this morning show gets just for a brand new one moment of Michael rely on the morning tomorrow from six to seven vent wor\nMorning every one is we approach have forty on a Wednesday of everyone's doing well let's take a look at some of the entertainment\nOf headlines and I know we've all been very concerned about an ... day\nSince the big split with Pete Davidson of Saturday Night live well she made her first public appearance Michael ... showed up for NBC's taping of a very wicked Halloween is also a stars a dean them and sell all my friends frozen starring wicked\nStarring this friend that Michael everyone's your friend on Broadway until you write a bad review about him [laughter] and they turn on you he do 'em\nAnyway she's that that is the first time in public and apparently she can go to any of the reversal but she did show up for the program and she also announced that she's going to quit social media\nReally well while I guess she's a she get the Ninety three thousand dollar engagement ring back to the poor slob she did\nWe here she's going to that's the that's the word on the street\n... right she's going so she's got a lot more money than he has he really blew that one he could have lived there for free or sixteen million dollar apartment\nWell he said he did he was living there for free so set on Saturday Night live all he had to do with stock the fridge responsibility she took care of the rent and how to sixty grand a month or had any lettuce sugar mom I get away not a smoothie ruin it for a long time so what's this up I was fascinated by this and I guess I should have\nKnown this we use of Marilyn Monroe converted when she was married converted to Judaism\nShe did she marry Arthur Miller famous play right a death of a salesman and he was Jewish and she converted and now her\nSit or is that how you pronounce it or you know ... or is going out for our book right her prayer book that she used that she was converting and studying Judaism is going up to auction expected to fetch\nTwelve thousand dollars and apparently it is very well thumbed through the spine is broken and in her own handwriting are a lot of notes that he was shot it down so she took\nThe conversion to Judaism quite seriously wrong to a rabbi who was her teacher back then his name back in those days was rabbi\nGoldberg of congregation Michigan Israel in New Haven Connecticut he oversaw her conversion he was quoted as saying\nAfter her death in Nineteen sixty two she was not an intellectual but she was sincere and her desire to learn about Judaism that's interesting yeah also up for sale is her ah ... her key bird Nineteen fifty six for tea bird and that's expected to fetch\nFive hundred thousand dollars is a big auction of her stuff or a yes it's going to take place out in Los Angeles next week\nBut the two prominent items are the ... and the and the thunder but one who's got the dress the shoe or over the grill and I I I Do believe somebody does somebody does on that address did go up for auction it's one of those things like the uh\nUh Dorothy is ruby slippers yeah it's come up for auction a few times over the years and I think it ...\nI Would think when you think of iconic movie props that would have I Would have to be in the top five you know what I like\nTo know what someone paid for the house that she died at Brentwood that would be interesting wow or was it a fancy house no it was a bungalow kind of she was living there uh by herself at the time when they found her dead of a drug overdose but I've driven by the house in or out there in Brentwood\nWell you know a an entertainment is obviously we were disgusted earlier the commerce debuted last night on ABC were anxious to get the first ratings I haven't seen them yet\nI'm madly in love the show is very good and the that they could get a very good rating with a tune in I have noticed this flying under the radar a little bit Michael NFL ratings are doing very well in fact they are up\nAnd you know there's a lot of talk about uh the Colin Kaepernick and people were never going to watch NFL football again because of that and that there were trumpeting\n... to a dip in the ratings last year I didn't believe it I said it has to do with competition including games well the games have been there been some terrific game high scoring\nMany of them one in the last second on a field goal the big names have stepped up and hug Brady into Aaron Rodgers new stars of a reason like I'm a parent homes in Kansas City and I and I just think I'm\nA ... so the ratings are up so uh and and you know another thing when it comes to television\nOne other no don't want to give you is is a story out that's saying the limits terms you know when it comes to television coverage and elections\nObviously a presidential election gets the big big coverage yeah well they're saying all the networks are treating the midterms like a presidential year well it's a big big election coming up\nWell I'm ... I'm Wondering if you on the right thing that's because the left the networks than they are going to win the house and that's why they're treating it with such important ABC News is saying uh this uh this is going to be an event of seismic proportions\nWell the whole question is if the Democrats get control of the house then they have subpoena power they can hound the president they might impeach the president that's a historic moment and it's well worth tuning in Fort\nWas interesting as the late night shows are going to go live yeah so a ... it's even called bear who often you know he'll go live during the president's election so he's gonna he's gonna go live a let's see who else is Seth Meyers on even later on NBC is going to go live the uh the Daily Show will be alive so I guess yeah\nI mean well but you have to say the other thing is going to drive the ratings are there is genuine excitement surrounding this election when it looked like the Dems had a surefire shot at taking a house I\nWas probably going to be tuning out but now that it's gotten closer since the Kavanaugh hearings it's going to be a cliffhanger you're eating you might stay up past your bed tend to watch it on\nWell don't back on his own bed on that [laughter] so you who who let me set up this next story 'cause because ... basically thinks the royals or a waste of time and he's not a big fan of kids\nAnd then he walks in the sport he says oh there's this cue this video this little kid and with Megan and Harry in Australia and I'm saying is this what what did you like take the wrong pills this morning when he woke up\nI mean well I was ... I was channeling my inner soccer mom when I was looking at this video and I thought well Natalie do if she saw this video and I've had ... ... you go that's so cute it's a video of a kid a Megan and Harry are down under their tour in New Zealand and Australia\nAnd are they met this kid I think it was in Australia where there was a drought\nAnd the part of that ah the country suffering so they went to try to get some comfort to these people and it's a cute little kid and he goes up to Harry and he plays with Harry's beer which is cute and then he hugs Meg and he won't let go right and they just clean really hurt apparently somebody said he he loves Santa Claus like most children Dale\nAnd beard reminded him ginger Santa\nSwat was this kid oh he was young I Know the topic of the issues for like ... I mean it's just a little kid what\nLincoln fiction put up with that is that drought has it had a dry water\nIn a week did you see the new pictures of making inherent today\nAs she got the baby bump no matter who was telling me that it was raining there\nAnd she and he was giving a speech and she ... on his side holding the umbrella for him\nAnd all of us are sort of why wasn't ... holding it for some reason why I said that's\nThe job of the of the check out his speech the chamber of ... famous on well you know you're going to the side by side pictures of that that's right well you see you could see that video on our website right the little kid Oh absolutely not been ten W. O. R. dot com slash lent and Michael you can see the kid playing with hairy little beer\nAnd I think it's a completely appropriate that she was holding the umbrella that's the way it should be exactly get back in the kitchen and cook's sub soup you're right so [laughter] I don't think making ... going to be cooking by soup such trouble surprise the president and interview with Fox News last night you know he's a very big fan of Michael Bloomberg where do you how to\nFly if you're spending your evening with our ... morning show catch just for a brand new one burning Michael Riddle in the morning you Maro from six to fend on seven then a couple of you or [noise]\nEverybody's got a little a political news for you know you may have heard and I guess we've\nProbably told you 'cause it broke when we were on the air Michael Bloomberg former mayor of New York city he re registered as a Democrat leading people to speculate that he may be running\nFor the a presidential nomination on the Democratic party now what Trump was asked about that on Fox Business I think yeah\nWell he was on Fox Business a shocking in an interview with Fox but he did\nWhen he doesn't seem to threatened by a little Mikey Bloomberg he does not\nMichael Bloomberg might be running that's good\nYeah I think it'd be easy though is I don't think is what the Democrats and I wouldn't be able to do anything in the primaries where the ... I think I think the Democrats will eat 'em up\nThey'll eat 'em up those Democrat yeah Pocahontas all scalp him heal the\nGulf this fits right and I got I got an email from a listener ... hello Helen so we're high on my mother's name some partial to then I'm so obviously we're talking about the uh the Trump news where he called a ...\nA Stormy Daniels or space you said your co host doesn't see anything wrong with President Trump calling people names he does the same thing like when he calls you an idiot he defends from 'cause he identifies with him\nWhy did I call unity it um I don't know on a regular basis\n[laughter] I don't look at it today or not I don't think I called you in India Today no I just rolled my eyes that but I Will unity of that but I I Do know if you call me to you you do that with love absolutely I Will tell you and I guess I ...\nSect Robin sick so that was involved in that one too I like to I'd like for real well I liked blurred lines with Emily ...\nBut that's a whole other story or I went to about ... what do you have to say about the horse face comment while he was Paul Ryan speaker of the house\nThere's no place for that there is no place for any kind of there's no place for that kind of language\nThat she should not have said that\nWell you know Lindsey Graham had this to say\nIs a street fighter sell so [noise] I just don't think that that would make him does anything good for the country so I think I think the\nPoliticians are saying the right things I mean Peter King earlier on our show a Michael I asked him that question I said well what what would your oh lovely wife Rosemarie what does it say about that sweet\nIt was absolutely ridiculous she thought it was wrong I thought it was wrong it's a story Daniels is not the ideal woman is the fact is is the United states you shouldn't be even saying anything about her a subject that way which was foolish was wrong and I am saying it was it was up to no shoe store and she was\nThere you go to the entire interview that we did with Long Island Congressman Peter king earlier this morning is on our website seven ten W. or dot coms less than a Michael our interview with Peter King is equally as good as not better than anything on these TV shows that we're talking about this morning\nThe funny thing about this this is not going to pay attention any of these guys and he's going to go right on saying but he wants to say because it works for him right it works for now Lindsey Graham\nIs Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham is right about this I Want to say that one\nAnd this is fundamental to understanding from but I don't think you kinda grasp the concept of the street fighter but exactly yeah leader and Lindsey Graham understands from it's the street fighter\nThe queen's brawl or that Trump is at heart and that his supporters love to see on display and that can sometimes degenerate into a little bit of name calling but well ... the support is support out there all\nPaul Ryan was also asked this morning which I think is even more important he was on the CBS show this morning about the midterms and obviously a speaker of the house will continue to be so\nI think we are I feel pretty good about it while I think our voter enthusiasm is where needs to be and more importantly we have a great record run on the agenda that we ran out in twenty sixteen is each other we actually only Seventeen and twenty teens\nAnd it works well he's not going to remain speaker of the house because you know you're not running right he's done that yet he's finished\nUsed on but uh but I'm saying is the Republicans will maintain control and have their own and it was the front runner to replace him speak\nFor that question I'm not sure I don't think I've heard any I'm sure some names have emerged where I haven't heard anyone\nAnyone yet we know who's going to be on your side if the Dems take over\nA who's a Nancy Pelosi\nCan't wait for that and wait to see her wielding fan of Democrats you like hurry like Feinstein you love them all the great war ... and Cory Booker oh genius oh Schumer yeah never can't get enough of Schumer I get up every Sunday Morning I think what a Schumer going to be said on the talk shows this morning very excited\nBy the way also on the show as a there were some interviews done with Nick Cage you know he was the a NASA\nAstronaut Oh yes he and the causes but I remember they survived that space emergency this and that's pretty scary they blasted off from Kazakhstan last week and they had a parachute remember we saw the video came down with a bump boom I mean they really landed hard well anyway uh here's a\nA Nick Cage or was there was some interviews\nA lot of side to side motion being a tossed around but it was over almost before it started a and at that point we switched into a different set of procedures knowing that our mission I prime mission at that point was to get back down on the ground safe and so we started doing the things we needed to do to make that happen\nA house or are you kidding me but you know when we listen to the Nassau a narrator they all sound very calm and do\nI forget what the term days where there is no well I mean I don't mind the glass is great but thing is common\nAnd that's what I said I was there on the ground there's ... there's an anomaly\nBe careful that must be in the

It's MORNING show catch just for a brand new one burning Michael real in the morning tomorrow from six to fend on seven than the W o off\nAt a very good morning to everybody well Mary Bono did not last very long as the head of the USA Gymnastics she resigned just after five days now Simone Biles who called her out in Arizona when\nShe was not happy with the Nike colon Kaepernick or\nA ad campaign and she apparently used a black market ... bono did he did marry Boehner did she used a black market a cover up the Nike logo to voice their displeasure with the company's ad campaign\nBuilt around the NFL activist quarterback\nSimone Biles called her out and Mary Bono his folded like a cheap touchy by the way was the wife of Sonny Bono who did it when he ran into a tree skiing and uh she served as she took over his seat in the house of representatives and she's surfer Fifteen Years now I bet Simone Biles in her because Mary Bono was a Republican I bet that's that's I think\nThat's what's sad you know I think well ... you know first of all\nUs women's gymnastics has a huge huge problem you know the whole about Larry Nassar at all the abuse and he's in prison for the rest of his life indeed and uh so this is Mary Bono comes in bono to to to clean things up and then she they find the sweetest she put out and she\nI don't know her her ... or apology letter it's not really an apology letter the reason why she stepping down I think uh she kinda dances around a lot of stuff but\nWhile she goes after the personal attacks on her but she doesn't come out with a direct a pilot apologize I suppose the head of the gymnastics board of directors probably should not take a political position on these things one\nWay or the other issue is just going after response or I mean some of them ... sarcastically asked in hurts we you know it's it's as if we don't need sponsors right you know they need to they need Nike and they need other sponsorship so uh\nShe should probably have focused on trying to burnish their reputation organization that's really in the gutter there are problems allegations problems are\nYour favorite football team is making a lot of headlines a first they gave oh they'll Beckham juniors Ninety five million bucks\nThen he gave an interview to ESPN where he a kind of criticized the way the team was playing and now the owner or that seem a John Barrow who a dozen or often say a lot of stuff well here's what he said I Wish she would [noise]\nFor a little more playing a little less talking\nWhat do you think Joey be or the giants fan around here I I saw he tried that early on the season he tried to be a good citizen because they did give 'em a pile of money but I I think he's a little frustrated right down first of all the guys immature\nBut he's frustrated by the losing I think he's frustrated because he like can't get the ball to them and I think another thing that's irritating a or they'll Beck and junior is that say Kwan Barclay has now the star the steam\nAh that that was interesting yeah running back he's a great running by I still think the giants should've drafted the quarterback but that's just me but uh this guy is a terrific running back there's no question but in the NFL today you don't build teams around running backs or wide receivers building around quarterbacks and\nAnd but ... had they drafted a quarterback right they would be in the same since ... starting quarterback right now that yeah but you look across town and the rookies started Sam ... for the jets the jets and out three and three year the giants are one five\nI think that would have been a big call for the kids that come off the bench if there was a kid on the bench now Mara was asked about manning at the same time he was talking about a hotel back from junior and we're still believe in\nAll right so you kind of dance their team is a mess I mean team is uh made it up and leave all have such high hopes on my God I Know and again you know the the odds makers the beginning season said they were going to win six and a half games I said that's a good bet take that they're going to [noise]\nI don't think they're going to do it very disappointing\nYeah well a couple of Michael even [laughter]\n\nWhat's their record it and I don't have it in front of me uh let me see if I can call that [laughter] they get the sports though no matter what and five\nOf us ... hey there was a baseball game last well there were\nTwo and a\nAnd I'm you know the teams that I thought were going to go to the world series they both lost last night there there was a baseball game he at the bar he saw it on our side how 'bout Jackie Bradley junior you know he's known for his defense with the red Sox\nSo in game two we had the big uh bases clearing triple and then last night in Houston and the\nOne to Jay Jay Hi Dr\nWas out of high school call though that was jokes the Rio and that's the red Sox value not just used to that excited\nThat's the red Sox ... would you rather him saying it didn't sound very professional really apparent joke his son works at a Fox five to ... to pick 'em for Joe here's been the red Sox announce it forever by you guys are harsh on announcers will I start going on while\nThere's what's going on and it's got to say how heroes that's for sure used by standard that alright well anyway the red Sox are now lead to games to one game for tonight is right here on seven ten W O R we've got the red Sox an Astros\nCoverage here because it's seven thirty\nThis is a really wanting to today's Len Burman and Michael read all in the morning and get them live tomorrow from ... on seven ten W all are\nComing up on six forty a good morning everyone on a Wednesday and uh [noise]\nYou know Michael ... what do you think a good job ... doesn't think the horse face story is a big story a certainly did not make well it was mentioned in the front page it was not in the New York times anywhere on the website when I checked the time ah yeah I think I think it's somewhere buried it when I said\nI'm not trying to make a joke here when I saw that I went whoa\nI mean I I knew when I went may I well I just it was ... I\nI understand the argument and Joe said well that's trumping Trump or are we so that's our fallback now no matter what he says goes because Trump's ... isn't there any kind of decorum anymore now the president\nI mean can you imagine Abraham Lincoln well for scoring several years ago the\nOh we're a long way from the race or a long way for a long way in our society we're a long way\nIn our in our conversation at our national conversation from Abraham Lincoln but may I remind you there was a civil war when Abraham Lincoln was president so things weren't so great back then either I Can't imagine if\nI'm not making this Democrat Republican I can imagine W\nCalling someone horse race or W senior or Richard even Richard Nixon ... a lot of crappy things I Can't even imagine him using that phrase\nYou didn't hear the Nixon tapes my God the stuff he said about Jews and\nWith this public I'm Talking about public in public that's what I'm Talking about yeah they say a lot of so I'm sure LBJ curse like a truck driver while he was sitting on the John barking out or did you see what you were in the movies\nWhere you you you have a blind spot as so many on the left do about Trump what gives Trump his power as residents and his strength is he says things that people think he has no filter and people find that refreshing went for most of the time politicians ... politicians come out with their poll tested speeches\nTheir ... their cliches and they bore you to tears okay well I'm On a horse you to tears\nYou know a lot of women who are like this show and support Trump because they call us ... I Would love to hear from women\nAnd and I'd love to hear what they have to say we'll take calls throughout the morning you know but why I'd love to hear from women what do they think when they hear and they see the president of states publicly calls a woman horse race he's calling out okay it's a porn star I Know so so that's what she's more are earning an honest living here are just the news writer for the post\nShe's earned his earning an honest living by trying to go after the president with some trumped up charges that were just dismissed\nSo she can capitalize oh it's okay to her motives are hardly pure land so it's okay to call you ... you're just a writer for the post", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "year": "2018", "city": "New York", "day": "18"}
