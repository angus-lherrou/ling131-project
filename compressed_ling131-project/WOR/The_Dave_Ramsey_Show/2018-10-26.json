the White House press secretary should understand their words matter that's far they've shown no comprehension of that\nThis is ridiculous so basically what the media that hates trumpet saying we should have\nFree rein every right to attack this president relentlessly and he should not be able to fight about it and he was fighting not stand up for sale he should not challenge us because we are the media and what we say it's a final verdict on President and he said just shut up and be civil that's what the media itself from\nEvery president gets attacked there's ways to fight back and there are ways not to fight back you have to understand that this is the president who during the campaign versus supporters beat up those protesters I'm going to pay your legal bills I worked he got elected well this is the president who just last week said hey it's just fine and dandy\nThat a congressman body slammed the reporter so this is a guy who was embrace violence in his rhetoric come you can't sit listen if he doesn't like what the news media saying then fight back with ... and now\nI'm not there no life here Len he has ... has tapped into this boiling resentment from a peep from Republicans about a mainstream media that seeks to keep Democrats in power and to destroy and denigrate Republicans Trump is tapped into that it is there he unleashed it\nAnd it's about time it was on the east and the media should be challenged all the time I Can't stand the media when they get on their high horse those fearless seekers of truth talking truth to power they like to say and then they then you criticize the media and the golf sensitive about that\nIt's a battle between what Trump in the media they were out to destroy and he's got every right to fight and he's been successful at it too I might add\nDoesn't have a right to fight with the words of violence why not fight back with facts instead of ...\nWhat are the facts that every time the story comes out it's against Trump will fight the facts see here's a thousand times\nSo the the you know what the media to ignore all of his\nLife the media is perfectly fine\nGoing after Trump I have no problem with that although that's already happened with the media does because Trump has every right to defend\nThemselves and go after the ... not in the Congress media itself letting the media saying you have no right to challenge us to discuss and it'll it I got to take us on that is what the media they say\nThat that's what soccer's just a matter of civil talked weaken Alice on all night long bashing you saying what a horrible person you are but you you can't say anything negative\nAnd you have to be similar he does have to be he gets up\nThere totally tone deaf last night and says after what happened with CNN that oh the media has to be civil as if he bears no responsibility whatsoever who's the one who calls on the enemy that people fake news lock her up low IQ Maxine you want me to go on and on and on no wonder all these people were targeted\nBy the way a lot of those things I gotta say and he got elected and he has tightened the gap between the Democrats and the Republicans coming up the mid term elections so his tactics are affected\nWell let's let's see what all these people have in common here is the list now as we have a George Soros is the first one a bomb was probably not pass through the mail I'm guessing someone just put it in the mailbox I think the CNN\nThat was it was addressed all these words dress bogus leave from representative uh Debbie Wasserman Schultz in Florida we know that it's focused for a fact well they\nMisspelled her name yeah maybe one suspects are all day I'm not trying to put you off the track [laughter]\nAnyway it was it was addressed to CNN to a former CIA director John Brennan doesn't even work for CNN he works for NBC\nOr that they're saying was delivered by Korea\nYeah so that's kind of help them find okay oh they're gonna find as part of Hillary and Bill Clinton rock Obama a Eric Holder former attorney general I'm\nA ... they think there was a package headed for Joe Biden I guess the story is that the package was that there you know it was sent back to Debbie Wasserman Schultz so it's out there somewhere another Biden package and now this morning\nA we think it's a deniro a suspicious package\nAnd try back I guess\nA breaking news now it's coming on television right now and I was riding my bike by that Saddam\nHad alright ... hours already ... yup at CNN is just catching up to ... catching up to me ... so these are all the people clearly all critics of the president\nBut I agree with you guys wholeheartedly that we have to wait and see who actually corals perpetrated this it couldn't be just sum total crazy lunatic could be because probably on the right but\nI have a way way out but wait we have we all the way\nGuys on Twitter and everywhere else all the left my Twitter saying this I don't I don't indulge in conspiracy theories but we just have to withhold judgment but your site is already blaming the rhetoric of President Trump for the pipe while they were there and then last night was Chris Cuomo who noise that\nHeck out of me says his brother Tom I ... how about Andrew Cuomo did you see at the press he thought he got a pipe bomb he was like oh no I'm On the list to whom this is going to be great that that the Blasio look\nThey're all saying this congestion pricing is going to work Michael\nWell maybe they should put food stalls in the subway system and make money by selling people food\nCongestion pricing even fully developed and completely implemented\nWill not be enough\nI it's it's a bottomless pit that as an end the millionaires tax\nYeah that that's the only to block is going to still have the uh what the equipment from the Nineteen thirties ... unbelievable to me and whenever a range of flooding all over the place and why does the governor who controls so much of the anti what is he going to do about it nothing because he wants to punish the Blasio for opposing him\nTo notice all these problems are going to develop after\nHe's really you have a good idea by the way but food court said the subway attacks on the subway car that's right you could make some ... falafel whenever they get all this stuff ... you ... seconds you could drop the boats on the floor of the subway ... feet sounds good to me\nSo I so so let's sum up their slobs or the subway or going to have to pay more and we're going to cut service have a great day everybody I woke up the Thursday the big city\nFloods

New Jersey ... ah that leads off our big three this morning I guess this is what the eighth bomb found seven yesterday he got CNN Maxine Waters the Clintons the ... who sent to Maxine Waters are so at the end\nAnd it may be one floating around that was sent the Biden there they're looking at that one because it was Mr dressed and it was sent they all have the return address of Debbie Wasserman Schultz and misspelled shoals right and uh so they think there was one cent abide myths floating out there that's on its way to show so they're looking for that one\nWas not one cent to Governor Cuomo who seemed to hopeful that he was going to get one yesterday at the news conference when he announced dramatically that reported that a bond as been sent to his office\nSaid device has been sent to my office\nIn Manhattan and wasn't true [laughter] ... exactly\nAlright also in the big three well Megan Kelly is trying to apologize madly for her comments defending\nBlack face the other day but that may not be enough to save her job to go for today that she's going to be out of her a morning show slot on NBC it's probably not just well the blackface comments were inexcusable\nBut that's a good reason to get rid of her because her ratings are terrible to as the words NBC has not been happy with her and rounding out the big three way lost money yesterday I'm Sorry to say that I was down six hundred and four points wiped out all the gains for the year and the tech stocks really took a tumble uh what are they showing out of the markets are going to be little up\nThere on the little are they in your own little little bit up this morning I think yeah I got the Dow futures of a hundred Seventy four NASDAQ up Ninety seven is about one percent a pick up at the beginning assuming these numbers whole\nBest thing to do is don't panic little turbulence in the market just steady as she goes don't sell now that could be the problem out\nYesterday was was while because it opened up down by a bunch then it came all the way it was it was it was only down like sixty or Seventy points at one point and boom the bottom fell out and\nIt dropped a ... a six hundred down but uh yeah I've ever there climbing that's Arabs they're climbing a the interest rates go sometimes they just don't know I mean uh but that that that's that's the shoes as they are using\nRight All right some people will receive those bombs are speaking out yesterday including Hillary Clinton\nShoes or she and her husband were targeted in a in Westchester\nWe are fine thanks to the men and women of the secret service\nWho intercepted\nPackage and dress she last long before it made its way into our homes\nYou know and uh\nSomeone was making the case I obviously on CNN these were assassination attempts [laughter]\nOh well I'm just telling you just tell me what they were ... well if\nYou're sending someone to bomb oh hell yes if I could do them yeah that would be an assassination ... I Know it sounds a little dramatic would it be what would you\nCall it um well I don't what would you call I don't know that I don't know that was an assassination attempt I mean obviously this is\nIt's a threat it's a threat but don't you know bombs sent to their home you know I the only thing that gets me\nWas a bomb threat was actual bomb okay the the issue here is they the target seemed to be very carefully picked very um media I'm focused people from opponents and and and ... and as a result of what's happened here all of those\nThe selected people around talking about being victims here and you know I\nI don't mind paying a little shown that old I Would say though I mean when you get a bomb sent you you are of the so why wouldn't used to be I mean we haven't heard from Maxine Waters I catch Joe can't wait out very well\nYet but here's the lump oh and I don't know what do you mean of course they're ... look at I mean\nIt can't go on this one Joe is there like this you know what if they wanted to bomb somebody's house and bumps somebody I think it would have one of them would've exploded so this is a ... a year buying into this I'm ... I'm not buying into anything I'm trying to paint in total picture here as opposed to do this is\n... we ... we can't speculate and include you in because we\nDon't like us [laughter] good way to do that and I\nI look at where we are now in terms of we've got all the Democrats getting ... we can like relate on who has gotten the habit\nImmigration law might here's what's gonna happen land and this is the political play the Democrats are going to make I think in their heart and right they are delighted yes it is happening because they were losing ground with the caravan that Trump was making hay out of ... lash\nOut the backlash against the attack on cabinet avenue what will we finished\nTrump was closing the gap in the mid term elections\nAnd now this gives the Democrats and the mainstream media CNN MSNBC just wait for those editorials and the New York times to shift the focus on Trump and his rhetoric and his in some on civil attacks on the main media and this is what it has caused and this is why we must elect Democrats that is the\n... kind of timing cannot be ignored so you're going to blame the you're going to say sources behind my self the ... center it's a mild said we cannot speculate\nOn who sent the bumps I Am just telling you how to fit the as the Democratic playbook yeah this is what they're going to\nDo here is John Brennan one of those so called non victims the Portland was talking about bringing the former CIA cheap so when the bomb was senses and it was addressed to Brennan who works at NBC's so this person is a real genius whoever it is anywhere\nI recognize that there are a lot of raw emotions and feelings in this country and very strong feelings for individual political parties as well as individual politicians\nBut this country was founded upon ah the the foundation of freedom and liberty liberty or give a speech\nIn a row harsh critics all the people who were targeted all harsh critics of Trump deniro Maxine Waters Obama the Clintons I don't know what Eric Holder did but somehow got thrown into that the former attorney general\nLet me ask you listen to what is the motivation for somebody on the right to do this now exactly\n... on the Democrats\nIt and if they really were the ... don't you think one of the bombs would've exploded so you're\nBuying into the found them to get enough money you want to get both sides here but you're you're making your case you're buying the music the left in it\nYou get ... I I don't know give me the motivation the home on the right to do this\nBecause they're following the lead of their house set out okay the body slam a reporter boy it's okay to the protesters and because he will pay the bills mhm mhm Len Burman spokesman\nFor ... water right morning ads right hey\nLet's go to a let's go to Joe in Norwalk, Connecticut he's got some thoughts on this morning Joe what do you think\nWhat I'm ... out in my truck\nJoe's back to watch the show he says I Want to look to me was the drivers struck at all does\nNot just today let's work it ought to give me a few short and\nI Know I Know a little bit but I I you know what it's clearly a political stunt so short because those packages that ... percent are show easily to check the goal ... ... and it just smells so she told her ... right\nYeah that's my job but John ... from what side\nI think it's a red flag operation I ... I think it comes from the left on any anybody anybody that actually watch all the it's a it's a chore when would never ever do something like this I mean and and the low for bombers always left wing I don't think there's been a a\nYoung age I don't remember the bombshell remember the weatherman into sixties the weather and all that underground lefty Tommy Tommy Boy commune there that blew up the house and ability to go sit in a rocket go for a ride and maybe the weather's been ...\nBy the way everyone wants to call in I just saw you know we're going to take a whole phone call segment on this who's to blame is the president's fault we're gonna we're gonna take that about seven forty so all you people calling we appreciate it but I think around seven forty will take your calls\nAre coming up next is the morning show flame out Megan Kelly is apologizing like crazy for her comments on black face but it may not be enough to save her job we will discuss\nBeer enjoying this ... times of today's one Berman a micro real in the morning we'll be back with a new show tomorrow from six to ten on seven then wor\nRated number one seven and W.

R.\nDot com [laughter] this is a really wanting to today's Len Burman and Michael read all in the morning catch them live tomorrow from six built in on seven ten\nW O R alright the phones are open one eight hundred three two one zero seven ten is at Trump's fault about these pipe bombs there because he attacks the media he's brought to the level of discourse into the gutter that sweat lens says that's what the mainstream media says that's what CNN says\nOr is the left to blame for their attacks they're vicious attacks on our president one eight hundred and three two one zero seven ten we want to know what you think\nThe calls we uh you know were great it inside information you're the one who broke the De Niro bomb story to this morning another pipe bomb center Robert De Niro the story was broken by Michael ... right here at seventh and W. or\nUm we have another inside report we're talking about Megan Kelly and her days on the today show are numbered andme multiple outlets are reporting including variety\nIs according to the New York post ... uh the president's sent Haspel the turkey to investigate the killing\n'em but apparently\nUm she's heard the audio someone must be just frightening\nOh my God it kind of well I remember that shilling detail ah I think it was in the near he wasn't in New York Times report that the guy who directed the operation he told the Fifteen hits ... members of the hit squad were chopping them up he said uh put on earphones and listen to music while you're writing its members screens\nAnd there was a story yesterday the crown prince actually was public and made a speech and called the whole you know he\nWell he showed up at his uh his as Davos in the desert some it there and he got a standing ovation from people but I'm sure they're all if they didn't stand up maybe jumped up too\nBut he talked about his outrage over what happened and they're going to get to the bottom of this ... telling me he had no clue whatsoever that and he directed this thing I I haven't really\nDid and I really think that the king of Saudi Arabia has got to push NBS aside and stole some other cousin in that job\nPilots second with Brad Garrett he is the ABC News crime and terrorism animals we welcome you back to the show bread my son the notes that you're thinking the secret service may may have a pretty good leader\nWell we'll see the thing of it is that people who make these type of of threats\nBut I have a track record they have threatened to other people before maybe not with bombs\nBut this is an angry guy I'm going to say guy is typically they are that has lashed out through letters through email through showing up at somebody's office etc to the point the he may be in their database of of folks they sort of keep track of\nThe end they'll have his fingerprints on file they may have his DNA on file a ... there's a lot to work with those bombs as far as potential forensic evidence and so so we'll see\n... brat so as they studied these bombs what are they what specifically are they going to be looking for\nWell first of all you want to even want to see if they are actually operational or are they something that was sort of put together to look like a bomb to scare people but it's not really a bomb that could go off much going to be one side of this you're going to look at how\nThe ... or not the bomb is in my sense is it's not sophisticated [noise] um because it tells you something about the bomb maker or is this something he learned on the Internet for example um and so you take that information and it gives you a lot of potential leads as to who this might be\nWell a Brad ... if those on the writer correct and this is all just concocted by the left to try to make the president look bad then maybe this is just some kind of shoddy operation and there is no track record of this guy\nMaybe that that is true but if it's in fact he has any sort of criminal record if they can come up with fingerprints they may still be able to find him [noise]\nUm you know one of the keys is going to the if in fact he did use the postal service is that he had to put it in the mail stream someplace he also had to go or ... or send somebody to\nA a courier like fed ex UPS et cetera so there may be a trail of him at those locations so a lot of potential surveillance cameras to to review and see if they get lucky\nThat Brad we keep saying he though but could this possibly be some sort of gang or a group of people I'm thinking of like the the weatherman in the sixties who blew up a house in Greenwich Village\nSure ... it could be I'm just kind of going and what I see of unsophisticated bomb every envelope is exactly the same you get to misspellings of like a Mr Brennan's last name is misspelled or things that\nSort of lends itself to a you know one guy this angry this ah targeted a group\nOf phone are you there I'm here oh good okay so that's what I think's going\nUps now he's gone because we're having a little gremlin is you know I think it's the um I think it's the\nPeople on the left are screwing with our phones well he ruled out they sent all the bombs and now the mess done with our phone says well he's ruled on anyone who won the spelling bee well its brand names spelled uh this person who sent a also a misspelled shoals as a ...\nWhat I wanted to ask him and if we get them back or maybe we'll just try to get a message to him I'm I'm just curious well I I don't know you know people will keep going back and forth who\nCollapsed me I'll I'll answer your question well terrorism expert Michael Riddle over here you\nKnow no I just ah I I I just don't know how I'm a I'm I'm just curious if the guy put this in services mailbox Im south yeah does that mean these local New Yorkers this guy's just hanging around New York\nWho you know we don't know if he put it in I guarantee you George Soros has cameras all over his priorities so somebody walked up to the mailbox there's going to be a video\nOf there were that yeah but I'm just wondering if this person is local because you have the deniro thing you know the only one there are a couple of been out of town but uh they they claim the CNN one was not through the mail that was my career so I videos key and I'm sure there's\nI think it's going to be more than one person I think that there's a a a gang involved here\nWell even after the bombs arrived President Trump attacks the media hostility on their part and who do you think is listening to his private conversations on his iPhone coming up\nWe're joined as rewind today and Len Burman and Michael real in the morning we'll be back with a new show tomorrow from things still than on seven ten W ho\n... glad you're spending your evening with our replay of this morning show catches for a brand new Len Burman and Michael read all in the morning tomorrow from six to ten on seven ten W ...\nFlower live and drive back here and the biggest news story the day is right here and drive Becker right down the street Michael Reed also spit out on his way to work he had it before anybody else did\nYou saw the cops and all the presidents of photographers around the dinner hero's house where Robert De Niro lives and works in there as a restaurant and and read all figured it all out there was another bomb and it was sent now apparently it was censored to narrow two days ago I finally realized what it was\nYeah yet I was riding my bike to work and uh I heard the sirens going down the west side highway and of course I thought some ends up being I thought must be in Wall Street area but then as I came across to\nTo come to the studio the police were swarming all over the place I immediately recognized the Tribeca Grill owned by Robert De Niro and we know that deniro is a fierce critic critic of President Trump's so I put two and two together\nI mean just because of the narrow said this I'd like to punch him in the face or bring three stories today more bombs and this one Robert Deniro but I guess if it was sent two days ago than it was all part of the same batch same best threat than African batch of baked bombs\nUh as another Trump critic is reportedly targeted mess right here in try Becca this is a day after all the other bombs arrived to CNN and those other Democrats who are also critics of the president also the big three\nBeer enjoying this re winds up today is Len Burman and Michael real in the morning we'll be back with a new show tomorrow from six to than on seven Sen wor Lucian we're glad you're spending your evening with our replay of this morning show gets just for a brand\nNew Len Burman and Michael ... in the morning tomorrow from six to seven vent wor\nWow we have the AIDS pipe bomb in the way we found so far\nA dress to Robert Deniro but now it looks like we've got confirmation about ninth\nYeah they're saying well as with suspected I think there was one cent to buy it and it got hung up in the mail with the return address the phony return address to Debbie Wasserman Schultz so now they're saying nine rock Obama Joe Biden Hillary Clinton Eric Holder\nOr John Brennan slashed CNN Today Maxine Waters George Soros and Robert Deniro ... so that's nine that we know of\nThe terrorism as gripping city terrible story out of New Jersey seven children have died from the outbreak of that or a ... and the virus in the health care facility and I'm the mother of one of the children Elizabeth polish her name is that's the child who died her mother Christine is speaking out about this when she's\nYeah her daughter was sixteen and it's a fascinating story because she was in this facility yeah which was in one a cue\nAnd then she was ... she she got sick so there's\nYou know I as I suspect that this doesn't happen all at once when we talked about this yesterday and said this is going to be a timeline when one of these people actually died and and how over what period of time apparently this person was a ... that the child Elizabeth sixteen years old and was fragile and she was having issues right she had severe medical problems\nNeed a breathing and feeding tubes shoes or the term to be suffering from the ad no virus ... so they transferred her to St Joseph ... medical center in Paterson with a raging fever\nHuh I Wonder if she spread the well but the ... well the ... but the even\nThough they knew what was apparently what was going on at the rehab facility where this all happened uh they'd wanna cue facility they transferred her back really that's where she died so she was in the facility went to saint Joe and then transferred back even though they're having all these issues over there are there's going to be some major lawsuits\nI mean you would think they would've quarantine them a little kid in a one reply\nSo here's mom this is an exclusive interview she did with a ABC\nAngry I think if I Need to know more information I like facts I just want to know what happened I Can't bring Iraq\nComing back\nWow sounds softly together I\nMy beautiful the farm\nAnd she's in a state of shock and maybe a while and he recorded Santa\nWhy wouldn't you report it sooner absolutely I I just seem fishy to me that yesterday all of a sudden oh six people died they don't die like on this and the same minute you know running stretched over a period of time to find out about\nThe the sanitary precautions that they take in that hospital there you know I think on some issues with that because when we talked to some of the experts yesterday about important things to wash your hands yeah actually you don't put in place like sample\nVirus the virus itself is going to kill you you have a less you have a kind of a mile here's one other parents uh who had a a a child there or the child is alive\nQuite think he's considering communication\nAnd parents\nYeah oh that's usually the case you know what I Want to talk to us about this mhm Mm well that is dead though very so\nSeven yeah so that so far in eleven others are sick\n... um you know there was a debate New Jersey there was and it was a nasty one I think yeah they it was really nasty as the uh the Cuomo a melon arrow debate I don't think it was that nasty but you had a huge getting\nHim and then does you're going to Republican them and then there's the Democrat who's been tainted the corrupt Democrats yeah anyway here's a here's some of that debate sure alright heres Yergin\nOn running because we deserve better Bob Menendez has failed and embarrassed us\nOkay so want us to failure an embarrassment let's do and then does is\nWe need is a grainy drug companies CEO going to solve healthcare and our nation oh grandma greedy\nGreedy drug companies CEO All right so then end as was as corrupt as they come this guy\nRan a big company and rented well and made it gives billions dollars when Menendez was pocketing a zillion dollars from a bunch of his campaign contributors and buddy's he was doing favors for not found guilty but I'm not defending he was not exactly found innocent either land that's correct\nUm [noise] so as you know you can put out this campaign that talked about Mendez v sex with underage prostitutes the FBI looked into it they didn't find anything but he put it in yet anyway and you can ah defends the Eddie put out\nOnly about ten percent of Jersey the new there were sworn FBI affidavits were very specific allegations and corroborating evidence about sexual misconduct\nAble to deliver the ah the ah spark necessary to explode it that's the issue right now and they're all basically the same devices across the board all at the same packaging so clearly is one person or as one individual one group and then she goes who's doing this and that will go forward it's going to be a big investigations\nSheep voice what kind of clues from the device itself could tip you off to the person doing this\n[laughter] so you hope to get some kind of ... on the sea so if you remember that the twenty third street bum you on the cover of a quaint sixteen\nUh we were able to ah one of the I'm not a lot of it was a a pressure cooker bomb we were able to get a fingerprint of the ... a country and we had them identify within eighty eight or ten hours it ... it went very quickly that investigation so now it's ... it's going to be a surge of the postal system because that's where they were brought\nWe track back the CNN case yesterday and want to understand the ... spoke with a career he picked it up from the location of post offices deliver to CNN do their track that back as they go out to see if they could find that\nThat's interesting so you say it went to a post office and then delivered by courier so the courier than would not really have culpability but shouldn't they be able to figure out perhaps what post office was on the other end or where it was a posted\nBest what they'll do now and now they're out and use it comes to the JFK if it came with a K goes to a centralized location is in Manhattan and then to a local post office a courier cooks up a lot of mail for a lot of different companies and then delivers it to them to expedite it\nSo that's what we found that yes it was a lot of quite a few packages going the CNN [noise] now that was open\nIn the mail or and pulled out so we they put a picture of him and I thought that was very a a good idea so people can recognize when they see something like this um the the employee of CNN stepped out around the coal not want to exactly what we ask them to do and the police respond and picked up the investigation\nAnd she Boyce I'm thinking about the bomb that was delivered to George Soros is house now he must have um security cameras there they you must be looking at these things for anyone who came by his house the other day\nSure you look at it as a as a pretty high end neighborhood as you can imagine a a a there's a lot of the year you have video cameras throughout there's also a license plate area as well that could have ... I\nDon't know where that is right now but I thought that was the uh [noise] that was the best the best is is that if they don't\nKnow where it is right now with the case of but it looks like it was delivered by the United States Postal service\nOff when I'm does okay I thought maybe it was in a hurry and dropped it off there but you think was postal service\nThat's what you hope for lying on the hope that it's a it's an individual that you can track back but I Believe it's the postal service\nWe are on with cheap Robert boys is the former New York city cheaper detectives we've had him we've always heard his soundbites over the years and I'm just thrilled we got a chance to talk with him he's been in the department for thirty five years\nAnd uh does it do you have a a feel for where this person may be located\n[noise] I don't know now that that ... who has the case may have some direction on this and I'm now you're going to look at all these threats you're going to look at social media who house wrapping up\nWhere it comes from a very large investigation I Can't think of anything and there was nobody I Know this you have to remember these to these devices went to pull us ...\nHomes so um I I've never seen anything like this so it's it's a ... they probably know more the secret service about threats to uh to keep people than anybody else they're part of the J GPS and they'll play a large role in this\nGetting a sense that all that this would be a loan bomber or is it possible you know I'm thinking of the weathermen back in the sixties that this could be a group of disaffected people\nWill you hope it's more than one because you investigative a chance to go up dramatically what is more than one person one little across the street to different people so you're hoping that is more than one of the chances are you're it's it's impossible to say right now\nOr if it's one person or or group ah from what I understand no one's taking credit for this um it's a it would take us over real um so I I think it's going to continue that don't know the frequency of the points who's been made quite well often these are the visuals so hopefully it doesn't but ah I don't see is going to be over\nShe for running out of time just quickly do you think this will be solved quickly\n[noise] ah I don't I Can't tell you that because I don't know what evidence to have a strong I'm In my case we we got to get a picture of a the perpetrator and we put that out someone calls or have some things it's all going to depend on the forensics and past threats or that came into these individuals\nLet's see if this was great speaking with you I Hope we can do it again down the road you Robert Boyce former New York city even effective thanks have\nA good talking to have a great\nI mean you guys are so good interesting that he hopes for more than one per yeah the yeah chances of catching them all go up dramatically\nJust amazing story and I I I Would think it was just such a nationwide a law enforcement hunger right now I wouldn't think it would in quickly but I don't know what he doesn't think it's over either yeah that'd be scary part\nOf coming up next what so lab was charged for blowing a toll the George Washington bridge that sudden ice and why did Justin Timberlake have to cancel his concert here in the city\nThis is a marine wind to today's Len Burman and Michael read all in the morning catch them live tomorrow from ... on seven ten wor\nTo attract hundreds of quantum find buyers directly to your home at the moment it goes on the market and rich charges only two percent total not the ... percent commission your local broker expects get started now by calling six three one nine zero four seven\nSeven three nine rex can also help you buy a home your license rex agent Lorraine showings negotiate offers guy do escrow and even get your pre qualified for a mortgage at the lowest available rake rex is with you every\nStep of the way to speak with a rich representative called now it's six three ...\nThis is a really wanting to today's Len Burman and Michael needle in the morning catch them live tomorrow from ... on seven ten W O I make a little break from all of his bond news this morning and\nTalked to some entertainment land that idea I I Want to tell you about a show now it is a show comes from England it was on the BBC it's called the bodyguard it has just dropped on Netflix all my friends who live in England\nThey said the entire country has been glued to this really the series called the guard it saw it stars Richard Madden who you may remember was dark and game of Thrones and he plays a bodyguard and he is assigned to guard a British politician a woman ...
