I mean they're stepping\nOff on to the movie is no one is what's gonna happen as they take off you see the the flag in the background there was plenty of flag throughout the movie so those are guys who have politicians who haven't seen the movie and it's it's a very patriotic felt\nA lot of ways and it's about what this country really went through to to make this achievement a so that just said nothing yeah that's a nothing burgers\nStars for for a man how about the now what's this movie bad times of the ...\nThat is also great a totally different kind of movie that crazy kind of title I'm gonna try to give too much away it's a thriller that takes place at around the same time oddly enough around Nineteen sixty nine and a Jeff Bridges is a priest who shows up at this this is a motel in Lake Tahoe\nAnd he's got a mystery behind him and he's showing up there to look for some cash that's what stolen and then all these characters show up Jon Hamm from Mad Men is there a ... to ... for different reasons and you kind of slowly figure out that everyone is there a for their own reasons but they kind of ... in plain did other things and there's\nThere's kind of political mystery going on and it there's a lot of violence is kind of quitting Tarantino ask but it's great it's really really terrific and it really keeps you guessing and\nChris ... worth shows up a as a cult leader and there's there's all those kind of cookie crazy stuff going on that kind of sixties related I Can't recommend this enough if you really like suspense and quitting parents you know like stuff this is really a great\nMovie out how many stars\nI'm giving that four stars or the five\nAlso sounds a bit like it's got some of the Coen brothers thrown in there and\nIt does yeah very much has got a cold and brothers kind of feel to it and it's directed by this guy named drew Goddard who also did a the cabin in the woods a couple of years ago when he wrote clover field\nAnd he wrote them he adapted the Martian so he's got sort of there's a cool kind of mystery suspense thing going on and uh so ... it's a weird titled or remember bad times with the royal but if you go you really gotta walk out and said that was really original that's something I'd never seen before it's kind of got a very cool feel to\nIt so it's going to movies all of a sudden you've got five stars four star general star is born last week come on late I mean it's a fair I mean I\nCan't guarantee for next week which is the remake of Halloween or the or the redo of Halloween so we'll talk about that next week but it's false Oscar season is all the good stuff coming up another good one this is beautiful boy this weekend as it was a Steve grilled drama about a a guy who tries to get a subtle off drugs that's really good too\nThat's really where they had as a force to you know Joe I noticed that your vicious attack on your vicious attacks on ... didn't stop that thing that I Know [laughter] kind of power\nThat showed me they'll they'll it'll make October running you know I wouldn't get it I made a record it's good to stop it you can only do so much to stop that um\nLet me just ask you something quickly you mentioned that I'm In the movie a bad times a day all around the same person did cabin in the woods I've been meaning to look at cabin in the woods on Netflix is it worth it\nIt is it is worth it and that's a that also is a movie where it's kind of real twisting and turning and that's a little bit more kind of ...
