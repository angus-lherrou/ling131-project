{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "More fearful that yeah that's frequent and more fear that drives me crazy when when we're taught and medicine to use fear to get people to do it we want no bounds of nature we use education jobs here means teacher so so that people can make that choice not fear I don't believe in fear factor\nAnd the house Chad is also just magical and ... ... one wonderful thing as a health costs when you're working with people\nAnd sometimes there's decided they helped try ad that people can't face you know they're just they've been working on it long enough and they're done they're like I'm given up on the physical and I can't lose weight or I Can't do whatever I'm done I'm not going to work on that anymore and so\n... the health coaches that if you just work on two sides of the triangle the third one comes up naturally on its own so we just say okay let's set that aside for now and let's look at the other two ... and ... it improves and then as\nThings improve than they get more\nWilling to look at that site that so difficult for them\nSo you have a health coach that takes the customers through the various ways in which the fruits and veggies interact perhaps with other medications or how much you should take what time you should take them what are some of the different roles that health coach fails when they start taking balance of nature\nWell the main goal of a health coach is\nBecause we are results based company is to make sure that our customers are getting results or you know we all there's always results with balance of nature all you have to do is take it and and we teach our health coaches that because that is absolutely true we've done the research we know that that we know the results that you're getting\nOn the human cell if you just to swallow them but you don't always feel it\nExactly whether you fill it or not the result is there and you know I I Hope this person doesn't mind that I use the example of not use names anyways but just just yesterday I had a wonderful experience speaking with a man and I'm an in\nRelation to what you're talking about what do we talk about with our health coaches his it's based upon the try out of help and that's what I built after five six years of practice and I started to realize and see this that\nEverybody's helped is based on three factors and and a lot of people think oh I've heard this before but not this model of it 'cause we're based upon a chemical aspect of help that's nutrition that\nThe air we breathe the drugs everything in our body it's a chemical we are a chemical laboratory so everything is based upon the raw materials\nOf ... of of chemistry\nAnd then then there's good and there's bad okay and then there's the physical side of help and that's an aspect we have to we have to address always and then there's the at the mental spiritual emotional side of hope it's all one that's not three different things that one side of your health try out\nAnd so we work on goals on all three of those sides to help people really see the greatest benefit and for example I was with somebody yesterday and ah\nAs I was talking with him he's a good man and so one of his goals you know they'd written down be good to people do kind things for people and those are all important but I just looked at him finally I said\nYou do all those things you are that person you could just see it in him and fill it from him and finally I looked at me you know what you're what you're dealing with is fear\nBecause fear and face cannot coexist you can't have them in the same space one chases the other out and so\nWith tears he finally said you're right\nI don't trust I Need to change the trust in my life and he left with a new resolve to trust to trust in the process of his body to trust in the process of things to trust in people\nAnd he he will have a whole change in his life because now we're working all three sides and we had some other goals of walking and being active and and and obviously was with nutrition we had several several goals but until we found that one he wasn't a change person\nHe will see results now\nWe're going to take a short break and we'll be right back with more from Dr Douglas Howard answers and\nDon't go away balance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule\nReally does work I've had a great dispatch and not not getting the little allergy calls and stuff in the spring and in the fall and I attribute it to that because I shut down uh I actually stopped my vitamins that I Would take a regiment of vitamins and\nI think sickly stopped all of them and then went on this and\nThis seems to be beneficial for me\nThat made me feel better I mean you know at my age if I can keep up with all the animals and they work\nIt just makes me feel that I think a products are wonderful and I take an average day at work\nFor a limited time used discount code wor and we'll take thirty five

five one or go on line to balance of nature dot com and use discount code W O R\nWelcome back to the balance of nature show I'm your host Laura Smith and we are talking about why whole foods or the answer to many health problems versus taking supplements that have vitamins\nI'm the founder and formulate or of balance of nature Dr Douglas Howard and his wife Susan Howard\nDr Howard is a medical doctor I wrote practical Dr researcher\nAnd specialist in vitamin nutrient Dr Howard what is new that you can tell us with balance of nature and and truly what do I know you do research continually you're one of those perpetual scientists\nDo what you are learning it even more and more as the results come in to the company about what the wonderful people who are taking this product what it's doing for them\nYou know what is beautiful the balance of nature is it's not new is the oldest form of nutrition on the earth and it's exactly what it was made for us you know yes I'm always researching and finding and driving up how and why does it work\nBut the beauty of it is we don't have to reinvent at every couple of years and make a special a new\nBecause the formula for balance of nature has been here for thousands of years on the earth it's one hundred percent pure fruits and vegetables\nThere's nothing at it and nothing taken away from it except for the water it's pure produce\nIt took years of which fruit and which vegetable and and how they would interact with each other and studying that through and then doing studies with with the electron microscopy it to different universities so they could study by electron microscopes\nHow it was affecting the DNA the very best and then some of the studies we were doing was how it would affect the immune system the most you remember the game pacman of course okay well you've got white blood cells in there that run around like pacman going you know to to eat up the bad things\nAnd that's what those white blood cells are out there to do so we tested how many of those white blood cells could be out there to eat up the things that shouldn't be in your blood\nAnd how quickly they could respond those immune studies those DNA studies and studies about how the red blood cell could receive the nutrition and receive oxygen so get out to where I needed and also even studies about the ... the blood or in other words\nThe thickness of the blood how it flows through the veins and can get to the smallest possible vessels\nAll of that put together then I studied which fruits and vegetables and combining those until we had sixteen different fruits and Fifteen but different vegetables\nThat made the greatest impact on those things and in the DNA for example how could protected the most and how quickly the DNA could repair itself wind damage to those are all things that help prevent aging diseases\nIt's always such a great pleasure to speak with you Dr Howard and Susan Howard from balance of nature when I find remarkable is how easy balance of nature has made it for me to get more than ten real whole servings of fruits and vegetables every day it really is remarkable beautiful benefits of the ... the whole house system\nAnd just so much about what good nutrition means and what it can mean for everyone's life no matter what age it's a real pleasure thanks for being on today\nThank you it's great to be here thank you laugh\nThe proceeding was or paid programming W O ... airing of this program constitutes neither an endorsement of the products offered boy the ideas expressed\nI'm Michael ... Donald Trump rumored to be on sixty minutes this Sunday\nAnd I love the rascals we've got a raffle ticket give away all next week Len Burman and Michael read all in the morning beautiful morning Monday six that than I Am on the voice of New York sevens and\nW. or sell a you will are when you ask ... eight states in New York\nNew York this is talk feels rated number\nOne seven ten W O R voice of New York and\nIs fifty four and clear at nine o'clock good evening I'm ... one body has been recovered after a small plane with three people aboard crashed in the ocean off the Hamptons this morning more that from W O R as Mike Bauer\nCould have treated that mess in the pelvis with five treatments each treatments ten minutes he comes in gets a treatment we hit the sarcoma run the pelvis phone gets up and he goes to work and he does what he wants compared to a twenty two days stay and he's still not fully ... still not back at work\nAnd actually has left in severe pain is on medical marijuana\nFor his pain so what did he win from the chemo nothing what does he went from the surgery I don't think you want to anything and it cost him a lot he's a fifty year old man who's suffering and now the cancer looks like it's spread to the chest so I saw him just a couple of days ago I suggested we get a new\nCAT scan this last one was about six eight weeks ago we got a new one and see what's going on in the chest compare the new one the old but I'm fearful that the cancers all ready like a horse out of the barn\nThat the cancer is out of the barn now you go to a super duper big place and get cutting and chemo but that doesn't necessarily mean it's better for the patient we think the better thing for the patient is to plan your strategy in advance makeup plan\nNowhere that cancer is ... traveled or not if it's traveled where is it how to attack at what kind of cancer does and that's one of the big advantages of coming to radio sort of New York where we have a triple board certified\nCancer doctor board certified gifts to the doctor Lederman me trained in medicine medical oncology radiation oncology license in New York working here with the longest experience of radio surgery and the western hemisphere so for this man can benefit from us probably could benefit even more had he been here a couple of months ago\nProbably but we are here to educate that's the only reason we are here on the weekend is to educate\nSo that you if necessary can help yourself or your loved ones are your friends or neighbors and I can tell you that many of our listeners save lives if only one of our listeners had told him months ago that most likely heeded and need that surgery and the chemo how it would have changed his life\nSo here we are ready to sort of New York sit back and just listen and learn and wonder what the heck is going on in the medical profession here and elsewhere\nHow each place is different every doctors are on strategy and experience and patients coming to radio started a New Yorker lucky to have the most experienced doctor with radio surgery in America called Thirteen any for\nBroadway Broadway and thirtieth street in Manhattan serving you\nWhere we accept most insurance is Medicare Medicaid I was like what a fifty year old woman she's a black woman and I said that because black women have double the death rate from breast cancer and this woman\nHas a lump in the\nLeft up or other quarter of the breast she has a mammograms in two or three years he was seen by doctors who apparently pooh poohed\nBut I can tell you that when women feel things that needs to be pursued and that's what we're doing so she came to us a couple of days ago and we're getting her worked up to make sure that her breast is fine or if there is a tumor there that we can be able to tell her exactly what it is because\nWe listen to the\nPatient does my grandfather told me fifty five years ago when I asked them what\nThey do when he went to see the doctor said well you tell the doctor to close the door sit down and stay a while and that's what we do here at radio surgery New York talking about sixty eight year old man who is single he has prostate cancer at a biopsy\nNine months ago one of the big hospitals in New York and they only offered him surgery and he didn't like that and he declined and walked out\nThe biopsy proven cancer he was staged a no spread of the cancer he was only offered surgery he as\nYou are a nation three or four times every night we saw him we offered medicine to get his your nation better we offer treatment and there's lots of reasons why we treat men with prostate cancer the number one reason is to get better results to avoid radical surgery avoid robotic surgery keep the sex life keep that your life and\nWhenever possible cure that man on physical exam at a rock hard prostate as an elevated PSA this is a man who tells jokes on the streets he makes his living by telling jokes on the street and he told me some of his jokes which were\nFantastic one of them was was one that cannot be ever forgotten and they want to talk about a man sixty five year old fireman married with a couple of kids he had a lump behind his right ear it was\nBased on cell cancer cancer of the skin behind the ear he was seen by the dermatologist set a biopsy which showed base will sell the surgeon the dermatology surgeons for them to a mole was surgeon Moses like ... or ... or the skin and they keep on dig and dig and dig and then he had at once said he didn't like\n... that was due forming left the patch that do a flap he just doesn't like it we treated him in just a few non invasive treatments and it was amazing we saw the cancer going away his wife saw the cancer going away everyone's how the cancer going away he saw it and photographs he put his cell phone\nAnd focused behind this year and he saw every day the cancer it'd be going away now he's about six months out from treatment of you had one and a half centimeter mass\nOf skin cancer behind the ear and I can tell you that we treat lots of skin cancer we treat skin cancers by the ties knows here's mouth\nHad hands the\nBody you name it I haven't met right now as a massive will probably talk about him later that show next to his grow them as a big mess about the size of a slob he came into my office last week and he says Dr Lederman I have this mask down here and I said well where is that we usually when I see a patient I talk to the patient first I liked the patient\nTo describe what they have their symptoms that only after that way examined them and I said was in the ... wrote him he's not sure as a beer and not sure and finally I examined him and it was just adjacent like\nTwo leaves on a tree and there was a big mess about the size of a plum and\nWe had a biopsy that mass he's head of the year and a half and luckily he came here and we were able to\nBuy up said the sexual lives in Florida flew back home for the weekend and he's coming back next week and we'll tell you more about the progress of this skin cancer that's next\nTo this growing them which is probably not related to sun exposure for this man who had the space will sell by the year I came in last week and the cancer is gone and that's what usually happens there's a big difference between surgery and\nOur treatment surgery is a mechanical remove also they're under a move something that will leave a crater or do you factor a scar compared to our method of treatment we don't remove anything so with us we're able to send beams from different angles to hit\nThe cancer weather's faceless ... cells skin cancer or obviously we get along and breast and kidney and bladder and you name it and\nWe have a very high success rate and we leave the body intact so there's lots of reasons\nTo consider coming to\nYou know the rest I Want to talk about a Seventy year old woman she's from Iran she came with her son is multiple sclerosis she is unable to emulate\nAnd well she was ... cared for by an aid the aid found a mess in the breast and the biopsy was done in the ... breast cancer growing through the skin bleeding she went to one of the super super big hospitals and they just started her own hormones but hormones won't\nCure her and\nThe surgeon said she's too weak for surgery they had no other ideas so they gave her some\nHormone pills and center home to the the the you know what that means and their son found out about us and brought her here and he wants us to\nTreat or because he wants treatment cropper to get rid of that cancer to stop the cancer and stop the bleeding and that's what we do here at radio surgery in New York actually if you look at our new\nBody book that you'll see examples of breast cancer shell the breast looks after treatment you'll see a cat scans and other examples and you're talking to the doctor that brought breast conserving therapy to New York when\nNinety seven percent of the women in New York We're having mastectomies were losing their breast in our practice Ninety percent of women were keeping their breasts avoiding modified radical mastectomies as a big difference where\nOne goes why we're in the big hospitals Ninety seven percent were losing their breast why Dr Lieberman's ... Ninety percent of women were keeping their breast stop because the women were different it's not because of the breast was different it's because of the philosophy the mentality to try whenever possible to keep the body intact\nSo for the Seventy year old woman with multiple sclerosis we're treating her to get this breast cancer into remission and\nThat made me think today while I was taking notes that we treat\nMany patients who are delicate\nLike her she's been in a wheelchair\nBut she wants treatment and she wants treatment to hit the cancer so just because the patient as delicate and many patients are delicate many people come to us that might be older frail or they might have other medical conditions heart disease or like in her multiple sclerosis or kidney disease or it might\nBe frail are fragile just because they've been through the mail they've had chemo standard chemo and radiation and surgery or doesn't work but that doesn't mean that they can't have\nTreatment that is highly effective and that's what we do here at radio surgery in New York at Thirteen eighty four Broadway were accept most insurances and that's our specialty\nTreating cancer patients and patients with suspected cancers and cancers in the breast and lumps in the breast men difficulty with your nation that's what we do find him center Lederman ... short break we'll be right back\nWith Dr Lederman at best prostate cancer treatment is custom tailored for you\nEach man like cancer is unique unfit for best resolve based upon PSI queen ... that's like Dr lead I'm In constant pain early prostate cancer treatment is most logical feed the data yourself not every man should get the same treatment\nWhich is a great thing to do we listen to the patient I saw another man who was sixty eight years old he came in with his son is an elevated PSA a biopsy was at one of the big hospitals and they pushed them to have surgery and he didn't want it that you heard about all the complications and well he just doesn't want all those\nComplications and that's why we do what we do which is to listen to the patient and offer him treatment that there's more effective\nNoninvasive avoiding the radical avoiding robotic that most likely will hear him and most likely keep is sex life and urine or life that's what he wants and that's what we like to do\nThe best part of my day when I see patients and all these patients I'm telling you about our patients have sent in the last few days I take notes at the end of the week I gather my notes and then we come to the radio studio and we talk about\nThe patients we learn and it's a great way that we all learn together and you can hear what happens\nTo people and usually when you're in the hospital you don't get to go on medical rounds in fact unless you're a doctor in the hospital you don't get rounds in fact I'll show you away but here it's just the opposite here\nWe're able to take that patient and explain what's going on without using their name you don't know what happened to the patient but we do get will explain that to end\nWe follow overtime and we talk about our new patients who also talk about our older patients to talk about someone else or talk about this person who came to us\nWith a mass in the breast she's had bilateral mastectomy so I'll listen to this is fifty nine years old she's divorce has two children should have one centimeter mass which is about a third of an inch and what happened to her she went to one of those super big hospitals they remove\nBoth breasts while she could have had just lump of cancer modem or centimeters about smaller than a grape remove the lump have a short course of radiation and have equal or better results and keep her own body intact\nKeep her own press but no she went to the hospital ... based on the reconstruction then she got infected they took tissue from her abdomen moved up to the breast they put in match the mesh got infected the wound got infected chosen hospital multiple times and now she's here with me\nBecause she wants to be followed she wants to see\nIf she has any cancer she wants to follow up\nFrom a new fresh second doctor and that's what we do here at British or the New York I should tell you that for most women\nNot every woman but for most women there is no need for bilateral mastectomy as you can have it if you want you're the president of your body but the question really is not necessarily only what you want what's best for you was a day to show the data actually shows better results\nAvoiding excessive surgery bless complications lesson factions just like this woman had multiple infections from\nHer surgeries to remove for breast and replace them when she most likely had perfectly good for us and speaking of that I Want to speak about fifty nine year old woman born in New York City she's had lumpectomy is on her left\nBreast she was seen at one hospital and she went to another hospital and she dissatisfied with that they cut out the tulips are tulips and left breast shed multi focal to areas that means multi means multiple focuses of cancer in the left breast\nOne was close to their polling was further from the boat then she went to a second hospital now this is all taking eight\nMonths or one hospital to one doctor then they get a PET scan than they do a scan than they do by ... than they do lymph nodes then they say it again and then they get for the pathology and that it's taken eight months and what happened during his eight months well\nEight months at a CAT scan the beginning her lungs were\nClear and now after eight months\nThere is a nod joy in the long that looks like cancer so eight months when your health\nIs at stake I personally might suggest you stay away from the slope hawks wife because a cancer keeps on growing growing charting new the cancer had traveled to the lymph nodes shed\nLymph node biopsy shut breast biopsies lymph node biopsy is Charlie knew she had stage three cancer stage three because it's in the lymph nodes and in the long mean stage four but she didn't have that eight months ago so when your\nLife is at stake you might want to stay away from the slow pokes lots of places seem like they're the slow pokes do people wait six weeks eight weeks to get this pastor that test was cancer doing during that period of time\nHe grows that's all it does and the fourth of July and Christmas and New Year's nights and weekends and holidays cancer grows and this woman that cancers growing and she's upset I'm Upset to that\nShe was allowed are forced to wait eight months for a work up and she still had no treatment no treatment this amazing and she wasn't given the pictures she wasn't given their reports\nWe got them and we put all the reports together I showed her that the cancer like a traveled to the lungs when I wasn't there at the beginning that's the work that we do here at radio surgery New York how are we talking about a Ninety three year old woman she's with old she has four children she came with her daughter to evaluate a large mess\nIn the right breast she's had it for six months she had no pain shed no bleeding shed no mammogram she just got to the hospital one of the big hospitals in New England is there for a week laid Magid\nShe got a big mess and the breast she's in a hospital for a week how long has it take to do a mammogram\nTen minutes Fifteen minutes and a half hour no no mammogram was done how long would it take to put a needle in this mass and get a diagnosis ten minutes\nThat wasn't done either yet she was in the hospital they gave her medicines and the same hospital shed medicines five years ago when she couldn't tolerate they have are the same medicines the second time and the daughter is live at the daughters live with that they had their records they saw that she was sensitive she became dizzy and passed out and now they gave the same medicines\nAnd no one took care of the breast mass so she came to us\nAnd here we're able to do a biopsy were able to do a PET scan on the same day we can get the diagnosis her get her stage to help and could see exactly what's going on where she had this cancer for six I Believe cancer I I Would tell you not at present cancer she's had this for six months growing distorting the breast heart\nAnd the rest is most probably is a cancer it tells you a lot about how\nPeople get treated and work up in hospitals versus in a free standing\nCancer Center like radio surge in New York where we're here for the patient responsive to the patient you're off to wander the halls and wonder who's taking care of your mother or yourself or your husband or your wife or your child here it's easy to find the doctor at radio surge in New York except most insurances were\nWe like to do things in a good meticulous thoughtful way using the best doctors of New York\nHow are you all that stuff\nI have my question is the first time they don't let any chance that night we could crack a and I was curious to what the actual therapy or if you catch it fell into that very\nWell I like a car wash we don't do one thing for everybody so many different kinds of cancers cancers of the brain those cancers other than actors cancers of the throat cancers other lung cancers of the breast of the pancreas and the liver the prostate and like in Madison when you're a doctor you go\nFor years to college and for years to medical school and me I spent my first thirty five years in education so if you want me to give us a synopsis of how do you learn thirty five years and answer that Adam with one\nAnswer the patient tune into W O R we have multiple shows every weekend and you'll learn you learn how like we just talked about a woman with\nBreast cancer are ... are a gentleman with lung cancer that's what we do here we are learning just like doctors learn and every case is different every human being is there for another is not one answer for everybody to quite under\nUnderstood that right now I understand it I I mean it's a combination of chemo radiation or surgery\nAverage case is different there's no there's no quick formula you have to understand the patient insensitivity the patient like I just had a patient with multiple sclerosis who can't walk who's got a big breast cancers eating through the breast she might well one treatment of another woman who is thirty five years old with breast cancer\nRuns the marathon she may want to different treatments so in medicine and especially in our practice where we see a new patients with cancer but also we see people with Rick current cancers every case is different if you want you can call us the business hours Monday through friday to five and we'll send you\nThree or four hours of DVDs which you can watch will send you booklets about our work or you can tune in the radio show if you do this radio show for three or four years you're probably have a education of a cancer doctor and a have a lot of experience our main\nInnovative treatment if you're getting at that is radio surgery we brought pinpoint radiation to America when every hospital every doctor every facility was giving\nA large amounts of radiation so if you had as I say a\nPlummeted bread box if the plum was the cancer and the bread box is your body every facility every hospital the most famous ones were ready it in the bread box to get to the cancer and that means was harming a lot of\nTissues we said Dr leader when that's me said there's a better way of doing it if the cancers the plot why don't we it the plum and leave the bread box alone and not hurt the body not at the heart of the lungs and the kidneys and all the other sense of tissue so we brought\nSexually active to us because he wants to save his life he wants to say there's sex life let's say there's urinary life why should tell you something else this man was sent to us\nTwo years ago and he is now cancer free as PSA is zero his PSA zero his sex life is a hundred percent is urinary life is a hundred percent and the cancers gone he's in remission most likely cured and that's how we like our patients here\nAt Thirteen any for Broadway or recruited thousands of men with\nCancer and thousands of women and children also we treat men women and children with new cancers and the current cancers most anywhere in the body\nIncluding brain tumors ... style was asking cites homeless pituitary tumors but then she almost acoustic or almost as well as cancers of a body punished or Lederman we'll be right back\nFor cancer treatment most prefer effect of non invasive well tolerated outpatient therapy that stuck to lead them in the radio surgery par News Go to\nFirst in America first to New York first for you with body radio surgery Dr lead them in the history of cancer with no cutting no bleeding Lederman has decades of experience with primary and met a static large or small cancers from head to toe cancer treatment with possibly a second chance\nFor you even if the mole radiation or surgery didn't work or isn't tolerated\nGoals are best results and quality of life\nMeet Dr lead them in these New York's only Harvard trained triple board certified radiation oncologist called two one two choices two one two choices to meet Dr lead them in most insurance is Medicare Medicaid accepted free book the DVD to super convenient Broadway and thirty eighth in Manhattan\nMeet Dr Lederman to hit your cancer called two one two choices two one two choices\nWelcome back to the radio surgery our doctor Gilead I'm In the leading cancer and prostate cancer ... in the first New York for ... brain rainiest entering first in America\nAnd in the western hemisphere finding radio surgery you can also call Dr Lieberman at killing killing for free and farm in Brooklyn and DVD hey Dr Lederman while back\nI was talking about a Seventy one year old man from gay on and we have many people from beyond that many people from the Caribbean many people from Latin America who come for treatment this van\nIs Seventy one he has one son he came with his son for a Gleason seven PSA seven point one prostate cancer he had a bone scan and number I showed no spread of the cancer you expect that for an early stage cancer you expect\nNo spread of the cancer his way it is a hundred and forty four pounds he's been stable is Hi this is five foot three\nHe did smoke in the past and these quit smoking he is now\nAsking about what is the best\nAnd actually he was referred to us by his surgeon is urologist\nOne of the big famous surgeons urologist to New York sends us his patience why because he just doesn't like the results of open a robotic surgery used to do open a robotic surgery any stop\nBecause of the complications she didn't like to leave his men with impotence and incontinence and less good results she's seen my work for Fifteen Years and he likes the work he sees the patience and the patients are doing great\nWell what's the data well this man Seventy one years old with a PSA seven Gleason seven cancer and waste is how the cancer looks under the microscope if he had open sort of open source is when the ...\nHands are inside the prison robotic Israel or is it gives more like a puppet who is moving around your body the success rate is sixty percent for police in second place in seven cancer sixty percent for at least in seven cancer and with us\nWith no robotic no surgery no open radical surgery our success rates Ninety percent and with us most men keep their sex life with us most men keep their urine or life so there's lots of reasons why men with prostate cancer come\nTo radio surgery New York I examined him\nHis profits buggy it's in large the TNC prostate cancer Gleason seven with open a robotic surgery at sixty percent and most likely impotence and incontinence with us the success rates Ninety percent and most likely this man will keep a sex life keepers urinary life and keep intact protests\nIt goes what most men want most men with prostate cancer I Believe one to avoid radical surgery they want to avoid robotic surgery they want to hire a chance to be cancer free and to keep the sex life and the urinary life\nOther men who came in from Ireland with say police insects PSA nine point five prostate cancer is sixty five years old works the construction industry has worked over the world and Ireland and North Africa Libya and America he\nWants to be treated also as your allergies surgeon send them to us because that surgeon just doesn't like the results of radical surgery doesn't like the results of robotic surgery is cross that is buggy enlarged his a PSA nine point five\nAnd six cancer\nWith us has more than a Ninety percent chance of being cancer free with surgery it's about Seventy six percent and that's an Eighteen percent difference imagine there's about a quarter million man where you are with prostate cancer so everyone came to us\nRather

O. J. face consequences regarding fight that well he signed the final by so boring and then when he's talking about the rule\nBlogger speaking up for truth and Jim Jordan blasting Rod Rosenstein uh conduct now the president met yesterday on air force one apparently had a meeting not a lot of details about what went on in the meeting\nWith Rod Rosenstein there was talk about well he might be fired after it had been discovered that he was talking about well you want me to wear a wire\nAround the president and his answer was you know at least has the spin was well I was just say that you wouldn't want me to wear a wire around the president and it was all in the tone and the cadence of what he said we have three articles in front of me right now one by Katherine heritage at Fox one by Sarah Carter won by John Solomon\nA Solomon's article goes on former FBI lawyer plot to record remove Trump was not a joke and John Solomon let me read from the article don't tell former FBI general council member James Baker he was one of those that resigned that those infamous discussions\nAbout secretly recording president Donald Trump and using the tapes to remove him for office where a joke he apparently doesn't believe it and he yelled quite the vantage point as he was on the inside of the FBI bureaus leadership and may have twenty Seventeen when the discussions occurred and Baker told Congress last week\nThat his boss than acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe remember became and Lisa Page both took notes of the meaty and McCabe was saying yeah Rod Rosenstein had in fact said this\nAnyway now James Baker is saying and Andrew McCabe is saying that in fact they were dead serious about about the idea\nOf Sarah surreptitiously recording the forty fifth president\nUsing the evidence to make the case\nThat Trump should be removed from office according to every source now in all three articles and Baker told lawmakers that he wasn't in the meeting that McCain had with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein and which the subject came up but he had first hand conversations with McCain\nAnd the FBI lawyer that was assigned to a ... page about the issue so Baker talk to both of the end quote as far as Baker was concerned this was a real plan being discussed set a source directly familiar with the congressional investigation it was no laughing matter to the FBI\nOr member then you can go back to what was the insurance policy to remove Trump\nIs five months now into his presidency is this just before the appointment of the special counsel\nAs soon as Justin ... at that time frame around the media elite strategy that was occurring anyway so it goes on word of bakers testimony now is surface just days before Rosenstein said to be interviewed and private by the\nHouse Judiciary committee lawmakers that's supposed to happen Thursday of this week and the New York times first reported allegations that Rosenstein the number two at the department of justice has tried to downplay his role in all of this in his office suggested that\nHe thought the discussion was a joke that Rosenstein never gave in order to carry out any such plot and he doesn't believe the Trump should be removed from office\nBut making those statements through a spokesperson is a bit different than having Rosenstein himself face Congress answer the questions under the penalty of a felony if lawmakers think he's lying and bakers account lawmakers this month clearly complicates already complicated picture\nAs it relates to Rod Rosenstein before Congress\nAssuming he shows up for Thursday's interview but even more so Baker story lays ... extraordinary conversation and we go on from there and now we're going to really take our time with this issue today and we're\nGoing to now begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together because what this is we're laying out here are the top people at the upper echelon member twenty five people have either been demoted fired or have left the FBI the OJ their\nUpper ranks here and James Baker is one of them and Andrew McCabe at least a page both corroborating what apparently now James Baker is set about Rod Rosenstein anyway John Solomon and he is an investigative reporter is what the hell\nRag Jarrett Fox News legal analyst and of course the seller of the number one book the Russia hoax thank you all for being with us I'm John let's just I Want to also put this in context where people because it gets complicated we've\nGot a first start with the pine light and the timeline is mayor of twenty Seventeen well that's when Robert Mueller is getting appointed by Rod Rosenstein just before that we had people like ... and Peter Struck talking about uh media elite strategy that had to do with the dusty a\nWhile it now appears that that was all being league for the purposes\nAnd they got rid of all it was was the dot CA recycled and different news outlets for the purpose of initiating the special counsel so it would get appointed that we're discovering that they're even talking about Sarah ... taping the president of the United states so that they can remove him from office this sounds like a cool to me\nOr if there's one other event that occurs and that may timeframe that rarely I think you're a shockwave for this conversation and that was the termination of James\nComey's the FBI Director of it all out all this Russia investigation to go on and we know now from refrigerators testimony that in may and they still have no evidence from a proving any form of collusion with Russia so they've been nine months out of James Kobe's let this go on for nine months\nHe's let two agents who have an anti Trump or fire read that investigation get fired and what for natural reaction of all those who've been supporting James Comey that the roses have a a Cape and a stroke page\nIt's hey maybe we can remove this guy rather can't prove that he did something wrong with Russia maybe we can prove easily confident in well over a quarter\nAnd a and maybe try to take 'em out through the recording and the twenty Fifth Amendment Fisher is not what the FBI with ... with the ... I'm ... ... talk about history his book\nLays out the real possibility that this was a softer right look at this we have the FBI they're not investigating a crime here that\nIn fact they can't find a crime by a page as\nWell at least two pages testimony just to be clear she said they um they had found nothing and nine months leading up to the point\nThat's right so they switch gears right maybe we can remove them to other than me and and this conversation is so extraordinary ... it says that job for the FBI or twenty Fifth Amendment\nNever envision the FBI being involved in it she got the FBI and the deputy attorney general or allegedly our conversation he says it's a joke they say they're dead serious about it and they believe he was dead serious about it and it no matter which way it comes down is just another example of how far down the road the FBI\nWas beyond its core mission which is to investigate crimes stop counter intelligence\nAnd again this has nothing to do with rank and file agents that all this this is John group of rogue power hungry upper echelon management types and if anything they took the the cases away from the field offices purposely so that they can involved themselves in these nefarious activities that's why\nIt really does explain a Greg Jarrett why every FBI guy I Know is so angry about this because they know was ripped out of their hands\nAnd this and all of them say that if this was them they know they get fired\nThat's right and in fact I interviewed former top officials or the FBI who are angry at people like James Comey Andrew McCabe James Baker Lisa Page\nPeters struck for ruining the reputation the good name of the FBI I wrote a column recently that said Rosenstein actions\nIn an attempt to deposed the sitting president United States\nIs the equivalent of an attempted coup not a bloody violent coups what's known and John refer to it a moment ago as a soft coup ah using in misusing their power in the law to remove a sitting president and so here we now have not just James Baker\nWho was told this was serious because the people in the conversation with Rosenstein\nWho are Andrew McCabe and Lisa Page you said he was\nDead serious recruit people to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment and secretly record the president to gather evidence in support of it uh Rosenstein whenever he gets caught engaging in wrongdoing\nClaims oh I was misunderstood he threatened the intelligence committee staff members in January first denied it\nThen it mitigated but said oh I\nMe stories of de L O R word is Sean Hannity\nOn seven can tell you all are [noise]\n\nHave some exciting news simply say home security is now valued at one billion dollars and when this company first started on this show they only had six people working together you know the founder only started the company because he wanted to help his friends\nWho are victims of some type of burglary and that was simply say protects over two million of us are simply safe home security has comprehensive protection for your home round the clock professional monitoring and police dispatch you get protection against intruders fires leaks busted pipes\nAnd simply say keep working during power outages\nAnd even down why and even if a burglary matches your key pad at this system is simple to use incredibly intuitive only takes ... minutes to set up and was simply said no contractors I Know hitting the at all you get twenty four seven monitoring for only fourteen Ninety nine a month and right now because you listen to this program\nYou save an additional ten percent off your simply safe system is going to simply say Hannity dot com simply save Hannity dot com you'll say ten percent on your home security system it's simply save Hannity dot com\nIf you're concerned about your heart health or know someone who it then you should consider\nCardio mobile the FDA cleared personal EKG device for Ninety nine dollars guardian mobile delivers a medical grade EKG right to your smartphone\nAnd it fits in your pocket you can take and EKG anytime anywhere to order the guardian dot com K.

for the big things and we've tried to ensure everything top down and that's led to the last\nYou know really a good ten years of insurance premiums that have doubled or tripled but we need to do is insured less which is how every other insurance product works they keep it that is\nMeans doctors have to make more of the services they provide affordable\nAnd they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline then as simple\nAnd how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility in at the same day in Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors in over thirty two hundred patients\nUnbelievable and your aid you give concierge care at all I could pick up a bone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call\nYou do you have and I could go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches ... it's an emergency you know a lot of the three am phone calls or chest pain which we might send the ER but a lot of times the kid who's sick and a mom who's worried and\nUm you of if you can avoid the ER you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill that's how you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet healthcare is access to your doctor yeah\nAll right and then how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model the day of duplicated how you you've been out and about and a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this model in the last few years but there's about a thousand total there in forty eight states in every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota [noise]\nUm and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nNow and what do you do Dr growth in terms of your president of duck ah docks where a patient care foundation you know now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundational er physician or on health policy think tank because doctors never seemed to be at the table whenever we're having a conversation about health care\nSo we put traditions of back and back to the table to have conversations personally I I also have a primary care practice much like that lets them here in southwest Florida a practice any health are plus when he was you know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services\nSolid does is create a ... tour\nYou know and we're ... ... ... points as Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us from all over the state of Florida and even from outside of the country we're seeing some inbound medical tourism are and what we're finding is that\nYou know not not the same thing got about health insurance we're just using it for all and you know when somebody is you know place twice the amount of money for a service because the ... shots water we insuring it's using insurance drives up the cost of the other products\nSo an MRI cash price Ross is two hundred and twenty dollars while using her your commercial insurance you know we go through all the the hoops to get it authorized\nYour co pay five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again on the more people are are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or\nI'll let you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical ... solution so but I'm pleased to see that you know we're shifting the conversational from a coverage for everyone on ... talking about reducing the cost of health care\nI think the real close and that's why I was about to testify on us some help committee on this exact topic\nWould it be a better idea I mean I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody's shock Gavin Newsom ... who is now offering free health care but everybody he whether you're a taxpayer whether you're in the ... the state legally or illegally\nEverybody's got to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California but you get sick\nUm because people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a Republican is within striking distance and\nThat gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay for every illegal immigrant in the country but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of at the same day and I would be your patient\nDr ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my\nDoctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserved for service provides a fifty bucks a month now how much is the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic planet if the big things heart attack or accident or cancer how much would one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars a family\nMember dollars per year or a month\nA month so and the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage if the Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars\nPer household per month in and they're being credited with the economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household [noise] ah the the real ... and the the politician their heads and California is to send them on a ridge analogy\nThis throwing more money at the problem has never fixed it what we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and and a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get ... cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable [noise]\nUm you know actually
