and ... ... one wonderful thing as a health coach when you're working with people\nAnd sometimes there's decided they helped ... ad that people can't face you know they're just they've been working on it long enough and they're done they're like I'm given up on the physical and I can't lose weight or I Can't do whatever I'm done I'm not going to work on that anymore and so\n... the health coaches that\nIf you just work on two sides of the triangle the third one comes up naturally on its own so we just say okay let's set that aside for now and let's look at the other two ... and ... it improves and then as things improve then they get more\nWilling to look at that site that so difficult for them\nSo you have the health coach that takes the customers through the various ways in which the fruits and veggies interact perhaps with other medications or how much you should take what time you should take them what are some of the different roles that health coach fails when they start taking balance of nature\nWell the main goal of a health coach is\nBecause we are results based company is to make sure that our customers are getting results or we you know we all there's always results with balance of nature all you have to do is take it and and we teach our health coaches that because that is absolutely true we've done the research we know that that we know the results that you're getting\nOn the human cell if you just to swallow them but you don't always feel it\nExactly whether you fill it or not the result is there and you know I I Hope this person doesn't mind that I use the example of not use names anyways but just just yesterday I had a wonderful experience speaking with a man and I'm an in\nRelation to what you're talking about what do we talk about with our health coaches his it's based upon the try out of help and that's what I built after five six years of practice and I started to realize and see this that\nEverybody's help is based on three factors and and a lot of people think oh I've heard this before but not this model of it\nBecause we are based upon a chemical aspect of health that's nutrition that the air we breathe the drugs everything in our body it's a chemical we are a chemical laboratory so everything's based upon the raw materials of ... of of chemistry\nAnd then then there's good and there's bad okay and then there's the physical side of help and that's an aspect we have to we have to address always and then there's ... at the mental spiritual emotional side of that is all one that's not three different things\nThat one side of your health try out and so we work on goals on all three of those sides to help people really see the greatest benefit and for example I was with somebody yesterday and ah\nAs I was talking with him is a good man and so one of his goals you know they had written down be good to people do kind things for people and those are all important but I just looked at him finally I said\nYou do all those things you are that person you could just see it in him and fill it from him in China and looked at my you know what you're what you're dealing with is fear\nBecause fear and face cannot coexist you can't have them in the same space one chases the other out and so\nWith tears he finally said you're right\nI don't trust I Need to change the trust in my life and he left with a new resolve to trust to trust in the process of his body to trust in the process of things to trust in people\nAnd he he will have a whole change in his life because now we're working all three sides we had some other goals of walking and being active and and and obviously was with nutrition we had several several goals but until we found that one he wasn't a change person\nHe will see results now\nWe're going to take a short break and we'll be right back with ...\nOr if I'm Dr Douglas Howard and Susan Howard don't go away\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule\nReally does work I had a great expense and not not getting the little allergy calls and stuff and\nBringing in a tribute it to that because I shut down uh I actually stopped my vitamins that I Would say you know sticking a

that have vitamins\nI'm with the founder and formulate or of balance of nature Dr Douglas Howard and his wife Susan Howard Dr Howard is a medical doctor how real practical Dr researcher and specialist in spite of nutrients Dr Howard\nWhat is new is that you can tell us with balance of nature and and truly what do I know you do research continually you're one of those perpetual scientists\nDo what you are learning it even more and more as the results come into the company about what the wonderful people who are taking this product what it's doing for them\nYou know it was beautiful the balance of nature is it's not new is the oldest form of nutrition on the earth and it's exactly what it was made for us you know yes I'm always researching and finding and driving a towel on why does it work\nBut the beauty of it is we don't have to reinvent it every couple of years and make a special a new\nBecause the formula for balance of nature has been here for thousands of years on the earth it's one hundred percent pure fruits and vegetables\nThere's nothing at it and nothing taken away from it except for the water it's pure produce\nIt took years of which fruit and which vegetable and and how they would interact with each other and studying that through and then doing studies with with the electron microscopy to different universities so they could study by electron microscopes\nHow it was affecting the DNA the very best and then some of the studies we were doing was how it would affect the immune system the most you remember the game pacman of course okay well you've got white blood cells in there that run around like pacman going you know to to eat the the bad things\nAnd that's what those white blood cells are out there to do so we tested how many of those white blood cells could be out there to eat up the things that shouldn't be in your blood\nAnd how quickly they could respond those immune studies those DNA studies and studies about how the red blood cell could receive the nutrition and receive oxygen so get out to where I needed\nAnd also even studies about the vis costs to do the blood or in other words the thickness of the blood how it flows through the beans and can get to the smallest possible vessels\nAll of that put together then I studied which fruits and vegetables and combining those until we had sixteen different fruits and Fifteen but different vegetables\nThat made the greatest impact on those things in in the DNA for example how could protected the most and how quickly the DNA could repair itself wind damage to those are all things that help prevent aging diseases\nIt's always such a great pleasure to speak with you Dr Howard and Susan Howard from balance of nature when I find remarkable is how easy balance of nature has made it for me to get more than\nTen real whole servings of fruits and vegetables every day it really is remarkable the beautiful benefits of the fruits and veggies and the ... the whole house system\nAnd just so much about what the nutrition means and what it can mean for everyone's life no matter what age it's a real pleasure thanks for being on today thank you it's great to be here

cancer that went through the bloodstream and got along so he has options that we tell everyone about all the options\nGood bad and otherwise it's up to the patient to the side we'll try to tell the patient what to do or how to think that's not our business our business is to tell people what the options are and be fair and honest we would want that for ourselves that we want that for our patients that so I went to medical school to be able to treat patients to the fair\nHonest way not sit there selling something we don't believe that people should be selling something but rather the informant\nAnd we're talking about a man who was sixty seven years old you got two kids\nAnd burned so we're part of his body when it was five even though the gunshot wound in Vietnam when he served as a soldier\nAnd the other right lung cancer he had standard chemo and radiation\nAnd any of the cancer of his right side of the face\nAnd he went to one of the super duper super biggest hospitals in New York and they cut off much of his right side of his face the cheek and they took a flap of tissue from another part of the body and stuck up there and it really looks like\nThey stuck it there without any concern on the looks looks is unbelievable and they did this for cancer so some of those are those cancers sometimes doctors can do almost anything to the patient's body\nWell this man had really a total destruction of his right face looks terrible as a graph\nAny at all that treatment at one of the biggest hospitals in New York\nAt the center of radiation had chemo and the cancer came back right in the wound where the surgeon cut so there's a case that might have been asserted actually spreading the cancer cell sometimes people say oh that could leave I don't want this treatment that treatment because I don't want\nTo spread the cancer well our work is totally non and face it there's no one's hands and your body\nSo this man while he had the surgery at most of his right side of the face was lost had standard British gonna work and then the cancer just grew back riding the scar ... two areas of the scar and they wanted to cut off more of his face at the super super big hospital\nAnd he just walked away he was disgusted use disgusted how they left them how they left them looking after that surgery was disgusted how they let a cancer grow back\nRight in the surgical wound right where the surgeon had his hands and he came to us with cancer ... cancer of the face area the sinuses right in the world\nAnd we stage them up we've got a PET scan before he came to us he never got a CAT scan they never got fully staged as ... shows two areas one under the chin and one right in the scar the right to face\nAnd we've created both and the good news is with no ... no surgery no the foreign buddy both these cancers are now\nGone there in remission and that's the way we like it it had standard surgery we should move so much of his body so much is face it centered radiation weeks and weeks chemo and\nIt just didn't want any of it just doesn't work you can't blame them stop wanting something doesn't work he came to us Richard both areas of the first theory on the cheek which came back in the wound itself has now gone completely gone away and now the second to what was just finished treatment this week\nThat too was gone so he's had great results with us why well we're more pinpoint more precise higher dose per fraction so many red many reasons why our treatment worked and those other treatments that the other deformity just work and left them in a bad way\nOur treatment has left them in a good way and that's what we tried to do every day here at Radio City New York for every patient you wish you could get more information you can call us at two and two choices to into\nTwo four six four to three seven to one to two four six forty two thirty seven to get information DVD a book mailed to you\nAt no charge or booklets about brain cancers and

doesn't work very well she's had surgery already she does not want to have more surgery shove radio surgery\nWhich has pinpoint treatment to the cancer wherever it is the body whether it's in their local area or whether it's spread she believes it's all all all a\nBoy or know that until you look because cancer control to along as far as like this are growing up a few minutes ago and not cause symptoms ... says one mass causing symptoms does not mean that she has had an areas that have\nSmall cancers so our success rate for SARS comas has very high so for Ninety percent\nThat's why so many people come to us was comas needing treatment spending people come to us before the radical surgery she had radical surgery but this big surgeons as big place just left the cancer behind and how do you do that well it's like going to force in the coming on trees sometimes you can see everything that needs to be cut\nDown a surgeon who's operating on human beings should be aware of that should work out that\nThat's the work we do so our work if she chooses it was non base of pinpoint we sending beams retreat many comas including massive succumb listen the abdomen\nSo many homeless or that way they spread to the chest her abdomen and don't cause symptoms until late because they're not pushing on any nursery structures she only knows about it because she can feel it under the skin this is Scott sarcoma recurrent after surgery after ... to cut through the cancer and spread the cancer sad for her\nAnd then they want to talk about the gentleman who Seventy eight years old he's the man who's married with two daughters and\nAbout ten years ago the Gleason nine PSA one point three prostate cancer he had forty five days of treatment and I showed him for Gleason nine cancer forty five days of treatment is not the best treatment\nThis is a fancy man and the fancy wife went to a fancy radiation center they give so many treatments maybe it's good for the radiation doctor are good for the hospital good for the facility\nBut it was not very good for this patient why because it doesn't work the cancer came referring back and well he's had cry all therapy and radiation and chemotherapy and all the cancers re grow on\nBecause he had lousy treatment to start with that is why it's so important to get the best treatment first some of his see a patient and we all for treatment and say well the ... says even the surgery fails I can have radiation and I say well that's true you can have it but it's not very successful bumper to number three\nIs hard to get around it's hard to function and that's what this man is trying to do so he has a stage for cancer medicine prostate cancer who said radiation standard and cry and hormones and came on the cancers keeps on progressing so we offered the stage them up and get them out of pain good amount of suffering and that's the work that\nWe do every day here at radio surge in New York\nAnd other woman who came to the post office worker she's fifty seven years old she's a black woman she's willed with three children she kept with her boyfriend and she has a forest centimeter mass in the upper outer quadrant of the la\nCrosse that means the heart of the breast by the armpit and she has a three centimeter mastered the harm could itself while so she has at least stage three cancer and the broader quadrant of the brass you seen by going to college just shut the ultrasound actually at a mammogram and a biopsy it showed cancer\nAnd then she had a PET scan we've asked her that she refuses second biopsy she's refused a mastectomy she was scheduled for ... one week ago today and she's just refused to do that she has pain\nThe masses Powerball she has no headaches she's had cataracts so she just had some surgeries and she knows what surgery is like she's taking no medications that are no our churches now should these past medical history for a C. section and\nCataracts and she wishes to be treated for breast cancer and not lose her breast she went to the big hospitals are pushing for came over she does not want there were pushing for mastectomy with she does not want she wants non\nInvasive treatments and we have a particular special program here real sort of New York where we treat patients with\nBreast cancer who do not wish to have standard surgery or chemo or radiation and so it's an innovative program just for women with breast cancer declining other methods of treatment wishing to keep their breast avoiding surgery and chemotherapy this is the work we do why\nBecause we believe we should listen to the patient we believe that the patient as the president of United States of his or her body and on many hospitals doctors think\nThey're the president of the patient's body but the doctor is the president of the patient spotty the patient is the president of the patients spot in their spouses the vice president and we listened and we advise and that's why so\nMany people come to us that's one reason we listen to the patient we don't make people wait months and months and months for treatment I talked earlier today about a person to win three months to get going with treatment while at three months imagine how that cancer grows we don't believe in that\nUh we accept most insurance is Medicare Medicaid were super conveniently located the third Sunday for Broadway

cancer whereas with me Ninety percent of women were keeping their breast the difference was not the women the difference\nWas the doctor offering all options allowing women to have\nTheir say and choice and we believe the choices are so important even our phone number is two one two choices just from was diagnosed with breast cancer two years ago and should chemo and the cancerous ought to be inoperable she kept on chemo for almost two years\nShould symptoms of the left breast unarmed pitches had cancer for two years\nShe mentioned the lower inter quadrant of the breast she was seen by doctors at one of the big hospital she's had painted the arm hit so much chemotherapy and even though she's getting chemotherapy she's getting more and more painted the arm\nAnd well this is another sign of stopping chemo it's called useless chemo with chemo doesn't work and you keep on taking this poisoning the system that's another reason to stop the chemo disorders had multiple modules the skin they're growing there a cancerous nodules growing through the skin she is having\nThis abreast somewhat never smoked but she has a short of breath I examine churches multiple modules over the left breast the left presses massively large swollen and heavy as the thickness in\nArmpit of the left side there's no other lumps or bumps so she doesn't fly matory\nBreast cancer she came to us for treatment when chemotherapy is failed in so many people come to us for cancer treatment with chemo fails\nThey come to us because cancers growing pain is getting worse women come to us with lumps in the breast cancer the breast week see patients with cancers most every part of the body it's a reason to call was to get a caller office even know\nWho won two choices to one to two four six forty two thirty seven to one to two four six forty to forty seven this doctor later thank you and God Bless you know\nThanks protesting in to the radio surgery hour with Dr ... and myself if you have questions before next week's show or want to free informative booklet end DVD just contact Dr Lieberman at two one two choices that to one to two four six four to three seven that to one to\nTwo four six four to three [noise]\nThey're proceeding was a paid programming W allies airing of this program constitutes neither an endorsement of the products offered boy the ideas expressed cell are you are you exhale eight feet there in New York\nThis is talk station rated number one seven\nAll the information that has been subpoenaed now with the obstruction continues and you just heard Jim Jordan articulate what that is that means the size of warrants to three oh two gang of eight information\nOr we have representative John Ratcliffe and talking about fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson well\nHe's now saying indicated he's going to plead the fifth he's not saying a word anymore\nOr he was on Fox News Sunday telling Maria ... that Glenn Simpson is in real legal jeopardy in all of this he also confirmed that the FBI has evidence that directly refused the premise of a ... a Trump Russia probe in other words that there's been and remains exculpatory evidence\nThere was a great piece by Jonathan Turley ... three reasons Mahler may not charge Trump with obstruction apparently not asking any questions about it but\nSticking exclusively to whether or not there was any type of collusion which we all know the answer to a you have one top Republican lawmaker no saying the FBI failed to provide a\nFederal surveillance court with important evidence well we don't that now for a long time and we know that\nFor Pfizer court judges\nOr handed information that was supposed to be verified and corroborated ended up being Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for Russian lives that was put together by fusion GPS interestingly funneled money through ... from the hiring of Christ is Christopher Steele a foreign national he doesn't even stand by the information and the ...\nAnd it was the bulk of information to get for Pfizer warrants against the Trump campaign associate and the lead up to the twenty sixteen race\nAll this comes down to some simple basic fundamental things and they never told the ... the judges that it was Hillary Clinton the paid for this information and it's unbelievable that this could be happening in this country but it looks like we're\nFinally beginning to get to the bottom of it at least I Hope so Jason shape it's is with us\nFormer congressman now on Fox News contributor author of the New York times best seller the deep state we have Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova up to ... with us ah thank you both for being here let's start with Jason shape it's because this is your will house and it seems to me that it doesn't matter what Congress request\nThey seek to do their job of oversight they're never going to get the information from the department of justice and they're not going to get the people they need to talk in front of them under oath\nWell the hard part about when you issue a subpoena when I was the chairman of the oversight commission or committee I can issue a subpoena but the only way to earn for that is through the department of justice and so the weight of the paper really isn't worth much because the deejay won't enforce its own subpoena the subpoena issue by Congress\n... the name that people need to also militarized themselves with is Marco why it marked why it was ...\nHe was canceled for the DNC he was counsel for Hillary Clinton he was counsel for a ... group he was involved there\nThis this guy sits in the middle of a lot of these transactions in the movement of money and I think more and more you'll start to see his name along with you know or and Simpson and all these others\nWell I think the fact that ... Simpson is now saying Victoria that\nGoing to plead the fifth and it can get away with that and make them come in and plead the fifth you know the idea that they can just threatened to plead the fifth and not have to actually go through with it I think is important\n[noise] they should make him show up and in front of the TV cameras plead the fifth it's ridiculous to accept a letter from the lawyers and I hope they send you are talking to your former French and telling them to get them or get in to the Congress\nTo take this it and I don't care if they're not going to um\n... because I think there are other ways to to figure out how to do it you've got a subpoena you subpoenaed first and then you negotiate later you don't say oh mine he didn't show up talking trying to work it out now you have to think about CNN said Pina and then you say you can't make it Wednesday then you make it Thursday\nThat I Can't believe there's no ...\nWell I mean I'm trying to understand I mean the president said that there would be de classification and all the materials that Jim Jordan was just talking about would be an redacted and we'd have a chance to see the ... the gang of eight information that three oh two between\nA Bruce or and Christopher Steele and how they wanted a funnel that information straight into Robert Mueller's office uh Joe diGenova but you know the idea of why do I think even with you and Victoria's my attorneys\nThat I wouldn't get away with just saying oh I'm going to plead the fifth leave me alone now or or not handing over subpoenaed materials to Congress\nWell I don't think there's any question that Congress has dropped the ball on of course it gets so the pages but let me just say this because this is really important\nAll the names that you heard Michael ... Mr liar or all those people they are to everything that was done in the United states\nWhat's fascinating is what happened in the United kingdom between the Congress as an issue any subpoenas court we now know that the FBI or am I fix\nAnd that you do a cue to conduct electronic surveillance of Americans said he said it on foreign soil without legal authority to do so\nAnd that information what fact conversations of George ...\nWere intercepted and in the course of the conversation they found out that Papadopoulos was not interested in Hillary email or anything else and they never ... information to the by the court\nYou know it seems congressman shape it's that every piece of the puzzle now is falling in place I think we now understand what the insurance policy was Lisa Page testify that in the the nine months of the investigation\nLeading up to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller that they had no evidence of Trump Russia collusion at all\nUm and by the way even her lover Peter Struck said the same thing he said well I'd be all end up there was something there there's no there are there\nAnd then all of a sudden we find the media elite strategy that they discussed it this way Andrew McCabe comes in James Baker comes in and other people come in and what we see is again it goes back to the Clinton bought and paid ... that dossier information is leaked out to the media creating the impression that in fact there was Russia Trump collusion\nBut they did it themselves they took the again it's it's all they were doing the leaking so that they can appoint the special counsel so that in the which one could be ... begin\nI is there any part of the puzzle that isn't clear to you because it's getting very clear to me\nDo it is becoming a crystal clear\nAnd that's why Jim Jordan is exactly right\nThe people that were in that meeting and reverse the timing of this evening this meeting happens directly after a district Colombia's relieved of his duties but just before Mr Mueller is put into place and you have to understand who's in that meeting what was discussed it sounds like bakers being them of candid about what was going on there but\nEach of the people in that meeting should be brought in for its own their own deposition uh transcribe under oath or before Congress you don't have these\nFive minute little ... you know after you have questions when you do this and I've been in these they go for an hour for the Republican than the Democrats get time than another hour for Republicans and you can really get in depth information if they would do it that way\nWell Victoria I think that's true and that's right and that's just not fair but\nThe obstruction continually I Will take a break we'll come back more with Jason Chaffetz and Joe diGenova also but Dorian ... with us\nI Want to remind you our friends at my pillow they have done it again call their toll free number is eight hundred nine one nine six zero

V. I. L. J. B. T. Q. it's law enforcement it's veterans are\nThe candidates said and then Stacey Abrams is her name and it's made up of those who are told they are not worthy of being here those who are documented and those who are undocumented\nSo I guess she's saying that the blue wave is going to include undocumented people voting in Georgia that's going to be interesting to GOP nominees by the guy by the name of Brian Kemp telling Fox News that Abrams wants the illegals to vote in Georgia\nAnd said I think hard working Georgians should decide who they're governor is not people here illegally like what my opponent wants and adding that it would be unlawful for undocumented immigrants to vote in a gubernatorial election\nBy the way I told you last week about Christian a cinema now she's going up against Martha ... one of the important races that were following and how she uh had referred to her own home state and people in our state of Arizona being crazy and the meth capital of the world and\nAll the Washington Examiner apparently found the emails that shows cinema herself inviting a prominent group\nI'm not making this up of I'm reading from the Washington Examiner of feminist which is\n[noise] [noise] yeah that that's highly unlikely show they were really to aggravating factors year one year already brought up the fact that this happened I'm In a consulate I'm a diplomatic facility that that I mean that breaks every single a protocol moral ethical rule imaginable\nSecondly Sean uh aggravating as well aggravating is is probably enormous enormous understatement here is that he was a member of the media not that there's this ever permissible please I'm not saying I'm suggesting that this makes this even worse on the scale of Savage read the fact that this individual aka so he was a member of the media makes it even worse\nNow how could it happen in a diplomatic facility like that without a higher ups somehow knowing\nIt's highly unlikely but having said that you know there's there's two sides of this there's the side that said wait back let's see let's get the facts looks like some of the facts are starting to come out now but we do need the Saudis there's this is not a ... as simple as a black and white\nSituation we do need the Saudis the relationship with the Israelis are starting to improve we need them where honor razors edge with the Iranians are their nuclear program so this has to be viewed that way and I think Trump get one more thing though shocked I I think the Saudis did screw up big time when they\nSeemingly tried to make these veil threats that they were going to respond you know we were they had to be responded to there was no you can't just let this go so\nThat was a bad move yeah I think that too yeah\nThat's the thing that not only the threats that worried me that Dan just said it seemingly the Saudis need to answer why they like the president and the\nPresident came out and said that the king and ... among the crown prince that called Jared Kushner who's working on the scale unless something that we don't know about it look like they have like the president and I think that they need that there's a lot of explaining to be done there\nWell I think they're going to try and pass it on to an underlying that was in the consulate in Istanbul and so we didn't know but I mean I I Can't imagine for a second that they don't have cameras all over the consulate in Istanbul you spent two years in the in the\nIn Saudi Arabia and well okay you're going to happen I mean the the men and women I\nChronicled the lot on this program and ... women voting and driving et cetera and being told how to dress a being told that granted permission if they can travel abroad et cetera I'm ... I'm sure you had to cover up if you left\nIf you went out and public anywhere and what was life life like for you as a woman living under the sharia there\nYou know this is such an excellent point that you're bringing in China and the reason is is that what we actually last year\nWas modernization and Saturday we saw when then being able to drive we saw the ... what the ... the garment that I had to wear ... and that you were at high school graduation of people have seen it on television probably or if you live in a major you to the central\nFeeding people dress up differently but it's such a great clean shown that people aren't talking about what you just said is that it has been an incredibly repressive regime as it relates to ... for many years and and this and this new\nRules or a precedent relates to Judaism and Christianity and lesbians are either ... or killed is not true\nAbsolutely him but that's for me it was so unfortunate about\nThis incident and why I Hope it gets corrupted very quickly is that we will actually modernization of that team liquor you know a more liberal or such to women's rights limits education when driving and that played the crown prince had built up\nSuch good will around the world is because he was taking a different approach to really saddens me to see them go so far backwards from what was really an interactive it last year to change things\nRight last word damn bones you know\nYeah Morgan's right they were trying to diversify the economy get away from our strictly Petro dollars\nAnd I mean this is an enormous enormous step back on\nYou know there there there's no covering this up if they have to admit that they did this and and the details but this come out they were terrific as we say on this going to be some explaining to do I just encourage everybody to keep the whole\nGlobal picture in mind here uh when doing we can't start World War three over this although sub there has to be a some form of upcoming clean by the Saudi some form of a of retribution there's no\nDoubt they want to pass it on to people and the consulate and I don't believe for a second that they didn't know\nOr at least the crown prince did no sooner than this uh All right thank you all pre she ate it\nUh Morgan Ortega and are are good friend a dam bond you know eight hundred million for one shown is our number next hour by the way we've got a lot coming up we'll get back to the rioting that took place in New York and in Portland over the weekend Sally cold shutdown advisor self as part of the resistance but she'd never be a part of those trust me quick break right back will continue\n[noise] Sean\nHannity\nOn seven can tell you all are [noise]\nAnyone tells you to flee to investing crypto currency has no idea what's about to happen next I'm ...

you're dancing 'cause you're kind of ignoring you know I I don't know what I'd like to punch I'd like to punch him in the face or not the crap out of them or you know maybe they should have been rough up or you know that that if we can talk about\nViolent rhetoric and we're going to look I think it's all bad but like ...\nRhetoric is now the tactic I or go to the heart of the hard left you know people don't like when when the president says you know fake news and they're not real news people and their phony journal is I think that's just that's the exercise of free speech and my hearing you write used to organize protests in front of people's houses\nYou didn't hear me correct yes\nWhy would you do that knowing that there could be kids women and children in the house because I kind of a
