I'm saying and be sure\nYou have a second mortgage on your house to your dad you're going to stay on the house you're paid off for the actors you can absolutely and then you also first mortgage and then hopefully by then that rental will come up to its ... worth at least what you owe on it and you can get rid of it and get rid of brother out of the house\nAnd on your debt frozen uh yeah yeah\nYeah I Would not only a rental property that I break even on dude it's not my goal ... rental property as soon as brother could move if you weren't forty thousand dollars upside down but you're forty thousand dollars upside down the toilet wait on that market to recover a little bit because most real estate in the U.S has not recovered you're in a weird situation there that if it hasn't\nBut I'll give it a ... a year or two or whatever and let's get it recovers wants to write a large check to get rid of it I'd rather I'd a hundred and thirty six dollar check than a what a forty thousand dollar checks all do that for a little while but this idea of buying property to subsidize relatives that we're losing money on and calling that a tax write off this is not good\nWith money but you didn't set out to do that it's just where you ended up marrying into it so when it comes up in value dump it and in the meantime pay off your second then pay off your first there we go think\nKevin's

um\nMy dad came to me a couple of years ago and um he was getting ready to retire and let it take are offered for me to take over a whole life insurance policy for them I think he just kind of looking to get rid of the premium before he retired [laughter] I Would like to get rid of it now knowing a little bit more about whole life insurance\nBut he keeps telling me I Need to hang on to it mhm and keep it so that when he retired or excuse me when he passes I have money to pay the taxes on uh the inheritance money that will be coming to me and\nSo how large assistant state [noise] uh I Would say it's close to a million\nThere's no taxes on his estate\nSo he doesn't know wasted on impact 'cause I Know you don't have the time like there's no tax federal there's no federal or state tax on stage over a ... unless they're over five point for nine million this year\n[laughter] okay so everything like Phil ... so he's he is can I think he's converting most like his raw than it is for only caves and all the things though\nIf it was a state is one million dollars there's no taxes on their\nOwn pay any taxes on me but\nNow you might pay a state probate tax but there's no federal estate taxes on in the state of one million dollars and\nThen the ... there were\nOver five million dollars for the feds to get after you show so if he's got you know what he's doing he's parroting the back what the

seven to end wor [noise]\nThey\nUs from August Georgia here in the lobby of Ramsey solutions Hi Dale how are you\nI'm doing great thanks Dave how are you better than I deserve how can I help\nAh well I had an unusual question and I've been pondering it for a while\nI'm after my divorce I moved to a guest and started working and I moved in with friends in their garage apartment mhm so ever use a kitchen restroom and laundry on normally thing she would renting a room um\nBut I came across a condo that I'm Wondering the realtors owned and I had an opportunity to buy it\nFor about fifty two thousand and its values anywhere from sixty five Seventy and it ... and was rented [laughter] when I bought it a couple of years ago and it makes about Thirteen hundred dollars a month and my rent where I Am is only five hundred\nAnd this one's going to be available for the end of the year and I've been pondering do I want to move into it make it my own home now that it's bacon ... bought it and it's rented\nOkay and what's your income oh average about thirty five thousand a year commissions mhm\n[noise] well I ... the way I answer questions was bought always ends up happening with me on stuff like you're describing is um what feels good and the short term\nMight not be taking me to my long term goal\nAnd a show or when I'm always asking myself as warm where am I going to be in ten years in which these decisions takes me there\nOkay now obviously you can live in a garage apartment how old are you I'm not fifty five okay then you could live in a garage apartment or your sixty five\nAnd you could make the transaction will spread here I'm making next door some extra money doing that is what we're saying and then you the question to ask yourself is is that worth it to you\nDoes that get you some place that you couldn't get otherwise um my tendency personally would be to do everything I can to increase my income during the next ten years and be living in that condo\nOr I mean you landed in the garage apartment as a a a place to heal and and get reset after a divorce right\nBut that really wasn't ... it's kind of camping when you're not a college student I mean this was camping ... you know and so this isn't like your destiny it's not where you want to be long term but ... and so my point is just because the numbers work on something doesn't mean it's right\nSo if you feel and you've settled you got your ... footing under you again which I'm guessing you do that you bought a condo um probably moving into their condo but the ...\nWhat am I going to be doing ten years from now like Seventy thousand understood a thirty five and what ... what am I gotta do to get my support a healing is believing in yourself again at away ... are Arab living yourself in a way maybe you never have to worry you put yourself on a career track to get those in comes up long term\nBut er ... if that's where you are that's where your head as I think I'm going to move into the condo now if you're headed is saying you know I think I'm probably going to the show all I'm ever going to do I'm just going to route thirty five thousand into retirement you might want to rent a grudge apartment but the other money in your pocket\nBut I don't think that you um\nWhen I really like to purchase a house you know keep the ... rental income\nNow let's get it paid off is paid off so good that'd be awesome them you will by if you get an extra money to about beyond Tobias worth\nSaving not at the moment now than living in a condo with no payment at all\nYou know you can do that and again getting your income up get you into that goal faster\nSo um I I'm going to be working on the income so the equation and I'm probably going to go and enjoy that paid for condo it's a it's kind of like saying uh I'm back\n[laughter] you know what I'm saying is that does that ring a bell with you yeah okay yeah you're back yeah they all use back and you got a future and it's right and it's going to be good and you are moving in the condo but it's on my way to a house that I'm a package for 'cause my income is going to go up and goes back\nAnd uh yeah I'm I'm not gonna camp anymore fifty five\nIt was okay to do that for a little while no shame in that game but that but you're you know you got past that stage now\nIs that okay yeah cool thanks for dropping by thanks open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Claire is with us in Atlanta Georgia I clear how are you\nI'm good how are you know good how can I help\nIf it was paid for in order to have three hundred and savings and the answer real quickly in my mind will be no right right right and because all we're doing is doing that in reverse aren't way yes and so that's how I kind of get there but the thing the reason I was asking some of the questions I'm trying to think you know two hundred thousand is not a huge mistake it's a good one\nBut it's not a huge one I mean it's going to produce Fifteen twenty thousand dollars a year in income and um then they've got the other\nUh Fifteen or twenty thousand dollars a year coming in from Social Security give or take and they got to live on that otherwise they burn through this nest egg and they end up having to sell the farm in their old age right and I don't want to do that so as long as they'll keep\nA spending less than the income that is produced by the two hundred\nAnd their Social Security stay on a ... household budget that's below that then the game plan you and I just talked about will run in perpetuation no matter how long they live okay is that is that logical to you as long as they do that\nThen yes I Would do it in a heartbeat or 'cause I Love the idea of going into your you know your latter years will everything paid for especially your home box when your home is paid for and you're sixty seven\nYou stabilized\nFor the next Thirty years till you're Ninety seven your ... your your housing costs and your housing costs as the largest cost in your budget\nSo if you're renting your rent goes up every year for the next Thirty years if you're sixty seven and and that sounds like homelessness to me later unless you've got a huge mistake\nAnd so by owning and by owning with no debt you've completely stabilized your golden years Tyler is with us in Oklahoma City Hi Tyler our you\nHey Dave I preach taking my call sure man what's up\nWell my uh wife and I did our dead prescribing last year in July so we're on steps four or five and six um when I got back to the Oklahoma City area ...\nCouple of months later he started to change my job an employer and after a ah what appeared to be a better job of it for us in our family at the time and it produced nothing but a year worth of turmoil and so now I just lost my job on friday last week [laughter]\nI'm working through the debt snowball paying off my student loans [laughter]\nI think I pretty much burned myself out of my career path and so\nI'm a pharmacist and light training as skilled in such that I'm new at this point I don't see myself as as marketable for other areas and so that's where I'm trying to figure out I've been reading books like crazy this last year [noise]\nBecause I'm passionate about um small business I'm an entrepreneur heart and I still like working with people but working in the health care sector has just\nEating my lunch this past year and so I'm trying to figure out what to do\nNow is not actually doing pharmacy or dealing with the customers a chew up it's the bureaucracy and show how is there another way we apply your existing education skills to the market that rather than just work in a CBS\nCorrect um\nI don't know but I I Would think that there's got to be some kind of ... a pasta carry idea out there kind of old school high end delivery or something that is not all insurance based in driving me crazy\nRight you know like ... and the doctor has got some of the doctor ... go to the ... air model right correct where they lower the number of patients that they see and you pay a flat fee and you've got like they'll do house calls and everything and they actually know their patience now\nRight that kind of thing where they lower the different kind of practice management is the I Wonder if there's that kind of application to your world I have no idea I'm making this up right now so I'm flu pharmacist\nJob market is saturated um they've they've been dumping pharmacist more and more pharmacists and ever since I graduated\n... or ... it was just there just stamping it out that's the ... world so right and that's\nThe world I came from a smaller smaller sector and you know here I Am I lost a hundred and forty five thousand dollar income and I'm thinking well you know what next to it obviously I Can't pull the lead up to the dog because the docks no longer than I\nWell I mean there's there's there's two things one is I'm trying to think through if I'm you a business model 'cause you've got an entrepreneurial itch to scratch that is some kind of high service ... low insurance no insurance ... carry model where you use your licensing and your knowledge is you're very specialized in very\nValuable knowledge right and that's not what you were burnt out on your burn out on the corporate crap right and uh and\nSo is there another way to be a pharmacist in today's world that you invent even if it's on a small scale I don't care I'm right I'm going to begin to investigate business model ideas like that around the country and see who's doing\nLike an old school of public area I'm almost thinking like a soda fountain and the thing like the old days you know kind of thing we're stuff but I don't know I I'm just making this up in my head sitting here I Know that ... here's the thing I Do know about the marketplace the very very\nHigh end high service a luxury markets are booming in every sector\nThe uh low end the bottom end which is all price based is booming middle grade product lines of services are not booming in any space\nThose are people I mean in other words cheap hotels enriches or doing good the ones in the middle are struggling\nRight and so get off on one into those spaces you figured out the bottom into the ... space is killing you so we're probably going to some kind of high end thing is they're the ... to rich people model some way I don't know I'm making this up\nI'm just asking questions out loud now while we're discovering that I might go back in under another year or two of the grind to put away two hundred thousand bucks to go live my dream with\nOkay but I'm not going to submit myself to Thirty years of this grind right okay but I put up with all kinds of crap for a little while to get to where I Want to go\nThis last year has been so brutal and my wife and family that you know they they now see what I saw um you know a year and a half ago it's\nBrutal on their wife and family just your time\nYou're ... ... my my morale\nOkay what's your morale has everything to do with what you're looking towards you thought you were stuck there I can ... I don't want my Morales bad if I'm standing and poked my knees okay but not bad if I'm standing poop money's cause I'm walking through that shoveling it to use it as part of laws or to grow a crop\nTrue okay you see the difference I if I can look past it I can walk to anything but you couldn't like passed it in the last year and it destroyed your emotion germ your gas tanks empty\nRight I'm kinda glad that I said that chapter you know and I turned a new page yeah\nMy point is you could walk back into a similar situation if you knew you were only doing it for two years because at the end of two years we're going to do X Y and Z\nRight okay but you gotta have your X Y and Z defined and I'm I'm not capable of doing that in this setting\nIn you know a minute and forty five seconds on the radio but I mean at least get you started there so you got the right stuff do you just got to believe in you again and not completely give up on the idea that you can surf people through a path to carry through pharmacy because you can surf people\nThat way I just don't know how to do it business model because I don't know your world well enough I mean I'm a consumer see the CVS model I see the ... model out there\nAnd see the ... model in the high end on the medical care side that's working really well I'm a customer [noise] but uh of that for convenience thing on the high inside so I don't know I I don't I don't know\nHow that works but I think it's for a year on the right track that\nYou've got this big on this this ...\nGuy child abuse or of the day brand new show\nOn the side to

taking my call sure what's up\nSo I'm currently on the baby steps four and six\nAnd I'm calling about my house and whether or not I should start throwing all my extra money at it that swept in my budget um because I'm thirty I'm Single I'm and I'm worried that you know when when God does provide me that women are coming up right\nAnd my goal to have the house paid off I'm forty if I get paid off maybe she doesn't want to be here forever hold and I'm not sure that I'll stay here so to that makes sense to start throwing all that money to get paid off early\nTwo years into the mortgage goal to pay it off by the time I'm forty yeah I was wondering I Do think it makes sense after all that money out here in the mail not sure if I'm going to stay here forever\nAbsolutely sure throw the money that here's an interesting thing we're not spending the money when you reduce your mortgage and you're homeless paid off and you sell your home they give you a check\nAnd all that money comes back to you so it's not like you're throwing the money away you're actually investing it at the rate of interest that your mortgage interest is\nMuch is your mortgage interest rate\nIs proof pouring through Seventy five percent fair\nTo say you have a three point three Seventy five percent savings account that you can withdraw from until you sell it it just I just ... I'm Sorry I'm just\nTrying to get in there may Fifteen Percent of your income in baby steps for going into retirement live your life\nAnd my extra money that you find or squeeze throw it at the mortgage into houses bite off\nIf you do pay it off and said young lady comes along and you guys choose not to live there or you just choose not to live there you sell the house they give you a check all that money comes back to you we're not spending the money the money's not leaving it's just being deposited into the house\nAnd see the difference Yes sir it's aren't going anywhere\nSo yeah yeah I'm going to go ahead and pay on average no downside to this except that you can't get to the money without selling the house which is actually kind of a good thing Cindy is with us in Houston, Texas Hi Cindy how are you\n... have you\nDone better than I deserve voice\nWell me and I currently work baby baby steps\nOne too and I'm Linda how can we reached only celebrated our wedding anniversary yeah hey hey hey hey particularly they eat a fool when an average ... and paid on credit\nAnd it boils down to LA you know and I'm twenty troll keeping it or we\nDon't understand how his brain works [laughter]\nI thought you said the two of you were working on a plan to get out of that\nI that we work yeah\nI'm more concerned about the fact that he's not on this plan than I Am the ring\nI agree because what my next week he's going to finance power tools mhm\nYeah and then he's going to come on when the new ... three weeks from now we'll have a lot more there you go there you go let's finance six thousand dollar drawn their lawn mower you might be a written that give you a payments on you're riding mower\nYou know I mean Syria ... did you see the breakdown breakdown is we can't get out of a whole hour digging out the bottom\nCatch a cold and so I'm a lot more concerned about his lack of grass that this was the family goal that I Am whether or not you keep those ring them personally I'd take it back I mean I've been married thirty five years and you know\nIt'd be nice to have an ice rink and you can get you another ring I mean there's just stupid rings everywhere I mean there's not a big thing it's not like at your wedding ring or something and it was an anniversary gift that you couldn't afford\nExactly and I mean sweet but dumb you know right yeah I think\nSo but I think the thing is here yeah I'm probably taking it back but more importantly I Want to take his brain and ... back and a little bit better you know and to to you all the ... are we really doing this or not because otherwise you're you're never going to get there\nBecause apparently he's not on the same page or on that's big thing I mean Ninety percent of this question is around that temper sense on one of the keep the ring or not so young\nAh so I assume he's a pretty messed up\n[laughter] yeah we have to say the least yeah how old is he a he'll be twenty eight [laughter]\nOkay um is what\nIs one of the nature what's the nature of his disability\n[noise] um [noise] a losing land okay I'm In a a in a concrete labor accident\nGotcha okay leg or arm what leg okay All right\nAnd I'm not to minimize that 'cause that's a horrible thing but that's all\n[laughter] yeah and you know I think basically what's been happening is there's been so many different disputes back and forth and counter suing going on by lawyers\nAnd that's all that's all behind us you think now you think this will come and go ahead\nI think it it's I'm finally getting to the point to where there's going to be actual real settlement um talk and um there's just been some shady things going on in the court cases\nWells what twenty million dollars is they're going to they're going to mess with it you can count on that [noise] yeah okay\nWow\nAll right so uh and what is his emotional and mental state\nI think honestly he just wants to keep working he wants to have you back at work\nHe doesn't want is going to get what a prosthetic leg and he'll be able to do something with his mind now only won't be doing heavy lifting things or something like that probably\nRight\nExactly that's that's the hope except for he's got a desire to do those kinds of things so it's really killing him to around\n... around but I mean I'm you know you usually actually make more money with your mind did you do with your body anyway\nRight as a career path so generally speaking and so that's forced upon him here which is I'm not not a bad thing is what I'm thinking so I\nI think he he gets to sit down and ask themselves that question what do I want to do if I could do anything in the world because\nNow he can do anything in the world [noise] right right\nAnd so I'm going to coach him on finding a career that he loves and I'm going to spend a very small percentage of this money because they won't take as much of that a small percentage of that much money to do some kind of retooling as far as education goes\nAnd saying okay I'm going to get a degree in X or y or I'm going to get some training in X or y and I'm going to learn to be one of those things over there or whatever those things are that he wants to do so what's he want to be when he's fifty\nYears old that he's made his life's work and his career and he gets to choose that now that's awesome to be a self employed track that could be a ... a track of uh some kind of a a a\nI don't know I mean anything but it's obviously not going to be something that is physically\nHum demanding okay right [laughter] that's okay that's okay\nIn terms of technology though um he's kind of wanting to start his own business now and getting all these ideas and they have no water that acts implication on something like this that you've known it'd be facing with\nThat depends on how the settlement is structured and you'd have to talk with his uh uh uh attorney and was from tax advice to find out how it's structured ... in California as well that's correct down\nThat that's the first thing you need to figure out what the taxes are going to be and what the lawyers' fees are going to be and then you know what you're going to have met the second thing then is figure out what we're going to do I would I Would urge him to pretend like this money's not there by and large\nI mean even if let's say there's twenty million after taxes just to use a number okay and if you if you've pulled a million out to start a business and to coast for a little while emotionally\nAnd that leaves you're Nineteen million that you just pretend like you're not there\nThat makes sense that's pretty bad yeah I mean you can buy anything you want to do with that right that's a lot of freeway money okay I'm so absolutely something along those lines and then what I Want him to do is to build himself a uh the Bible says in the\nIn ... in the abundance of counsellors there are safety in the multitude of counsellors there's safety so he needs to build himself a little board of directors\nA needs an estate planner\nA that's a lawyer he needs a tax professional probably that as a lawyer but at a minimum is a CPA I'm\nA needs an investment person in his corner I'm ... probably you when someone else sitting there that look at him and telling me stupid when he's being stupid\nAnd he needs to to commit himself to\nGathering information from this group of people before he does something\nDoes that make sense because white people lose money like this is is that they go off on their own and they don't have the tools mentally to to manage this and you've got to put some people in your life not to do it for you but the coach you\nAs a group to do this I don't want one person managing your weather and that's how I get ... right\nAnd I don't want you doing it by yourself 'cause you're probably not completely equipped\nBut we're going to put a group of people around him if he wants to do some real estate and he has a high quality real estate person sitting on his little board rights but we've got a CPA we gotta stay plan or we got a tax person may be a real estate person may be an investment person in the mutual funds world and then we're going to build a game plan here this is what we do with like an NFL player that asked us what to do\nThey get they get a ten million dollar signing bonuses and they're really good at football but they are not really good money\nAnd so they don't if you don't end up on the front of Sports Illustrated be one of those stupid people that lost a million dollars here's how you do it you put some people in your corner that teach you coach you and God you as a group\nYou don't have one person doing it and then you gradually over the years become very adept at managing twenty million dollars\nWith the help of these people teaching you and they all need to have the heart of a teacher they don't need to be arrogant and bossy\nBut they and they need to say they need to look at him and telling the truth and kindly but go listen here's why you don't want to do that you can do it but here's why you don't want to do that and then and he needs to commit to keeping his hands off of the bulk of it and put it in investments them forget it's there\nAnd he can live the rest of his life easy easy but if he goes into size to open a twenty million dollar technology thing he's going to lose it all by the ... three years from now all the money will be gone\nYeah that's what I'm afraid of too yeah I'm so don't do that you know don't\nDon't open twenty million dollar business don't open a business that takes up all this to open a business is very small he's got plenty of money he doesn't have to prove anything okay take your time to be the tortoise don't be the hair\nAnd just take your time put a group of counsellors and the multitude accounts for their safety put a group of counsellors in your life that are professionals in the different areas that can speak\nTo you teach you and how old is he today ... ... so the goal is by the time he's thirty eight he has a clue okay yeah\nAlong the lines of managing twenty freaking million dollars [laughter] it'll it'll take ten years for him to intellectually and emotionally get his arms around it and he'll lose it all\nIf he starts prone to do one or two plays with all that money\nWell I'm an open a traitor pizza parlors all gone it's all gone yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna be the next Facebook no you're not it's all gone\nIt's all gone OK so take a small amount of it and get yourself back to work to give you the dignity of work and to create an income where you really don't need any of that money any way and it's just sitting there growing and then this horrible tragic event\nTurns into a financial blessing that changes his family tree so there you know for generations to come\nBecause he's wise with it does that make sense\nYes thank you very much appreciate all the five\nMaybe that's exactly what we would do if we were in the

our wonderful student loans from a private Christian university ...\nWe were expensive spouses to each other ah oh\nOkay so this you drop some coin men yeah All right and I'm doing six and a half years that's a long time to pay off their student loans I was thinking maybe it was the house when he told me years so there has to be a good story tell me your story\nUm I got a really funny story actually hum when we went through financial piece at our church at the time I'm One of the things that you mentioned in your video was a take cash with you when you when we were we were newlyweds when we first went through and you should take cash would you when you go to a\nFurniture store to buy a car and and and slashed the cashing in and talk to them that way so\nWe were at a furniture store and I'm a very non confrontational kind of guy kind of a free spirit and she told me hey let's do this let's put this to practice so we took passion and I'm Talking to the sales guy about a bad that we're trying to buy for our apartment at the time and\nI'm flashing the cash and saying hey I'm I'm gonna walk as if we can't make this happen right now and he's like I'm I'm Sorry that that's just the price\nAnd uh so I just went out in the car and set down because I couldn't swallow my pride and buy it but then my wife ended up by the\nUs I don't know that that that's just to show that\nThere was a lot of negotiation from the beginning we were really um when we were dating and engaged at the time we were sitting down with their finances and\nWe were actually writing out the numbers and it was just this pit feeling in her stomach because of uh we're just indebted to these loan companies and we're going to be in our fifties before we pay 'em off and\nUm so and so we started the class we now down a budget and did the ... system we were really um persistent faithful with envelopes us down and just really got serious about it on\nAnd I think the big part and for us for as far as deciding to really try to work on baby step too as\nWe paid by car off I'm relatively quickly and then he had gotten his first pretty big bonus them from work and so we were like okay we haven't really gotten to travel before kids let's take a really great trip to Europe with the money we deserve it\nAnd we were sitting there one time where like where we just their budget you know a few months ago and so that was\nThe first step we use that bonus money instead of a trip to Europe which who knows if we'll be able to take that ever and that's okay but we uh why wouldn't you make a hundred and sixty thought of any debt and our first the first and now we have two kids so it just makes me a lot of kids [laughter]\nAt least in some countries [laughter] so yeah that that was the big you know turning point for us when we put that big lump sum of money in our first a student loan payment and there was an awful feeling that hurt but a good feeling\nTo show how much of the six years did you move closer to Seventy five and how much closer to one sixty pretty much the whole six years a product of the last year or so last year the income doubled down right ... and so that's a relatively new figure correct them and so really you know basically you paid off for about thirty thousand bucks a year\nFor six years while making about Seventy five right now so you really have been doing this ... and then the last year a kicked in about the time you saw the light at the end of Donald income comes up ... yeah yeah what what was the hardest part of this for your cars six and a half and a good", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "year": "2018", "city": "New York", "day": "30"}
