steroid that Scotland really excited\nFront row Amy is on display and we're going to tell you what she's showing\n[noise] this is a really wanting to today's Len Burman and Michael read all in the morning catch them live Monday from six built in seven ten ... so he says\nThis is a really wanting to today's Len Burman and Michael read all in the morning catch them live Monday from six built in on seven ten wor [noise]\nMichael our listeners just love us all you have to do is go to our winter handle\nOutlet\nMichael W. are they love us you want to hear some of the tweets though I Can't wait lay it on me Len ready at or around me George sweets Len picks up talking points like a bomb picks up change [laughter]\nI I thought one\nFrederick ... if you'd like to weigh Frederick tweets I Love what Michael comments on people's attractive this for someone who looks like the love child the bows though and ready kilowatt he shouldn't criticize anyone who's ready to kill a lot I looked it up some spokesperson for an electrical company some little animated figure\nDo I look like ready kilowatt you're pretty much ... for so the bows of well pretty much both why do I look like those other Klimt oh you do come on our listeners looked like Pierce Brosnan yeah right\nYour dreams are you excited by the a playoff game tonight I Am Yankees at Fenway Park there should be great yeah the plane um the Boston Red Sox they are good good point in my [laughter] glad you brought that up because no one knew who they were playing up there\nIn February and so you basically this was a Boston Red Sox we we could have been the ah you know Toledo mud hens for all we do\nLook at it's no secret if you've been listening to show I don't know very much about sports I learned a lot about the Mets and that kind of learn about the Yankees is you do\nAnyway a the picture for tonight will be Jay ... for the Yankees against Chris Sale is terrific for Boston or the Yankees picked up happened midstream and the IRS is a thoughts about Tonight Show down\nOn a focus on on being aggressive and interests and myself and [noise] just continuing to kind of sort of do it I Do and trust that that's going to be enough\nYou know there's this game is another game it's a big game but I'm going to treat it like another one\nThere you go to another game Michael ... is that is one of the great sports cliches right is that there is a tomorrow you can't you can't use that one yet because there was a game tomorrow you can't say there's no tomorrow you can't say their backs are against the wall we can say you can treat ... just like another game\nAnd my feeling is not knowing too much about all this I think the red Sox are probably the best team in the country and I think they're going to beat the Yankees\nThey may I I think they ... the interesting part is that the the a Red Sox real advantages their starting\nPitching but their Achilles' heel is their bullpen\n... now the Yankees starting pitching has been up and down but they're both ends pretty good so I mean if it comes down to a battle of bull pen the Yankees might have an edge there really but do the Yankees win if they beat the red Sox\nNext step would be the Houston or Cleveland just ... the two good teams right of to fight for the American league in Houston is defending world champs so it's it's it's gonna be fascinating and I like watching some of the nationally games yesterday in fact we carried the Braves Dodgers game here on seven ten W. or last night Dodgers one six nothing but that was a great ending\nYeah no you're taught at the Milwaukee Oh yes yeah Milwaukee Colorado was a was a great ending a I'm a single one of the game\nAnything interesting about Fenway Park over the years have you but you also have some time off and like the best ... is it the best stadium\nWell it's not the most comfortable stadium to sit in because like Broadway shows they built those seats a hundred years ago and the women have to stand in line forever to use the restroom probably in this very\nTight ... but it's just a lovely little boy you walk in there and then you hear the phrase band box with some famous writer actually calling did as a banned book stadium um she's like I Can't remember now anyway you have the the big wall agree monster in left field it's a beautiful little ball\nPark and I I I Love spending years in Boston as a sportscaster uncovering the red Sox and Fenway now speaking of the play offs mhm I was watching the Milwaukee game which valley was just referring to Milwaukee be Colorado and they did it with a single attempt ending\nUp watching the game I said I Know that lady and right behind home plate and you can't miss or when the from the set of your camera her name was front row Amy

R. dot com slash let them either you want to check out front row Amy uh she's basically just sitting there she's leaning over the field let's put it\nThat I mean is she lets just well ask you not like she the type that if you're a player and you you could be distracted your mind might be thrown around a little bit you know I think you look her way I guess for the pitcher you have a good view of her\nOr I get it out that he's the catcher well here's how she ... she was asked by a Madison radio station a thirteenth ten WMBA she was asked how she got her name\nBack and kick out laughing\nOn radio station like eight fifty W. A. S. S. T. they start talking about me because they found me and if I were out quite a bit and um someone called in one night that have now out in and set her name's Amy so then they kind of um gave me the wave oh Amy that's a great\nOr just out ... lowest level since\nThe September of Nineteen sixty nine wow who is president then that would be Mr Nixon indeed so Republicans are you there are the kind of other great\nAll right let them go before you go to the phones I Want to read you a a one email from Seamus as you know you can always email us okay asked us at seven ten W.

women with with with with sons\nI I agree ... even though my son is still fairly young mhm Sony Thirteen but\nI mean the culture change even in schools where everything you say is put underneath the microscope and I've said to my son you know I just think every time you see something before you have an accent think about it because I don't everyone hadn't put in that\nPosition you stay away from the girls that that's what's growing and that's the problem is women that's the problem right hey I promise you really say that but remember the garden of Eden story Asia and in New Jersey age and
