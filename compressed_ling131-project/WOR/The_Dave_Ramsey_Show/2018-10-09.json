{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "Division series against the Dodgers at twenty Fifteen or game five I should say with Jacob ... really struggling early Terry ... stuck with them and all of a sudden the ground was able to get through six innings\nA but tonight for the Yankees I think they are they they want so badly to get ... because they don't have full faith and see the ... who they named their game ... starter tomorrow\nAnd and they're trying to get him through\nA this game where\nYou got to be aggressive taking your pitcher out if you see that he does not have it and uh Louise Severino this is not the kind of dominant performance then he had at\nLeast are in the early going in that wild card game against the Oakland A's was able to rack up quite a few strike out or in those early ... ah as for\nThe rest of the ... around the NFL we got into the jets big win over the Broncos and now you know how they have to try to maintain and do it for a second time\nOr what's going on with the giants where it is it's always drama around Dale back a junior in more of that this weekend even if his heart is in the right place and he's trying to do the right things and I think just going about it the wrong way\nOne thing you shop around the league yesterday was\nWhat winning teams are willing to do decision time late and games and specifically on fourth down either there are two great examples yesterday one being the\nLos Angeles rams will look like the best team in football they're playing the Seattle Seahawks there ahead thirty three thirty one in the fourth quarter\nThey end up in a fourth in one situation late in the game minute and a half on the clock Seattle calls time out the rams players are saying we want to go for it we want to go for it\nAnd Tim McVeigh considers it and then decides you know what you guys want it you get worn down in one own territory up to end the rams decided hey we got this first down came over we would\nLove that call QB snake Jared golf picks it up game over naked Neal out the rest of that clock\nAs aggressive as most teams in the league it's been forever decision you're ...\nYou're trying to hold onto the field position you make the Seahawks go would be forty fifty yards probably to get into a field goal range\nAnd how often do we see especially in today's NFL where all of the rules are so far in favor of the off and Susan Bennett high scoring game Seattle already scored thirty one points do you really want to depend on your defense to make a big spot stop make a big turnover\nAnd stuff to do\nThe op ed just have all of the advantages so why not use your ... to win a game and the rams able to do just that yesterday and\nEvery decision that McVeigh makes seems to turn out positive for the rams they're up to a phenomenal start this season building off of their first real good season last year and it shows just the kind of different set of head coach can make\nYeah they got a lot of talented they've added over the course of this season but look at how Jared golf he looked like a bust the first year as the number one overall packed with Jeff fissures is head coach\nComes in and all of a sudden maybe on a modern day off fence\nGolf is slinging it to a host of different receivers and everything looks easy and golf looks phenomenal everybody plays up\nThe coach makes a huge difference in the NFL and that aggressiveness the faith and your team you love it when it on up and if you could do that the rules now it sets up nice for you\nAnd then consider the opposite decision made yesterday by Jason Garrett and the cowboys\nOn Sunday Night Football in overtime the cowboys moved the ball down the field in tax since territory sports in one another team with a strong running game that utilizes it's running back a tongue tied girl with the rams Ezekiel Elliott with the cowboys\nAnd the cowboys decided to pump the ball back and get it back to use and and that had been a lower scoring game\nThe Texans defensive line at held up I get some of the thinking from Jason Garrett but that's a spot\nPlato when when they came\nDon't play for a tie don't play not to lose and it's a kind of decision that will bite you\nAnd what happens is used in as a huge plate\nTo de Andre Hopkins make numbers spins gets down to feel they can feel going when\nBecause the rules favored the Austin's now and and to me it it changes the arithmetic these decisions\nGive yourself a chance there's nothing wrong with going for it on fourth down more often than not far more up not going to pick it up and if you're going to trust your defense how can you trust your defense even the best defenses in the league now they don't dominate\nThey survive\nIt the scoring numbers in the league are through the roof this year\nIt's up drastically from last season\nSo you have all these extra points the ... are getting more and more difficult to stop all the rules and the rule changes over\nThe years have been in favor of the ... you get to adjust if you're a head coach and times where you would have punted in the past or you would have trust in your defense you just can't you\nCan only do so much it can only survive there is no defense in the league ban is dominating the game that is truly thriving the jaguars of a tremendous defense\nThey're probably the best in the league\nAnd they're going to give up some points that's going to be part of it you're not going to beat the rams of two thousand and you're not going to be that kind of defense against\nThe rules don't allow it\nSo and notes key situations you trust your often sometimes and the winning teams will do that\nLike the rams and the losing teams like the ...\nThis won't they won't be very good and not game had to put a smile on some giants fans faces and I know\nAnytime the cowboys lose that's a plus there but it is amazing how bad the giants have been for them to be one and four and you could still look at this division\nAnd see how the giants are and nobody is going well in the division the Redskins at the best chance there too and one but there in New Orleans tonight down six to three right now in the second quarter the defending champion eagles they have problems\nAnd they're checking in at two in three\n\nThe cowboys after their laws yesterday just two and three and that division is bad right now it is absolutely wide open and so the giants even at one in four\nThey're not dead\nI think they could even lose on Thursday and not be dead this division is so bad I don't get me wrong at the key game\n\nWhen we knew the giants scheduled to be brutal early on\nAnd the key for the giants is how do they handle it do they all come apart if they're one in five like they did last year where does this team I actually have the ability\nTo rally and negative rally soon a it's a tough Thursday night match up against the eagles but they are at home that's a huge advantage on Thursday Night Football\n\nIf you're going to try to win the division let's say and that would appear to be the best ticket to the playoffs and that division you're probably not gonna be a wildcard Eddie NFC East well\nYou want to die breakers in your favor and you got to win a home game against or divisional opponents are so that's all part of it for the giants you but that\nDivision is it's been lousy it's been underwhelming so the giants for all the problems that they have or are the issues that they are bad for the occupants of lack of productivity they've had really until yesterday and they finally broke thirty ... thirty point what do\nOh that's what they want yeah ... and and that was his case you know may have there been any other evidence other than her ... accusation with nothing else to back it up you know maybe it could believer right I I I you know I'm kind of siding with columns now that you know maybe something happened to her but it wasn't this guy\nI thought ... gave a very effective speech on the floor of the Senate she really laid out her thinking and how she came to the conclusion unless you're a little bit of ms senator Collins\nI don't think she was coming forward with a political motive although I Do think that she was treated well\nBy those who who raised her confidant and said\nNo kidding that the Democrats here's one more\nI Believe that Brett Kavanaugh was her family [noise] so I Do believe that she was ... I don't know by home and I'm not certain where\nOkay that was um I think it was that was on the CNN I Believe this yesterday in a state of the union\nWill now of course I read somewhere that are the Democrats have raised three million dollars to support someone to run against\nSusan Collins who now they're going to try to go after all of the senators who voted for a cab and all the ones in a swing states we have close in tight races but what's very interesting and this Joe is what the Democrats did not bank on this fight\nHas energized the Republican base\nAnd the Republicans now who may have been a little lethargic a little disappointed in Trump maybe not going to turn out for the midterms they see that this fight to tear down Kavanaugh is the preliminary to the fight to impeach President Trump and I think that's going to turn them out\nYeah this was and and it's the weapon of choice is character assassination\nRight somehow someone Trump is\nKind of immune to that he ... he is that when you can say\nI mean they have said the worst things possible by this guy and it does just set up a bounce off his back\nYeah I well I'm trying to say why why can't you destroy his character because I mean\nWe all we all know the flaw exactly nothing is going to surprise that are on the most genius thing about Trump is it's all out their baby to this is who I Am you voted for me anyway so bring it on because of the people who's the bar may that just kind of shrugged their shoulders and say yeah tell me something I didn't know\nHim ... ... in case of Kavanaugh he ... he was brought up on something you did in high school\nAnd a cap it all came out as a boy scout studious good man coaches sports never did anything wrong so when all this the ah stuff came out about his drinking and his alleged sexual assaults that didn't compute with the image that he was putting out there so that's why I became a problem\nSo maybe it's better to start with the unclean image as opposed to as a boy\nScout grab 'em by the you know what you're saying [laughter] ban on land or at any time\nDuring the day they weigh in on all this stuff out of it all confirmation the left wing going nuts that really fascinates me one eight hundred three two one zero seven ten one eight hundred three two one zero seven ten so now because the left wing is so furious so furious that cabinet I was going to the Supreme Court\nThere's already talk about old fashioned court packing that Roosevelt tried to do back in the thirties when the Supreme Court was not supporting his new deal policies and he wanted to expand the court there's already talk now on the left\nOf expanding the number of justice is from nine to eleven so when a Democratic president is is is in the White House he can put her she can put a more left wing or is up there to redress what they see as the imbalance in the court tilting to the\nRight well that's not going to happen for another six years at least\nKnow what do you see and and the other thing too there is talk and it was congressman Adler my congressman who was talking about impeaching Kavanaugh if the Democrats get control of the house of representatives\nThat's never been done if never admitted on what grounds ... what do you think that would stop them that would stop them no not at all but there's no grounds to impeach him\nKnow and if they impeach him then why why stop at him why not in a peach Clarence Thomas to dredge up all the Anita Hill stuff try to take a bus down I wouldn't put it past the Democrats to try to do that\nYou know I think that ... Ginsberg may have done something a ... and her family in her early years\nWow when you talk about the partisan ship\nOf of Brett Kavanaugh how can you possibly be fair and rule on anything that uh the left wing brings before the court what about Ruth Bader Ginsburg who came out publicly and said she couldn't imagine this country if Trump were elected president how possibly if if some of the issues surrounding Trump get to the Supreme Court how could she possibly rule fairly\nFairly when we know that she was against terrified that Trump would be elected president\nThe scenario that uh I've heard is that there's going to be one state may be a state like Mississippi mhm that says we want to ban all abortions right than that\nThere now and the other thing too is that it may be you know and that's a way very rural area that maybe the driver was just unfamiliar with that road and thought that you know it was going to continue and he ends up in a a a T intersection\nRight well they've been complaining about that intersection for a long time and nothing was done about it so anyway twenty people killed in that a little accent really terrible terrible terrible [noise]\nFlags are spending your evening with our ... morning show catch just for a brand new one burning Michael Riddle in the morning you Maro from six to fend on seven then a couple of you or [noise] [noise]\nEverybody you know Joe coming up at nine forty my friend Harvey fire seeing is going to be joining us everybody now our big fires the\nHome great RVs the best character oh he's a terrific guy talks like that all the time right absolutely that's\nThe way he talks and by the way you wouldn't think I ... I guess out of time has a beautiful singing voice he got no don't last he does he does I saw him in a revival fiddler on the roof he was terrific\nAnd he's got it as a revival on Broadway of his landmark play tort song trilogy which won the Tony Award back in Nineteen eighty one or eighty two I Believe and\nIt was a very early I'm openly gay play on Broadway and it's been revived now with a Mercedes rule very funny playing a Harvey is a ... the mother figure\n... female character lot doesn't it doesn't have low fell him a side\nYes famously in the hairspray and that's when he played the mother and hairspray when it seems that\nThere's this move voice\nDoesn't it's not exactly Johnny Mathis okay but [laughter] I mean he's got that gravelly voice but he hits all the notes how do you get a voice like that well we'll ask that book\nIs radio so you're going to hear that voice coming up at nine forty you don't want to miss the wonderful Harvey ... he's been a friend of mine for a long long time just a great guy very very funny characters yeah very\nI mean he yeah he writes he sings he acts well the dancing and he's not bad not bad but you know\nIs there I don't think he would make a claim to being prejudiced or anywhere I was going to be here at nine forty just a couple of a kind of fun little notes here so did you see this as a CNN reporter her name is Caitlin Collins right now we know that CNN is you know they're on the left and she's probably on the left to but she had to apologize yes for some tweets\nThat she put out when she was in college homophobic tweets so here's one uh that she put out the\nTweets in question were posted by her in two thousand eleven she said I D K if I Want a room with a lesbian\nI decay believes if I don't know I don't know if I Want to ruin the lesbian\nAnd she used the word I don't know can we use this word on a ... not there is that can use the F. word for homosexuals on there I don't know ... well you know a media where do we mean there anyway she's that we're too so she has apologized if anyone was offended by those tweets she says when I was in college I used ignorant language in a few tweets to my friends\nIt was immature but it doesn't represent the way I feel at all I regret it and apologize ... I'd like to see her try to ask Donald Trump the question\n[laughter] hey aren't\nYou the one who said all those homophobic things back in college and that would be fun\nThe other thing too is this was a warning to young people out there absolutely everything that you write on social media is there forever if you do you may change but that's always going to follow you\nThis is why despite ... constant urging me to get on social media I Am very reluctant I've never been tweeting or instead of posting or Instagram ... or any of those kinds of things that people do out there because I don't want any of that stuff coming back to haunt me one day\nWell we have your radio podcast so that's all there [laughter] at the end by\nLetter of resignation in the afternoon and W ho just wants to be on this show I'm finished\nWhat we do become a big Broadway producer do you know what Michael ... fed back on W O R those\nCrazy left wing lunatics out that's a good man Brett Kavanaugh one boy and I we had to buy a Broadway [laughter]\nHey speaking or by tweeting here's something I don't know ... Stephen ... a writer will ever regretted his name as aerial do loss he writes for the Steven cold air show he bragged on Twitter quote that\nWe're ruined Brett Kavanaugh's life at least we're ruined Brett Kavanaugh's life with all the attacks that cold there launched on Kevin does it All right\nI think the left wing has gone\nNot so much in well they aren't saying but they've also turned vicious maniacal bent on the destruction of Republicans were going into some dangerous territory with the left did you see those women clawing literally clawing at the door of the Supreme Court\nListen to this this is what it sounds like [noise]\nI don't listen to this protester this this was ... [noise]\nI got no end [laughter] right well\nI think I think the uh uh politicians the Democrats you now you think I'm over plane this but I think they will one tried to impeach Kavanaugh at some point if they get control the house of representatives and I said this months ago\nThat if they lose the court if the court tilts too far right they're going to agitate for court packing are going to expand the number of justices when the Democrats in the White House so they can appoint some liberals they're going to expand the court from nine to ... or at least they're gonna try to now I think you have to get sixty votes in the Senate to do that because it is in the concerts\nThat's a long way down the road ... I think what the president said on Saturday is true that the Democrats have now turned into an angry mob ... he's pretty good at taking a simple phrase and explaining a complicated situation they are an angry mob right now\nAnd every time he talks they get angrier and angrier and he knows he no yes he knows he is that red flag in front of the liberal\nAnd the other thing too he was talking about the so called mocking of Dr Ford ... he said he knew he did it deliberately because it would wake up people or I Would wake up people and to to what was going on and he thinks that helped sway the votes in the Senate confirmation\nNow we have seen over the weekend polls tightening Republicans now solidifying leads are gaining on democratic challengers\nIn some of these key states that Trump one where the Democrats think they have a chance to get some house seats and even ascendancy I think Heidi Heidi Heitkamp there in South Dakota is a not long for this world\nI think are liberal listeners out there the the ... supporters out there going a little wacko right now\nI get I bet you they're screaming at the radio is is the best thing or they didn't\nThey didn't expect that they thought what's great is that the Supreme Court fight has energized the left you have to defeat trumping the Republicans they didn't bank on the fact that the rate has been energized too because what they see in the attack on Capitol is the prelude to the impeachment of\nDonald Trump if he uh yes you too now becomes real of women\nWomen can women still support Trump can women still support Republicans then the Democrats will say no I'm ... what did they call I'm Susan calling an anti feminist yeah anti feminist because she did not a vote against capital\nJust remember there are a lot of women who have brothers sons and has been and I wonder how they would feel if someone came out and accuse their brother their son or their husband of a sexual misconduct that can't be proven I think women have great concern on that front\nTurned those are wonderful a beautiful rolling hills of America into a Trump golf courses [laughter]\nSo that's where they are protesting the land is not here today he is a I did\nNot know lend is a big supporter of indigenous people's day he's out there celebrating with his tribe which I don't know what is he a member of the ... Cox out there and\nHe could he could be a member of accelerate ground we were just shouldn't talk on the fourteenth green maybe then I anyway lens\nOut here but I'm joined by Joe Bartlett it is Columbus Day little a bit later in the program we're going to be checking in with Alice stocked interesting I actually kind of curious about this show I really wonder how Italian Americans feel about this um\nAnger at Columbus Day this uh this desire to call it indigenous people's day uh you know to not celebrate\nBullying treatments have Christopher Columbus look what almost happened to the Columbus Circle yeah they want to take down the great to have to take\nDown the center yeah but yeah I think Italian Americans are very proud of Columbus still and they were fight to keep the day called Columbus Day\nWell it's a it's a good day for the Italians that get the parade\nUm all of the politicians will ... you know that despite his progressive philosophy I think one was not coming out against Columbus Dayton rally exactly you know and um and mayor de Blasio he'll be there to\n... well you got to celebrate it too because when the Italian American point of view\nI think of think of what Columbus did think of the bravery of sailing out him to see when you know he thought the world might be flat you might fall off\nUp to the bravery it took for him to not discover the rest of the world because it was there but to open the rest of the world up to the Europeans very exciting we should salute them all ride leading off our big three today\nBrett Kavanaugh is no longer judge Kavanaugh he is justice cabin on the left has gone out of their minds Klein at the door of the Supreme Court county and\nI'm going to be horrible home I got just wait till you see what he\nDoes our turn Ravi way that's coming it's coming it's coming and also terrible terrible news from upstate New York a limo crashed killing twenty people Eighteen of them were in this limo to wear bystanders are the worst crash I Believe Joe since two thousand nine in this country\n... including plane crashes\nIncluding plane crashes yeah All right let's get the latest on this horrific crash from Jessie McKinley the New York times bureau chief up in Albany good morning Jesse ... good All right so bring us up to date what is what's the very latest you're having this crash\nWell the NTSB is looking at it obviously in New York state police just looking at it detailed have been eager to say the least uh you know at this point as you pointed out we've got Eighteen dead inside dilemma a couple of people on the ground a NTSB is promising about five days out at the same but I think\nThe betting money is going to be on looking at both the driver as well as the vehicle itself to see if there was a mechanical problems or the or the driver was impaired or or had any sort of medical conditions are once again\nYou know we don't have much at this point I'm ... except you know they're kind of human tragedy of all of these you know young people in their twenties and thirties who hopped into a limo expecting kind of a nice afternoon on Saturday and ah and paints a\nJessie can you describe that the intersection for me I Believe the limo would have been coming down a hill\nYeah there is a it's basically to country highways intersect that she um and the one in which the limit was traveling was you know it it was a great it's not as I said to someone yesterday ... alpine skiing you know this is not a forty five degree angle but it is a very steady in a decline from\nYou know the rage over ... into into the intersection and one can imagine that if something happened to the car or something happens the driver coming down that incline over a couple of hundred feet or maybe even a thousand feet it would it would build up quite a head of state so that would be a dangerous situation\nYou know as an amateur investigator here I Know we have the national Transportation Safety board are going to look at everything analyze it very scientifically but you've got to think this is either a something that involves the driver\nWho had no clue what he was doing or a medical issue perhaps or some sort of mechanical failure on the part of the vehicle because you would not go into a T bone intersection at that rate of speed and all things being equal correct\nNo absolutely I mean I think the NTSB are worth of everything as well start police but\nUm you know I absolutely you would be breaking pretty heavily coming down this incline anyway and and to hit it at you know witnesses put it at sixty those sorts of things are always a little bit [noise] uh you know squishy but ... ... it had to be going to have significant rate of speed the cause of the amount of damage and\nAlso keep in mind that safely said yesterday that most of these\n... people inside limbo\nDidn't survive impact so we're talking about a a a ... a very heavy vehicle that must have been traveling a pretty good clip\nOr in order to cause that that that range from death that quickly\nAnd Jesse tell us about the people in the limo four sisters I Believe and they were celebrating or one of the sister's birthday and she was recently married\nYeah it's I mean just in terms of the human cost of this it was pretty terrible one time we lost four sisters and the last two brothers or at least two of these couples were or inter married you know they they have kids um there were cousins in in in in the vehicle\nUm so it was really a a gang that that you are reporting showed you know there were a tight knit group that works out for a Saturday afternoon\nUm and then of course there were two bystanders who are just going out on a you know Columbus Day weekend to you know by some tokens or moments or something at a at a at a store and and we're we're hit as well so it you know just in terms of randomness of this and the and the and the human toll toll it's it's just pretty costly\nIt is if it's horrific and uh uh do you know if the NTSB it's going to do another briefing usually pretty good about this process in the first one they don't really tell you anything the second one they have a just a little bit more information to\nGive it did help us make sense of this I think that's what people are trying to do and how ... how do we Eighteen people in the car to people are walking down the street guy you know you got to tell us something\nYeah I talked to a state police is ... sort of bracing say I think there was the lead agency at this point you know that you mentioned plane crashes it is remarkable that the last\nThe last time we have this many people killed ... was two thousand nine and that was fifty people end up playing outside buffalo [noise] um and I've covered your minor plane crashes as well as NTSB you know they they take their time you're not going to have an answer today or tomorrow\nThe state police will probably brings us today will have a little bit more to say\n... Jessie I saw some pictures you took a over the weekend when you were there and a really poignant one of the ... this kid mark I think and then a hair brush they already up with a brush\nYup yeah that was it was yesterday afternoon in the ground there was littered you know there there were still you could kind of sensitive to the the\nImpact you know the force of the impact of skid marks were probably ... feet long it had landed right in this this sharp golly had landed pretty quickly and obviously the impact of drift off parts of the parts the car you know pursue a limo you know you had a wheel kind of been better than the mud you had\nI saw bracelet I saw her brush and mental I saw that to the deaths of mirrors you know it it all the way it was a was a terrible say\nAnd do you know how long they were in this ... before the crash I Know they were headed to Cooperstown they probably had quite a ways to go from here to Cooperstown right so how how long do you do if you know were they in the ... before that crash\nWell we don't know yet and then it's back to the information on the limo company and the limo driver and that may have been one of those same have been have been non existent at this point to have something to\nBe taking into today you know there there was a report I read the soaring that that perhaps had a couple of wineries before they were heading to three percent which would make sense\nTo you or I don't yeah ...\n... that's why you hire a limo so you don't drive drunk\nNo absolutely and um so so you know ... will be trying to reconstruct how that day developed and and and how to end it obviously um in our reporting to the\nAlright Jesse McKinley Albany bureau chief for the New York times thanks for your reporting hosting a\nSpecial I guess I I think there's going to come down to the driver yeah I think it's going to be the driver\nYeah probably I mean you do not go zipping down that hill now and not stop and apparently he just went right through that T bone intersection\nNow I mean you would think you'd have GPS that would tell you you know turn right in five hundred feet or something I I don't know but I'm the if I had to guess now and you know I guess I have the privilege of doing that I Would say it's gonna be a driver Mm\nYeah we still we still don't know anything about the driver but uh I don't know I'd never felt I never thought those things were safe those big extended limousines\nAnd then you put in a driver who who may or may not be ...\nExactly I was in the area and now I'm just terrible All right hey when we come back we've got some celebrity news for you guess who already wants to get out of jail\n[laughter] I'm not going to do that but as a celebrity in jail and he wants to be out\nAnd Taylor Swift is getting political ow\n[noise] glad you're spending your evening with our replay of this morning show catches for a brand new Len Burman and Michael read all in the morning tomorrow from six to ten I'm

Supreme Court justice after being sworn in tonight he thanked President Trump\nLean towards the uh um Pocahontas wing of the Democratic party at and I just love being a young Little Women\nWell but let's hope they're not voting age [laughter] I must not have been probably are those events probably are not a voting ha tell me about rose McGowan she's got some interesting stuff stuffed\nSay in the hash tag ...\nYeah no rose McGowan actually was the woman who really began the me too movement because she was the first two accused Harvey Weinstein right raping her and him and that started the me too movement but now uh she was one of the most vocal supporters now says it's nothing but be\nAsked me to move me too movement is be asking what does she mean by that can she elaborate on that first\nYeah she says I'm a I was just thinking there I Can't even say that word\nThey're not champ they're losers these are the two are supportive I don't like them she told a British newspaper I don't want to go because it's all be as it's a band aid lied to make them feel better I Know these people I Know they're literally liver and as long as it looks good on the surface that's good enough for them\nSo basically what she's accusing them of just\nComing out in supporting me too but\nNot really believing what is behind it\nAh she um claims also uh she's facing a cocaine possession charges she claims that that was planted by a ... an operative\nUh let's see she also says she's a little odd she's she's rescinded her years of support for Clinton ... as she believes it's not possible for a Democrat to be a as clueless as the Clintons were with wind steam\nWow that's a good point because we know that they collected a lot of money yeah from Harvey Weinstein and you know that because anybody who knew about show business knew about all the rumblings about Harvey has trouble with women to\nBe the spark for me to says it's BS very interesting alright rose McCown\nOrganizers renting

Democrats say their bases all fired up\nAnd they're going to turn out in the midterms and they're gonna do after those Republicans but I think and a lot of other shrewd political analysts think that the Republicans are just as ginned up about this that they see the attack on cabinet as a prelude to the attack to the impeachment\nOf Donald Trump so I don't know what are you guys think it's going to be the dams on top of the midterms are the Republicans finally fired up themselves one eight hundred three two one zero seven ten let's go to a to Bob in Pennington New Jersey morning Bob\nBob Bob

I think the Dems will run against her\nBut uh she's very well entrenched\nI've seen and I think she's going to survive and we we got thirty seconds a Bob Menendez in New Jersey is he in jeopardy\nI think so I'm a you know uh I mean in the end that's a that's a very blue state and again these are going to be out there also a lot of house races in in New Jersey where a lot of a ... Democrats think they can take two three four seats but uh but then there's this blemish ... men Menendez has a lot of scars and I'm\nA I Would not put that solidly in the Democratic camp but this is one of those races that could really be an upset at the same time the Democrats take two three four seats back in the house of from Republicans\nAll right Steve Roberts ABC News political analyst thanks a lot Steve appreciate it okay when we come back we've got some entertainment news for you Mitch McConnell leads the new character and Saturday Night live I thought it was actually it was funny and I got to give it its ally ... we'll we'll we'll be talking about that plane a bit of that and is Lady Gaga\nGoing to go home with an Oscar my hunch yes indeed\nGlad you're spending your evening with our replay of this morning show catches for a brand new Len Burman and Michael read all in the morning tomorrow from six to ten I'm seven ten W O R\nSolo getting the right pillow and there is nothing like my pillow discuss that special patented\nIt gives you better support you sleep better you fall asleep faster it feels a lot different from any other pillows for a couple of months to get used to once you do you'll never go back\nTo regular ... thirty five million people are using my pillow clothing me it really does make a difference if you've been thinking about doing right now they got a special deal [noise] buy one get one free just use the promo code job we\nHope you're enjoying this re winds up today is Len Burman and Michael ... in the morning we'll be back with a new show tomorrow from six to than on seven send the wor\nAt a very good Monday morning in Columbus Day everybody I don't know if it's gonna be a great the weather for the parade today Joe\nIt may improve you think may improve the plate where's the prey does it end or start around Columbus Circle I don't I mean I I Know you're Irish but your wife is Italian yes but that doesn't mean much and I bet you are um I I Can't see marching any parades\nSt Patrick's Day I've done a while that I could invalidate ... I can see that you know they that statue about\nColumbus up there in Columbus Circle is an interesting fact that I Know uh-huh so for many years the statue was up there on the pillar running during middle Columbus Circle somebody does I think back in the Nineteen eighties noticed in pictures taken over\nDecades since the statue was erected\nThat Columbus was actually facing in different directions\nWhat you mean to change it was changing no ... Columbus was changing facing in different directions so the city went up there and they discovered that the statue of Columbus was never anchored to the Hillary\nWow so the rumble of the traffic the vibrations all these years\nWe've made Christopher Columbus Ohio wow and you can see pictures of him looking east\nWest south because whoever record them up there they forgot to put the nails and to keep his feet type that's crazy red line when he ... he was ... up there all these years is slowly turning around you've got you know it's a nice view up there the city so campaign ... didn't fall damage collapsing on some Italian American\nBut a parade does that take place on Fifth Avenue and they marched between a from forty third to have any second straight up to Seventy saying you know we are welcome but don't they gathered Columbus Circle\nYou know and have some ... have some key anti anti bottled kicks off at a at twelve might\nPlay into every ethnic stereotype bike has hit American\nAvenue is not going to go by Columbus but I always thought you I mean it's the Columbus Day parade for heaven's sakes you got to gather round the statue of Christopher Columbus out well maybe it'll be facing east and you can see them on\nFor that [laughter] [laughter] I had a good view\nSo Saturday live opened a kind of a funny opening would\nThey'd GOP senators celebrating Kavanaugh's when any Republican locker rooms snapping towels and down and Bruce skis\nWe now go live to data bash who's with Senate Republicans [laughter]\nPart of you for [laughter]\n\nHit any\nDisplay that that is right near a\nPacemaker is being [laughter]\nI live in the poll a video\nUp on seven ten W.

yep yep\nHundred and twenty five million dollars eighty million alone here in America a movie that got got one star or no stars from the critics does eighty million dollars\nIn all the critics are the people who bought bear to go in and they let him when I got to be you know what the critics I don't pay any attention to critics\nNobody pays attention to critics that is a dead end job these days folks\nNow it's not a star is born I really want to see that a matter of fact I may go this afternoon\nOh well that did pretty well too you know not as well as venom venom but it took in forty two point six million dollars which is good for a movie that is not about action hero that's about real people\nAnd you have a lot of good buzz about Lady Gaga there's a lot of talk about Lady Gaga certainly be nominated for the Oscar but very likely winning the Bradley Cooper too because he directed the movie so good for a Lady Gaga\nWe're glad you're spending your evening with our ... morning show just for a brand new my mom and Michael ... in the morning tomorrow from six to seven Ben wor\nNew York's most most of the Fox they rated number\nOne seven ten W O R voice of New York and\nWell

can't make it up it's awesome hey Alice what do you get yeah\nWhere where do you stand on this do you call the indigenous peoples there you still are Christopher Coney Island\nYeah oh God no no no I I agree with the woman you that list and\nThe like the whole staff will like the whole controversy over slavery and we have to remember the game the time that these things took place a lot of it or that things but he still explored it still open up the west show you you just got to take it\n... which for taking history out of context constantly trying to find that to our times oh I you know so I that's kind of where I Am I I don't think we can just say Christopher Columbus day later my husband and I and and it's probably listening along with my mother in law so I'm going to go with cold on that\nShow how well it all on that that's right well I think what he did I didn't really watch and we had\nItalian Americans are very proud rightfully so of Christopher Columbus when they have resisted this indigenous people's day\nYeah I don't think there's ...\nAnd ... we're going to take out all the statute across an hour and we're going to stop all the parade and but we do need to recognize what happened in what he was and let's talk about other explorers at that time and what happened and just things that they get while still making discoveries that we would have never known about\nYeah how can pump family own when he gave us the founder you so yeah\nThere you go All right Alice factored\nRossellini happy Columbus Day and by the way happy\nColumbus take it Columbus ohio not celebrating Columbus Day is really\nNot as ... but I but ... they're not do it because it's indigenous people's day they're doing it because what I Want to celebrate Veterans Day instead that day off it's a cop out yeah you're probably not really confronting the issue\nIf they want it to you you could give the employees both days off you could yeah but um I look at who gets Columbus Day off anyway unless you're a federal worker now I've never heard of Columbus Day off people are going to go to work today\nYeah and most people apparently according to else's reporting have no idea this Columbus Day or indigenous people's day I\nDon't know that some of this political correct stuff is running amok you can't put all the sins of the white man on poor old Christopher Columbus wasn't even a very good navigator he didn't get going anywhere it's\nTrue [laughter] I got it wrong about but I said I'm Glad he did we got us\nThat live up there in Columbus Circle of a guy who had no clue where it was just like bumped into an island hey this looks good while he was trying to get over to Asia I think he thought he could get the but nobody had any idea there's this big bang cold well it wasn't called America but the this continent was ... was in the way I mean yes and he didn't even get here you got\nTo where he got the islands in the you got the anti oh well let's take a a Larry Larry's calling about Columbus Day Larry from Cranford New Jersey more Hillary very quickly what's your what's your thoughts in Columbia\nGood morning guys you know what nobody should be given a day off and he ... Columbus Day or a lot of these others to go out with the President's Day and so on the post office was almost out of business there were only reason they're in business and sticky pensions going yeah they could be working today I'm Sorry yeah\nAll right Larry thank you know the federal government gets an awful lot of holidays they certainly do and the you know nobody's going to take them back\nBut they probably want Columbus Day on Monday an indigenous people down Tuesday so they have a four day work\nWe create a new holiday for indigenous people what would you call it I don't know pick a day become under the new one off TB Tuesday [laughter] I'm On Tuesday that probably\nGo get me in a little bit of trouble either I I think we got an honor Christopher Columbus his bravery is a great that great thing and human nature to be curious about the world and explore exactly to go out and explore and that's what and that's what he did and that's where all the explores did and many of them of course died in the process of doing it\nYeah absolutely wasn't an easy route that he took right and also I don't really believe that somehow there was this\nGarden of Eden that was America when the Indians were new Native Americans were here before the Europeans came that it was all wonderful and great the tribes were fighting each other we're scalping each other there was a lot of ugly stuff going on there were all living in perfect harmony\nYes had Christopher Columbus or um explorers never reached\nAmerica something else would have happened but\nWell third of history for ... yeah well exactly I mean you know what if somebody else came right ... and we wouldn't we wouldn't be the country we are\nAfter it hits the Florida Panhandle it's going to veer little east\nAnd go back into the Carolinas with more rain\nOh they already got had once they are absolutely soaked both of the Carolinas or so from Hurricane Florence\nWhile you were just down there right yeah notice did you notice the ah well the image\nI I I was a Hilton Head which is farther south and it didn't really get impacted by Florence but further north and in northern parts of South Carolina when I was leaving like almost two weeks ago we were still having flooding issues wow\nSo this could just add more real and I absolutely yeah so it became Michael headed to the pan handle anything it's going to be or rent\nWell landfall as early as Wednesday morning and um it's probably gonna be hurricane by the time because Florida\n... All right well we'll keep an eye out for it All right when we come back or the Democrats becoming anti Israel very interesting story in the New York times that say some of those hard core left these in the Democratic party are anti Israel some of them I Wonder if they're drifting to anti Semitism [noise]\nThis is a ... to today's Len Burman and Michael legal in the morning catch them live tomorrow from six built in on seven ten W all our\nBeer joined us rewind today is Len Burman and Michael real in the morning we'll be back with a new show tomorrow from things still than on seven ten W ho\nHey it's Columbus Day a land is off of Joe Bartlett is with me this morning if you're just joining us now do\nYou think land is honoring the age of exploration or do you think he's exploring the twelfth the whole Gulf War Sunday\nHe's exploring the inside of his eyeballs and sleeping [laughter]\nGood ... good morning everybody our big three today well\nJudge Kavanaugh is now justice cabinet and he was confirmed to the United States Supreme court on Saturday very dramatic moment I watched the whole thing did you catch a ...\nSome of it I mean it kind of you knew what was going to happen after Susan Collins so she's going to vote yes on friday\nI Know but just to see all the senators they're having to stand up and say no or ... down say yes they say yes but I say hey\nYou know get up and say hey yeah\nCollins gave I thought a very fine speech outlining why she chose to vote for Brett Kavanaugh\nOr she did very very well now the Democrats of course say they're going to spend up to well they've already pledged three million dollars to try to defeat her but she's pretty popular ... I think she's going to be okay and you're from there ... or ... ... ah well gee you know I think she gave that\nIt doesn't matter which way she was going to go because she's ten points behind in the in South Dakota I think so she probably is not going to beat her Republican challenger\nWell and that's true but she could have helped herself a little bit don't you think\nI think ah somebody said she's toast either way okay um so\nThere you go and give it up ... fold down on the sword\nId Heidi whoa whoa whoa we'll be out of their own mansion the only Democrat who voted the only one of them in West Virginia which is about as red as it\nGets the but is there a deal at Trump stays out of West Virginia and\nThen it'll be interesting to see how aggressively the Republicans pursue Joe ... Mitch McConnell Senate majority leader was asked uh how we felt about mansion he said look we still want to win seats in the Senate but you could tell that he was not the American idol some blood lust you go after ... Joe Manchin so I have a feeling Joe mentioned maybe going back to the United States Senate\nYup okay this is I mean look he seems like a decent guy yeah I think so yeah\nAlso in the bakery terrible terrible news coming from upstate New York the limo crash over the weekend Eighteen people people in the limo were killed two bystanders were killed when the limo driver plowed right through eight she junction coming down\nA hill and just I apparently did not stop and just went right into this parking lot uh and and kill the two innocent bystanders and we found out from Jessie McKinley\nIs the New York times reporter covering it that most of the people in the limo four sisters were dead on the impact so that it had to be going fast\nHeartbreaks them and these are for young sisters owned their thirties their husbands all killed a couple of them had kids\nAnd um they were celebrating the birthday of the youngest one we've just been married in June and they did the right thing they were going to some wineries obviously you don't want to drink and drive yeah so you get somebody to drive you and um it ends and tragedy\nWell there's a report that they were had a van originally but for some reason the van couldn't they couldn't get the band so they got this limo instead was a bus a boss will take down a parent's right to bust broke down but so they got the ... I think those limos are deaf traps if you ask me I'm an I'm\nA ... and we we do have them do you want to hear this this is one of the uh the sister her sister was killed in the limo crash\nRight Purina Hulsey yeah let's see what ... who she was on good morning America\nSaw her last Saturday on her and my mom always feel split on plant shop and Vermont and we had just a really nice pay out together [noise]\nMhm well that's a Corina ... my wife and long hair to fulfill that I've ever read now\nOh gosh Sunni heartbreak yeah the worst uh accident ... including plane crashes since two thousand nine in this country and it's\nWorse when I was a plane crash in Buffalo that killed a lot more people\nYeah aren't a rounding out the big three it is Columbus Day or indigenous people's day some people who don't like Christopher Columbus had to say but Joe and I well he we hear W. R. we think it should be Columbus Day now and forever\nFor ever that's my feeling now with digital ... and look at it is a Columbia Columbus did what we can go back and read disease and destroy the Indians that's what he did discovered a great country while began the process that got us here\nRight I don't know how great it was back then apparently it wasn't you know they were eating you know bird seed in berries\nShe's magic ... just mentioned the vegetation that that existed when these people landed on this continent that's true yeah I took a lot of ... I mean how many people ... first of all they died along the way people died when they came here wasn't easy\nYeah and it was not the garden of eating you know the left with like you to believe that all before Columbus before though the west before Europeans discovered the content of America it was a wonderful place where everybody lived in peace and harmony and ran make it through the forest\nYeah no it's not the gardens I was kind of fun to me about it [laughter] hey that's\nSomething I wanted to get into this as a stray that caught my attention in the New York times now I'm a very big supporter hardcore supporter of the state of\nIsrael one of the perhaps the only democracy there in the middle east in great country had been two times or I Love the Israelis I Love the spirit of the place you know they they literally the Jews made the desert bloom when they got Israel and the farms and great stuff but now there's a wave of anti Israel sentiment", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "year": "2018", "city": "New York", "day": "09"}
