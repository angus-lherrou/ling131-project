diligence\nApparently she had a real life fiance once and she cheated on him when I go ... ... and she claims to have supernatural affairs at least twenty\nGhosts we gotta get that other guy on the

crazy\nWhat what have you seen on the subway ghosts ghost yeah people with sheets on their hands oh maybe to de\n... not a normal thing you see sheets on there and have you been on a subway there's some odd stuff happening now in\nTheir heads is is concerning no I haven't seen anything quite like that in my share of disturbing things yeah subway but\nFor people who go there no snow no I haven't seen claim there goes you've never around going to move or something like that or Caspar the friendly ghosts hopefully and they are friendly they offer you fruit snacks okay\nBecause otherwise you get the Ghostbusters on that and things get messy of ... they're not\nThe most recent goes bust so that that movie was terrible I didn't see it exactly because it was terrible and said either everyone just said it was terrible so I Would I watch it okay not not female empowering market has nothing to do with the female Ghostbusters [laughter] it was a terrible movie ...\nPlastic bags filled with the urine is a huge issue so called Pomona College in California\nI just like to read the headlines and get your shock factor that apparently a the college is having problems they're finding urine all over the floors in the bathrooms\nAnd then it doesn't just can you figure that's the first part of our guys miss it happens whatever but no people are ... in garbage cans in the dorms and they found plastic bags with urine inside the garbage weird like\nWhat has to happen to you to be that desperate that you can't just walk\nTo the bathroom now it's a it's not get\nIs that so you think it's one

that I was an avid again Pomona bonus nobody can tell on our college you know if you go home for Thanksgiving and near ... starts talking about Pomona College you say I've heard and I found something odd yeah well now you busted them\nExactly right or is that was that the whole roll yeah that's\nIt that's all I got so many meals strange for you on this Halloween\nAlright a producer mark we're going to run out gets braces soon\nAbsolutely where it's at Washington Square park there you can make it in the next nine minutes\nI'm not going to make not a tech a come back at your set for tomorrow and what we got coming up on the show some exciting thing sports on with the McCarthy on the voice of New York seven ten wor\n...\nR soy down with the McCarthy\nTomorrow night on the show a we'll have a long time NFL writer\nGary Myers in Studio ... big Mets fan to swell up some fun talking to a baseball with him as well as the jets the giants go around the league or the jets here is a must win game this Sunday against the Miami Dolphins the jets down to three and five overall this year or they get the bills the week after so\nI'm a little bit of room for a hope if they could somehow go down to Miami win a game they can take down buffalo five and five it to buy a week and then they get the patriots in or they could give you a uh a couple more weeks\nIt's a meaningful football around here but they lose their son it adopted all of a sudden\nThere was a tie breaker to Miami having lost both games against them or they would need just a a ton of things they basically need to run the table to make the playoffs wouldn't be realistic so a huge game for the jets and they banged up in a way that you just\nDon't see a whole lot in this is a team that was largely healthy ah after training camp in for the most part the first few weeks of the season right artist may with a bang up but they may problems Barry injury report now\nQuincy anew and walk Robbie Anderson ... born Neal Sterling ... Lyndon Frankie Luke Kevin beer Louis ... Johnson they all in practice today than\nSpencer Long markets make helping beecham Jordan Jenkins they were limited and er James carpet or trend can and dealing with a thing or two as well and there's a couple of players they're like special teams but for the most part\nThe starters news Jed steam you've got to starting white out better hurts a starlings by quite a bit of tight end the both of their quarterbacks are on there as your markets may one of their safety\nIs a mess right now for the jets health wise so they're not in a good place going into this game and I'll tell you what they're up at the blonde better take it as a challenge to deal with Miami because the divorce and got their butts kicked a last time they face the dolphins earlier this year up here in New York so\nUh that's something you know jets are going to have to figure out how to get them Donald a little bit of time and\nAdopted or a decent team and they're coming up a long week is well planned on Thursday Night Football or so you know somehow some way of just going to have to figure things out and it can't be well it's good enough I like the ... the camaraderie the way people came to come up\nThis week against Miami there are no moral victory exotic or what happens in this game it's a division rival you got to find a way to win this game and short of that and there's nothing there's a positive spin\nBut at the same time we love to pay off our house and um so we're not sure what the best movies and if it financially responsible to do one or the other and I'm wanting to get your opinion [noise] um\nWell I mean typically a Christian school is a private school and there's going to be more expensive and then the question you've got to say is if we go that route it pays off our home in\nSeven years if we go the other route it pays off our home in three years is it worth four more years or whatever the number is you just run your numbers out I just made those up okay\nBut in other words this is going to delay the mortgage being paid off if you go the more expensive school route in order to get that world view which is fine and I'm no I I Will tell you having educated a paid for the education for three kids that are now adults\nAnd having participated in this discussion a multitude of times with friends that are Christians and and we are obviously to um [noise] that you need to be very careful if you're going to invest in a a a a private Christian school that they are actually implementing that belief system\nThere are some that have a Christian heritage that are no more matching with my value system that fly to the moon\n[laughter] just ... they once had something that was Christian and and sometimes they still holding themselves out as Christian schools but the values that they're tenured professors are bringing into the classroom at nothing to do with the values of miles hold\nAnd show if I'm going to do that I might have if I Will be on the enemy territory I might as well know that I'm On the enemy territory instead of a wolf in sheep's clothing kind of thing so if you're going to invest make sure you're getting what you're\nAttempting to get here I'm not saying that can't be done and can be done there are great Christian schools that do a great job of a quality education with\nThe quality value system but you just gotta make sure you can't just assume because such and such was a Baptist school or such and such with Presbyterian\nBut that might have been many years ago and there and you know they've got that in their heritage but there are no more than fly to the moon anymore um and so\nYou know that then you just pay for an expensive school with a questionable quality you know so they're not the second part of the equation as this and this is not the challenge you it's just a kid help you with your critical thinking and you decide which one you want to do in the process my three kids and sharing and I all went to\nUniversity of Tennessee a public state school\nWhich there is some bizarre stupid but stuff that happens on the campus\n[laughter] okay I mean crazy and some of those professors are proof ten years should not be there you know I mean there is some nut burgers running around over there\nMy university's campus okay and I love University of Tennessee but there's some stuff happening over there that just make your hair curly you know so my kids went there though but here's the thing we figured out that our kids spiritual walk was not based on what happened at school it was based on what happened at home\nOkay and so our kids plugged into young life while they were in a public university setting and they already had their values and backbone and apologetic established because\nOf how they were raised inside the rambling house so they were equipped to go into\nThat environment and not quote unquote lose their salvation in the process now I'm not saying no Ramsey kid ever did anything stupid I can promise you randomly kids Ramsey are pretty much known for having done some stupid at one time or not [laughter] but but uh but but you know I I you know you can do that and a Christian school too you know that right\n[noise] right yeah ... right off campus is a bar\n[laughter] every one of those and so you can go get do you can go get just as drunk at a Christian schools you can in their states goes all that to say I I don't eat there is no bubble that protects them like your home does\nThe preparation you give them at your kitchen table is their insurance policy is their fire insurance policy it's not you know the name of the door of the school but that's not to say you should never do ... I think it's perfectly fine as long as you pay cash for it and you're willing to say we're going to be off the mortgage a little slower\nBecause of that and how would investigate and make sure that the values are actually taught in the classroom I put my kids in a private Christian school for two years when they were in uh\nElementary school and I found that some of the teaching they were doing over there and I'm like well this is useless is complete waste of money\nBecause they're just you know just as\nEasy as as a mainstream I mean you know so I figured out it's going to be made that does this this is that I ...\nQuestion I get asked all the time is do I\nNeed life insurance listened the whole point of life insurance was to replace your income for someone who counts on you so if you have a spouse or you have kids yes you need term life insurance is the only way to protect them until you're out of debt and build up your ...\nYour only digging a deeper hole if you waste money on cash value plans says it robs you of their ability to make real progress and that's why I send you to the sand or insurance and I have for Twenty years that's where I get all my insurance and they only offer the plans I recommend it is not expensive it's not complicated\n... will be there as your guide every step of the way visit ... dot com recall eight hundred three five six forty two\nEighty two you need to get this taken care of I can give you the advice and I can tell you where to go but it's really up to you to take an important step to get your family protected\nThat's ... dot com or eight hundred three five six\nForty two eighty two\nHey this is Rachel ... that is always drilled into us that you can buy quality things and they'll get a great deal that's why I Love cats and eat on mattresses packing needle offers amazing that just as for every budget\nAnd now they got a brand new mattress called ... they took their back mattress and made it even better it's incredible tried tested needle for a hundred nights risk free at ... dot com at ... dot com I don't remember it ships for free at CNN dot com\nAir some exciting news simply savers now valued at one billion dollars\nFolks this company used to be just five guys working together now they protect over two million people and here's why simply say ... system is easy to use and takes just minutes to set up there are no contracts are hidden fees and twenty four seven monitoring is only fourteen\nNinety nine a month visit simply say direct dot com my listeners get free shipping and free returns\nThat simply say direct dot com\nThan doubled you are now Dave Ramsey show [noise]\n\n\nEuro for like five five to five job and we'll talk about your life and your money\n... today comes from lines dot com and find out for yourself why blind spots on is the number one online retailer of custom window coverings or\nYou'll get free samples free shipping and with the new promos they run every month you'll save even more used to promote code Ramsey to get the best possible the question is from Brenda in Colorado a she comes to Dave Ramsey dot com and says is dental insurance for my kid I was a gimmick or something I should keep paying\nThe the you know the dirty details so to speak so that's why I think you're going to find the investment is worth that the manager to count is worth it but I it's fair to ask them to show you\nThe typical guy does this or you've been doing this over here but if you had been with us during that same period of time and here's what we would have had you and here's what the ... and and you know what am I drew one and a half percent more what it costs to half a percent street an editor for one that kind of a thing um it's a fair question to say hey prove your worth\nAnd uh I don't think any smart richer pro that we have would um\nTell you that that they can't do that um that they all obviously all believe that they can and then just ask them to show you the question Alex is with us from Charlotte North Carolina Hi Alex welcome to the day Ramsey show\nAnd I are you doing today better than I deserve so what's up\nA book about a quarter in um maybe a better course Gary Coleman about my career uh I'm currently in by but that too\nAnd I'm a welder I worked at a town and I'm Mike around a hundred and forty thousand a year mhm and um I've got opportunity to go work at home but the pay is about a\nOf water on my working out of town and under a curious if you thought it was crazy to take all bought that I'm I'm not married yet I'm getting married next month\nSo you're making a hundred and forty and you'd make like fifty yeah OK at home um my aunt where are you where are you working out of town\nA member going on now come on I'm actually in the world were on um you know my own they own mocking right now I'm On\n... anything other than a flower mhm mhm okay well\nI think the answer for me would always be see none of the above ...

I was writing and writing all of our bills on the dry erase board and all the squares were full like hey I've had enough so it's like I was like hey Dave Ramsey so\nI got online I Googled you and I thought everybody was like read the tell them I make over so it's like we got to go right now by that book\nWe went to the ... Barnes and noble book store and they had one copy less so is divine intervention there we go and then we just went from there I read that both at night and gave it to him\nWell you know she read it in one night while I did leave issue speed reading\nIt was on the couch is there we are actually critical or you know [laughter]\nThat's classic love it very good so you said you're from South Carolina originally but you've moved to Texas now sort of first okay very cool good for you guys so what did you learn in the total when you make over there might be able to do this what's the key to getting out of debt that key is\nTo not listening to other people have to say about what you're doing your own life\nSo we actually kept it a secret in our family they don't really know that we are trying to work hard to pay off debt so we got a lot of a life ... got a lot of all you always need a credit card for an emergency or you're always going to have a car payment nickel normal stuff we try to share\nA little bit of information with people because they were like how did you get through this they wouldn't listen so we just kept its ourselves that I'd say that the the craziest Niger on\nTheir close your ears blinders on and go forward as true you have to not care what other people think that is a big it's so hard to do to a there is if they mean well they are stupid you know I mean they are I realized got family or friends that are that way you know\nThey you know ... you can hear when their voice drops into that as Harley grounds teacher exactly why ... that's that's exactly why do you guys\nSo the key is not listen to other people what are they are the keys to getting out of that\nIt's not going to be brief oh the first thing is getting over beat yourself up over the mess you've made I mean you made a mess and there was time to clean it up that's good a number to\nDo your research are firing books articles watch videos um you know find their personal finance grew really does is for you on that but it sit down and plan and birds you were very competitive people some ... ... oh my go along with it for any married couples teamwork\nYou know it works famous compound interest you know it was a very powerful thing mhm I'm for it a single folks out there working on it\nWhile a couple of things and my first wake up call was when I actually took the time will add up all my debt if he were to ask me how much that I had before I got started it would've been a much lower figure so just seeing all the numbers added up in front of me at they actually were\nTerrified me another wakeup call when I got like ten Ninety nine foreign and seeing that my income to actually do much higher than I thought it was for that\nOf course got me wondering what the heck are they doing like on line three and a lack of early on actually wind I mean a wonderful relationship with them I Believe that free now we are engaged but at the time I knew we're headed in the direction of\nMarriage and that I just didn't want to bring the baggage with me so not long after I heard you mention in a workshop and the welfare shall total money make over\nRead it in a day followed the plant and here I Am\nWow look at that yeah so ... positive influence of the fiance\nAnd and then you go I got I had all this up and you went okay I've got a Google so I got to find somebody and there there there I was in ...\nWell good for you back for a way to God and my gosh\nThey like you know I say you know you feel like these are rain and yeah and do it so much life much more fun now\nYou know ... um yeah what do you tell people to key to get a get out of debt is\nUm for me I think it's worth remembering how fast time flies by and how in a blink of an eye on wake up it will be two years from now and ... you can either be hearing that same condition or a completely different wines so\nFrom a technical from ... from a tactical standpoint what did you do you have to find it for making them by Ted ... and\nI Am I had to work at my numbers often so tied for every dollar I had a little red shade of all my progress in my little projections and not something that you know looking at it every single day reinforced by why and how great to be one day\nYou know as a train or you're you're already teaching goal setting a bad\nYeah\nAnd so just doing that for yourself

community\nThe Ramsey baby steps community will let you joined or if you want jump over there on Facebook or lots of interaction or over a hundred thousand folks in there talking all the time\nOr should we Heather says take out out from that community take out our retirement to pay off our car which still have somewhere for thirty one years old no\nWe never cash out retirement to pay off a debt unless is to avoid bankruptcy or a foreclosure you're not facing either one of those where you would have mentioned that\nYou just want your car paid off here's the problem you pull money out of a four one K. they charge you a ten percent penalty flush your tax rate so if you're on the twenty two percent tax bracket as an example in the year twenty Eighteen\nThat would be a thirty two percent hit on your money so that's the equivalent of saying Dave I Want to borrow money at thirty two percent interest to pay off my car\nAnd the answer would be no that's stupid and show don't cash route retirement no that stupid don't do that unless it's just unless you're ... against the wall and you can't breathe which case maybe you need to sell the car actually if that were the case not\nStill not cash out the retirement but if you're looking down the lens of some kind of a horrible financial situation that would be the only time I would use some retiring considering how hard the government punches you in the face for doing this Christopher is in Los Angeles CRISPR welcome to the day Ramsey show\nAnd they have lied\nBetter than I deserve sir how 'bout you\nGet the same ... thank you well

December she or you know make that one but by the next year what would you say the chances are you're they're fifty fifty Ninety ten what\nI'd say probably fifty fifty sixty forty okay show not very good\nYeah what do you do for a living I'm account manager okay All right um\nI probably would still do it okay because you're not going to you're not going to lose money you're just not going to get the match do they have are off four one K.\nAnd they do then that makes it a no brainer do the raw because Ross four one K. we'll give you the exact same thing as a Roth IRA but you might get the match if you're there\nAnd so definitely do their off and do it there and then if you're not there you didn't lose anything as long as you picked good mutual funds in there and you're spread across the four types of mutual funds that we tell you to use which are grows growth in income aggressive growth and international\nAnd put a force in each of those and picked good mutual funds with long track records and do the raw you should always be rough four one K. any way but in this case it's like double e essential so if you let's say you do the raw and you you get fired November next year and you don't get the match\nYou didn't lose anything you just take that rock and roll it out to a rough IRA and you'll have no taxes and you move on with your next career and everything will be fine

four years old and I'm thirty six where the paid for how ... how I feel\nPretty amazing actually I think you\nTalk about a lot that idea of something relaxing when you don't\nHave any debt that you maybe didn't know was there and I think for us\nThat's been surprising I think I think I academically understood\nBut I Do think that there's a sense of peace they got they I mean you got it right on about financial piece that something relaxing you didn't know was there and all of a sudden we we don't feel like we're at the end we're ... at the beginning I didn't realize baby step seven is a real step for the end we get to actually build wealth and do all kinds of fun things now and I think that's\nWhat I'm most excited about male\nAnd having sex and having kids that are still young ... to know that we can do whatever we want and we're not we're not tied down you know\nWe don't care I mean you're making two forty or you know pay the thirty years'\nTax gr age yeah and I don't\nYou know we had some hard times we did not everything was not easy you know wasn't it wasn't a just a cake walk the whole time but but we uh we worked hard and I think it brought us together for sure we um we always had a goal that was\nThat was right in front of us and that that was one thing we didn't fight about I mean like any other company we fight about stuff for sure what that one we were I Know that one being one of the most important ones we were not around the same page\nLove it yeah that's one of my biggest thing even with a county but when we when we're hosting a leading su classes biggest thing is I get on the same page and we never fight about money mhm also\nShe she paid the mortgage on the house I paid a foreigner that's just the way that we had been doing things and we both agreed to go in and tackle this so that we can own a house you know within\nFive or six years mhm um\nIt was probably may this year I bought a two thousand Eighteen foreigner and to upgrade a package so it was like forty one thousand we put eleven thousand down with a trade in and everything I'm about thirty five thousand on it together we have about twenty thousand and saving a she\nEssentially what I got from her that she kind of want to skip\nThe baby step three that she doesn't have any other day that they're only ... the foreigner in the house mhm um she got a wife gets to babysit three to\nPrepare to get out and so that would put her paying you know the normal mortgage and he um gets all my bills that we have and saving everything else until she gets out another she's still she teaches dance on the side as well so she's got additional income\nWhat's your question um I wanted to know if we should tackle this foreigner together mhm and get this thirty five thousand out of the way ... or if you think that we just keep going about it the way that we are going to let her continue to save and then meet tackled a foreigner and that eventually when she\nThink you're running your actual tension that occurs when you're trying to act like you're married but you're not you're ... you're vacillating back and forth between acting like a married couple are acting like roommates\nAnd your and your ... so it's my bills her ... her bills but we did this and we did that and yeah under in a legal sense from ... from a law perspective there's not a week\nYeah you have a roommate from ... from the perspective of the law you see what I'm saying and so if if she decides to walk out the door whoever's names are on these things or who's going to be holding the bag\nWhoever's you name any savings accounts which can be there so you're in relation Lee you're struggling back and forth in vacillating so um\nYou guys can do what you want to do obviously you're grown ups and you've done very well you're making a hundred and twenty year congratulations [noise] um you called and asked me so I Will tell you what I Would do if I woke up in your shoes okay yeah I Would get married tomorrow\nAnd then there would be no you're for one runner your savings account\nYou're this it would only be weak and then I Would work the baby steps exactly as prescribed\n\nTo what I Would do I think you're making really good money I think you pay the stupid for rent or off or get rid of it before she gets out and I want to run up and I want her to line up her career or for what she's going to do as she comes out of the military but you know the thing is you you just can't vacillate between\nYou know looking in the refrigerator and going well that's my mustard how 'bout that mustard\nUm you know back in ... or no that's our mustard because we're we're doing this together oh why can't decide and there's there's it it just polls at people part is from\nUm there's all kind of\nStatistical research that shows you're going to have substandard results in your finances as well as other areas of your life until you put marriage in the equation\nAnd so you do what you want to do I'm I'm just an old guy advising you I've got several reasons for that advice but um that's what I Would tell you to do it\nIf you were my little brother that's what I Would tell you to do I'd say get married and stop trying to play both sides of this coin just do it and you know you've been together forever anyway you do in life together it's a technicality really but then you have to say from that point forward we\nWe have a foreigner we have a house we have a savings account we have a plan we are going to submit ourselves\nTo the baby steps we are going to stick with this we are going to go that route and and you become French at that point we week right [laughter] and so that that's what I Would do it cleans up everything and then walk ride down it and if you want to say well\nYou know we're facing an emergency with the loss of her income and so we're not going to work the baby steps right now we're just going to pile of cash and get ready for a baby step that's not really skipping the baby step three that's just saying we're not gonna do anything right now in power money if you want to make that decision you can cause you're panicked about the loss of her income\nI don't think I'm panicked about the loss of her income though I'm\nPlaying because a I think she's going to have another income lined up she's got from now the June to figure that out and be I don't know what percentage of your income she of our income once were married that she represents so that that's the other thing you gotta look at the variable will is with us in California Hi Will welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nI Do think driving me sure what's up so I I've got\nA four home that I own a three hour Rand Paul's at this point uh was I was my primary residence two of those trials are paid off and the third I owe about one Seventy on I guess my question is\nI have the cash to pay that a rental property off completely I'm Wondering if I should versus what the ultimate goal is to get more investment properties so I was wondering what your thoughts are on now\nIs the ultimate goal to have a bunch of investment properties and a bunch of debt on them or a bunch of investment properties that are paid\nFor a pay for of course okay then let's start with that okay that's what I did\nUm the second time the first time my mom and dad and my last and everything but the second time I don't borrow money and more and so I I you know paid off all my properties and I use the increased cash flow that was resulting\nTo buy the next property and by the next one and of course every time you buy another one you got that much more cash flow that's a debt free cash does I mean these things cash brought like crazy when you don't have that right\n[noise] right it changes how much do you do your residence or my primary is about to forty okay\nThe rental rental is one Seventy\nAnd you have how much cash about two twenty okay I won't pay off my primary first off the primary first yep yep\nAnd are either way what the either way you're encouraging what actual oh well the reason is simply this year your heart is part of this equation it's not simply a math equation\nUh and when you're homeless paid off for you to think differently you can't keep yourself from doing it you will make different decisions um it ... it calms you down um you know you just chill and not in a way where you lose your ambition or something like that\nBut um you relax or because you're walking around the back yard when their shoes on and you're at it the grass field different under your feet the bar or really is labor the lender I've experienced that and I've had many many many people experience it over the years that I've talked to millions of people\nAnd of course that frees up that two thousand or whatever dollars a month what's your household income\nOr about one forty five good you've been doing great man how old are you a forty four\nYou're doing well doing very very well so either way out\nWithout the psychological I guess it's kind of what your cars that other that rent on that has money on it oh you should be my primary residence and probably will be again at some point so if you take the emotional equation out of it doesn't matter which one you pay off versus the other\nThe emotional equations part of the equation\n[noise] so yes it matters his personal finances personal it's not just finance ... when you try to do your wealth building process\nAnd don't involve behavior and and don't involve relationships and don't involve emotions and don't involve spirit your spiritual um\nYou're you're you're you've got a substandard plan if you're doing it only on my asking\nAnd you're gonna miss it you do whatever you want it will guy with the progress but if I were you that's what I went to this hour that I've Ramsey show in the bugs will be back with you or you know in the meantime remember there's ultimately only one way of financial peace and that's
