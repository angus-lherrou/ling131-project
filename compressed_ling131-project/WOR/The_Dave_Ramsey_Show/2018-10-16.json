soil down with frequent [noise]\nBaseball playoff in all cs game three of the boroughs of one nothing lead over the Dodgers that game still fairly early in the top of the fourth inning hey the stores\nAre still in it so it was a big deal uh the way this postseason has gone this far in the way that it has played out and you know it seems obvious to trying to find a way when they don't have their studs on the hell out of you get it to the finish line get those twenty seven outs and we've seen\nSome creativity or along the way and a lot of pitching changes ah as well\nUh but eight under three two one zero seven and the number or the jets are as we talked about a little bit tonight a big victory over the Colts yesterday and you know the jets are in a situation here where they are quite obviously a team on the rise but still\nI have some things they're going to have to take care of over the next couple of weeks namely now some injuries quit see a new law with a high ankle spraying that could cost him over a month\nGermane curse more than capable of stepping in and wherever you seek curse and he's just a professional receiver came up in Seattle last year\nAnd he ended up getting a lot of action yesterday a once a new law was out and that should not be a spot where the jets lose all I could see a new law\nAnd he is a good receiver he is a guy that could make some big place has some speed is very physical tough to bring bring down um\nBut I don't think they're going to lose much when they have a guy like curse to be able to go to another possession type of receiver to compliment Ravi Anderson a but more significantly the blues markets may uh in secondary one of their\nTerrific young safeties and now you\nKnow they're going to have to mix and match they did the first few weeks in season or the jets haven't exactly been stuffing opponents on defense but\nI find a game like yesterday encouraging for the jets defense because they were able to force turnovers as we've talked about all the rules they're in favor of the ... they get to dictate the game in a way that\nReally hasn't been before ... and you put\nOne of the all time defense is out there like two thousand ravens defense they are not coming close to having the same impact on the game they still be very good don't get me wrong it's still be the best defense in the league\nBut that ended up itself wouldn't be enough to carry a team to the post season they wouldn't be allowing with like ten points per game that theme of loud and they'd be very good but they have given up at least touch down more than that you can't do the same things and see can't dictate the game defensively\nSo yeah you need to\nBe able to put up some points is part of it but\nOn defense to me yeah you're going to give up yards but can you get some stops and the red zone it can you turn them over\nAnd the jets defense did that yesterday four turnovers against Andrew Luck in the Colts when they needed some red zone stops they got them in the second quarter after the op ed gave the culture tremendous field position back to back possessions\nThat's those are the things you've really got to be able to do and I know it's easy to look and say you gave up thirty four points out well could the defense of played well they got turnovers they got the ball back and some of the jets embed exactly adept down in the past now\nOne of the issues for Andrew Luck has been he will throw interceptions he will force the ball down field some times and he's trying to do too much without having a whole lot of help on that called steam as has been the case for a long time\nAnd boy that is again\nThe worry that you have the jets are going to have the franchise quarterback in place and they had their guys Sam Darnell that he's going to be perhaps the best franchise quarterback to come out since Andrew Luck\nAll those years ago now it looks really been wasted in Indianapolis CIA carried that team to win AFC Championship game\nAnd a key shoulder injury last year but he says it had the town around him to win\nAnd that would be your fear that that's the next step just gives you get the franchise guy doesn't mean it's all set up for you\nYou need to be able to put talent around whether it be skill position talent and opposites of wind which Andrew Luck has never really had needed exist jets are going to have to get right going forward already it's better team around Sam Darnell Ben Andrew Luck is probably ever played with even the team that went to the AFC Championship game\nSo that's a plus in the development of a young quarterback but\nYou see you know the quarterback could be dangerous a franchise guy like Andrew Luck but there is a certain limit to what they are able to do and the ... you know fallen eight points shy uh yesterday\nWith and I don't have any truck with these guys I'm not interested in these crazy far right wing ... opened his group's no I'm not ... but but the book of what I'm concerned about is when Governor Cuomo and a New York public advocate ... James they come out and they started calling for FBI investigations\nHate crimes what can we got this thing called the first amendment the speech can be offensive but people are\nAllowed to say offensive things and when you have the government government officials like Cuomo which is James they're saying well we really should look at these maybe there were hate crimes of all that to me is the left trying to censor speech it does not like that is a concern of mine you know what I hate crimes cut both ways\nSo they didn't investigate antifa absolutely not and you see what happened out there in Portland yeah they had riots out in Portland with mentally investigate them yeah so that but this is called the ... I think it's the same slash what'd you call crazy you know what the credit kooky left kooky the cookie looks like it's never just the left is the same law it's the same to me look\nI don't I'm not making the case when he's proud guys I mean I'm sure they're crazy right wing lunatic not cases but you got a right to be a right wing lunatics you did not case in this country without government officials saying if you're saying stuff we don't like what we should investigate hate crimes here that is called censorship and that is a dangerous road\nTo go to Ellen oh boy and we don't know but we don't know who started this fight and win\nOriginally I thought the three arrests I saw one story that said the three arrests are on the left and people were furious that none of the right but the NYPD is saying they have no I have no idea where you arrest who they're affiliated with now so I don't know\nBut it doesn't bother you that uh you've got the governor of the state of New York now saying we should investigate these people for hate crimes\nWell what do you have a right to say what they want to say as ridiculous as it may be what I found the odds he won't answer the question when it's not I am and you're going to like my answer me Mr cookie writer [laughter] duck and they only said that about the left\nThey never say the cookie right well there's a phrase the right guy that's you know that they\nGave us the right in the left yeah people on the way they have people in the left they looked like they never they just feel that at all those people out in Portland they all look like they sleep under a bridge\nYou done with your little we're scared you know and I think is wrong is when the governor comes out and says well as Trump's fault I mean I you know it's just that I'm not really evil wise that Trump's wall to these people were fighting everything is his fault exactly according comes Tacoma\nYeah I I don't know if that's fair I mean I Know it's almost as hate cannot hey could not be tolerated in New York are you kidding me ... ... foot wide open to hey it's a free country like hey do you want me to\nTolerate eight or ... ... this may be my favorite story this just breaking\nGone so far left that they consider Pocahontas irrational\nPocahontas well get this story the a ... a loaded with war and the senator from Massachusetts fondly known as ... as she gave her DNA results of the Boston Globe oh a DNA analysts found out that there is quote strong evidence\nThat she hasn't Native American heritage and her family tree tape that you cooks on the right\nAll right so she really is ... but a few hundred low in the weekend oh this is pretty funny how much what the precise strong evidence you\nDon't listen to the Stanford professor found that the vast majority of warrants heritage is European but that an ancestor born in the late Seventeen hundreds was partially Native American\nSo All right so she's really Pocahontas what's the problem is that what percentage to have you may even have some Native American so I don't think that counts as a percentage at all no\nDozens of course it does it very well I think it's kinda funny\nWell listen I'm all for her running because Trump will clean of like oh we have been there is no way she's going to be able to be President Trump na na na na ve can beat him right now now what do I still don't can be ... what's that poll that came out the other day the Biden has like twenty per Saturday three yeah oh among Democrats yeah but no one's even close enough to know\nEveryone is learning oriented or his point oh two centers of Lindbergh I was surprised how little he had nothing zero as early but nevertheless you look at that list it's like oh boy\nMore interesting to me though is these midterms are tightening up yeah I looked like a blue wave was coming but boy that Kavanaugh's confirmation really helped the Republicans when you're watching Fox ... no I was in the Drudge Report last\nNight [laughter] that was one of the other I don't know if there was a report and McClatchy right yeah I saw that in my class and it was somebody who said hey in the same this at the same point in the two thousand sixteen election Hillary Clinton was going to win absolutely and then all of a sudden change you've got to get out of New York times bubble there [laughter]\nI saw set a date or says they're got all the Democrats are going to right away rate for artists are said the Democrats are easily ... native a very rural named her that genius\nDon so far left that they consider Pocahontas irrational\nAll right how do you watch the sixty minutes deal and I did I did I thought he was fun I thought it was great I Love it when he said the last I saw the president you are not\nSo much better president and your died last year it was ... I like that one yeah mad if he knows more than to do more than him more than a matter of\nThe things you can get all the one on one sit down and you want you're never going to put them down for anything\nHaving a lousy forward I didn't ... but that's why we one way or just getting started on the odds of October look it up when we rates are in that awful beating in Brooklyn and it was caught on camera and that horrendous escalator deaths in the Bronx is just awful [noise] glad you're spending\nYour evening with our replay of this morning show catches for a brand new Len Burman and Michael read all in the morning tomorrow from six to ten I'm seven ten W ...\nA beer enjoying this re winds up today is Len Burman and Michael real in the morning we'll be back with a new show tomorrow from six to ten on sevens and wor\nSo this guy\nWith a long trailer truck tries to go around the band and there are signs all over the place their vehicles\nOver thirty nine feet in length are not allowed on this curve in the road because it just can't work it does so this guy this this was clearly longer than thirty nine feet I mean I might have been twice or three times as long as he tries to go on this a highway\nAnd uh basically uh the trucks just goes to show for Michael [noise]\n[noise]\nOh\n[laughter]\nDid he was ... when you say out he did with a question mark out out of ... ...\nThe driver was not hurt but the video this this wrong tractor trailer trucks just goes up so over over the side of the road down the embankment\nLike the long remember that Lucille Ball Desi aren't as movie the long trailer wow yeah yeah yeah and I remember them ever and they they tried to turn to navigate with along trashy puts all the rocks in the back and they're all those falls over\nWe got to check out this video with seven ten W. or dot com slash let them Michael a I guess one contractor he was capturing the video I guess he was heard to say oh he oh he's in it and it's so when it\nIs just go to Alan just going around the band I Love this\n[noise]\n\nWe have a question or ALS\nLives down the embankment the oversized truck check it out the website oh we have this this is Mary Annette ... a lot more to this story\nOkay so here's another video we'd got up seven ten W. O. R. dot com slash lending Michael this woman ... Klein she's fifty three year fifty three years old she's in Brooklyn and uh somebody grocer so she called nine one one but it turns out the person who grow up Carolyn\nNine year old a nine year old black boy but I don't think he really grow up to you know he did he just like knock this letter by after yeah and she calls nine one one on um to me that he sexually assaulted her and of course all the people around or are you kidding me you're calling nine one one to complain that a nine year old child sexually assaulted you\nWell this is Natalie now who would have caught this whole thing on video now we'll end with the surveillance video games today I met\nActually this woman Theresa and a whole bunch of people from the community met back at the ... during the weekend to watch it with the media there and that there is nothing on the\nPatio dining out of a sexual assault hit too I mean he's just not really in a ... a backpack might've brush her genome by men ... now did you hear clearly on well let's listen here\nAnd I feel like they\nHave a right to say in the early ...\nNo no no\nNo I Do these people this is the community meaning must be the\nMost of the algae right after the incident is this highly ... know this is when she was actually outside his door calling nine one one on her song already\n\nSomebody\nWho's yelling or do I what am I liked her flat blank than what she said yeah nobody was well I mean if you look at the video very thin and nobody wants a ... year fast well you know ... flap\nYour car dash you did well although ...\nIf you go anywhere near me going to bump into that thing where Kim ... can't help it along as each trip over it and say well this is crazy started\nThe world\n\nWhy do you\nThe fraudsters you just go away a white woman confronts the black and the and the black woman says go away why ...\n... it was ... it was seen as slaves had crying and he's on the phone this could become a racial incident it already is terrible well if you look at the video apparently all the little boy\nDid he had as a backpack and he just brushed against her and she turned out I'm like some vengeful fury well when was this little kid nine\nNine nine years old well apparently a now Fox caught up with this lady on the street or well yeah I think this might have been part of this policy has apologized to the press or that they had to pack up his store\nThey caught up with Theresa ...\nIt's very aggressive use of video that leads to many of the theme song I thought it was a\n[laughter] how\nWe I just ask them\nSaid they were getting ready to go\nI don't think this woman's going to be shopping in that deli ever again because when they should go anywhere near that Kelly help absolutely loves speaking the crazy this over the weekend is Proud Boys fights so they ... they had the speaker\nAt this Republican club on the Upper East side on maybe third street the metropolitan Republican claw I've spoken there really mhm yeah so you're they have all the right wing crazy [laughter] yeah I just got Gavin McCann is founder of the Proud Boys\nWhich is apparently a far right group describing themselves as western chauvinist right well obviously there was some supporters of is there and there were some protesters from the left there and there was a Malik and there was a a may like the main street or on the street on any third street\nAnd there were three people arrested early reports were there were only arrested from the left but the police are saying they have no idea who the arrestees are affiliated with the ... ongoing but then Governor Cuomo jumped into the fray\nWill not tolerate each speech it is not protected [noise] ah it is illegal\nWell well we will investigate it to be foolish\nWhat is he talking about hate speech is not protected of course it's protected as a First Amendment out their folks don't do anything about the first amendment Governor Cuomo you can't go round silencing people just because of the same things you don't like that's nuts that censorship that is scary\nTo pass it he's he's a white supremacist he hates black\nWas that some woman's blaming Trump is that what that is all about that but that's what\nThat's what I was a cheap shot you know I'm concerned though and I do think we're going to see more and more violence in this country as the left and the right to begin to you you said as I think we're going to start the I think we're going to start seeing it on college campuses when some of these the provocative speakers are there we saw some clashes in Portland, Oregon\nI'm telling you I have an an easy feeling about where we're headed\nAlright this woman who was was not speaking about Trump She was talking about the Proud Boys leader Gavin mechanical\nFashion he's a he's a white supremacist hate black\nSo that's the guy who spoke against 'cause 'cause Cuomo was blaming Trump She said it was all coordinated with the midterms and Cuomo said Trump was at fault here and one\nWas going to blame trying isn't doesn't it bother you when the governor of the state of New York comes out and says we will not tolerate hate speech it's not protected by law I'm Sorry the most ... the only point of the first amendment is to protect the most offensive speech that's the country where we live in your title you're entitled to have a horrible opinions not promote violence\nI don't think you were these guys promoting violent I don't know that he's had yell fire in a crowded ... if you want to hate the Jews you can hate the Jews who can I mean that's ... well could I Know you're the first amendment don't do that you know the only way they are in the ... that's the only way to fight the ...\nA hard right organization they called themselves western chauvinist they were giving a speech at the metropolitan club up there and some kooky left ... people\nWere out there on the street protests lead and then there's a fight broke out but the concern or at least my concern just doesn't seem to bother Len one bit is that Governor Cuomo was out saying we have to stop this hate speech hate speech is not protected seems to me he wants to censor people he does not agree with\nI don't know what these Proud Boys stand for I'm sure I don't agree with that I'm sure they're out there in the crazy\nLunatic fringe of the right wing as well but unfortunately a lot but fortunately in this country we have the first amendment that protects all sorts of speech no matter how April so Governor Cuomo needs to take a First Amendment class I thought he was a lawyer but he is out there now calling for an investigation into hate speech to stop these people that is called censorship\nAnd wake you up John Philip Sousa da da da da da da da da da da da da ... what Cuomo has had to say what Cuomo yeah he was put but you know what\nNot all speech is protected but he's you know if you advocate violence is not protect we will not tolerate\nPage speech it is not protected or it is illegal I don't know what you want to investigate it to be foolish I don't I'm\nNot sure I don't know I hear clearly doesn't now but what it is is the left wants to censor people on the right that's the bottom line here folks\nAlright and rounding out the big three we have some celebrity gossip today so Ariana Grande day is on the market again she should offer rain gauge been to the Saturday Night live guy and the anti aren't as\n... David the Davis Saturday Night live guy you know I Can't I haven't seen family life says ... she\nWas alive but to Anthony our associate producer is so happy he's already put in his Gibbs for a a date with Ariana Grande there both from Staten Island you've got you've met before right have they ever met before him\nHe said he he had a hug oh wow I was oh my goodness okay in touch\nWith you know she did not\nShe waited you got an age to be Davis it at\nHome and I wonder if it did you get a number now at the time she was with a a rapper big John oh yeah I don't know what your chances are Anthony but ah I own zero zero zero zero percent and we got her well baby\nUnderway Megan Marco is pregnant she and Harry or on a world when tour of uh Australia and new\nZealand and tongue guy in Fiji and the baby bump is growing\nUp but what Joe Bartlett makes a great point do you want to make that point\nPublicly hello Joe\nI'm going to say no on whatever this is not I don't even know what to do a great point during All right I'm I'm\nJust kind of curious I mean there's you know Meghan mark was half African American young so it's sort of African American lineage now in the royal family\nSo they have red hair I don't know about all you have the first black royal baby you know what you're saying okay well that's a good point it's definitely going to be that's a fair point definitely going to be yeah that's a very hand American\nYes they can wow what's how American the royal family's falling down the American yes\nAn African American soldier by by by only disappointment was she was a Jewish could you imagine a black American ads yours you would've been a throw them out or Canadian she's Canadian especially no now working in Canada She was working so technically that child\nWould be in a ... you know way down on the list of ah\nThe higher the lineage him ... but in line\nFor the throne I Hope that child's conniving and bumps off the letter that ran around where they hated America poised and everybody who is in in in a head of them in line that great a black ... America blend we'd have ... I think that would be wonderful\nFabulous so congratulations to Prince Harry and Meghan Marco and all the girls in the ladies will be all excited that there's a new oil baby on the way\nBy the way it's just one of the thought you were talking about the president's interview on sixty minutes last night when he stopped the Leslie stall\nI'm president and you and I will remind me of what you mentioned SNL Chevy Chase and you're not override Oregon remember that that's I think that's where he got it from Chevy Chase the president of a ... I thought he handled himself well in the interview well ... ...\n... what I found interesting yes no matter what came up be a climate change he said well yeah it could be a ... I don't know well it could change I mean he's got like he's got every answer on both sides and he just slumps through them I mean the thing about Dr forward I mean this is this got me a little bit\nAnd I made that speech where would not have one that I was just saying she didn't seem to know anything and you're trying to destroy a life of a man who has been extraordinary\nShe's saying what he said in a sense of who didn't mock Dr Ford yes they wouldn't have one which means the end justifies the means no\nHe had to do something and he did it quite brilliantly to underline the ambivalence the ... in her testimony she couldn't remember where she couldn't remember when upstairs downstairs all he did was repeat\nHer inability to be\nSpecific about when the alleged incident between her and cabinet happened\nNo one really tough with her knowing what I thought you know to say hey wait a minute wait a second he had the courage to do exactly ... the Republicans they were so scared they got that idiot woman does your question or it would get a terrible out by the way you can do you can't you can't deny your guide the Supreme Court and that kind of an allegation I understand\nWhat you're saying but you do understand that the psychiatrist will tell you the people who have undergone traumas do have blanks in their memory especially with us from so many years ago so that is entirely possible well no what is that I didn't have ... minutes\nThere's no evidence ended discussion lens so that's ... by the way I to quote Trump we won so get over it\nI think you're making a millennia brought up\nThis evidence thing too and I and I just have to say that the [noise]\nThey may not be you know that was there evidence on all The Cosby things\nI mean what is clearly there wasn't enough evidence could well but will deliver the you know there was a lot of here say and he said and she said and they believed\nHer story and the others who came forward but when you're talking about evidence where's the evidence I'm not sure that evidence exists on most of the ... you're just going to conduct because the allegation is made I didn't say that but just don't dismiss it out of hand either by saying well where's the evidence\nThat that doesn't work either justice cabin on its over it is over the Republicans won the Dems last ah ha ha\nHa you're you're really British or [laughter] whatever [laughter] I saw a fourth grader hack I'm really a man and then there are some intelligent commentary on the radio medical discourse oh what a ... man [laughter] perfect I'm\nGetting your go today there last night can be when the ... boys who just beat you up\nSo I don't see right I associated ... you're right ...\nHave you need any more evidence that the mainstream media is completely prejudice against Donald Trump did you see the correction NBC had to issue\nYou had a Trump tweeted something NBC comes out and they said that Trump was praising\nConservative Confederate General Robert e as incredible it turns out it wasn't Roberts Lee he was praising he was praising Ulysses S grant who fought for the north and won the war for Abraham Lincoln and this is how the mainstream media just wants to make Trump seem that he's a racist because he liked the civil war general\nNotice that there's a big difference between Robert de Leon Ulysses Grant\nNBC's not getting any Trump interviews you know ABC got a millennia CBS Scott\nPresident NBC nothing well there's still an axe to grind with NBC over the practice and Jeff Zucker who's now oversee and then there's still a little bit of that going on but uh again and you're making it seem like the mistake on NBC's part was intentional of course it was\nWell I think they will jump to whom I did but oh you're saying they intentionally went out this when they knew all along that he really meant grant but he said the league\nWell what it is it they they want it to be like yeah that's what they wanted to because they want to be able to jump on him for being a racist so it says Ulysses Grant but they're so clouded in their judgment there so blinded by their hatred for this man that they see Robert de leite when it's Ulysses Grant\nLet's see if we can pick up some of this I don't want to play the whole thing\nBut it also gave you [noise] a general [noise] who was incredible he drank a little bit too much\nYou know I'm talk it out and rent there was a big drinker so really it was a great general\nNumber of violations so I'm going to be the Saudis\nThe NTSB when there is a stretch limo fresh so they can go investigate well\nHe wants them to go back in time and look at all the past ones and not you know and he's got he's got some good points there I mean\nHe's always got something to say on the Sunday talk shows and without fail pops up there but this one was uh there's no serious so sad those for funerals over the weekend\nHe really was sisters All right so you know I don't live in New Jersey and don't take New Jersey transit so Bernie fighter our travel reporter extraordinary learning guys\nWeinberg so she's always recover so everything yeah I saw so they've cut back all the strays been passed was having a problem so a typical suit but they've cut back all these trends but they aren't going to give them more than ten percent discount at some point so light on us what's this all about\nYour right yes uh you get a ten percent discount for the remainder of this month the U.S last November December and January and that's a no matter what train you take a but yeah there every day they're going to be canceling Eighteen trained well every day every rush hour\n... throughout the throughout the day after day uh Eighteen uh trains are gonna be canceled on you know all the big lines including the Northeast Corridor nurture the coastline\nAnd this is going to affect a lot of folks are saying well I was just looking at Twitter right now there's a multiple trains that are delayed by about forty five to fifty minutes already this morning so forty five to Fifteen minute ... although I was just talking to Georgia engineer and he said he had no problem it for fifty five this morning\nSo and by the company to go into\nSo when you're leaving a rush hour when you're leaving the city you could wait forty five fifty minutes before you train comes to take them\nAbsolutely yeah badly about that temper ... she was saying if you have a monthly ticket that she uses a couple of hundred dollars or more that alone I\nMean here's definitely add up here's the question then Bernie well more people decide to drive the clogging the roads up even even more\nI have a feeling anecdotally I've been hearing that people are just I'm pulling over or left to an end to town and just a cheaper and less aggravation I guess and actually interestingly enough I'm definitely saying heavy traffic\nAt the Hudson River crossings more so than normal especially right now it's like forty five fifty at the Holland Tunnel so yeah I I think a lot of people maybe are taking a a car service and or\nA car pool and but you know this is old for a good cause and that they have to do is federally mandated a\nPositive control that have trained control and\nUh yeah this is a system that\nWill implement a breaking a to um you know deter basically human error whether it be around mentor collision you know unfortunately that was that horrible accident that metro north accident I guess it's been about five years now that are several people were were killed and I believe that the NTSB I'm\nDiscovering that um he had fallen asleep the engineer dried our on them and that they had\nThe positive train control that accident probably would\nNot have how how how long is this supposed to take and we're not going to get this done\nWell it's supposed to be done by the end of the year there all night [laughter] yeah\nAnd if they if it's not done you know they could to be a a a penalize financially I'm also a you know a Amtrak is their landlord and um if New Jersey transit doesn't finish this Amtrak and say you can't use our northeast corner anymore\nI was waiting for you to say that

actually no it's not not horrible we've got that accident investigation Lyndon I don't want to nine but yeah that is still there\nWe will talk to you throughout the morning great burning burn it at my leisure\nOr a traffic reporting here but that I mean every time she mentions ... New Jersey transit I mean it's an absolute mess\nThere is a problem I Wonder if they have heat in the stations I remember they didn't have air conditioning in the summer I Hope that compete in the winter\nReminders renting or even with our ... It's MORNING show just for a brand new one moment in my career in the morning tomorrow from six to seven Ben wor\nFine at a pile of limbs and you'll be gone point at a king size mattress gone point at a dead TV refrigerator washer dryer\nGone gone gone gone till midnight seven days a week do\nIs a one eight hundred and ...\nThe following message for monster contains multiple uses of the F word it may not be suitable for younger audiences and those easily eight\nVoyager ... with our ... morning show catch just for a brand new one burning Michael real in the morning tomorrow from six to fend on seven then a couple of you or\nYou didn't notice the Clintons have no shame\nWhatsoever you're after all these years Hillary Clinton came out and she said absolutely not bill should never have resigned\nWould never have resigned when the Monica Lewinsky scandal came out even in the hash tag me to error they would've fought it out because they are shameless people we want to know what do you think should Bill Clinton had resigned one eight hundred three two one zero seven ten\nOne eight hundred three two one zero seven ten give us a call what do you think do you think should have gone down he tough it out\nYou did when he was impeached though but I have a hard time thinking that if a\nHappened during this time the hash tag me to era that he would not have been out that door an Al Gore would have been president United States but we want to know what do you think one eight hundred three two one zero seven ten\nWell Hillary was on\nA CBS this morning or the Sunday Morning and uh she was asked about all this\nThere are people who look at\nThe incidence of the nineties and they say a president of the United states cannot have a consensual relationship with an intern the power imbalance in adult\nBut let me ask you this where the investigation of the current income than to against him numerous allegations have been made\nAnd which he dismisses denies and ridicules so there was an investigation and as I Believe came out in the right place\nShe turned it around all the time when someone says something about Trump is simple what about Hillary so so yes Hillary's you saying well what about Trump's so that's fair\nRight mystery to let us know what do you think you're gonna buy tickets to see bill and Hillary on their on their road trip around the country with Hillary said he should not resign\nIn retrospect do you think\nBill should've resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scan absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power now allow\nAh All right let's see what the Denison bayside has to say good morning Dennis\nDennis starting your phone down down and start down on you they're going to a dentist would have to say\nYou should we should be locked up your show we're talking criminal why\nWhy now what's it like a ... extremely what's the crime that he would have been locked up for\nYour name it [laughter]\nWhat about a hundred of facts that well fed and listen to the stage and pay a him in the fall and New Jersey Sam one or two away and good morning too\nLate morning um I don't know about Monica Lewinski but what about the credible rape allegation by Juanita Robert ... go down for that and maybe still should\nYeah he's he scolded away with that one didn't eat him\nHe certainly did what are we going to hear about that when we put a Bill Bill Cosby away about Bill Clinton\nI tend to think they'll discuss it on their on their tour bill and Hillary they'll talk about what he'd abroad Rick\nIt be whatever it is I get along with them really well I have a good energy with them I have a good chemistry with him look at the horrible threats or a man no more threats almost threats\nBut she's right I mean I don't use right what what do you what you got to deal with you got to deal with it and he's the head of North Korea we were at each other's throats\nTrump has toned down he's going to meet with and you can't you don't meet with your friends you make peace with your enemies or to make peace with your friends to make peace with your enemies to say I love the guy and you know murdering bastard what are you talking about you love the guy who's just buttery him home artery them up for the summit\nWhen he can get a deal from him to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula that's the goal that's the larger picture and there's less there's oh he's a bad guy you shouldn't be dealing with bad guys give me a break you know what else a Trump said me a break\nI'm president\nAh right when we come back what's going on with the missing journalist and assembled is Trump going to get tough with the Saudis if they did indeed chop that guy up we're going to check in with ABC News foreign correspondent in panel\nThis is a really wanting to today's Len Burman and Michael read all in the morning and get them live tomorrow from six built in on seven ten\nW O R there'll be drawing from stumbled turkey in penalties\nThe ABC News senior foreign correspondent a lot of twists and turns and the apparent there after we still don't know for sure of the Washington Post the journalists Jamal ... yeah we went into the consulate never came out of Saudi Arabia in Istanbul never came out this report\nAnd I was true or not that that there that the Saudis are going to let truckers officials come in and look around them and do their own investigation inside a conflict well they may have taken him out already right well I don't know what's there to them in\nChili and report though that uh he may have recorded and broadcast his abduction torture and murder if he wasn't a murder on his ah apple watch to his wife well\nA fiance a Turkish newspaper is claiming that that audio exists and the Turkish officials have bad audio recording of the alleged killing of ... shocking now would not be interesting\nMhm be interesting to see what Trump does too because Trump is pretty close to the Saudi Arabian family there and Jared likes the likes the prince\nThe prince who allegedly may have ordered the hit job on this guy but Trump is coming out a little tougher than he was initially like he's come out and said if indeed this journalist was killed by the Saudis that uh they have to be a price to pay for that\nWell here's what Trump said on sixty minutes last night about\nFor nobody knows yet but we'll probably be able to find out it's being investigated being looked at very very strongly that we wouldn't be very upset and angry if that were the case as of this moment they deny attendant denied the mentally\nSo he has said that he's not going to pull the arms deal no so what kind of do exactly\nYou know I don't think much is going to happen in Saudi Arabia is a the it's not a democracy okay\nThe princes probably a bad due buddy is our ally in a very strategic place in the world in the middle east and he you know Trump will just do what Obama with the school year wag your finger at them tell them to behave but you're not going to cancel hundred billion dollars in arms sales because the Chinese will just step and sell the arms of Saudi Arabia why should we give up that business\nYeah real politics the way the works\nAll right with that let's go to Ian panel he is an ... we've been speculating about all the stories that have come up in the last twenty four hours what's the latest from your spam poignant\nYeah good morning Lynn Good to be with you I mean this is a January ... is it a murder mystery I'm standing at that level and just about ten Fifteen Years from ... to show this\nSaturday correspondents he was American resident ... for the Washington Post was the last say we're outside the Saturday ... this morning that last point to what you were saying I look at the camera that film the going in that we've seen those shots\nBut then he was never seen again his fiance wasted outside she ... she didn't hear anything from the Saudis say look he left out the back door and yet they haven't proved to provided any evidence to prove that the Turkish authorities here are saying that they have evidence that he was\nHeld that he was interrogated and that he was killed him to explain exactly what\nThe Turkish newspaper claims they have audio off the watch that the that has been killing on it that that's what the Turkish newspapers saying the Turkish authorities have that audio you\nYeah what we're hearing is that that was a deliberate route to ... ... people sense how they were actually listening in on another country's culture\nWhich seems to be much more credible I mean experts have said it was on the watch but somehow is transmitted to uh the uh the always fun to go outside that doesn't sound entirely beliefs but what is much more believable is it they were actually listening in uh what was going on in the culture there will ever find out\nBut there clearly absolutely showing it put enough pressure on the Saturday\nBut the Saudi king to pick up the phone last night's speech which is president implements this chilling investigation where expect you to see Turkish investigation going that ready in the last couple of hours we also sort of local cleaning crew get there's a cleaning crew going into the culture that presumably to tide you had to the investigators\nWhile he in what is the reports of these Fifteen Saudi operatives they came in to turkey and then they ... they left their thought to be the hit squad are they not\nOnly that certainly allegations comes through again for the Turkish sources so you get these two private planes land with Fifteen Saudis don't vote including people identified as possible\nSecurity detail that works for the world family a forensic experts they check into a hotel which we're staying in which is now only a few hundred yards away from the culture that they felt that backs that comes to the ... ... the journalists wise a few hours later\nThat ... and then they will get on the plane and they leave again in the ... ... ... ... they wanted to Saturday to the church are absolute combat\nBut it's important to vote and only sixty two percent of men say that's important and so the intensity advantage which Trump past two years ago seems to be swinging toward the Democrats and particularly among women voters who seem to be more highly energized\nWe're on was the robber it's the ABC News vertical wind list in Washington joins us every week this time Steve is this some\nOf Saudi mystery going to be the next big of a diplomatic issue here the president says he doesn't want to stop any arms sales he says will do other things uh what other things can he do\n[noise] well that's a very good question um it's hard to know there are probably other sanctions that get can be placed a on on the south east but the president's been very clear and you heard this and the sixty minute interview he kept circling back to one issue and that was job\nLet's remember that was at the core of the reason why he got elected\nPromising to restore American Jobs who particularly manufacturing jobs and he's had trouble keeping that promise and um uh the last thing he wants is for these major contracts or to be in jeopardy because it's it's a part of the core of his political appeal so he is going to place\nA economic issues ahead of humanitarian issues that had a diplomatic issues I'm ahead of these larger moral questions that have people very is critics very concerned that\nYou know if you get past economic sanctions aren't too many other levers of power that you have with the south\nIt's true and Steve I mean they are for better or for worse our ally I don't think any president Democrat or Republican could just easily ditch the Saudis\nWill know they've been they've been very important to not only as business partners but you know the Saudis play a double game um they've also a finance a lot of bad actors around the middle east to that's not as if that they are\nTotally loyal friends to us but they are very very powerful a you know given their oil revenues they have the ability to a an Hansi international oil markets we've seen that in the past mhm um they have as much power to do damage to us as we do we have power to do damage to that\nI see the person just tweeted a an outrage that it's we the crowds at my rallies are far bigger than I've ever been before including the twenty sixteen election never an empty seat and these large Venus many thousands of people\nWatching screens outside enthusiasm in spirit is through the roof all caps something big is happening watch is a possible the sheer force of his personality can bring the Republicans across the finish line at the at the elections coming up in a few weeks\nWe'll look a whole series and analysts have been wrong about this man before so um you got to take him seriously but our polling data shows that he's still\nA very much underwater when it comes to public up Google his the favorable rating is forty one percent in our polls now that's up five points from from August and yet this is the lowest number\nThan an incumbent president has had going into his first midterm election since Harry Truman in Nineteen forty six so he can talk about the crowds and there's no doubt that his core supporters are wildly enthusiastic and there's no doubt that the Kavanaugh hearings\nHelp with that group and there's no doubt than in red states where there are key Senate races that's probably going to be an asset in Missouri or South Dakota or Indiana\nYou but I'm In the suburbs of of big cities as we said many times which is these are the district say there aren't too um uh decide this election female voters are not\nFavorable to this they're looking at those big rallies and it's turning them off\nThe if we uh we got her own pre share that will talk to you next week but the all good points and the the polling stuff the difficulty fascinating thank you Steve Roberts ABC News or when we get back we've got your rascals tickets were going to give away and the Proud Boys and what was that brawl about we've got our Stockton proceeding on the scene of the crime\n[noise] glad you're spending your evening with our replay of this morning show catch us for a brand new Len Burman and Michael read all in the morning tomorrow from six to ten I'm seven ten W O R\nPermanent Michael real in the morning we'll be back with a new show tomorrow from six to ten on seven then wor\nMore and everybody said forty Alice ... is up there that snooty metropolitan Colombo recently they have that\nThing oh about ... Rao boys it so far right wing group and they found a robot spoke at the very ... metropolitan club where I've spoken and left these were upset about it and there was some sort of brawl out in the street and now you got Cuomo calling investigation on hate speech but it was probably the left wing\nBet all yeah there was a left wing oh sure yeah I was elected will nominate and felt anyway I was checking with Alice ... interesting to see if she got into the club while he was ... it was Cuomo had to say\nWe will not tolerate hate speech it is not protected or it is illegal [noise] we will investigate it to be foolish or you\nGo see about that I think our Cuomo needs a lesson in the constitution\nAnyway are breaking news on CNN that was just really qualify for breaking news while everything's break you know was it bit Warren has given her asked to the Boston Globe has and against the test showed that she's got a little a Native American blood in her you know breaking news no but what this keeps me up to is that she\nSeriously considering running\nFor the Democratic nomination for president to go up against Donald Trump or would not have given those DNA tests to the Boston Globe\nShe's one of the president's favorite boils\nThey've gone so far left they consider Pocahontas irrational\n[noise] oh I\nSee your eyes that we can finally get down to the facts as to whether or not she has in the ...\nThat we are well she took a DNA test she released it the Boston Globe and listen to this Michael ... this is this is serious stuff the Stanford professor found that the vast majority of Warren's heritage is European\nBut that one ancestor born late Seventeen hundreds was partially Native American\nSo there you go are glad we got a you know it'd be a great ticket for your team really light seem Elizabeth Warren and Maxine Waters oh yeah that'll\nGo [laughter] oh I ...\nI Hope the Democrats nominate Elizabeth Warren well I really speaking of Democrats the other news over the weekend was Hillary Clinton with on CBS Sunday Morning and if that she actually address the Monica Lewinsky deal with her husband in her comments thrown up a little bit of controversy there\nMike there are people who look at\nThe incidence of the nineties and they say a president of the United states cannot have a consensual relationship with an intern the power imbalance as to why an adult but\nLet me ask you this is where the investigation if the current incumbent against him numerous allegations had been made and which ... dismisses denies and ridicule tell there was an investigation and as I Believe came out in the right place a\nCouple of things they're number one the fact that Monica Lewinsky was an adult is irrelevant because she was an intern ... underneath the power of the president and number two I Love the fact that she's doing the what about isn't because every time a Trump is accused of something says well what about Hillary so ... what about Trump and Hillary\nHow did she make that money those cattle futures land but that ever thoroughly investigated among the about the\nKnitting retrospect do you think\nBill should've resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scan absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power now\nIt was to go there you go read all\nYou remember when I remember when all of her feminist friends dumped all over poor Monica Lewinsky they said she was a little bit nutty in a little bit slutty remember that you remember that I remember all the feminist coming out to trash or ... hypocrites a lot of them land\nMines are spending your evening with our ... this morning show just for a brand new my mom and my career in the morning tomorrow from six and seven Ben wor\nNew York's boxing meals and rated number one seven\nGot very violent and um\nThey vandalized the building and I both I was absolutely ridiculous\nThere's no place for it and I think they should have all been interesting that's what I think both sides are no no\nFor tests you outside of the protesters that I Would be the left side the likes of yes yes I Do that had a problem with the guy from the right that was speaking at the class I think he should have the right to speak in this country I guess people\nTaking sides what else to do with ... the ah well\nListen to this woman she's on the other way other side\nThat I think it's much more um representative of\nOur life and I mean this is an attack and if you ask\nCertain people from the um extreme right they will say that it to set up from the\nIf you're in the neighborhood you're going to find that radical either way doesn't exist\nPeople here are I Would say moderate\nThat's totally appropriate to have friends\nNow there are those who say that we're headed for a civil war in this country I think people are going to have a I think Trump that it'll be careful 'cause they're probably going to be a lot of attacks on his life\nThere are people that are so angry [noise]\nDo you think he's feeling that things are absolutely\nWow that's pretty harsh Dallas\nSo yeah it's like yeah it's one of the other and then we've got grant who's kind of you know he just thinks this is America and things like that should be allowed\nI couldn't make out any of the words that they were saying but they were upset [noise] actually I really liked it\nJust because it's sort of shows there's freedom of speech\nI mean it seems that people don't protest or do much any more um and I thought that it was\nVery healthy I think America is supposed to be all about freedom of speech and freedom of assembly\nWow you got a lot of people with a lot of thoughts that no shortage we're bringing up their house\nRight well the very next night the Proud Boys march to Portland, Oregon and\nIt was there was a black lives matter protests and they got into it and it became a much bigger law and viral videos are being investigated there\nBut I can tell you this these anti fascist groups and I ran into them at the Republican convention and at the Democratic convention they were the ones burning the flags that were the ones that were really getting\nHeated at both of the conventions and\nFighting and throwing things so you know\nIt doesn't matter what side you're on when it when you start hurting people I mean they were setting things on fire outside of the inauguration remember when when bottles were throwing during the inauguration the they they they started attacking buildings in Washington DC\nI mean when it starts getting that crazy that just\nWait we that's now that's not a protest I don't know what I don't know what not said you're trying to get across when when you start getting violent and people are getting hurt and planes are being burned in buildings are being vandalized so that's the problem with both sides both sides are violent and both sides are now getting into regular\nClashes across the country and as we head into the mid term you know I I just wonder if we might be seeing more of this kind of activity\n... well I'm going to say oh my quote is going to be there are plenty of bad people on both sides\nCould people alright ... spree she had a good guy or the order of ... a member of the metropolitan Republican club\nI Would vote no I don't think so [laughter] a president's just waited oh you did significant uh-huh just spoke to the king of Saudi Arabia who denies any knowledge of what ever may have happened to quote our Saudi Arabian citizen unquote he said they're working closely with turkey to find the answer\nI immediately sending our secretary of state to meet with king\nOh well he's on top of it so there you go he's on top of it and it's the latest on the other part is\nThat we got a lot to talk about coming up Michael a new
