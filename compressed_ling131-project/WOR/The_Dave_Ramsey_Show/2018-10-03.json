we know the jets the giants is not exactly going the way that they would like both teams at one in three for the jets part of the\nGrowth curve that you might expect with a rookie quarterback for the giants are more of the same and it seemed that really doubled down on the now on the short term and\nIt's a it looks exactly like it did last year I Know they have a tough scheduled to start but it doesn't get much easier for a few more weeks here with the Panthers coming up and then getting the eagles at home on Thursday Night Football uh but you look around the league right now first of all the panic in New England over the patriots that\nSubsides now as they had a big win against the Miami Dolphins and\nThis is the same story with the patriots they mess around with the first month of the season they're trying different game plans in\nBuilding up training their players it's like a build up an arsenal that's what they do in New England they stockpile early in the season I might not be wins that they stockpile but did no team as consistently gotten better over the course of a year\nAnd then the New England patriots every single season they are peaking at the end and they are not the same team at the start and\nUh you know one thing I noticed in general this year in the NFL so often the first few weeks of the year our disjointed ... look bad the football looks lousy and\nTeams don't get enough time to really train during pre season that's been a big problem in recent years I I think it's something that\nHas affected the ratings to some degree\nIn recent seasons 'cause the football just looks lousy er visits here that has been the case you look at the scores from this past weekend\nAnd officers are putting up points uh teams like the rams and the chiefs are moving the ball down the field and will it took the state's a little while to get going this Sunday against the giants but by the time the second half rolled around their score and all the time even the jaguars you're putting up over five hundred yards\nGranted against the New York jets but\nAh you see some wild game the raiders and brown both over forty point soon in overtime game that the writers were able to come back and win some real drama on a Monday Night football game yesterday and a team with the young quarterback overcoming eight ten point deficit and the fourth quarter\nThe Chicago Bears one of those innovative officers in the NFL bad a huge day against the Tampa Bay rays scoring over forty points do you see these shopping is\nWhere a month into the year and they're rolling\nSome of these off that just might be peaking already\nAnd that is it's just not what we've seen in recent years it's taken at least to mid October for most of these officers get on track in the past and then the weather starts to be a factor the final weeks of the year\nAnd you just don't have not that it has to be high scoring but you don't have the kind of track made games it up and down it's exciting that ran the Vikings game on Thursday Night Football that was exciting\nAnd we saw a ton of bad this past week and I understand they of relax all the rules there really is no defense that's going to win games for you in this league anymore it's all predicated on you're passing game your quarterback and how many points you can score that's the way the sport is designed now\nBut it's good to see it\nGet off to a a decent start and not having weeks and weeks and weeks where teams are trying to put it together or for the most part you know these officers have come out\nFire and make things happen\nNow uh you look elsewhere around the league at some teams are it's big trouble right now the Atlanta Falcons at one in three they've lost a lot of games late there one of those seem to be played shoot out those are the falcons have averaged ... almost thirty points per game and the only one wins show for it\nThat's how bad their defense who's been twenty nine points per game for the falcons and that's not good enough for them um you know the Indianapolis Colts\nMight've expected better from them having Andrew Luck back they're stuck in one in three years the Texans have been a disappointment to Shaun what's coming off the knee surgery you figure there'll be some growing pains for him is even though the worldly last year you'd figure there would be super aggression there there has been\nAnd the Texans are having a rough go of it besides\nUm you know again I just sitting there at one and three so\nUh you know but I think overall you've seen more entertainment from the

I'm seven ten W O R [noise] [noise]\nWell it's a you know the when the president holds a news conference to matter where it is no matter what it's about it is highly entertaining what happened yesterday\nAs he called every body to the rose garden late morning to talk about the new deal this replacing NAFTA ... at the Canada's agreed to it in Mexico's agreed and this is the greatest deal et cetera et cetera\nAnd the reporters do to flee ask some questions but then they didn't want to talk about\nIt while I wanted to wanted to talk about now that are they talking about NAFTA that's not exactly a ratings grab or no I Know so they all play in the new deal to me let you do it you went to Columbia younger a magnet ... do you explain it it's a some trade with Mexico and Canada but he seems to be happy except in New York Times which of course is already tearing the deal apart you know\nTrump said when he yeah he's done what he said it was going to do he ripped up NAFTA and he's renegotiate it a better deal but nobody cares about that\nWell we have several sound by so we pulled it out one of them has to do with it [laughter]\nI thought I didn't pull a ... that's not me\nI'm just saying that it's just not entertaining it's there's no use more entertaining than not but what happened was they were all talking about uh the trade deal and he was answer some questions and some there were some good questions asked and you know has to do with\nDairy farmers and soybeans\nGray and cars and it was fine I mean I and if\nIt's great oh hallelujah okay by a lot of soybeans who care so anyway um Sicilia Vegas from ABC stands up right and she wants to ask about something else and here's this exchange which has gotten a great deal of attention Michael okay question yeah go\nShe shock that I picked her [laughter]\nI said Russia [laughter] I'm not thinking that that's okay I Know you're not thinking you never do [laughter]\nFor him as well but people yeah well people were jumping on the fact that he said that to a woman you know ...\nNow you know if this morning or tracks because she went excuse me let's listen again before we'll just laugh CNN right know ABC NBC ABC All right well it's the mainstream media that hates them well let's listen to just listen can you try to uh not laugh over that so we could hear the at all the details here\nOkay question yeah go ahead [noise] sure [noise]\nShe shocked that I picked her side of the state of shock [laughter]\nI'm not thinking that I thought hey I Know you're not thinking you never did\nAhead sorry okay wasn't excuse me I'm Sorry I mean sorry she stopped teachers like he just said I Hope she's a woman\nShe was ruffled head of the man he would've Bob and yeah man would have had ... much\nBetter [laughter] he would have died and I go I'm gonna I'm gonna die I Would have\nGone to write to the question I said Mr President you stand behind the drunk and loud you picked to be on the Supreme\nCourt didn't then didn't she started to ask a question about cabin on ... and he said not now come back to you later but now we're talking about what does it have to deal with trade\nWe're not going to do with mhm yeah good for him I think I'd be bullied by the press corps Len well he did he did eventually answer some questions and ah ah first of all he took on the Democrats which is just do\nFavorite thing in his new favorite word is loco it worse now than\nTheir logo but that's okay I put up with it I use that word because of the fact that we made a deal with Mexico\n[laughter]\nAnd if we make a deal with Israel all use the word hot spot\n[laughter]\nSquarely at that race just brilliant [laughter] that's how he uses the word we had made a deal with Mexico ... what is crazy and Canadian\nOr\nIf they don't go crazy am into a ring a so obviously he was the cabinet thing ... was a big topic yesterday and the rose garden I watched that hearing\nAnd I watched a man saying that he did have difficulty as a young man which drink the one question I didn't ask is how about the last Twenty years have you had difficulty last Twenty years 'cause nobody said anything bad about him and many many years they go back to high school\nYeah he's right about the second part the first part is a cabinet never sent a problem with drinking that now Trump is a scientist\nThe problem with you and he never Kevin I'm never said well he indicated that he did drink in high school I can imagine you may have had a few too many here and there you are how many times but you know Trump is a total T total or so from his perspective if you have one beer you about a problem with alcohol\nIs is the classic bite and then yes he he's never had a drink I'm not a drinker\nI can honestly say I never had a beer in my life okay\nSo one of my totally good traits [laughter]\nWhenever they're looking for something that I say I never had a glass of alcohol I've never had alcohol I guess you know for whatever reason [noise] can you imagine if I had what a mess that they would I'd be I'd be the world's worst [laughter] but I never drank I never drank okay\nHe's got a great sense of humor about himself when he does self deprecating there's no there's no question ah let's see what else do you have to say\nI Want it to be comprehensive I actually just a good thing for judge Kevin ... I think it's actually a good thing not a bad thing I think it's a good thing now with that being said I'd like it to go quickly\nAll right so that was pretty much this theme he wants it over fast but he says he claims he's he's given them full reign because one report came out from NBC that he was limiting the scope of the investigation that that does not\nSeem to be true that he could he claims much 'cause they're interviewing a lot of people\nThat they found is making this decision and I'm instructing them as per what the Senate is looking for\nAll right so it was putting on the Senate and he's being very deferential to the FBI who has spent months and months and months trashing over the deep state and the Russian collusion read a page has struck I thought this was interesting tell me who do you think he's talking about here\nI happen to know some of the United states senators\nAnd who is on the other side\nWho's pretty aggressive [noise]\nI've seen that person in very bad situations [noise]\nI've seen that person in very very bad situation somewhat compromising\nSo we can go down to ... well it's not that I was going to stop at Columbia jar [laughter] I don't think it's Coons I mean it can go and it was only forty nine of them right [laughter] I don't think is Bernie are probably not burned out I couldn't\nAgree I'm\nI'm Cory Booker I don't know ... ... well\nI don't know I ... during the break in here with something who do you think of it all like come on now I live I'm thinking he's\nProbably talking about ...\n... local guy exactly you know he's\nHe knew them longer yeah it's the only reason ... and he's known Schumer is I guess he's in general I bet Schumer he's known Schumer along having seen I've very long time absolutely I Can't imagine Schumer being aggressive or having to us just I just can't picture I don't know Adams' trimmer doesn't strike me as a drinker mail is ... and she's probably a\nCrazy that alcohol [laughter] it's terrible it's hardly a mover I'm surprised that they haven't been speculating\nAll over the over the media I think that's what we're doing really well but really I mean we're we're\nSeeing that with your data but

you know if it goes from the fuzzy allegation of sexual abuse to his college drinking I Know it's a totally ridiculous we're all going to get into\nWith Alex ... of ABC News political Allison just a couple of minutes that leads off the big three also in the big three this is a sad story the boy scouts who were plowed into a drunk driver on Long Island one of them sadly\nIs dead and this guy has been rained on charges he's out on bail but he said he had what three beers or something that the country club for he killed the boy scout and write thanks a lot of\nEnron and not the big three Carty

of all people he moderated the Pennsylvania gubernatorial debate which is we're going to some of the audio and\nIt was just weird anyway I got an email from a listener Steve ha ha you can email us directly at our website seventh and W. R. dot com slash leather Michael Steve said last night I was near Philly\nTons of people including other reporters arts weeding the Tribeca stunk ... one person on the news of the Tribeca spoke more about himself and lectured more than the moderator the even said he knew nothing about the state what\nIs your finger bringing a guy who lives in California for a sea moderating a pet that's stupid that just shows you how stupid politics has more on ec idea was it to bring in al extra back and we'll probably the Democrats than [laughter]\nThan you know pat said you're going to moderate the debate between Cuomo and ... you know who's a suggested was cardio\nDown next time\nYou're going to a game show host moderate have Bob Barker for having sex I'd be All right we're joined now by ABC News political analyst Alex ... good morning Alex loading\nSo Alex uh we started with allegations of sexual misconduct but it seems to me we are now devolve down the cabinet front into guinea have too many beers when he's in college it says to me that maybe those are sexual misconduct allegations are not holding up\nThey they didn't pan out but the good news is it's reviving the economy the stock market's up a couple of points it apparently is just beer sales\nYeah of course by the way\nIt was it's an endless quest by the Democrats shows apparently nothing short satisfy them\nAnd uh you know this is like a football game where the Democrats were losing late in the fourth quarter and they had a great idea hey why don't we play a fifth court or\nIf you guys are really that superior if your nominee is is innocent then let's keep playing until we decide whether he should be on the Supreme Court\nSo not unexpected a but it's having a political impact there's a Senate race in North Dakota Heidi Heitkamp ... threat senator who is now down ten points in a race that was pretty close\nBecause this uh I hate to use Trump's worse but a witch hunt against Kavanaugh\nHas energized the Republican Party\nInteresting so you use the analogy of football isn't is more like a ... in your estimation is this a Hail Mary pass\nI think so but it's having an impact the other way to suburban women in in districts are congressional districts where\nWhere you have a lot of white suburban college educated women they're still fired up now I don't think this is going to help Democrats as much as it's going to help Republicans because of the Democratic party was already on fire\nAnd you can't set fire on fire there were already they're already do stuff\nBut it's having that kind of impact I think on Republican so I think yes Kavanaugh has a good shot still getting confirmed\nWow huh here's something that I don't think the Democrats banked on ... just you just touched on that but let's explore further Alex\nWhite guys you know middle aged white guys like me are saying wait a minute we're going to go down a path where riled up feminists think the allegation stands on its own and it's about time these privileged white guys get theirs that is going to make me vote Republican\nAnd you're seeing exactly that happened out there look I mean I think Ford was a very believable witness in many ways but you wish you could have named at least one witness who could corroborate her allegations and do you wish that may be one of her\nClose friends Mrs Kaiser a headset or that she remembered something\nBut she didn't say that she said look I have no recollection of ever being at a party are gathering where Kevin always present so [noise] and you're right Michael I think what this reveals is that for Republicans this is about to people in who's credible but for Democrats\nThis is about Donald Trump and stopping Trump from putting someone on the court who would in their view set women back about a Woman's Journey to independence here and that is not something that a\nKavanaugh's ever going to be able to clear himself from\nA Roman Alex Cross the ... the NBC News political endless will read all their Alex was being disingenuous he says well that's going to make me vote Republican he was going to vote Republican\nAnyway so he's just got to it's going to make me how it's going to make me about twice twice but I my my concern\nIs in it and feel free to shoot this down because read all those with all the time I really thought the hearings expose the demeanor of cabin on and I and I thought there was some real questionable things that he did during that hearing it makes me wonder about his mental state to be on the bench\nI think some people saw it that way Lynn\nBut I think a lot of other folks saw this as a decent guy whose name has been drug through the mud who's had to sit down with his daughter at home ten year old daughter and explained that he's not a rapist\nAnd people saw that he was outraged and angry and he reacted the way they might have and so I think a lot of people saw Washington drag itself lower than it already was which we thought was nearly impossible\nAnd in line of good man so the Democrat argument now might be hey we can do outrageous things but you can't be outraged we can burn you at the steak but you can't make and we can politicized these hearings but if you object than you are politicizing uh the nomination\nSo I think thatch\nAgain Democrats I don't think they're going to pick up a single vote because of this but I Do think we now have a Republican Party which we didn't have before these hearings\nThose are the senators on that Judiciary Committee I think represented the Republican Party when it started they were hiding behind the skirts of a female prosecutor\nRight by the time it was over Lindsey Graham you know I I think Kevin are kind of picked up the fall and flag of a party and retreat\nAnd change course and charged and the Republican Party when with him so I think the Republican Party found his voice again in a way and I think it November's now going to be much closer because of Brett Kavanaugh's outrage\nInteresting now you mentioned Heidi Heitkamp but what about a democratic Senator Joe Manchin from West Virginia he's in a deep deep red state or do you think he might wind up voting for capital\nI think it will I think that one would certainly be the smart political thing to do he's been very careful not to or\nNot to indicate in any way he was going to vote against him so I think that a vote you still might get Heitkamp it's Collins and Murkowski that are going to be key but Jeff Flake is what I think Republicans better be prepared\nTo lose you know I think I think he has the courage to uh to try to build himself a business in Washington After he retired from the Senate\nI don't know if it was interesting on sixty minutes I don't want to get your take Alex so they asked them point blank or are you able to be this honest and forthright and uh I'm In critical eye and all these other things because you are not running for office\nYou said didn't didn't skip a beat said yeah I'm a stay at home\nI'm that week and\nPerhaps that's why his favorable rating and Arizona is in the single digits while of a week we asked these guys you go to Washington to fight for us and it turns out to LA a lot of them only have the courage to fight for themselves [noise]\nAlright ABC News analyst Alex ... thanks a lot for your time as always Alex we'll talk to you next week

to invalidate his nomination and I said it all depends on\nWhether or not he was lying All right let's go to Mike New Hyde Park Hey Mike what do you have to say to yourself\nAnd more than guys you

da\nDa da\nDa da da da de de ... be that's the way have you got to be\nA good idea like that I got back in the [laughter] and I got real gives me nightmares when I hear that\nAll right let's play some of the cuts from the morning shows or shall we I Want to hear what the Senator Sheldon Whitehouse a Democrat from Rhode Island from Rhode Island is heading to say about what does he have to say about this\nThat he was on good morning America\nUltimately I Do think that when somebody's coming before the United states that if they want to be the United States Supreme court judge tell us the truth and if they're lying about something that his disqualifying yeah\nSo you think that if all that they have and I don't think he's line is that he had a problem with alcohol when he was in high school and college that that should disqualify because he didn't admit to having a problem with alcohol he said he drank drank\nDid lie about what a devil's triangle was in your book in ... but no that that doesn't just as well if I Am you know if there was some kind of proved to distance than actually happened that would be it wouldn't be the crime itself I said from the beginning\nPlus the fact that this may have happened was not those qualifying but if it does turn out that they've got proof which they won't but if they did then the lying in the cover up would be disqualified\nI think that's fair to say I have no idea what movie means I have no idea until you explained it to me the\nEye and explain nothing from a shelter in White House\nI'm waiting to see what the FBI report comes back with I certainly would not rule\nThere's plenty to believe in what he said but again it's very hard to sort through this until you have the investigation which is why we push so hard to make sure that took place\nNow he was on the Senate Judiciary committee guy the White House\n[laughter] yeah I think I'd rather do the right to their evident ya ya White House\nWas at the White House his ambitions are right out there I can tell you the running for the White House let's hear from a Republican senator All right as a senator a Joni Ernst a this is from Iowa\nOr what message that sense to win an end and American Pie as that have we are innocent until proven guilty and there's some great country and I have absolutely no doubt after revealing a doctor for a testimony that show has suffered from something very traumatic in her lifetime\nSimply that corroborate some why from there when I went and I says that she brought fall where\nSo what does she's saying that women who come forward are they're the ones who are innocent until proven that are not in my cabinet no she's saying that she believes that something happened to Dr Ford but she's saying there's no editing all that the first part of this listen to the first part\nOr what message that sense when an end and American Pie as that have we are in a sense until proven guilty and it's\nOnly about the women are the she's taking a stand against her hyped up feminist sisters who want basically cabin ought to have to prove his innocence and she say no that's not how we do the right things in this country you are innocent until proven guilty I see a rapid feminists are flipping out on its head well that seems to\nBe a talking point that the people who don't want to discredit forward because they thought that would be non PC are saying we do think something happened to her but it's just not him that's ... that's that's the argument\nCorrect one of the question is there is no evidence to indicate that it was him well\nHow do you want with it what did he was on the calendar hooky a slide though either do it so that killed though I see you now you're just hurling unsubstantiated allegations out there to try to take you know I'm not I've been lifted that's why the FBI said again and I said all along\nLet them take a breath and investigate it and by the end of the week they come back and say we found nothing to corroborate move on\nBut yet but it's not going to come to a conclusion they're just getting like yeah you know I never heard of it is and then we're going to still put it out there and then we're going to be right back where it all started and the Democrats are going to come up with another reason is try to delay the the the ... the evidence\nIs day we talked to mark judge and mark judge has recanted his earlier testimony and he's told the FBI blah blah blah then they'll write it down without drawing conclusions do I think that's going to happen no I don't think it's going to happen\nBut that's why one of the one week which was not a big deal you guys beat me up over the one we were going to be in the same ... a week ago and already know worms well\nThey know and that's fine but ... but at least you took the week depends on a couple of wavering a ... like flake and Collins yeah mccaskey but at least you took the week which I think is a good boys I'm\nGlad you that the boys could thanks so you are so condescending over their Lenny beat [laughter]\nI got back let I got Reno nine eleven I got a headache every war that\nWe feel I miss ... be and what does\nThe Dave Clark five he runs Amazon although at the same as wave Clark Amazon's senior VP of worldwide operations ah by the way a Joni Ernst was on CBS uh Dave Clark\nHe was on good morning America and guess what Amazon's
