this rewind today's Len Burman and Michael real in the morning we'll be back with a new show Monday from six to ten on seven ten W. law\nJust always thought the story died down ... now if my math is correct in that these are two devices on the west side and the one in Florida that brings us up to Thirteen minutes rent a so that one has been confirmed in Florida that was headed for senator Cory Booker now the two at the postal facility on west fifty second street\nBetween eighth and ninth avenue Z the whole area's cordoned off it's a it's a isolated zone now two packages were found there and they say if it's the same kind of model of what the other packages where so\nI'm just wondering if these were all male the same time or if this uh this wacko is done it on a couple of a couple of days or three or you know whatever\nThat was interesting we had a Robert voice on former chief of detectives here in New York and he said he thought that they were getting near to 'em or Raleigh aspect\nI thought they had him and he was the one who first tip to soften said the rumor was Cory Booker and well he's plugged in he really is it turned out to be a so\nYou know what's interesting about how this investigation's going is similar to the bombings at the Boston Marathon is what they do is we deliver put these bombs together has to go buy all the materials yeah so they find the materials they examined the where are they sold them to go to that location look at the camera for videos you don't see any won't all different devices and everywhere you go look for the video\nAnd that's how they found the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing and they suspect they'll be able to do it with this one is well\nWell as a Robert Boyce pointed out if if one guy brought this to the postal facilities in in ... he had to be carrying a lot of them you know there should be video of him they're carrying a box of all these packages so\nWell that clearly leads our big three are the focus is twofold it's on that male facility in a block of but it's also now on the west side of Manhattan fifty second street uh you know the devices were probably sent from Florida but now there's another one heading for Cory Booker and and\nTwo of them in this facility in his Joe mentioned a moment ago one for James Clapper the former director of national security\nAnd the second one for Cory Booker also um critics yep all Trump why does Cory Booker get to see special he Spartacus will also a wasn't a Maxine Waters got we got two two okay well yeah OK and Andrew Cuomo didn't get a single one you said [laughter] you know a lot of it All right we should make life but when it might\nNot you know I think one of the things with this coming out of this is more of a political statement then you know an attempt to\nBlow up people yeah\nClearly if there's a you know if these are not real bombs right yeah and\nAlso in the big three guys here comes the cavalry the president wants to send eight hundred\nTroops to the southern border region already has many of the national guard there and rounding out the big three making Kelly is out at NBC's Today show and now they're in the go shooting her exit package and that should be a fascinating negotiation ... billion dollars what was the original contract retold with sixty nine to nine\nBig\nThan doing it to president before he became rented that way he had rain not even a day later on and on the day nine point nine per se\nAnd only hit you back to you [laughter]\nThat's right that's right they take\nNo prisoners those two they're funny [laughter] All right hey let's check in with W O R Weather Channel meteorologist race staging about the north east or re uh how uh how gusty on those winds going to be\nNo forty fifty miles per hour here in the city could go sixty on the eastern end while and in Cape Cod\nSo you know nothing to sneeze that certainly not the strongest a nor'easter or coastal storms that we've had but I put it right there in the middle not going to be we wouldn't be where the climbing re I think tomorrow morning between uh I'd say the early morning hours just before sunrise and about noontime heaviest rains strongest wins a could linger in the early afternoon\nA picture of the storm coming up the coast of South Jersey first central Jersey and then\nComing up and heading to New York city by the afternoon some unstable air comes in on the backside or make it a few thunder storms to Mars just just a just an indoor day miss a day to stay indoors or\nYou know maybe go on line to start your Christmas shopping what's he gonna be like on Sunday Sunday should improve um we'll get some dry weather in and it looks like a the dry whether it be accompanied by\nAh maybe some gusty winds at times but in terms of precipitation were most likely out of any significant ... uh I don't even think of any lingering showers even on into Sunday and see the sun start to pop out low fifties\nStill down below average by about ten degrees collapse of dry days coming into at least the early part of next week\nOr maybe some showers a mixed in there but the owner of this terrible several modified back to normal by Wednesday which is the low sixties but impacts heavy rain and could be some locally or a locally pond water on the roadway so that could be so will cause flooding strong winds may put some power around some spots\nAnd we've got the coastal flood it costs a flood warning noon until three tomorrow and then when devise real sort of effect too so well everything but snow from the storm has certainly going to be one that will keep you are probably indoors most of the ...\nOkay thanks a lot right okay go ahead and take care of every weekend\nWhile you're spending your evening with a replay of this morning show catches for a brand new Len Burman and Michael real in the morning Monday from six still than on seven ... W ...\nWanting everyone at nine ... and the story I Will go away and there are more developments\nThey don't have the uh the culprit yet they're focusing on a male facility uh north of Miami but um two more package has been located born in that Miami area it was intended for Cory Booker of course New Jersey senator\nAnd then a a facility now on the west side of Manhattan has been closed down the postal facility\nAt West with the second street between eighth and ninth avenue\nA one package originally NYPD has said too they dial it back to one it was intended for James Clapper the former director of national security also address to CNN the way John Brennan's was so it's quite a scene on the west side and Alice Stockton Rosie is right there and eighth avenue and ...\nWe just why the total containment vessel new then\nThey're removing a pipe bomb that was that now that was found in the post office this morning and they're going to take it up there right then\nAnd then go back down that will go back to our Quantico, Virginia where there\nAre taking a look at all of these type on that they found I think this is number eleven and that we got to find but on the theme we've got ESPN why a lot of elite counterterrorism unit lots of people standing around asking out what's going on like a reporter of like a\n... second three between eighth and ninth they shut down\nUm there is some traffic believing by here in North bound on eighth avenue um but it yeah it it otherwise shut down\nAnd ah we're expected to hear from the official on the scene here within the next half hour or so they tell us it's got to be a press conference and as you said this has all the markings of all the laws that have shown up in recent days\nAnd that way no word where they're coming from and who's sending them and what the deal because they're not\nDetonating stay away they're not detonating so is that part of this whole\nPlan they're not detonating that\nSeems to me ah being done on that uh

bit okay I\nAppreciate it Alice is great but uh she's at the scene of a so that's the eleventh and I guess this one in Florida will be the wealth that suggest that Cory Booker and she I thought that was going to be the end of it when we got the narrow thing the other day and and now it's gone I'm just wondering Liz and Liz is through the mail 'em all he um than assume I wouldn't bail 'em all the same time we're going to spread 'em out or what have\nI Would I Would imagine somebody like Dianne Feinstein would be on that list the worse off in my mind there would be on that list\nThere were some rumors out on that but nothing confirmed there were some rumors in LA but uh nothing nothing yet right and we we mentioned before the break they come out with a list of the highest\nPaid TV actors and actresses\nWho appear on shows though I have to believe the number one overall is going to be someone like a judge Judy and owns a generous but those those are syndicated show yeah different animal

Would check the offices of the Democratic National Committee focus\nAll of a hotbed of Republican right conservative oh no no go oh polo co op at\nYou listen this is getting fish here and ... year these bombs Len they didn't even work well they got a little explosive in van ... details misspellings are suspicious none of them were going to work Trump is absolutely\nRight when he says the meaty a media is getting hysterical over this comparing it to September eleventh please three thousand people were killed by terrorists and we've got some pipe bomber who can't even put the bombs together correctly\nIt's there's something going on here there's something going on here also in the big three Megan Kelly she is going to be out\nAt NBC she is trying to get all of that money ... million dollars ... and it's weird that we're she wants Ronan Farrow to be in on her meetings with NBC and the negotiations what's that ... got some dirt to spill she's got a little a hash tag ... stuffed\nBunnies all over the heck you the exact yeah Marines\nAnd rounding out the big three President Trump is sending eight hundred troops to the border as the caravan of middle Easterners moves\n[laughter] anyway you know that the common land their time and they're kind of cool it does you know and all that out\nSo you referenced the president's tweet that's where you were talking about this morning and I just did a really Bartlett was so excited oh this tweet is great I Love to I Need a ruling he tweeted out of three this morning he was still on last night or if he got up early to to come up with this brilliant miss of\nWhat I think he probably got up early yeah gotta get up early\nHere you go three hours ago folks to get us going\nFunny how lowly rated CNN and others can criticize me at will even blaming me for the currents spate of bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September eleventh\nAnd the Oklahoma City bombing yet when I criticize them they go wild and scream quote it's just that presidential yup yup\nYou can't compare these little pipe bombs that don't even work to the Oklahoma City bombing haired to end to nine eleven did that this is what the mainstream ... never heard this up they have those long faces on terrorism is gripping the country Chris Cuomo was going on and on and on about it last night and it all goes back to\nThe tone that this president has set by attacking the media ... are you watching CNN or you're not lose all your\nPoint of order who is it who calls the media the enemy of the people just asking\nWell he's got a point there oh ... I got to tell you I was ... I I was reluctant to say this but I you know I'm the media coverage was hysterical absolutely I mean nobody's life was really in danger here now and um you know I could see look at if the bombs exploded fine\nThat Bill Miller but I mean these were all ... relatively harmless things that we're sending the mail yet we're reacting is if we are under attack well I don't know what you're watching because I was just so much the same way you see you see\nChris ... Don Lemon out there in Salt on the media and it's all because of the president of the United states every moment they get they turn this into a way to bash inland I don't know if you're just blind when you watch these things that you agree with\nI haven't seen anyone compared to September eleventh or Oklahoma City bombing I haven't so maybe they have I have and so but in terms of the hysteria that has been attached to this\nWell I I Will say and I have ever feel in danger\nI ... well yeah my son works at CNN and he was freaked out and didn't want to go to work the other day yeah I've got so I've by us most as I did feel unsettled was like when they had anthrax that NBC that day and that's where I was real stuff I Know well we didn't do that now that would well now they're saying that Joe we didn't know that two days ago\nWe didn't know and so now they're saying well most of them than other couching it well many of these couldn't explode okay maybe they couldn't but we didn't know that when these first for coming out and number two\nThe idea that the president ... zero responsibility for any of his rhetoric or anything he is done on his side that's just unfair\nWhy should he accept responsibility for his rhetoric Glen when the media is read Latin list and it's a tack on him and he fights back he's got nothing to do with it ever came up with the idea to send these pipe bombs whether they're fake bombs are real bonds you cannot blame the president for that you simply can't lend\nI think your flights leaving for four [laughter] I figure if you don't go off my God I was just ... I think there was a very\nWell [laughter] I Will repeat myself you know I Do as well he's the one who said it's just fine and dandy for congressman Weiner dog and a\nAnd and I felt that brought a bomb you know but you can't excuse the president of language an actress beat up the protest\nFirst I'll pay for and listen if I can say Maxine Waters gets out there in that you get it not face ... how do you always seems to\nHe's the president of United States and he if he wants to fight fake news doing with facts which she seems incapable of doing he is\nDoing to them and they want to destroy him now I I don't listen I don't agree\nThat I Would say that that that it's all the mainstream media it's all of that I Do say that he has to ... except some culpability for him to totally deny deny deny call for unity and been slammed the media again is this typical of this guy and I think it's wrong\nWhat to say that one more time on [laughter] I Will though I Will hey let's go let's\nGet another voice maybe of reason and here Rob on ocean side New York morning Rob\nShow up you know what honestly you know it's just like to comment on Syria he's already killed ... President Trump is\nHow do we even know Judy let's get the facts ditch debt free judging this whole thing like the Michael Brown ... remember one Obama came out on this story recall dog just start\nI remember that when he was sent to try to grab it ... it ruined that guy's life you know they got a call ... ... in this man says he put his hand on the little\nGuys yes they were that they asked\nHim I didn't like it because that person wedding Clinton news network was which was upset because you know when they dumped faced but we'll see\nWhat else [laughter] it was right they were all\n... did you have the same Kool Aid laced with that ... this morning to go down\nI just I'm just tired of it you know they're still working guy like medium forgot person like me for the past eight years as soon as I should have been slapped down by a man or a judge to the world for America\n... to apologize for America now regardless of President Obama met them and I I still respect the office I wouldn't go around so that people or show people that go after people eat them up to them that's not my style\nBut at a restaurant you're pressurized by oh no no no\nNo no I just think I just think that the people it relates to the people law because it's frustrating it's really frustrating ... and the ... you see some of the shuttle Mitch McConnell getting arise you see chick who's getting harassed it's never on it it's a little clip\n... and I said it's wrong to Rob I agree with you on that that's wrong All right when we come back a nor'easter is headed our way we'll get out the umbrellas with W O R weatherman race age it\nIs a ... wind to today's Len Burman and Michael needle in the morning catch them live Monday from six built in seven in ...\nAnd I think you're right I don't think they'll ever learn okay here's the story of fifty eight year old Manhattan man died was a mystery woman he met her\nOn okcupid is that a site we have about ... ... ... a dating app so it was last Anthony knows about it\nAnd see what do we know about okcupid grinder Naga grinder ... not in there All right so uh he's our sister producer get off the track Anthony down\nAnyway this guy a dime with her at the ... you know the skill lemme tell a restaurant and battalion most of the restaurants I don't know that one well the couple headed back to his Upper East side apartment according to authorities mhm that quick Nike cap and the woman asked them for twenty dollars\nAnd at that time grab this ten thousand dollar vintage all our gay watch and took off\nBy ... so how did you get off his wrist I guess maybe had taken it off when he got into the apartment who knows the scam happened all the crime and what I call it a scam but that's why I said well all men ever are and how many times when we had these stories out or it happens all the time and how many people have ten thousand dollar watching\nThe man said that the his state's spoke Croatian ropes and he said he never saw the woman or the time peace again ... really surprise suspect is described as tall with dark hair all the ...

that and she said why would a pretty late like that be spoken away like a ... you don't want to get it if\nYou ever want to get a glimpse of a cut of the real Mary Tyler Moore her ... and see her in the movie ordinary people home she says she plays ... mother who's right and really good and\nShe was wonderful and the Mary Tyler Moore show us oh and I met some uh Valerie Harper when I'm trying to think of the people I mean those were actually met at one time or another\nI had a a just a quick story for I had a friend an actor and he was a guest on the Mary Tyler Moore show and he arrived or for their first reading the script and all the chairs were out there and Betty White was there\nAnd he said he was the guest actor and he said where should I said and the Betty White's oh sit anywhere where democracy around here so we sat in the middle charged oh no no that's ...\nThat's ... democracy so what do you make it a president Mattis\nMay sign up the defense secretary may signed the order today Trump wants between eight hundred thousand troops on the southern border this was an addition to the Twenty one hundred National Guard soldiers that he's already spread out along the southern border this was the combat the caravan heading this what got no problem\nWith that you got what seven to ten going maybe to fourteen thousand people come in there who knows who's in their gang members terrorists we have no idea\nComing our way we've got to secure the border this is precisely what the troops should be used for all the image that are coming to write you a falafel carts right in the ... being pushed over here we got to get the anyway I don't really know national\nGuardsmen ... over there don't they just uh offer support to the customs and border people they don't actually get out there and do the work they actually do backup or and all that so I don't know what the troops are going to do but the okay\nUm well what do you what do you I should be done I guess let him come in you know\nI've said like I'm a proposed do lend something has to be done at seven thousand people thought they were not coming in okay what's the some of them are going to get in okay and they come into your house because you said you have to do and when I was under the border and wave and go back\nOK okay we've been round the bend a hundred times how about Sarah Huckabee Sanders was left to defend the president yesterday because he's being attacked by the ... well you guys called the mainstream media they say he\nShould in some way be held partially responsible for all the rhetoric that's going around the these days with these so called bombings anyway eras Sarah Huckabee Sanders yesterday\nWe're going to continue to do everything we can to provide the resources they need to investigate and hold the person or persons responsible for that I fully accountable\nOkay so then of course you went on to say one person who's not responsible in any way ...\nThere's a a big difference between I comments made and actions taken the president is certainly not responsible for sending suspicious packages\nTo someone no more than Bernie Sanders was responsible for a supporter of his shooting up or Republican baseball field practice last year the idea that this is that the hands of the president is absolutely\nOh that's right the media was an angry mob there Germany screaming voter there'd be stowed very that I'd had their push for it I thought I ... and uh\nObviously she went out to talk about how negative the media is towards Donald Trump in some quarters\nNinety percent of the media attention around this president is negative despite historic a job creation despite the fact that our economy is booming despite the fact that trade deals that everybody said couldn't be made had been Nate despite the fact that the president is trying to solve law and order at our border\nAnd we get Sarah how can we do like PR worked for this show I mean really she we could do the rug\nVia wonderful show us the best show ever she is very skilled at what she does I have to say a very good at what you do that otherwise Sean spicy spicy boy\nYeah the president is going to continue to lay out the case and the differences between Democrats and Republicans Americans have a choice to make and he's gonna lay that out and you're going to see him do that\nYeah he used by the ... you know some presidents\nKind of lay back in the midterms and he's boys right out there no this is all on him in in some way this is a rallying them on him galvanizing\nThe base we shall see I guess the Democrats still our favorite to take the house but it's going to be quite a night well you know you see all kinds of\nPolls some are even summer up some are down looked like they can't take the Senate anyway it's going to be crazy it's coming up soon everyone hey uh coming up how the mighty and rich have fall and the Megan Kelly saga we shall discuss\nUp here and joined us rewind today's Len Burman and Michael real in the morning we'll be back with a new show Monday from six till ten on seven ten W ...\nShe was good at Fox playing the tough question or the prosecutor because she is a lawyer\nMa coming from the right but then when she decided she wanted to be all warm and fluffy in the morning nobody bought it the viewers just did not buy her that only right no absolutely funny and and they're not going to embrace somebody who's phoney and they got rid of someone I really liked I'd a camera hall Dyarman who is great without they had that I Would do very\nWell I was on the show with them all the time and by the time right now has her own talk show coming up with Disney which is Great Hey I'm Monica in Westfield New Jersey you one of the way I always story Monica\nGood morning I'm Megan Kelly than ever since the first date however I live in LA I mean I feel that\nShe would say it in the context of the character of paying somebody habits they led by Diana Ross and I got to put a white face Diana Ross okay I think we're\nComing down to either that's all\nI but I see Monica Monica well she's gone now but I mean you have to understand that blackface is deeply offense\nThey have to African Americans you can't they used to call it black dumped you know they would put the charcoal on their face and do a minstrel show that is racist and offensive and it touches a raw nerve in this country and she just went right for it blended into it\nYeah but again I think that was her only offense heard ratings were great they say hey there's a little sensitivity training I Apologize you know let's let's\nBring most she tried to apologize to well your apology but then she brought on a block of the blocks that came out like our broker but then she said I Melvin said that bone headed thing where she said it in her apology and and I learned\nThat that um minstrel shows in blackface are offensive to African Americans I learned she just learnt that now by just talking to al ... you're talking about this\nI learned that given the history of blackface used an awful way by racist in this country it is not okay for that to be part of any costume Halloween or otherwise I've never been at the same kind of person\nAll right well she goes on from there hey this is where a Dan hope well junction dead you agree with me about something\nI I I find that I see it it's a dark day land I\n[laughter] really I Do they\nMake you Kelly has it raises your body I just think she unfairly way choked Patrick you don't\nOkay I draw a line [laughter] but I just do things to slip by the time that was silly and uh I I don't think she should I I think they had it out for a good show\nWasn't doing well the ratings were down this was a way to get her out of that multi million dollar contract\nYou know anyway she's fighting that she's finding their claw all over sixty nine million bucks we'll see if she get ...\nWe we we can find common ground and politics\nThan you and I are going to go out to have some beers we might\nWe might my baby don't don't limit yourself yet then you know we're trying to go into exile when I talked to di\nDi di di di feel bad about that I I oh your luggage when you said that we're happy to drink before we meet with the big brass last week yeah and I offered\nTo pay I said I'll get it and he offered I said no let me get a boy that while I went back so fast and then the brass to him and they picked it up so we got off well like I said you came to my neighborhood because we're right across the street from where we you know I'm trying to be polite nice you're supposed to say absolutely not no this one's I didn't you didn't\nFile for a second [laughter] when I go into those for a new car and I it's not the best you Okay John in Brooklyn and what do you have to say John what's up\nHey good morning guys Megan Kelly who I Am not a huge fan of both like every commonsense person who would say if a white individual wants to portray a African American individual you need to change the pigmentation love your skin but you actually need to do that to portray the character or the individual\nEddie Murphy did it in the Nineteen eighty and that task ... where he was an African American undercover as a white person knows anything about it so like any comments that person would say well I Need to figure dish and I'm like in your the makeup to do that\nYeah but can equate with a wife and yet the minstrel and\nSee what the problems we keep coming up with different rules for people like Michael you said before this is equally offensive to some of the problem is you don't have a right in America to not be offended we can't run a country or a society based on who's going to be a senator who isn't going to be offended when we get away from being free\nBut ... John an employer does not have to put someone on the air Hussein something that's offending a large part of the audience and you have to understand with blackface and the minstrel shows when white people\nPut on the black face they were exaggerating stereotypes of African Americans that and that's what our lately and when they were advocating\nMegan Kelly was not staying you're advocating that we get away from commonsense evaluation of what people are saying that's the point\nI hear you John ... thanks for the call out she said something really just really stupid\nAnd uh you know I think that was the final straw but listen when guests are going to pull out I'm sure advertiser listen television networks are very sensitive if you can't get gas and you can join the ratings and you can't get advertisers much like this show\nIs not going to be you can't get any of that stuff you're not going to be an existence for but you you agree with the black face is a ... Oh absolutely who's just a question I just I think she was just being stupid things I really I don't know you never know what's in someone's hard I'm not sure she was being racist so dumb thing coming up next the there was another debate\nI've ever ever heard of senatorial candidate chele Farley well now you will be we're enjoying this rewind to today's Len Burman of my career in the morning we'll be back with a brand new show Monday from six to ten on seven then wor [noise] hey\nGood morning everybody now have you need any more evidence that politicians just lie through their teeth lend oh yeah who's talking about talking about the president again no senator Kristin Jill a brand and oh she pledges\nShe pledges into debate the debate yesterday was a shell Farley she pledge not to run for president if she wins I Will serve out\nMy six year term she says oh right she's been in this state for about three days last month she'd been in every other state running around including New Hampshire where they have this thing called the New Hampshire primary yeah\nLike she's going to serve out the six terms she's got to be running for president she will lose but she's got her while you're saying I just\nIn general don't you think for someone who's a senator from a major state like New York how off the radar she is most of the time how that would pay any attention I mean at least at least Schumer does this little Sunday news conferences you know he's there and every so often comes up with some good ideas but but I don't know what you know she's just out there I don't know if she\nDoes the only thing she ever that she appears on the on the left leaning in National Public radio appears on that from time to do it I mean she's ... she's up they're testing the waters in New Hampshire she's clearly going to be running for president lying through our teeth at the debate and yet of course you still going to win because this state is so deep blue will elect any\n... Republicans don't lie is just the Democrats rely is that how we are and I'm just pointing out she line you know you don't believe her do believer I don't know I don't care if she's around for years as your senator\nWearing a she has so she did a debate with shell Farley who's no one's ever heard of\nAnd and who are here ... brand is going to kill in this election bud of the debate was on channel seven they're going to air it on Sunday so boy huh I guess it pointed TV viewing here's a here's Jula brand I guess as as as you'd expect to tar kind of got around to the president\nAcademic has hand racist and anti Muslim act immigrant homophobia and so I Believe we need to have a role model in the White House I don't think the president has done that and he's in ...\n... more than saying well my opponent senator Taylor brand wants to abolish ice which is the group that actually is primarily responsible for for ... we can't allow that to happen\nAll right so there you go as you that's a must must see TV well\nThe latest poll has Farley trailing ... brand by twenty five percent so I don't really I don't think the debates gonna swing things one way or the you know I just can't believe\nPeople of the state will certainly downstate because we upstate or is are proper Republican 'cause you down state or you know don't vote for any of the any hack the Democratic party puts forward so\nThey are ... are you going to be around now this is something I'm interested in yeah gotta level Chuck Grassley when he was a ball of fire wasn't and he was so Judiciary Committee hearings he has a yes he had a he was chairman of the jump to Sherry committee he's asked the Justice Department to investigate Julie sweat Nick\nAnd your pal Michael ...\nFor false allegations they made against judge cabinet now you may remember ... came out with this very suspicious Julie sweat Nick who claimed\nNobody bought this story\nThat Kavanaugh would get girls ... and go to parties where a gang rapes occurred and then she went on NBC and managed to backtrack on things\nContradicted parts of her testimony so good for all chuckles Grassley the hold them to the fire and investigate whether or not they lied and they you know they spoke under oath when she twins us defied well\nAn artist is bring it on them will get all the facts you always wants to bring it on so I don't know for the fun I Hope I Hope they expose ... for the alliance snake that he will say maybe ... maybe ... maybe ... they got some real facts hum and you don't believe the island of ...\nSeriously Mandel did you believe that ...

them\n... why I guess they think America is the land of opportunity I don't have the answer for you I guess they've they like our country better than theirs that's all I can say it's because they are being encouraged to leave by the corrupt people who run their country that could be to\nKnow what I said they're leaving a wine and roses this supposedly corruption and gangs whatever\nListen I'm a good point about their hair cut so that wasn't very cute point and very self facing on his part\nThan they look better that either [laughter] I like to see\nFrom our lives I Hope you're enjoying his rewind today's Len Burman and Michael real in the morning we'll be back with a new show Monday from then on seven ten W O R [noise]\nEverybody Joe's got some good news for us yeah breaking news yeah let's go to this uh this is a coming\nTo us from our friends that channel for the police department investigating another suspicious package this at the intersection of a postal facility on west fifty second street between eighth and ninth avenue that area\nHas now been shut down of course meant that suspicious package at the time Warner center last night it turned out to be just some Christmas toys with Christmas rap\nNot quite sure about the significance of this but uh it's under investigation and adding to this we are working to put this one together too that there may be an eleventh package now that was a in the mail to senator Cory Booker of New Jersey\nBill well we're looking at that one of the latest details coming up at night like Governor Cuomo was really gonna feel left\nOut [laughter] you know you got a mailbox right hey let's check\nIn now with the W. O. R. movie minute man Joe ... good morning to you Joe alright\nSo uh we got we got like a hunt for Red October movie here another a submarine thriller hunter\nNew battle stations battle stations it's actually a really fun movie all I Love submarine movies I actually you know when I was a kid I grew up watching you know just the bottom of the the hunt for Red October is to me one of the great action movies of the of the eighties early nineties but this one's really fought now do for those of us who didn't go to the you know the\nNaval Academy in Annapolis the hunter killer it's a kind of attack submarine that's designed to specifically attack and think oh their submarines\nAnd there's a a U.S suffering that goes down under Russian waters and drug butler plays the salty old dog who had it has to go aboard a hunter killer and figure out what happened and it turns out that there's\nThere's a a I'm not going to getting away with the Russian President and his team I had been taken captive in their in their homeland by a rogue agent age and another you know a a bad Russian essentially\nDid they ask him if he is very narrow election did that you\nThink it's a computer game and a four hundred pound guy we're sitting at a time and so you know it almost reminds me of in some ways of like\nAn early eighties bond film you know uh like octopus here they've got some really great action sequences I'm getting at three stars with a lot of fun and I think that you know some rain movies themselves I think are kind of cool because there's just like the the claustrophobic atmosphere and the you know the guys at the controls and\nThings like well the best the best one of all time was ... to remember that when John booth yeah the charming film exactly automatically talking about the claustrophobia and that one that's\nCrazy to end and then it was like you five seven water them Crimson Tide actually with Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington that's a great what this what what this suffers from a little bit is it's got\nIt's got a little bit of a bargain basement cast Gary Oldman is obviously great and just won an Oscar in ... and there was the secretary of defense but you know Gerard Butler is the is the you know the main submarine captain and then there was living in a cart lenient comment like there's sort of it's they could've been a little bit more money out of cash but what they didn't spend on the cat\nThey spent on the effects of it looks really cool and then there's like a Navy SEAL team that kind of goes in and kind of has to attack from from on the land\nUnless like all the way the Senate badly said this sounds really cool let's listen to this\nLanguage debate and [noise]\nThen you're going [noise]\nInteresting I mean what's going on there right

cloudy like fries and low fifties\nPleasures many or evening without a replay of this morning show catch just for a brand new ... and Michael Ritalin morning Monday six the fan on seven sent wor\nDefinitely felt the story died down my ... now if my math is correct in that these are two devices on the west side and the one in Florida that brings us up to Thirteen rent\nA so that one has been confirmed in Florida that was headed for senator Cory Booker now the two at the postal facility on west fifty second street\nBetween eighth and ninth avenue is the whole area's cordoned off it's a it's a isolated zone now two packages were found there and they say if it's the same kind of model of what the other packages where so\nI'm just wondering if these were all male the same time or if this uh this wacko is done it on a couple of a couple of days or three or you know whatever\nThat was interesting we had a Robert voice on former chief of detectives here in New York and he said he thought that they were getting near to 'em or Raleigh aspect\nI thought they had him and he was the one who first tip to soften said the rumor was Cory Booker and well he's plugged in he really is it turned out to be a so\nYou know what's interesting about how this investigation's going is similar to the bombings at the Boston Marathon so what they do is you know the the Web or put these bumps again there has to go buy all the materials yeah so they find the materials they examined the where are they sold them to go to that location look at the camera for videos you don't see any all all different devices and everywhere you go you look for the video\nAnd that's how they found the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing and they suspect they'll be able to do it with this one is well well\nAs a Robert Boyce pointed out if if one guy brought this to the postal facilities in in ... he had to be carrying a lot of them you know there should be video of him they're carrying a box of all these packages so\nWell that clearly leads our big three are the focus is twofold it's on that male facility and ... but it's also now on the west side of Manhattan\nThe second street uh um you know the devices were probably sent from Florida but now there's another one heading for Cory Booker and and two of them in this facility in his Joe mentioned a moment ago one for James Clapper the former director of national security\nAnd the second one for Cory Booker also am critics yep all ultra might assume Cory Booker get to see special he Spartacus will also a wasn't a Maxine Waters got we got two two okay well you know okay on them and Andrew Cuomo didn't get a single one you said a lot of it All right we should make life but when it might\nNot you know I think one of the things that it's coming out of this this is more of a political statement then you know an attempt to\nBlow up people yeah clearly if there's a you know if these are not real bombs right yeah and\nAlso in the big three guys here comes the cavalry the president wants to send eight hundred troops to the southern border is already has many of the national guard there\nAnd rounding out the big three making Kelly is out at NBC's Today show and now they're in the go shooting her exit package that should be a fascinating negotiation ... billion dollars what was the original contract for a total of sixty nine to nine\nMillion wow and I wonder if there's something in your contract that says ah she doesn't get as much as she wants if she says something offensive on the air I don't know if that standard procedure for big\nBlue I'm just wondering sometimes that's the story came out that Ronan Farrow who broke the story on Harvey Weinstein and the ...\nOriginally had offered destroyed NBC and they passed the the story is that a meeting Kelly wants Ronan Farrow there for the ... because it sounds like she's trading off some information\nCouldn't the interest to help her own costs ... ... the last take me to going on over there\nBut again my feeling is if ah if ah the ratings are strong on the show uh she's still be there this is basically was the last straw\n... they didn't they didn't care for all right it's time for a hour a superstar gas\n\n[noise] yeah I have it in the cloud two major major TV shows how are you sir\nI'm just fabulous thank you are kept denying well are kept it

... and the story I Will go away and there are more developments they don't have\nThe uh the culprit yet they're focusing on a male facility uh north of Miami but um two more package is located in Miami area it was intended for Cory Booker of course in New Jersey senator\nAnd then a a facility now on the west side of Manhattan has been closed down the postal facility at West with the second street between eighth and ninth avenue\nA one packet originally NYPD has said too they dialed it back to one it was intended for James Clapper the former director of national security also address to CNN the way John Brennan's was so it's quite a scene on the west side and Alice Stockton Rossellini is right there and eighth avenue and ...\nWe just why the total containment vessel new then it
