{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "Now I guess Alan has a back issue so he needs a sturdy chair okay I guess Alan walk back in and in Penn but just didn't care one bit and he's like well you know a kind of need that chair and it was like I really don't care and oh you really don't care and they got no little argument over that it is done and that escalated quickly as they said in a\nVery how far they were they throwing punches at each other did it reached that point because they they were separated like they name and fly on the same flight back home and then they didn't work together for the rest of the year\nAnd that was it I guess I guess the chairs were flipped and then that was kind of the whole thing they turn the one over they would've used and one thing led to another and it got worse and worse\nI imagine you know those play by play jobs or baseball or like\nHow are you weren't your own life\nTo get into one of those seats and then over that seat you are losing your gig and a boy okay\nAll right uh this happened over the weekend do you like it when when you no matter whether it's Fox or a T TBS when they interview the manager\nDuring the during during the during the game you like that do I like it now it's a waste time do you think the managers like do you think they might have something else they need to do during that time\nProbably not but uh yeah I'm I'm sure they don't enjoy it will not much to do in the ...\nThank goodness to the Internet and anyone still has a satellite in a back seat we found out or what Terry Frank owner was doing right before hazel may went for the interview [noise]\nSome very\nFrank on it was getting set to do the interview and hazel may ran down there and there's actually a screen shot of it from the ... call that uh he was running up the stairs and you know zipping up he'd he'd go [noise]\nThat's a quick uh by so that was on live t._v. no that\nWas on the ... anyone who had it like on the satellite if you get like the ... if you're watching one of those one of those big old dishes they used to have in the backyard and somebody on the Internet caught that if you were if you call it the raw feed of it and went out over a over a certain place and we and we caught a that Terry Frank oh a little bit like coming back\nYeah that will ... ... those Rafi they used to see the raw feeds when I worked at MIT dot com and you you you do occasionally get some different views than you do in the standard telecast\nWhen they are a narrow way Bella quite like that no but uh we knew Terry Franklin was a little busy up but he made it in time for the interview in and get it done so up business was a\nCompletely ... ready to roll and that's all I got for the sports side of it not well thank you ah bringing bringing the oddities to the table\nLittle juice [laughter] then there's no more juice unfortunately to\nSide I did three two one zero seven then take quick break a closed things out sports

that's go family cared dot com Callie three three four six seven eight to five night for Medicaid plans from up to my health\nThe W O R sport with McCarthy [noise]\nSports guys on to talk about but\nVery nothing exciting sports wise happening right now it was it that we got\nSome some hockey games happening in the pre season basketball no football no baseball it's October or is this supposed to be the peak of the sports calendar and it's pretty much dead tonight or tomorrow again no baseball but\nHuge game for the giants and uh the eagles the eagles are needed when as well or the defending champ sitting there are two and three\nAnd and then finally baseball returns on friday is the Dodgers and brewers will start things up it really is a shame you know as much as you might be happy for Mets fan and people I met the listeners here that the Yankees are done it would've been\nGood to see a game five tomorrow night and and have that kind of juice and and that kind of exciting to have a game five in one of these series a dab all of them wrap up so quickly and we only play two games over the minimum\nUh this first round yeah two sweeps into for game series\nWas on a whole lot of serious drama that had built up to start things off and it's where baseball is lucky that\nThey have those wild card games and you start with a punch and not only the wild card games this year but the tie breakers in the national league at least that gives things a little bit of a running start but then not much momentum here you have a couple of days off\nAnd finally a will hit those ... games Dodgers brewers\nI think it'll be an interesting match up I'm not over Lee enthralled by it um I like\nThe brewers in that series that I really do I I just love with Josh ... can do for them out of the pen they hit against Colorado or they have a lot of different ways to ... they're not just power hitting team they have\nSome different things they're able to do Christian yell at just the kind of star that plays out in the postseason whereas you know John Carlos Stanton who so dependent on the\nPower it's hard to\nContribute in every single game and you just don't have that many games or in a best the five best seven series you know those guys they can either be monumental important or slump\nBut it was someone like Christian yell at you that's the kind of hit or that he could do a lot of different things you can beach in a lot of different ways you can head doubles and the gap she can hit the homerun ... can\nSteal a base if need be a step brewer seem they got a lot going for them the Dodgers are very deep and that has the strength of bears um but you got Los Angeles Milwaukee Milwaukee's great baseball town as well it's football first the Packers but when the brewers are good people get ramped up about that there\nAnd then at AOL see as bad as as as good as anything I thought Indians Astros was probably going to be the match up of the best teams that you'll see this postseason\nUnfortunately it was just such a sweet the ashes just wrecked the Indians there were never really saw it so now you know maybe ... Red Sox will give us a little more drama in that series and even though the red Sox won a hundred and eight games\nAre there significant underdogs to me in that series him for all the reasons I didn't like the red Sox in the series against the Yankees I don't think any of that changed\nUh yeah I had the middle relief\nStand up but they didn't exactly change your mindset about them yeah they got a couple of scoreless innings last night from Matt Barnes and Ryan ... but those aren't the guys that you want pitching in a\nBig spot and they showed us much they went to their ... sale when they needed three outs in the eighth to Bridget to Craig Kimberlin wild chemicals in human and that night then I think you'll be fine\nAs these playoffs go along and you'll probably be stronger for having survived that situation there in the Bronx but that's what worries me about the the Red Sox is bridging that gap that is so vital\nIn these post seasons and against an Astros seem they're just going to come keep coming at you in waves or they're not going to stop a George spring it's just been unbelievable in the postseason seems a Homer every single playoff game going back to last season so\nThat should be a lot of fun though a one hundred and eight when a Red Sox table one hundred and three when\nAstros team uh they all have enough pieces to get things done but I Do think the red Sox have a real key weakness when you look at the calendar at this point in October and then you know the winter that American League series they're going to be big favorites\nAnd the world series so those two teams the Astros and Red Sox are just far better than the Dodgers and the brewers but uh as we know things can change relatively quickly over the next couple of weeks a starting pitcher could a\nPop up in the bullpen and and totally change things around and become you know stood back there is something that the red Sox be hoping for\nA and it'll be interesting to see now its core manage against this former team is terrific is coral was in a series against the Yankees or will he maintained that might it's touch because every single move that alec score a maid worked out\nYou know all I Love all the theories my my favorite serious you wanted to make more money which I you know I I wholeheartedly\nYeah remodeled later I also listen she has been dealing with a lot she was governor during a hurricane she's been working nonstop for years ... years old with\nBegan you know that's actually hate John Bolton I suspect but anything they said publicly you know it wasn't true so uh it could be you know first theory is that both men\nAnd pump pale are getting all the publicity and they've taken over and they're they're running the show and that's kind of shoved back of the line I don't know if I buy that one I Do buy the theory that uh that she wants to make more money and now she's not making much as having to do as\nShe she all she has to do was appear on television and she's going to get more people interested in her than looking at palm pay on bold and with his walrus moustache for God's sake\nAlright that leads up the big three else in the big three now here's something Lenin I did not see coming even though it's named after me hurricane Michael a couple of days ago were sitting around say nah I shall we talk about this thing it looks like it's going to be nothing all of a sudden practically overnight this hurricane is gone from\nA category one to a category for they are evacuating the Florida Panhandle and this thing looks like it could be absolutely devastate\nWell if you look at the uh the video that they show ya on television of this satellite imaging and this thing's a monster storm huge and you know a category for that's a hundred and forty mile an hour winds I Know that's a blow over your grass hot there on the panhandle so Mike ... oh whatever ... you know\n... blood on the panel and handle don't have homes they had a grass homes down there I did that literally Ohio I lend a lens people there in my eye and that's all he care yeah people in the adult grasshoppers and I didn't say that that they have no teeth\nAnd now the raccoons listen to that I mean you hear all these little says ... ladies and gentlemen this is all read all the events what lines to really they lemon grass hides once you've gone crackers while you're at it I Know I'm going to leave that to you\nThat view I mean what do you say they don't have teeth I made it through they marry their cousins down there [laughter] grad sides\nAnd rounding out the big three well\nFarewell to the New York Yankees they lost last night to the red Sox the season is over with for the Yankees I read something lend that perhaps you can explain to me ah because I Do read the sports pages these days to try to keep you bust up what's right so just try to keep up with\nSomebody said that the Yankees were kind of like a Potemkin village team they ...\nThey looked good on the surface but when you dig down deep there's not much there is that a fair criticism of the you know what the hell is he talking about what else Potemkin villages that someone who sells a pathologist a fake village Mendez rate by behind it is it's just a facade there's not a movie set yeah exactly\nWell is that fair criticism I Know yes\nAnd no I've said from the beginning of ... I said earlier you guys never listen when I got to a production right I said the political you never want to production now well I'll just say the uh\nUh ... I said at the beginning I thought the uh starting push it will be a little problem and that has been a front so\nThat that's all there on paper you see what the starting pitching is and that's what the demand was the starting pitching by the way when it comes to productions you guys are ragged on me yesterday\nLet me explain something you say well who's going to win the game I don't know who's going to win the game\nSo of course I said I was leaning toward the red Sox led by what would you ever divorce wasn't above the horse you guys weren't going to bring up you'd only bring it up if I had said oh I think the actor's gonna when they do rag ... the red socks laying high point and I had to put the screws on you to get a production out of and it wasn't able to predict the mayor explain why\nBecause you never know when sports let me tell you about oh wow who know let me tell you about my favorite prediction yeah\nBefore then Nineteen eighty Olympics\nThe Russians play the U.S hockey team that is a Square Garden the Russians beat the U.S hockey team tend to three I went on television and someone sent me the tape recently went on TV on channel two is that why bother having the Olympic Hockey tournament just take the gold medals right now and send them to Russia\n... oh you heard of the miracle on ice oh yeah well so that's why I'm not a godsend for ... you know my\nFavorite production of all time was that Hillary Clinton will when the two thousand\nWriting president I learned I learned that the audience last night in the Bronx\nShowing on tap founded slowly fire suffer\nMy challenge this call that's\nWhat happened so that was on the ... a W E either Boston station of joke is typically on and uh I'm a Vietnam ... anybody was anybody await for this but apparently there was a video replay so there were all jumping around on the mound and celebrating\nThan they have to stop and there's a video replay they confirmed yes he was out then they started jumping again\nSo you get time out in the jail around the previous game that got it wrong three times so in the first couple of\nAngel he named as the umpire was just brutal yeah and it was the whole played out by our last night they were complaining about a blue Yankees Red Sox though did a great job anyway and now they play the Houston yeah astronaut he used to the astronaut had like a really good looks and uh you know that's just the Dodgers and the ... I Do ah\nAll right Lynn what share production or am I but it was ... who is going to the world series the two teams I like the best the way they are playing or if you ... the Milwaukee I just went over the red Sox yeah I just love the way he uses playing I think the tremendous baseball team that we do\nA little bit underrated 'cause we don't see him as much as the red Sox either the red Sox are great\nHere's why here's another British and whoever wins the American league championship series within the when the world series but\nI think Milwaukee is like one of the unknown great teams out there was a loud noise used them regularly a fortune teller today looking into his uh sports criminal guy can't wait until the Dodgers Red Sox World Series I was outside and you'll rag all over me you know who really wants Dodgers red socks of course the TV and\nRadio people you know that that'll be the big ratings wherever a Houston Milwaukee World Series will not be a big\nRatings success there obviously smaller markets and not as well known around the country I Would do learn I I agree I I think Houston is probably going to win at again there are ... are very rhetoric solid all around all around bullpen starting pitching starting lineup speed a defense that they were terrific to you know\nI'm gonna have to watch one of these games\nJust ... they're called ... that way I thought they were they asked her well as you know they came into the national league the same year as the New York Mets yellow and I ... yeah and you know what their nickname was it was not the Astros when they came in and they were the Houston Oilers\nIncorrect forty fives the cult Cody ... can you imagine the Baltimore Colts when they do that all of our calls but that wasn't about gun this was an issue I got I got away from home now because I don't know anything they talking about if you had the baby after a cult forty five on an era of God's a dead\nYou know the Washington Bullets or the basketball team they change their ...\nYou know that's probably more controversial now than be named after Native Americans if you're named after guns\nSo sure there aren't too many teams they the bullets that cold I I like that the Winchester rifle the Winchester yet though you don't have too many ... Dallas AK forty seven I think the field this morning [laughter]\nYou buy a Second Amendment [laughter] All right let's get to something that I Do know a little bit which is Nikki Haley I had to say\nAnd I'll concede this to you I met some of the Trump people have been a little sketchy All right you don't want to brought it up now they get along the way he says that attribute it to me you started out by saying she left on the high road like others in the trumpet outlets Trump\nThat you know he was figuring things out he takes a few people in the beginning of may not quite have been up to that\nJohn Doe has the people that boy Nikki Haley is one impressive person the hurricane is headed to the panhandle don't want to be an ... W O ours race staging joins us with the details on a monster storm [noise]\nThis is a ... days Len Burman and Michael read all in the morning then lived tomorrow from ... on seven ten\nW O law ...\nThis is a really wanting to today's Len Burman and Michael read all in the morning catch them live tomorrow from six built in on seven ten wor\nEthics twenty three we're going to go to ray staging momentarily they're talking about the most of the storm heading\nTo the panhandle but uh uh all morning along Michael's been telling us about this\nYesterday I was a great guy terrific yeah I've really enjoyed and in fact I'm going to\nGo see him in Chicago good at the ambassador theater or he did it in London First and I was talking to a friend of mine from London who is an agent over there and he saw him he said he was absolutely sensational\nHe's though I didn't realize it was such a versatile talented guy over in film stage Danielle aversion to it really is a direct writes yeah quite a guy\nAnd now sings and dances on your way but before we get to that yes he is a story that it's a foreign story and I know you know not everyone has always interested\nIn what's going on elsewhere in the world but this caught the attention both you and me I think it was a huge story so this guy Jamal could show ... All right he's a Saudi Arabian journalist very close to the family that runs Saudi Arabia\nBut he's kind of turned on them because the Saudi Arabian family they're they're you know a little bit of a brutal dictatorship\nSo famous thugs ... okay so he starts writing negative stuff about the family for the Washington Post and he leaves the country and he proclaimed himself the dissident\nSo he's living in Turkey he wants to get a divorce but he's got to get it at the Saudi Arabian embassy in Istanbul\nSo he'll paperwork yeah right goes to the embassy\nAnd HIS Video of him going in and knocked coming out you know and now we have learned that a team of like twelve Saudi Arabian assassins came into that embassy including a medical examiner who brought a hack saw with him and they think this guy\nWas killed in the embassy and then dismembered by the Saudi Arabian hit teen trying to silence and apparently successfully ...\nAn hour is a creepy ... and our government steering clear of this 'cause we're stopping now you're going to turn around and around the you know no I'm just saying no we don't want to get it and we know we want to see what how we got to\nGet out Trump now Trump is out there saying you know this weight and said let's see if there's some evidence but something when I and when you when I heard that they brought a ... in their right\nAnd how about the fact that they say the uh the closer to camera wasn't working\nThat's why we don't see him leaving now that said he's this is really a high is cloak and dagger stuff is amazing story yeah\nYeah so anyway ah Cuba Gooding junior he was with us yesterday he's on Broadway now in Chicago great fun great sense of humor and Lenin I we just had a good time talking\nYeah and he uh he's playing the main road Billy Flynn was Richard Gere in the movie that way back when I saw her yard our back on Broadway and the original anyway so I had a question for Cuba fatty like playing believe Len on the and the great way\nUber I'll tell you having a ball and I did for much of the west and in London and it we had we grapes sold out shows you know the applause grade nothing compares to Broadway\nThese audience is what I jump up and everybody here the audience were up ... and\nEvery little thing you do they just respond to it's it's been ...\nDo you think he um I'm Michael ... I was first aware of him with a jury McGuire was that his real breakthrough or were you the people know of him before then\nWell no I knew him when he was a break dance or behind line will know you did in Nineteen eighty to score show me the money you know show me the minority was wire yeah it was a thing but you know the ... and he has a movie\nComing out to the south to its out right up by you\nYou caviar yeah which it sounds fun well it's interesting\nWell by caviar came to me as a script that was in development\nWith an director attached and when that director sellout they offered me to direct it they said oh you would if you'll allow me to do it three week pass on the street script if you like it but I Know that this is a project for me and basically it's a story of an impoverished community in New Orleans of a group of\nGood people who get caught up in a bad deed a sex tape my character is an ex I'm\nA professional boxer it was ... it gets recruited why I'm I'm a mob boss ... played by Richard Dreyfuss to get some dirt on one of his employees and so\nThat begins to hygiene Sydney collaboration with a photographer played by Sam ... chance in her subjects cats are McCarthy and then just underage girls played by live a jobs and it's the\nYou know the just the they all go on the road to ... should ultimately but that goes to the city part of life and um\n[noise] it's something great New Orleans which is a community upset\nAnd Michael he wrote directed ... did it all\nYou know this movie kind of brings to mind a wonderful movie also set in New Orleans that has the kind of the sleazy underbelly a underbelly of New Orleans called the big easy remember that movie oh sure I was a great\nMove and he was in the trial of O. J. Simpson he played O. J. Simpson on the really really unlike so between stage in film and all that he does so we asked him about his or\nProud is the what is most proud of\nI think it might be this Broadway and even the directing has always been my goal since I was um\n[noise] you know for about ten years ago I said I was the end game is to direct you know I've always idolized careers like Clint Eastwood and um Mel Gibson Kevin Costner these actors who transition to the directing share but I I have to say oh we lost my father last year lead singer of the main ingredient to getting senior and um\n[noise] what I stepped on stage the first time it connected with that audience locally I understood my dad's life passion you know\nA little bit is rubbed off on my soul and I think this is something that I Want to do or revisited getting to the rest of my life because it really is ...\nAnd you guys told me not to ask this question but of course I ... I think it might be hearing his behind the scenes and they made me promise I Would ask you this but I don't listen to them I just wanted about how many times are Muslims up to you it's a show me the money that's all I Want to know area damn day\n[laughter] I I got a very good\nThere's Len in there with a million dollar question\nI wanted to do it all your money you can see that I hear the entire interview on our website seventh and W. O. R. dot com slash why the Michael but that's you know clearly I I'm I'll bet you everybody says that to him whenever of course they go\nTo the walk down the street and people come to show me the money and I'm like when you walk down the street people come up and they say let's go to the videotape\nNo they say a got an\nMadly again [laughter] I Know that water and then after that I mean how do you deal with ... on a day in and I know that he is a a and nobody\nThe store the the cases he's dealing with sound incredibly boring a lot of them are can you tell what those three cases are about no a lot of them are\nFor at least they know is Justice Roberts given the controversy surrounding the Kavanaugh is yes it does is he going to bring cases that are really going to be incendiary now or is the Supreme Court going to have a year of just kind of granular so they'll do\nEither I think the case I think the Roberts is going to drift towards the middle and become the swing the swing vote yeah he is Roberts is is going to do about drifting but uh you know he's the swing vote right well you have ... they did yeah I'll\nBe does not become like a suit or somebody like that who you know you thought you got a Republican or a conservative in there and then he drifts too far to the left or standard they arrive they accommodated\nSigning up to Capitol hey our big three every one of these items you could say I didn't see that one coming here comes hurricane Michael major cat for barreling towards the Florida handle a Florida Panhandle also in the big three Nikki Haley obscene quits yeah that was a jak common\nShe literally quit about two minutes after we went off the air to November didn't they already had a show to do here madly didn't you get in touch with her to say come on like we needed a segment at nine fifty\nNow really it it did happen as soon as we went up there and I was a shock I mean what what what what what did I Know but it didn't happen until eleven it was\nA rumor came out in the ... came out I\nThought I was going to be like a hash tag me too movement you know she was like in New Jersey school\nTeacher knows started rounding up the grounding are the ones that some ethics questions about her there were found his of airplanes yeah with planes right that came out from some liberal democratic rag of course which what dinnertime at that time I figure if someone came up with this story\nSomeone came up with the story that she was using some private airplanes and running out are being three they came close but the ninth inning comeback fell short so the red Sox eliminate the Yankees and the Bronx three games to one for the three was the final score so\nYou know it was more questions than answers about Nikki Haley in and the guy who's got all the answers for us this morning\nCounter for ABC News correspondence over at the state department come on in your car\nGood morning so uh we didn't see this coming did you know and\nIn the short answer for for me here in the state department is that very few people in this building if anyone really saw this coming either I actually talked to one source who said that the to the bureau within the department that sort of the ways on between the state department and the U.S mission that the United nations\nStill hadn't gotten an official\nResignation confirmation from her team as about noon yesterday really something that was not expected I think many people sort of thought that she would go out on her own terms possibly go out after two years but but that announcement yesterday morning was clearly not expected by many people\nBut we have not Connor seen the last of Nikki Haley Lenin I were discussing this morning that she could well become the first woman elected to the White House I mean she's got popularity charisma intelligence her career is by no means over\nYou know by by any stretch imagination and I think for her you know that sort of why she's leaving now she leaves on good terms with Trump with the Trump Administration with Trump supporters uh she can go on to be successful and make some money in the private sector which is what she she did before she ever enter politics and she is also get that\nYou know strong so trajectory she was a\nState representative on the local level very popular governor in South Carolina through some uh emotional and and difficult times and now on the world stage in the United nations just got really strong foreign policy credentials\nWhich is sometimes difficult for a lot of governors to do before they jump to the White House um you know as I said she's also got the support of many Democrats it was interesting to see Bob Menendez of all people the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee\nActually praised her in his a press statement yesterday calling or you know a strong voice for human rights in the world stage\nOr on what kind of friend again ABC News correspondent the state department or I you know I haven't heard anything negative about her at all but you know there's this this story did drifts out yesterday that there was some question about her use of a private planes as that is that a big issue or is that it's just a a noise\nI think it's a little bit of noise I think it was a office of government ethics filing report very standard for any um government officials to have to reveal some of their finances any gifts that they've received\nAnd she had gotten these flights but she has listed all them she done everything sort of by the book\nFile all the proper paperwork bull is more interesting to me in those reports\nWith the amount of credit card debt the the mortgages that she has\nThat if she is actually kind of strapped for cash which can give you an idea of why someone would wanna leave government service after about a decade of it to make some more money\nYou know selling books or speaking on the on the speaker circuit or she also has to younger kids I think they're both in their teens are so she's got to make some money put them through college and everything like that\nAnd I kind of can you sort of give us some insight into her relationship with Trump because you know Trump is had some\nRather complex relationships with other people around him and they have not turned out so well but she's going out in a classy way and he really seems to respect or how does she handle this guy that most people have no idea how to handle\nIt you know it's a great question and I think more than any other cabinet official she has done it so that she has managed to separate herself from him on certain issues right at the United nations should talk some very tough on Russia in a way that the president\nIs reluctant to do to put it a nicely she's also\nDone out of her way to speak up for human rights something that\nThe president is also pretty quiet on in general\nBut there's never been that gap if you remember the former secretary of state Rex Tillerson whenever he would say anything it seemed like Trump would contradict him on North Korea on her were off on climate change and that's why Trump at the end of the day fired him just because there was this very public Gulf between the two of them\nThat made it a very admitted made it very apparent to to you know foreign dignitaries around the world who would meet with Tillerson that he didn't speak for the president Nikki Haley though I think because as you said she has that charm she's she's a politician\nAnd at the end of the day I think the president knew that she didn't need if she didn't need\nThis job but she was so effective for him because she was that strong voice because\nUh you know she she was a woman in a cabinet where they were very few women\nI'm ... and she could then be given that leeway to a gym thing she wanted I think it also helps or frankly that she was in New York and Washington DC ... that sort of caught up in all the chaos of the the day to day down here at the White House\nAlright who replaces Nikki Haley or she's going to suspend the job of a couple of months then who do you think Trump picks\nBook classic Trump fashion and he said last night that he has a shortlist of five people that he will not tell us who the five people are except for one person I think that's important the leading candidate I Would say at this point is Dina Powell\nNow works in New York at Goldman Sachs she spent about a year in the Trump Administration is the deputy national security advisor so she's got the you know the relationships are with some of the Trump family if I go to Jared in particular um she's also close with Nikki Haley\nInterestingly she uh Nikki Haley posted a photo of the two of them over the weekend at South Carolina with their husbands don't a boat\nAnd sort of you know reading the tea leaves over Twitter feed yesterday it seemed like that was a tacit endorsement of Powell as her successor and and the president has said Nikki Haley will be involved\nIn that process the only thing that's going against how two things I should say number one does she want the job you know she left after a year a mainly because she was sort of burned out by a chaotic the White House and then the second question is you know does the more\nA nationalist Steve Bannon wing of the White House\nOr allow her to get the job it's rumors that John Bolton is not so much of a fan of staff John Kelly may not be much of that but at the end of the day she is the U.S ambassador to the United nations so she's in New York and she's not directly working with those people in the same way that a a secretary of state ... for example\nI kind of ... thanks inside some good stuff babysitters corresponded the state department nice Connor thank you All right how about a ...\nPeople that know nothing to do with that but it is but I Want to tell you the people that do know that he would resign them either but uh you know and then be accused of nepotism if you can believe it\nOr you have everything I could believe that you know this\nMeans the power has now a crude to walrus face John Bolton with Nikki Haley ...\nIs facing ... code you know it's like a disease that must as ... as\nI Am the war and he's got he is now going to be in charge of foreign policy in the Trump Administration are there you have\nComing up next the Yankees looms boy so close last

the American leagues rest that could be a hell of a seven game series I think the law for the Yankees the season was the pitching\nI guess you listen to while you're up for it when I said the starting pitching was going to be a question mark and that's what we're really kind of did\nThem in hit it on the head Michel ... now that the ... was weak and you know without you support everything you say

with this with this whole lawyer right\nYeah I mean this is a it's kind of a touching story I have to say so the self described oldest trial lawyer at a hundred and center street down here uh not too far from us he uh he gave it up on Tuesday in Manhattan Supreme Court because the judge\nDeclared a mistrial citing his declining ability to defend his client uh this guy has been he's\nBeen there at center street for sixty seven years now eighty seven his name is Leonard lemons and and ah he just couldn't follow the case and judge Ruth pickles pickles\nI don't think you should be trying cases

throats of an infant carrier nearly killing the kid\nAnd Lebanon sin\nOne years he's been practicing he looks up the judge and he said after reflects\n... what would be the ... come on you're a woman badly help as well but the biggest misconception about millennia trout that\nMaybe she's not she doesn't talk up to her husband that she doesn't have our own opinions but I think some people this is my question her intelligence I think she's very intelligent woman you know I might I I think she's quiet and she's going to say what she wants to say when she wants\nTo have exactly exactly and that's great she doesn't fly off the handle the way other people in the family do in a she's planning out her course now that it's there\nSo you think she'll stay with them yes yes oh\nHe'll stay with that but she's not going to divorce him oh no no no I'm saying wants to lose the White House's adios although that's what they said about Hillary and bill so\nWell ... ... ah they oh my God or slick willy

she's getting an interview to ABC that will air on friday and we were ah we had a little preview of some of the questions that we know the question is because they didn't put the juicy answers\nNow just his infidelity and a ... jacket that said I don't care to you uh you know civil data Brian is right yes she's been around forever she's very uh she has a big presence on Twitter she just without something about you know why did ask her about why she was a birther [laughter] how evidence because she went after Obama the way a husband did\nAnd also I think she's got some chain migration going on there millennia 'cause she got her parents than\nYeah well ... so anyway I think obviously a that'll stir up a lot on social media but she really that's pretty interesting that the ... here she is so far into the administration and this is her first real I mean she had to sit down with Fox but you know yeah that they didn't they weren't going to ask her about\nStormy Daniels well there there's ... there's no question is off limits so you know anyway this I think she can handle herself I Do too and I I think she'll come out well I I think I think her popularity has clearly much higher than his don't you\n... I Would think so I don't know about I don't know about\nThat when you think if you did a popularity of ... that she would come out on the radio the little ... well yeah but I as far as\nPeople's opinion give her I don't think I hear yeah I don't think a lot of people have a negative right I ... I'm kinda you know I mean I like her ... and all that but you know she does she does she not controversial in any way well exactly which is why her opinion\nHe didn't pull it'd be high on her back Hillary that was fun to stay at home made us rank the first lady's like at a regular habit of Obama Gail Adams of a fun time you're hey Martha Washington alright name that tune so here we had the nominations for the twenty ninth team rock and Roll Hall of fame okay I'm going to play the ... the groups\nThat you just tell me that they aren't you know I'm not good on this kind of music

this you know they could get a jam this is Len\nBourbon and Michael ... out of touch in the morning\n[noise] I I never ever heard of the group MC five ever advance their to them probably just because of the big Doherty\nThose zombies zombies yeah groom these\nAround me that step tiger leopard I kept my masters and we told you so what do you have you know I knew there was an animal you heard of this one I I've seen her [noise]\n\nDominate at an individual but she's on what state when they're grown up in in the rock and the same yeah what's your group badly she's in a great Big Mac Fleetwood Mac ... you don't know where it would back she's in but it's not as individuals um it all I Know this one\nActual us anyway uh speaking of Hillary yup oh she took on\nA Trump the other day because Trump reef staged that's swearing in ceremony of Kavanaugh mhm and Hillary had those comment like that's just political theater and it's not you know other administration is don't do stuff like that and well a Donald has something to say about that\nI guess that's where she lost [laughter] she doesn't get it [laughter] she ever did I knew that a long time ago [laughter] Hillary never got it [laughter]\nThat's why she lost that was in the oval office they let me ask you something I I Know you don't like Trump All right so just put an island that that's what I met him many many times about a delightful right but you're not going to vote for him but just probably you know it's a good point probably probably\nBut just put that aside for a moment just from the purely political prospect yes ... valley in bold faced tough\nGutter tactical politics you got to give it to this guy I mean just the way she cuts right through all that nonsense and the BS and goes right for the jugular on his opponents and flatten them that is an impressive skill in the political yeah I did not\nKnow though I I think what you're saying is just rhetoric is highly entertaining and he does a you know ... ... when he said a low energy Jeb Bush boom he was dead absolutely just that one line hook hottest oh God well but I'm not sure he's\nThat political in nature and understands all that he's probably getting a little better now now he's been around for a while but I think a lot of stuff was just him ... street fighting for change that that's what he was doing exactly\nBut he does it brilliantly and it was and here's something that I don't know if it's ... but he really answer just the no doubt that was an animal instinct okay there you go but it is a successful and it's really an end what up and the elite media\nIn New York Times writers the national public radio people you're all voices you do the voices yes in my car and then ... and at times you've Bailey's New York telling you believe what the president said they don't understand this kind of and you put your finger on it queens street fighting that is so refreshing\nWent for years we've had nothing but boring speeches from politicians who are never really honest with us in any\nWay I mean it's right I mean you know the some of the names and some of the things he does is right or not it's effective it may have gotten elected but okay but it's affected with a certain group of his base it's not effective with countries around the world who have a lower image of us now because of his rhetoric\nI Believe that we're about to or have another summit with North Korea\nWe're going to another while you're up north Korea and us I've set up from the beginning of we do denuclearize North Korea give him a Nobel Peace real Detroit\nReopen trade agreements with Mexico and Canada to make them more in our favor you think this is not affected well let's see\nI mean I I I did read where the debt is is setting records again so and I know and as this tax cut as opposed to the debt to explode so let's say there's there's always yang to every year but I'm I'm I'll give them the benefit of the doubt it'd be a if he gets a piece of North Korea great if he if he brings the uranium so their knees great then I'll go for that that's great\nHe's entertaining and he's under that is why we like him have when we come back a guy goes into an embassy in one piece and comes out in various pieces probably in garbage bags and I think that'll just for a fact I think I ... was involved why not gonna believe this story\nThis is a really wanting to today's Len Burman and Michael read all in the morning and catch them live tomorrow from six built in on seven ten\nW O law Michael read all in the morning catch them live tomorrow from ... on seven ten wor\nPlenty three in the morning when you're with us a few of took the Jersey transit today so it worked out for you or your cats oh boy I didn't even halfway there are it's unbelievable what goes on with that\nOrganization but they came out with a hundred and fifty eight page report\nA yesterday and uh basically said was Christie's full who they are not where I get off to the beach dirty job there's you know they actually did not mention them by name\nBut apparently the auditing firms that Christie's administration um [noise] uh and they denied this that some New Jersey transit employees were hired because of their political connections rather than their technical expertise hot after I got a shocker\nYeah well the text technical expertise was moving comes around on the George Washington bridge there\nIs less traffic they talk about all the uh they say Twenty one percent of the uh non union rail workers are currently eligible to retire fourteen percent of the Boston headquarters non union workers but they said they don't have a succession plan training opportunities they don't ... you know basically\nIt basically report basically says oh what the hell they're doing that [laughter]\nThey said morale here's a shocker morale is an all time low at New Jersey transit\nAnd also apparently the engineers they're not paid that well so they're ... oils why New York state Connecticut and other places that can pay them a higher salaries\nNow this was an interesting part of the report and said ... and the headline for men Jake call at ... dot com forget running the railroad New Jersey transit can't manage Twitter or Facebook either so they are talking about their social media and they and they and they they said that just handing it all wrong for example they sign off at eight o'clock and they ...\nEvery what a good diet well they don't cook consumer our customers because the gold\nPsychiatry report what do you wish you'd be a good diet they also said they've also put out a message one day we made it halfway through the week\nAnd it says you know what that could easily be right is it the barest sing sweet for the transit authority all we're well we were able to make if you're the winner take all we got to Wednesday and we're still okay so okay so here's a here's the governor Phil Murphy on this big report\nThis is fixable is within our grasp it it's fixable within our grasp it a reasonable amount of time\nLine world you know he's got to be ... is also pledged no fare increases oh so what was his lawn he's got on the line in an ideal world now he says is the ideal world ah do fare increases but this is the ideal world [laughter]\nCome on now ... year our New Jersey expert do ... do you take mass transit ... most people just decided I'm going to drive because I Can't take\nThat oh no there's a lot of people who would take it that a lot of aggravated people I've I took Jersey transit for many years back and forth with a bad even back in those days it\nWell I think great the situation isn't that there's a lot of delays a lot of miscommunication you don't know what's going on I I think that's half the battle there when there is a problem let people know tell them what to expect\n... ears standing there and ... and you have no information in the day with Twitter and Instagram well Twitter they know they're off line by eight o'clock\nIt's it's frustrating and ... you think it's a bigger fix people's ... says\nWe're reaching act administratively to implement the recommendations we're doing so there you go\nSo they have no way to buy the whole report now we live happily ever elders and we can do this and a reasonable amount of time yeah yeah thirty five years\nProbably I have the answers did not to help me at all I I thought to myself that that was just a bunch of they let me ask mumbo jumbo how do you think this governor's doing now like I really have no clue that he is not a very vocal\nA politician you don't really hear from them much just recently have you seen a little bit more conferences or we invited him on the show we did early on we haven't recently\nCan we well we have to call them up at his villain Tuscany right isn't that were spends most of his time what was the memories of it wasn't even for a vacation doesn't actually my vacation is it gives billionaire\nOr right before we run out of time here you want to talk about jumping up a guy in Memphis so you know\nThis is fascinating ah it's a foreign policy story but there's this guy ... or ... he's a Saudi Arabian and he was very close to the Saudi family and he writes for the Washington Post well he well here's what happened he turned on the Saudi family 'cause he thinks that they\nThey're not going to go out and risk their lives and there's the justification is or if you were told to go and you decided to stay and I have to tell you guys as many as fifty percent of the people who were supposed to leave didn't wow\nWe saw was Florence the serious flooding and boats had to go rescue people is that the topography there there were worry about as well on the panhandle\nYeah but I got to tell you this is a very different storm than Florence Florence was a slow mover it it basically stalled over the Carolinas and sat there and just hung out like somebody owed money\nUh this has got to be a fast moving storm here this storm is going to go at Thirteen miles an hour it's not only going to go that fast as it crosses the coast here but it's expected to accelerate it will be a category one storm through middle Georgia\nAnd then it will go right to say it with me the Carolinas where you're going to get up eight more inches of rain they really don't need wow now\nWhere we just got pain proper attention paid because it just seems to me you know two days ago we were like as another hurricane there doesn't look like much and all of a sudden almost overnight this thing has become a monster storm\nLow you know four days ago this thing was nothing but a tropical depression this thing really blew up faster than when you can hear it started to really to blow again here it blew up really quick you know just uh about forty eight hours ago it was just a category one storm now we're talking about the possibility of a category five monster and [noise]\nNo I Can't say that people didn't take the warning seriously they just didn't get a lot of warning\nHey a pie as we speak a governor Rick Scott is doing a news conference in Tallahassee surrounded by a national guardsmen and he's calling this the worst storm the Florida has seen in a century I mean this is hyperbole I mean there've been some no crucial storms down at critical ...\nI got a role but I'll tell you this before I go it is going to be the worst storm that's ever hit the panhandle and one of the worst storms maybe challenging Andrew from back in the nineties that's hit Florida ever\nAll right All right he comes ABC News corresponded down in Panama City Beach Florida thank the old on your hat wow you can hear the wind just behind him do you hear the wind lend a yeah a dusting behind them it's going to be like a hundred and fifty four miles an hour how many houses\nThat some blood and I don't I don't know how that can sustain that at all uh you know right now the category for\nIs at a hundred and forty a we're going to try to are we able to dip into listen to the governor a little bit a he's a speaking right now are doing a news conference he's on the CNN let's listen to a little bit of it was governor Rick Scott Florida fuel\nShortages are outages\nFollowing the storm we will have resources available to quickly makes sure fuel is moving to where it's needed\nThe state of emergency response team has been holding regular cause with the fuel industry and ports in Florida to ensure they can get gas to all areas safely\nSyringe can download download the app gas buddy to check refuse available\nPresident Trump has approved the pre landfall disaster request we made on Monday and that will help with resources and response\nI just spoke with a president who again offered all available federal resources we continue being constant contact with FEMA and their team in the state of emergency operations center\nYou up that's the governor Rick Scott and are you saying\nThat you know the banner across the screen is worse\nStorm Florida as seen in a century I mean Utah remember was it entered the white down an entire a town in Florida yeah oh yeah yes absolutely what a ... air force base or whatever it was it was a\nI mean they've had some amazing storms down there and they're saying this but you're right this is this is bill to just unbelievable very greatly proportions I Know what I'm worried about his loss of life I think this and it's just I you know I don't know how\nI don't want to get run over by LeBron James\nPay by the way your favorite Sinatra song is New York New York ... so so when the uh the Yankees won in Fenway they played New York New York in the locker room up there are so anyway the red Sox when they celebrated last night and so they eliminate the Yankees they they jumped around in the Bronx that go into their clubhouse\nAnd guess what song they played in their clubhouse the red Sox rubbed it in\nMind that you're going to create a bad blood with this way and let me go areas already let me heading out to New York New York because Boston doesn't have a song can you sing the Boston song well they do sweet Caroline that went out of Boston song I Want to be a part of it posted ...\nPlease screw you read on the ... morning showing mash up who showed up on the TV morning shows that day\nFive flags you're spending your evening with our replay of this morning show catch just for a brand new one burning and Michael ... in the morning tomorrow from six to fend on sevens and the W o off\nWarning everyone on Wednesday I'll be doing well Michael really okay and I'm yes a hurricane Michael\nThat's me Joe Bartlett hurricane Joe how're you doing over there and I'm doing fine I'm surprised you guys missed the ... I thought you guys were going to\nBe all over the story but uh the the story came out that Ninety two percent of the articles written about Donald Trump or in the mainstream media are negative\nWe already know that some news land where do you know that I'm On the news the president's just tweeted about it now I see that what do they say well he said well by the way a\nYou're saying that the all the news is negative about Trump which is what the surveys are saying but\nYou know the nice thing was when Barack Obama was president it was nothing but positive comments from Fox News or young I was there was there we want to know about but he ... he won a Nobel Peace prize before he did anything but the thing is I I think these means the mainstream media and you know the major networks six excluding Fox\nAre advocating for them you know against him\nNot just reporting knew his was advocating against him he just wanted a few moments ago despite so many positive events and victories\nMedia Research Center reports than Ninety two percent of stories on Donald Trump I Love it when he calls himself Donald Trump Ninety two percent of stories on Donald Trump or negative on ...\nYou see CBS and ABC it's fake news don't worry the failing New York times and even put the Brett Kavanaugh victory on the front page yesterday a seven seed that was going to be the pages of brown\n[laughter] that's kind of show in his age therapies actually reading the old\nFashioned newspaper but I Want to say this just about the mainstream media is this is where Joe was absolutely right where the media is now just simply out to try to tear this president down and that was when the New Yorker\nAired that allegation against cabin I'll buy that woman Ramirez that had no credible confirmation the New Yorker which was one of the great journalistic institutions for over a hundred years\nOnce upon a time they would have had cooperation they would have had five six sources they just put that allegation against cabinet out there with no sourcing no corroboration they just put it out there because they thought we got to destroy everything that Trump is doing that is the end of the New Yorker is a journalistic institution\nOf the failing New Yorkers are a big three here comes hurricane Michael a major cat forum here earlier toward the Florida no yours is little whisper [laughter] below who is\nA barreling towards the Florida Panhandle and now there's even talk could make a five now wind speed right now is a hundred and forty five and a cat and that's category for category five which is the highest category\nIs one fifty seven so there and some of the gusto by the way are over that so yeah it's unbelievable so up it's going to be hit and\nThey say maybe two o'clock this afternoon ... will get a very quick update a a little bit later in the in this half hour from raced Asia at the weather channel will give us the very very latest but uh it it could go to five also in the big three Nikki Haley up and quits the un\nWhat's the real deal on that one and rounding up the big three they came close\nBut the ninth inning comeback fell short Red Sox eliminating the Yankees and the Bronx for three the final score you know the Nikki Haley thing that the one that makes the most I heard three different theories the one that makes the most sense to me I guess cause I've covered sports my whole life she wants to make more money you can't make a lot of money being a UN ambassador\nNo you can't and she was governor before that so she's never had the big payday and we do know that our finances are a little shaky she has big debts and she's got kids that she's got to send a college so she can\nTake a break from public service make some money regroup and I think she's going to run for president one day and I think if we're going to have a first female president is going to be a Republican and it's going to be Nikki Haley I'm not going to be Pocahontas no I don't know if it's\nGonna be Republican but I Do think that she would be a be be the first female president but it's all everything's timing\nBecause right now the election sell today Trump once again so now you're talking twenty twenty very difficult to come back and win a third term in the same party it's happened but you know in the last half century has what once well Bush senior\nWhile the other question on the table is does she replaced Pence\nOn the ticket disaster that aside\nWhat Bartlett has been saying that and I think it's a good plan I think the Republicans were smart they are and that would really help out with the women vote you put her in there and set a\nPen so I think that would be I mean it was a decent guy but he's a poor yeah I mean he has been loyal the question how do you get them out of there and give him secretary of state get another pet a demotion well I'm a plum job yeah secretary transport I Want a Supreme Court [laughter]\nI Know he's got no sex it is back right away is going to say they ought to be a ... way up to our guy [laughter] I'm Glad\nYou know of all the things that we love the ... so this is this is said with love all the things she's glad she clear this up\nI Can't say I'm not going to things down Jared and long hair I have I have not understand well\nShe may be right about that he is working on the middle east peace plan on\nIf you saw was the middle east I Will sit my I Will get down to my knees you will go rent an apartment in one of the building ... no I moved to Jerusalem was ... ... so what we like it this time to mention some of the people show up on the TV shows and then on Fox and friends a governor Mike Huckabee was on\nAnd he was discussing Nikki Haley and the and who might possibly replace her Michael\nIt's going to be a tough job to fill because she's done it better in my view than anyone has ever done it before\nUh she's been terrific she's been strong she's been from for Israel she's pushed back against uh some of the bullying that has happened by many of these little ... nations who can go and kick sand in America's face not anymore not when Nikki Haley has been there\nWere those ... squeak bases east Timor who's been kicking said that our face of China Russia [laughter] squeak I you know I think Trump should appoint to be the UN ambassador\nKanye West [laughter] well I think he'd be great he's they're having lunch today by the way\nThat ... you see I'm On the trail well my journalistic knows is twitching I bet he announced a United States ambassador\nUnited ... yeah that one yeah that would work out really\nWell he loves what we're doing for African Americans job for so many different things the median income as you see that at all
