not\nSomething else ... what a Seventy two year old woman who flew in from Canada She is marriage has two children she has a real factory progressive ... sarcoma sarcoma cancers of the connective tissue like the muscles in the bones and tendons and well\nIn Canada She had had surgery and radiation and chemo shut everything\nHe was diagnosed about three years ago she had abdominal bloating she had a CAT scan showed him as as a ... centimeter and ... she went to one of the super super big hospitals in Canada in Toronto and she had surgery and um they tried to cut it out and they were going to give her radiation\nAnd they were going to give her chemotherapy and then she went to the doctors there and they said well forget about that came of ... and really work very well for us our comas or they were honest with her about that and then she had\nScans every three months colonoscopy and then recently about six months ago she had a ... centimeter mass and they went back to the old scan\nFor three months before that it actually show to there was a two and a half centimeter mass which they didn't see\nThe only saw it when a group of six centimeters and brought their attention to it so here's a case where\nIn retrospect a CAT scan was misread at one of the biggest places in Canada She started chemotherapy in Canada She had months and months of chemotherapy and the chemo was stopped because\nIt didn't work so remember a couple of years before they're going to give her chemo they told her cumulus and work and then a couple of years later the cancer grew back they tried chemo and it's still there and work and then they tried more chemo and that doesn't work and she lost her hair and had fatigue and lost twelve pounds who went from one thirty seven down to one twenty\nFive five feet age she never smoked a lot of clean life did a CAT scan about\nFour months ago so it's a move nodes involved and some abdominal public nodes involved\nAnd she came here Jed lost her hair from the chemo the cancer growing ... brief staged or in Canada they did not get a PET scan that denied re stage or they center home to ... you got at the center home to die in Canada and she's a spry woman with\nA loving husband and family and children and she didn't want to go home to die and she came here to write a sort of New York city for Broadway even though she was at one of the super pope or biggest places in Canada sent home to die\nWith ... mile sarcoma and she came in with her husband from Canada not nearby and she came we examined her we got her stage adoption never been staged up falling in Canada\nWe found a very very complex amassing her abdomen ... Powell was we were able to treat her in just a few treatments that's what registered as about non invasive treatment pinpoint treatment know cutting no bleeding no hospital stay no anesthesia\nAnd why does it work why does it work better than other treatment while number was focused on the cancer and give higher doses fewer treatments outpatient well tolerated and that's what happened to this woman and we treated her and she came back for follow up\nShe flew and again from Canada we got our checked up rather staged up and she\nWould this very difficult cancer we're all the treatment in Canada doesn't work that surgery and chemo came here and just a few treatments she is now in remission she's in remission doing well she's in remission happy pleased with the success that we were able to offer her when all the treatment of the biggest places in Canada just\nOffered nothing but to go home and die and that's something she refused to accept that is why she came here for non invasive outpatient therapy and they can tell you when I saw her this week saw her ... her husband I gave them the ... getting reports that gave the CDs\nAnd it was sweet for the patient was sweet for her husband it's also sweet for me the sweetest part of the day is to give good news to our patients and thank God for us being the pioneers with non invasive innovative body radio surging non invasive treatments for cancer is\nMost anywhere in the body even prior chemo or radiation or surgery doesn't workers and wanders in tolerated most commonly were able to give our patients\nA good report good success where we attack the cancer\nAnd that's what happened this woman and she'll be back in six months we'll check her out and will continue to check her out because that's the work that we do here at radio surgery in New York and I wanted to talk to you about\nA man Seventy four years old he's single he has four children and he was diagnosed Twenty years ago one of the hospital's New York city with prostate cancer he never had treatment then he went to one of the big hospitals or this PSA went up to four hundred and he had pain when he was urinating ad pelvic pain\nGet a biopsy no spread of the cancer he wakes up at night tier and he's on medication for that is hearing has diminished from Twenty years working around the airplanes is no family history of\nProstate cancer I examined him as ... was a large share the stage to unseat prostate cancer Gleason seven PSA six and he knows his surgery sixty percent success\nRate with us Ninety percent success rate nose was surgery Ninety seven percent of the ... camp and you know as a surgery eighty percent chance of being incontinent are leaking urine doesn't want that doesn't want radical surgery doesn't want robotic surgery as one open surgery doesn't want less success right sixty\nPercent with radical robotic surgery Ninety percent with us he wants the best treatment first and obviously the best treatment first\nIs the best strategy because of the cancer comes back there's no guarantee that you can put that person remission it's better to be successfully treated first that's why he came to us with prostate cancer he wants to sex life and his urinary live from the quality of life that's why he\nCame he called us for information you can to call us at two and two choices to into two four six forty two thirty seven to one to two four six forty two thirty seven [noise]\nCause who get information you can call us and get a book but it can cause to get a DVD or better yet call and make an appointment so that's what we do for prostate\nCancer this man Ninety percent chance would be cancer free with us avoiding radical surgery avoiding robotic surgery and most likely avoiding the complications associated with surgery when I was up to the Lederman and we have joined on the line\nAt land has been ... ... ... ... thank God he was treated at salt\nAnd use those names to tell you what your question is today\nOkay you got treated with chemotherapy or for a year and a half and all all the ... or ... or ... ... ... ... ah they get the last ... therapy ...\n... ... ... ... ... or a special they ended up in the hospital with a blood clot as long as they got bigger brain showing along the\nGuys are at all in a hole in the hospital but yeah they're going to China last chemotherapy which is very harsh while you\nKnow I mean they're trying in my last and last and last and last and none of us work on and a look first of all the first came out doesn't really work number two the immunotherapy doesn't work and when they go on other third line or foreign ... a chance or work and it's only about five or ... percent so most likely it won't work\nHe suffered a lot from the treatment I Believe or even if it works even if this came all works even if you have a hundred people like him but only work in five out of the hundred so most likely won't work and even if it works works temporarily so why would someone want more came out after they've suffered so much from systemic therapy\nYou are in in a in a while the late ... and you stretching it can get\nA look he tried a legitimate place she tried chemotherapy he took it he probably was a great patient and probably did everything they told him he took the chemo for a long time probably longer than necessary to keep a immunotherapy it didn't work\nAnd it sounds like he's really suffering now and the likelihood of further came I was just a few percent so you know to me I don't understand why someone who gave a year and a half of their life\nAnd basically they're pumping and came over a year and a half he did everything they told them right right and it's not working and that is a last ditch the last ditch for whom you know who is winning here I mean that you know the expenses are huge at these cancer places ten or twenty thousand dollars a month so he's probably spent and Eighteen months are talking about\nProbably a quarter million dollars and he's not better off is\nI Would imagine he's worse off today that he was Eighteen months ago the treatments are work and so he's got choices and you've got choices he's the president of his body or the vice president of his body and you have to understand that came out after a year and a half just isn't buying them anything it's just\nAlmost torture its toxicity and the likelihood of benefit is miniscule even and even if it helps it's only going to help for a few months even if he's a tiny present that that helps so I mean us on the other hand if we were treated as long or is drain our success rates Ninety percent he comes in and make them all around the body we used to pinpoint the\nTreatment goes to the cancer not to the healthy body so what we do is exactly the opposite of chemotherapy and the big hospitals rather than pouring in chemo it's like putting his whole body in the bath tub of toxicity whereabouts of focus\nIn and send the beams to the cancer treatment takes ten minutes\nOr a success rate of I how can I tell you the truth about forty thousand patients like your husband\nOr success right where we aim to beam is about Ninety percent and unlike chemo our success rate Ninety percent is durable\nWhich means most likely if we treat the cancer the longer the adrenal or someplace else most likely it will stay in remission where we trade it for the rest of his life in general we don't cause the toxicity the chemo causes\nSo the treatment is like night and day I don't tell people what to do but I Try to open eyes as to what choices are and he most likely has choices\n... now and we\nCan treat the lymph nodes who drew lymph nodes every day we trade stage for cancer every day look at the treatment they're offering them is a work out and look I Know sometimes he always had a super big hospital if he's dying there he deserves to die why don't view it\nThat way if he's dying there I mean it's the treatments no good and you should get stop would that three minute stop with that he had chemotherapy for a year and a half after a year and a half of chemo the cancer mutates the cancers smart to cancer of the year and a half ago is not the cancer as today the cancers resistant to chemotherapy\nIt's resistant to him into therapy look a chemotherapy often works at the beginning it often does because the chemotherapy\nCatches the cancer by surprise but then the cancer wakes up and it mutates Senate resists and there's something called cross resistance Owens resistant to chemotherapy hey it gets pretty quickly resistant to B and C and D and ... and a half and so the likelihood of this chemo working is miniscule\nSo like my job is to educate to tell you that most likely that Kim was not going to work most likely suffered\nA lot from the chemotherapy look the usual treatment in America for stage for cancers came on 'til you can't\nCrawl through the door anymore and that's kind of what's happening to him he can probably get into a point that he's\nProbably not the man he was a year and a half ago at imagine and ah just because it's a big place and the famous place and they're telling you to take came motel he dies you don't have to decide that you want that it's your choice and your husband's choice to say I've had enough I've given a year and a half\nHe's no better he's worse they're not going to cure him stage for cancer came out does not cure stage for lung cancer so you're not giving up anything\nBy walking out of there and a half of the patients that are in our office\nHad been in big places and they walk out because they're so disappointed you know the next treatment is always so\nFantastic probably when you started the amino therapy they probably tell you the middle therapies ... newest thing it's the greatest thing I bet they told you that and I bet they told you it's so easy and it's got the kids the lock to unlock the cancer and then he gets his bread to the lung and blood clots and you see\nThe complication rates and with no one is talking about is\nThe ... toward complication rates of immunotherapy number one and number two the low success right number three of the high costs\nYou know the costs are just tremendous cost financially and physically and and I'm sure it's disruptive to your family it's just like a treadmill it gets chemo and shots and gets the complications and he's slowly tries to recover the complications and they give another came on shots like an endless treadmill that never never ends a do it he falls down and collapses\nAnd right which is about the Gulf right now the ... uh\nWell you don't have to be I mean you can go if you want you don't even get a second opinion if you want to but the likelihood of that came on working is miniscule if this came over so fantastic what did they give it three months ago when did they give it six months ago so I always the next chemo so fantastic but doctor\nTold me that about the last came out last chemo doesn't work and the chemo before that doesn't work and they will therapy doesn't work why is it the next ... toy so fantastic for the last one doesn't work why is that ... ...\nA year and a half and now they gave in ...\nThere and are not God told me she was one minute ... they're not gods okay just because they have three months to live I don't believe that the doctors sometimes they would do something called hanging crepe gang crepe at a funeral such as I say oh\nYou only have three months to live and they live for months to a doctor so fantastic he was supposed to die last month but he lived in extra months that's just hanging crepe doctors don't know when someone's going to live or die please right when they start that\nIs a mind game on you and it's not fair to you and it's not fair to your husband is not fair to other patients always live three months he lives six months\nOr so fantastic I'm going to go there and die there because they're so fantastic I mean that's your choice but I mean the proven that putting his his see half\nOf the man he was a year and a half ago\nRight now you know the guy he might have been in therapy he got an email therapy and what did they promised them what they made all therapy\nWell down at least a year and a half the ... area and they all look like a lot of people don't even know stay but it but in a can\nWell that's how I got him today versus a year and a half ago\nWell he stays tire each week or ... yeah I'm telling you know therapy backing away they gave a freak show they said it was the latest in a you know therapy\nOkay it was a ... hour work ... ... federal in a blood clot and again it's OK so applications and I'll do it in a work you're worried about it doesn't work and you had complications\nFlight so they took all that now that China and now the harsh very harsh every two weeks the three hours and ...\nDo talk about a gentleman who sixty two years old he's married with one son and his prostate cancer three years ago we had a PSA for but police nine so ugly says how the cancer looks under the microscope and the police made a scale from two to ten\nThe higher the number of the worst of the prognosis now this is a man who had those nine weeks of treatment remember just a few minutes ago I talked about nine weeks being much less good than our treatment well here's some at at nine weeks a tree Monti had little brown which is a anti testosterone shot\nHis PSA never went to zero and now it's going up was eight and now it's twenty two and the cancer is back and had lots of side effects of the loop run his press got the largest called gone to a mass to a guy named means like a woman and mass is breasts\nBreasts like a woman in the man has increased fat is hot flashes is decrease libido he said is testicles or shrunken size offered the loop run\nSo the loop ... nine weeks of treatment did that help and why are we talking about him or we're talking about him because if you know options you'll choose better and nine weeks is not the best treatment\nChoice we are the only place in America I Believe that gives out a date as you can look at your PSA look at your Gleason score and you can see yourself where the best treatment will be I don't think any other hospital or facility gives you that that's why it's so important to have our information\nFor it so important to come in for consultation\nThis is the work that we do here at Thirteen to the fore Broadway treating people with cancer recurrent cancer this man sad to say he got treatment he paid a big price when for treatment nine weeks are ugly and nine and he didn't get what he wanted to which has a chance or mission\nWith us the chance would have been dramatically\nBetter this is the work we do every day and sweat so important to know the data first and only one place gives the day that you can imagine so important to know the data why is that others don't give it a while because of the show

David Limbaugh's you with us You're gonna love this pastor I Will say this pastor because you've been very good to me and you even said to me he prayed for me and I I I Am I'm very touch when people say that to me and I know you mean you're a good guy\nAnd and David has written these books she started with persecution his first book on faith and religion and um I think now the best book yet it's called Jesus has risen poll in the early church\nAnd David is at a pretty profound impact on me making me realize I'm not that religious and then I I Believe everything um I I Would be one of those people that sort of shows up at Christmas and Easter at your church\nUh and I don't go to church that much but uh but I Believe all of us and uh both of you have encouraged me to to want to be better does that make sense\nIt makes a lot of sense to you know a time speeds it's contagious yeah and the fates of one can rub off on another phase breathe\nYou guys getting my grilled Telhami Hannity you know you need to shape up the ship out or Hannity going straight to hell live I can read your mind knew I Would never saw the way David ...\nBook is now a two week some running on the New York times best seller list welcome to you too David said a pastor Scott Greene\nThank you hey how are you guys thanks for having me on what ... what start with this mob everywhere we see we're not going to kick off I Would I rented\nTo um what's his name Blumenthal the Connecticut Senator\nAnd when I was in Washington went during the Capitol hearing said he was a total jackass during those hearings\nIs coming out of where I was going in and I said center Sean Hannity how are you we had a very cordial conversation if he was sitting at a table I Would never I might go over and say you know send a drink over though I might just because I disagreed vehemently with them I don't feel I have a right to tell them you don't belong here\nHe has a different point of view than I Do what we get the subtle out at the ballot box\nHave I have a fear and when I say fear with him we got him myself but one of these people might walk up to me in a restaurant my fear is that my response will go by\n[laughter]\nThat's my fear I mean I've asked myself what I had always said though man of the ... you know that's why I say I have a fear I'm like yeah I'm going to stand up for that only me the old me would come out and they asked me if I'm with my wife told me would come out and then it will go by what my response would go by what but I think they pick and choose their targets does exactly\nWell they may be but you know I listen I train five days a week an hour and a half maybe they are the largest and they know this well it's a it's not going to stop crazy people but I got to tell you something I Will walk away I Will do everything I can do to walk away I Do part of martial arts all the arts that I practice\nWe ... we bow out if we're doing weapons training we show great respect they were doing grappling or or\nOutright full contact we do it with respect we respect the tap we were ... you know we're not there to kill each other we're there to make each other better\nI'm so there's a certain discipline David associated with that and but most people age don't know how to defend themselves and be they're going to react like past just caught then they're going to get past and somebody's gonna get hurt\nI couldn't agree more and it is a danger for people in the public square and especially people who hold themselves out as Christians whether you're a pastor or you have a Christian themed Gluck at you really gotta be careful at it but we do anyway we need to be civil and and when some people on Twitter ... and our other interactions\nBut I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think I mean we don't uh communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the ... that it just means we don't have to get his dirty as they do\nWell I look I don't know I I we just had Newt Gingrich on and pastor what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served us so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigation of Cory Booker would be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband would be having an FBI investigation\nAnd Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life but they're obviously playing politics with with very important issue so the hypocrisy is there but between Kavanaugh the mobs the caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on parallel economic success\nFourteen state record for states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever I I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nI think the man on the street will factor it in I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican then that stupid the party leaders are stupid you know but the man on the street they're able to see this process that they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display\nThey know that there's a caravan is not simply a random\nOccurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly deciding to all walk thousands of miles to America to look for better jobs they can see the orchestrated now some people are going to vote the party regarding this but the others say listen I'm tired of this because all of the nonsense seems to be coming from the left\nAnd the very behavior that they pretended to criticize they've put it on steroids and I am ... so you know they said well we don't like that some of the behavior the president during the campaign but you say they have it to another level and you're you're ...\nYou're you're out of Cleveland, Ohio okay you're a an African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump out at the results are in\nAnd we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people look at that picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty six team was about for me the Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps the eight million more in poverty after Obama's eight years\nNow we've got four million jobs created eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps we have four\nHundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama sober never coming back while the president didn't get credit when you break down votes demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never done better\nThank God he's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus button I and there are a lot of ... and they say listen we see what Trump is doing we embrace with Trump is going is not what they told us that waking up and you know if they say is thirty six percent approval rating\nAt twenty or thirty percent to the fifty six sixty six percent believe me his message just rent cream tell him as a message with amazing the black community I come\nFrom a traditional democratic family years voted party forever\nBlacked it in my family and our sphere are now so ... to it that they're either going to not vote at all which is which is really go\nFor what we're doing with the conservative movement or\nThey're going to vote with us because they're starting to see that this is a charade here you know the media constantly but right and President Trump for no reason they've been doing it all day today CNN blacks used to go and get their news from CNN their politics from CNN and MSNBC they're starting to see\nWe got to get in the trenches we've got to figure this out so we're getting a bunch of calls from people saying hey what's going on houses going how's Trump doing this how can we help on this particular side he's going to get off the black vote than any other Republican president I'll throw this\nDay but if if we all believe in in God the father Jesus is okay and I think all of us here do\nIf we believe that that we all believe one thing and that predicated on that he created every man woman and child on this earth we agree with that right okay yeah so in that sense where\nBrothers and sisters we're all Americans to right and if we really believe that in every human soul God put some talent some ability\nAnd our goal is to to create an environment where that that talent that natural talent flourishes the word education from the Latin is in ... to bring forth from within\nThat tells you that God put their our job is to put enough sunlight and water on something make it grow and help people\nAnd that's what I see Trump's doing and it and it's now hitting the forgotten men and women David that's the great story of the two years at Trump so far\n[noise] yeah yes and and we want to get back what Trump is trying to do when he says I Want to make America great again it means to restore its founding principles is Judeo Christian founding principles which is based on the idea that we're all created in God's image and that's why we had an alien Abul lights it flows from that\nBut I think the left is authoritarian by nature their economic coercion can lead to political coercion and that's where they are and I I think the left is losing it because they don't have any ideas that worked\nAnd I don't have any proposal so they're frustrated and they resort to identity politics and changing the rules and this identity politics dividing people on the basis of race and gender is\nEvery four to four years at the same thing rich versus poor versus young black versus white a rat race a sexist massage in this Tacoma ... Lama foe but they weren't dirty air water they want to kill children and grandma throw over the cliff\n... and final thoughts here from pastor Darrell Scott also Karim is with it and what is you have a last name right Kareem linear ... okay and David Limbaugh a David we'll give you thirty seconds final last word thoughts today what's gonna happen and fourteen days\nI I actually think that we stay ... the so called blue what blue way that we might even retain the house\nAnd we're certainly going to pick up seats in the Senate We're gonna come close we don't want to ask me to keep it and I think as the pastor Scott ... said well there's so many a minority voters out there who are going to come around the Trump or expanded opportunity he's not a racist he's opening opportunities for all people including black\nAnd I'm telling you liberals can't stand is\nA ... and the other people who were defecting from their plantation can't stand it this is exciting stuff it's I think we need to go on a positive message nationalize that these last two week how\nHow great would it be weaker transform cities like Detroit Cleveland elsewhere where every person that lives in this country has a nice beautiful house in a safe neighborhood a nice car truck\nThat they can afford to vacations take their kids to do is anyone there seven and be miserable but but they want to take their kids go out to eat not have to worry about a pastor I mean we all want the same things that it does is universal listed humanity\nMiss it is I really believe you next fourteen days is going to be critical for messaging as long as I mentioned in stays consistent also I think that you know they're the script in the Bible says this is no weapon formed against the self prosper I Believe some of these weapons that they formed against this nation I'm not going to be able to possibly even with this caravan I think is back firing I think that\nA lot of Americans share the same concerns about those caravans regardless of political party this year the same concerns that the Republican Party shares\nRight good to see a both Korean we've got to let you go to thank you so much for being with us past are always going to see and when you're in New York and I appreciate you being here David as always congrats another New York times best seller it's on Hannity dot com Amazon dot com uh when we come back a tight race for congressman Ted Budd we'll check in with him than your calls eight hundred dying for one Sean has a number\nOf an awesome Hannity tonight at nine hope you'll join us as we continue [noise] you're listening to the best of the Sean Hannity show a lot more of your favorite gas topics and memorable moments that's all coming up\n[noise]\nThis is Michael ... here with my ... from health markets helping folks find the right Medicare coverage that news reports say that the rates might be going down\nThe government protect the costs of Medicare plans will decrease this year so you have to ask yourself are you getting the best rate help markets opera's a free service with access to thousands of Medicare plans nationwide to help folks maximize their benefits and say\nWhat is it people need to keep in mind enrollment in the right plan is not automatic with so many Medicare options that can be confusing my advice don't go it alone get unbiased helped to find a plan that may cost less\nAnd cover more with lower copayments more choices like dental and vision and the freedom to choose your doctors with the enrollment deadline only weeks away it's important to act now our health markets Medicare assistant says freight\nThanks my this is Michael methods for health markets\nFor your free Medicare assistance Colleen hundred seven one three forty forty two beds eight hundred seven one three forty forty to eight hundred seven one three forty forty to\nBreak in while he and his family were home where Shannon who's blink camera caught a thief stealing packages both times blinked video clips were sent to police to help convict the crux\nBlink motion activated indoor and outdoor cameras are wire free set up and minutes and run on to ...\nI'm from ... from ...

incumbent isn't a fight to keep that dream alive is going head to head with a liberal Democrat\nGeorge Scott for this newly drawn district in\nPerry won the last three terms in Congress by no fewer than twenty five percentage points but now because of uh Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision\nThey decided read do you draw that state's congressional map as a district that has a chance of flipping and as Perry has said he knows the people the fourth district I grew up with them so when the district was we redrawing it was heartbreaking\nThat's the hand you're dealt and ah anyway a congressman Scott Perry is with us She's also a Freedom Caucus member and I wanted to give you an opportunity they really tried to screw you in this redistricting didn't they\nYeah Shaun thanks for having me on they have out this week the book they want it to flip as many seats in Pennsylvania as they can\nAnd they drew the district to make it to to make it much more difficult for somebody especially somebody like they used the Freedom Caucus member a to win and not just the you know you've kinda highlighted some of the things er during the course of the big thing they're doing which they're not just doing it to me you know and talking to all your friends whether Jim mark Louis Gates' whoever\nUh it's the same playbook which is a quiz actually it's kind of absurd when you think about it\nAnd that's this this whole thing about pre existing conditions and healthcare a show on you know they're the ones that screwed up our healthcare system and and passed Obamacare and uh you know you know a twenty five you're going to say twenty five hundred dollars keep your plan to keep your doctor all that stuff all lives right\nAnd now they're blaming us for mess it up um we try to repeal it of course you know what happened with John McCain put wet thumbs down but you know Sean when we fought the British you know the Freedom Caucus in particular fought that original a bill\nOut of a you know the ... the replacement bill for Obamacare because if you remember we're going to vote to repeal Obamacare and immediately repay replace it the original built that deal with preexisting conditions among other things\nThe Mark Meadows Jim Jordan the whole crew you know wouldn't talk to the president talked or leadership it said you know we can't support this you can't have insurance companies denying people with preexisting conditions that we we got that right\nIn the bill that we finally passed yet they're running this play book all across the country because they don't have anything else that we broke\nHealthcare well let's all hardly ... tried to fix it\nWell millions of Americans now they lost their doctors their plans and they're paying a lot more that's number one number two you know the big lie is will Republicans didn't support preexisting conditions of course they did that was part of the plan I Know because you're right because I remember that very specific battle\nAnd in the insistence by people like Mark meadows yourself and others to get that in the bill\nThat was passed ultimately in the house\nOn top of that the individual mandate is gone and I mean it all all Obamacare was was one huge redistribution scheme where are you going to have the young and healthy literally buying plans that they don't need or want being forced by law to habits or penalized if

permission or illegal aliens illegal aliens should not be treated the same as people who entered the U.S legally president's decision to end DACA\nWas heartless and it was brain was when we used phrases like undocumented workers we convey a message to the American people that their government is not serious about combating illegal immigration hundreds hundreds of thousands of families will be\nRipped apart if you don't think it's illegal you're not going to say I think it is illegal and wrong and the ... of American businesses\nWill lose hardworking employees\nAnd the argument them as the president is Americans do want to do the work wage jobs can't buy American workers to do the work is the president that is a crime in many instances that's just not true\nIn my view from the citizen to end the DACA program\nOr some eight hundred thousand\nYoung people is cruel and most ugly presidential are\nIn the modern just three of this country I cannot think of one thing though which is ... and more cruel\nWe've got to do several things than I Am you know adamantly against illegal immigrant people have to stop employing illegal immigration\nTo west Chester sodas in Nassau County stand in the street corners and in ... you're going to see people waiting to get picked up\nAnd go do yard work in construction work and domestic work you know this is not a problem that the people who are coming into the country are solely responsible for counting fleeing for them to worst\nCase families\nAnd it will include a path\nTo citizenship what a bunch of ... all of them almost partly as a matter of fact it is all the ah Joel is an L. O. J. what's up Joe how are you glad you called sir\nJohn ... the number one supporter of Donald Trump in the country I think he's the best president moral history he needs to send troops down to stop this invasion and I think you would agree with that we just can't afford to take all these people and we we have a Twenty one trillion dollar debt and so I Hope he will send troops down to stop this invasion of our country\nWill be nice of Mexico did their job and Mexico would stop them in their country and you know now they're trying to precipitated crisis that could be really disastrous for everybody involved in this\nAnd yet you keep reading reports that you know people are being take well taken care of well bad food and water you know the goal is to get them up to a southern border but you know what's happened to the seven thousand is going to be ten thousand more is it going to be a hundred thousand more what do we know about anybody that is in this caravan you know everybody come here because ...\n... well I think between and I've been saying this and I believe it I think between the horrible treatment of Kavanaugh the elimination of due process and the presumption of innocence\nMeanwhile they're silent on Keith Ellison and they're silent on Cory Booker and there are silent on Claire McCaskill's a husband between all of that hypocrisy and between the caravan and the mob that were out all all over the place this weekend\nAnd the success and failure Obama's failure Trump's success I think that there's a lot to get people to get out and vote we'll see what happens in Fifteen days though Joe thank you eight hundred nine four one showing our number Brian is in Lexington, Kentucky Brian how are you and we're glad you called sir\nYes sir I was calling about the migration in Russia on our border and\nI Want to know your thoughts about who might be behind the scenes organizing there's basically committing treason and is that something Trump could find out where the FBI and you know maybe you need to look into that and find out exactly who's you know hashed out this big plan now that we know what's going on\nListen we know what's going on we know that you know at the end of the day we'll find out where the money comes from that\nReporting some of those uh I understand you know America can't continue to support and prop up as the president has been saying\nAll of these countries that were given a lot of aid to and they're going to let people leave their country and come racing towards our border I'm all for immigration but it's got to be done orderly it's got to be done legally\nAnd you can have what you know you can't have seven thousand people just drop on our door and say take us into were horrible people uh especially when the only place they can seek asylum is the first country they get to that would be Mexico and Mexico obviously didn't have the will or desire to do anything in those ...\nAnyway appreciate the call eight hundred nine four one Sean if you want to be a part of the\nProgram you are listening to the best of the Sean Hannity show don't forget catch the Sean Hannity show weekdays right here on this station and stay tuned for right after the latest news [noise]\n[laughter]\nMine's getting sicker every day I mean I noticed the same thing the Maxine Waters\nYou know you get a crowd and you follow these people into a grocery stores in department stores and gas stations and you tell them we don't want them here anywhere anymore you know telling Henry Kissinger to leave the country Mitch McConnell not only did they tell Mitch McConnell to leave the country\nBut then they're talking about the guy smashed literally ripped\nHis leftovers I guess just maybe it's taken a meal home to somebody else\nAnd throws it outside the restaurant door banging on the guy's table somebody's gonna get killed here you watch somebody is or hurt severely it it's going to happen then nobody on the left ever\nCan critique their own side for the rhetoric they're using Anthony Scaramucci is with us I just finished cover to cover is ... brand new book uh and it's phenomenal and it's the Inside Story about Donald Trump it's called Trump the blue collar president\nAnd held billionaire living on Fifth Avenue identified the struggle of blue collar Americans had won the presidency and all those are the forgotten men and the forgotten women in this country and I don't think they're liking this mob mentality I don't think they like the way judge Kavanaugh was treated much\nAnd I don't think they like watching this caravan of thousands marching towards our border\nI mean they they literally are mishandling everything and so ... what's what's happening is uh the the president has almost like this light showing like you know you and I were out on Long Island in the summer or parents would hang up that infect light well the president has that the Trump Twitter\nInsect light and they're all going towards the late in the vaporizing a Senator Warren she's got to get a DNA test she's less of a Native American than you or me into the vapors Asian big caravan issue the way they're handling the care of an issue it's a galvanizing his base\nThat Kavanaugh's thing was absolutely ridiculous they were making up one story after the next they figured okay\nMe too movement seems to work there is no due process in the meat you movement\nLet's take this guy that did very well credentialed judge\nOh he's got an impeccable adult life let's try to destroy him\nGoing back to Nineteen eighty one in Nineteen eighty two and so again right into the Trump Twitter insect vaporized or so so for me I'm enjoying this the polls are tightening of the end of the president's base is actually going to turn out in much higher percentages and people predicted and so\nOnce again he's going to defy logic here I think we are very good chance to possibly ah keep the house we're certainly going to gain seats in the Senate and it couldn't happen without the energy and the for tutors for a President Trump\nWell if they do when I'll say this he's carrying a lot of these people on his back but you know what if you like Nancy Pelosi the dangers are what we're going to have endless investigation higher taxes keep Obamacare open borders\nNow the president is is battling back on all these ... in Guatemala Honduras El Salvador he says there we're not we're not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S now\nWe will begin cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid we routinely give them an Trump tweeted out every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally thinking blamed the Democrats\nWere not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nRemember the midterms it's so unfair to those who come in legally and he's right um well and and we don't know anything about the people that are coming here we don't know when when one thing about them and I know the media can be sympathetic because they want but you know who might mix in with the people that maybe just want a job is a big problem for us\nBut it's but you but here's the other thing okay the American people intuitively notion that it's just all it is is he or she is recognizing with the legendary built for even one set about any country\nIf you have a welfare state in the United states does have one you need to protect your Puerto Rico's free market forces dictate that people will cross over that border\nTo participate in your welfare state and so every country has a strong border and so should the United states I don't get\nA you know ... on on promoting my my uh my book that today in the last couple of days mom a lotta left leaning shows in the way they go they go nuts so crazy on the president's response all\nYou want to illegal immigration you have democratic and Republican presidents and democratic elected officials that of voters it was I don't understand why just enforcing those laws\nHave everybody saw ... ... ... what could the rancher possibly\nWhy don't they well it's a lot of things are we better off economically than we were two years ago\nBy every single objective measure the answer is yes the growth of the economy consumer confidence jobs created the number of people leaving food stamps or out of poverty eight million Americans so you know by every measure and more\nBottom the bottom ... percent of the society shutting the wages of five and a half percent according to the wall Street Journal over the last Eighteen months but as a direct result of the president's policies\nBut also the fact that he cut the slack at the border and so he made it tightened up the labor supply and it's giving lower middle class families shot you know kept reliving wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci
