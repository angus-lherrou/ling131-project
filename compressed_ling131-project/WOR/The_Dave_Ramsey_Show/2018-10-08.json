getter for the month will receive an Amazon gift card\nBefore we sign off Dr Dan idle words words\nI I think the focus here is preparing to compete and getting shelf space in the minds of people who really need your product\nAnd ways to do that so we talked about a very interesting way to do that at lunch or if you'd like I can show you how to do it and it's a way for you to get a top of mind for people who you want to talk to if you take out your cell phone and open a new contact ah\nDoing that right now that you take out two and a first name section put business in sports in the second name section just type in mistakes okay a minute I got to finish this okay I've been I say All right in the phone number such and put a nine one seven\nEight eight zero six seven five eight and a company named put Dan Schaffer\n[laughter] only found out [laughter]\nSo so the ... a reality the reality is is that if you want people to be able to remember you and they don't have your card you know remember where they heard you name all they have to do is tied been mistakes so almost everyone here today in some way is selling mistake it helping somebody prevent\nSomeone else to make a mistake\nAnd so in my phone if I type in mistakes on the contacts I have twenty five or thirty people that I work with who so mistakes on a regular basis or makes it infinitely easier for me to refer them to somebody but just said you know I have this crazy guy with his pool gate he sells mistakes\nSo it's had to put that together so if you're speaking to a group of people do you want to get the message out there never going to remember the name and remember where they show you but if you put it in this way it's a way if you get shelf space them I've everybody talked\nTo that's a that's a great point and of course listeners if you're an entrepreneur you'd be making a mistake if you don't listen to past which the profit right so\nAnd also mistake if you don't get Dr dance but click the rest of it is\nClearly a competitive edge for business sports and entertainment you don't have to read the whole but you don't you don't read the book you just need just roll a table of contents and your subconscious mind will tell you exactly what you need to reach for the next year going into\nSo thank you Dr Dan this is fantastic tonight I loved all the pitches and if I could vote which I don't vote because I can never pick my favorite one because they're also good uh but it was really impressed with everybody today and this is what I Love about being in the entrepreneurial space\nThanks again to our special just an Schaffer who memorialized his name and your cell phone if you were following\nThat long [laughter] so [laughter] you make it a thousand phone calls after the

her stereo tactic body radio surgery non invasive treatment\nWhere she just lays on the table we sending thousands of beams to hit the cancer and a few minutes and then she gets up and she goes across the street to Macy's or home or to work without the cutting and bleeding in surgery and without a surgeon throwing\nHalf of our lung into a bucket where it's not going to help anybody that's a huge difference between us and them that's why I brought this very tactic body radio surgery first to America when every\nHospital all the biggest ones all you can think of the super super ones all the

pay Dr Lederman whereby\nThanks Rob ya we are back I went to about a forty one year old religious man is married he had seven children he just came to see me yesterday in the office you came with his sister and her sisters like an encyclopedia of his medical care at least she believes she knows everything about\nHis care and at first she was a little bit agitated\nThan I asked for the records that I didn't rely only an herb but we're going to talk about that in a few minutes he's forty one years old last summer showed that he had abdominal pain you went to the gastroenterologist yeah the ... and ... which did not show cancer than he had a C. D. scan and see the scan showed a mass\nThey see the scan showed a mass in the abdomen\nAnd then he went back to a second gastroenterologist to the second hospital in New York City and there he had a second call and ask the when the first call to ask if they\nMiss the cancer so teaching point number one just because you have a cold last could be doesn't mean that sees everything did call and ask and pay and they didn't see this huge from gaining massive blocking cancer\nThe second guess we're all just saw it because he had a cat scans show on the mass\nThat's a little bit of a a cheating point you might say and they buy up seated on the second calling us could be found cancer then he went to a third hospital and they went to another surgeon at the super duper proper place and well they started this big cancerous lymph nodes involved and I get the surgeon must have been a little bit of parade\nBecause he's a super super famous surgeon as a super famous hospital St Elsewhere\nAnd the surgeon said well go started chemotherapy so then he started chemotherapy and he had about\nFour months of chemotherapy but while he was eating better and some of the pain diminished the cancer had traveled so in fact the chemo wasn't working very well there was new liver metastases he had that documented by scan by him or her eyes scan than buy CDs scan of the CAT scan showed um\nParents and the metastases so the whole abdominal cavity is called the parent's name and he had cancer the traveled to the parents them so the chemo wasn't working very well the Bible was working fine he was eating is able to move his bowels he didn't have any pain and then he went back to that same surgeon the surgeon who refused\nSurgery in the summertime because he said you should have came up now the patient has no pain no obstruction moving his files and eating and now the\nSurgeon says big surprise I have to do surgery because of the instructions because it might get obstructed in the future I Need you to do the surgery now and the patient believed him patient and they get a second opinion he was so\nMesmerized by the super duper famous hospital and the super famous surgeon that he got his surgery on his ... when he didn't need it he wasn't obstructed the ad no pain no suffering and meanwhile the chemo was at work and then the cancer was grown\nMany other places deliver the parents do have a date was blocking the year writer and meanwhile by the way that I didn't tell you but his year it or the kidney was blocked off\nAlready by four months Pentagon seeing these doctors at the super super big hospital and no one told him that his kidney was blocked off in his kidney was being destroyed and no one offered to help him in that regard they wanted to give ... which is a big expensive procedure they want to do surgery which is a big expensive procedure well\nHe had the surgery for no reason and he was in the hospital for weeks and then he got out of the hospital and then this month\nEnded up in the hospital again with the super infection from that surgery\nSo this man is forty one years old who was married with seven little kids one child is just a couple of months old has been in the hospital most of the last two months\nFor a surgery he didn't need and then for the complication the super infection of the surgery from the surgery he didn't need\nWhile and then I looked at the notes and I saw the notes the sister had brought all the notes\nAnd it said the reason for surgery is obstruction well the patient wasn't obstructed\nHis vows were working his is he was eating he was not having pain the surgeon put down that he was doing the surgery for obstruction in the medical note said that but there was no obstruction the CAT scan showed no obstruction the amber I showed no obstruction then the patient had no symptoms the surgeon did it\nOstensibly for a reason that didn't exist so again this is another surgeon doing a procedure remember the last case we talked about the surge and wanted to remove the woman's along and make a respiratory crippled for the rest of her life luckily she came to third Jedi\nFor Broadway and luckily for this forty one year old man he came after the surgery which was dying which is unnecessary which resulted in an infection\nWasting two months of his life in a man who has stage ... cancer with very limited function and finally now six months after being diagnosed with a obstructed\nThirty five years she showed me her pictures in uniform issues handsome beautiful woman she could run out of no she was the fastest runner in the army and she served at the highest levels but yet recently she developed a liver cancer\n[noise] she was worked up to them or I'm a blood test shut the mirage she had liver cancer and she saw surge it's again it's all surges and they wanted to cut out half of her liver and she declined in fact she had no knowledge of what she was going to do she just did not want to have surgery\nShe did not want to have surgery and for six months she went\nWandering around wondering what to do about this liver cancer and finally a listener like you told her about our work\nAnd she came here and we worked or up\nShipping that any new testing in six months so we re staged or found the cancer found that the girl one in six months now sort of one or two on the liberal there were two nachos little liberal because of the group I asked her about\nHer intentions and we spoke about all the options like we always do and she chose to have radios surgery and I should tell you one more thing we saw her and treated her three years ago and she came in this week she was just here complete remission\nAnswers gone she is fine\nShe came with pictures of her new military uniforms from the U.S service incredible feeling fine happy safe comfortable competed\nThank you for your trust in us and thank you for excellent response and we wish you well and hope she lives to be a hundred and twenty or good excellent health and human centered daughter last year she sent her daughter to meet up worrisome issue with their breast which we also saw\nOh talking about another man who comes in born in New York He's married with two children\nAnd the as a cancer on his ear ... cancer on the left ear and\nThe dermatologist and the surge just want to cut out part of his ear and put it in a patch do what's called moles MOH us most surgery he does not want someone cutting out part of his ear he doesn't want surgery and slicing dicing I should tell you by the way he knows what Moses he's already had he had it on his hand and\nHe had to underwrite bridge of his nose so he's had Moses on his nose and mo was on\nHis hand and he doesn't want it any more he doesn't like how they keep on slicing and slicing input patches in doesn't like the results especially when there's non invasive treatments for skin cancer like the work we do recruited\nThousands of patients with cancers including many many many with skin cancer over decades claim a solid base will so anywhere in the body when not to go say anywhere I could say any where some of the anywhere it's would embarrass you probably that that's who I work we do a mini skin cancers of course in sun exposed areas around the\nFace the eyes that knows that IRS mouth at one point we had\nMany many people about seven patients getting treated for cancer the nose all the same time because it is a popular well tolerated treatment here\nAt radio surgery New York one of our many specialties decades of experience a team that works together with a quip man that's the path physicist technicians nurses all devoted to\nNon invasive treatment of cancer including skin cancers including ... so so if you have a lesion on your hand or your father your nose and you do not want to have radical the farming surgery numbers surgery is a mechanical removal of your\nBody part of your body whereas our invisible beams attack the cancer and leave your body in fact I just saw a man yesterday\nWith thick skin cancer on his right cheeky sixty five years old a handsome man and run in the middle of his right\nShe had this skin cancer and he just did not want to have the deformity of surgery or most surgery are having part of his cheek cut out of the patch put it that would never look the same and he came to me is actually it was treated last year he came to be for follow up\nHe's doing great he's it er mission his cheek is fine that cancer is gone and that's the way we like it that's all we most commonly see with high success rates for skin cancers most anywhere in the body and I can tell you most anywhere\nTo add an email from someone who had my closest ... which is a kind of answers infiltrating through the skin and they've had extensive chemo and other treatments nothing\nWork and they asked is our treatment work and the answer is most commonly E S so we treat a variety of skin cancers even met a static cancers to the skin\nMany people will tell you the skin is the biggest Oregon and some cancers spread to this get breast cancers commonly spread to the skin many women sadly believe that removing the brass will make it so that the cancer never comes back there and in fact the most common site\nFor breast cancer to recover is the skin where the breast once was so just because you choose to have a mastectomy doesn't protect you for currents of the cancer another big teaching point if you want the best breast cancer treatment you might\nWant to come in here before you get to the surgeons real

native brain regions first in America\nAnd in the western hemisphere plus finding waiting surgery you can also call Dr Lieberman at you when you're killing this for a free informative and DVD paid doctor Lederman whereby\nWe are back when I'm such a Lederman we are here to be with you to learn together one thing about the fifty six year old man he's married and it was fine until about eight months ago he was seen by a doctor he had a biopsy a cancer to cancer spreads who was fine and those ribs well he had\nStage for cancer he started chemotherapy it of course that came all doctors say we'll take chemo because came a goes everywhere chemo was best for you well the guy took\nChemo and guess what happened\nNothing he's lost twenty five pounds he's in more pain he got a follow up scan and the chemo was not\nWorking came up when it works just age for cancer usually only works temporarily casket works\nI Know that came up guys love to give chemo I Love the pharmaceutical industry loves that you'd give chemo because it's ten thousand dollars on average a month the hospitals law but the chemo doctors love and almost everybody\nLoves that except for one person and that is often the patient like this man was only fifty six and a steady cancer losing weight loss twenty five pounds and paying the chemo was not working the scans show as a massive his bones\nIs that a steady cancer and he's come to us for treatment because the chemo is not working so many people come to us when the chemo does it work you can also come in place of chemo which is a great idea\nThat we're talking about uh sixty two year old man from Ohio\nIs married with one son and he has a Gleason six cancer and a PSA eleven so it's an intermediate risk if he had surgery radical surgery robotic surgery or standard radiation success rate is only sixty percent with us it's Ninety percent\nSo there's lots of reasons for him to come to us with radical surgery or robotic surgery\nMost likely he'll lose the sex life most likely he'll be leaking urine and ... the chance of success is not so fantastic\nIn fact if you look in our prostate book when You're welcome to call\nUs to get a prostate Brooklyn or come in you can see if you have a PSA\nTen to twenty and you go to the most famous surgeon and America the success rates only thirty percent\nSo again showing you the radical surgery removing your prostate robotic surgery is a lousy option it's a big surgery it's like getting hit by a train and there's a recovery and the complication rate which is so high complication rates to sex life that year and every life\nAnd this is what most commonly happens to men who choose surgery why so many men\nCome to Thirteen eighty four Broadway this man as a a Gleason six PSA eleven prostate cancer we spoke about all the options and he wants option number one which is us because he wants the best chance to be cancer free\nAnd there was a man who came to us from Germany's eighty one years old ... widow and his wife just by two weeks ago from concrete tightest knot pancreas cancer but pancreas title and he has three children eat\nComes from Germany's a non smoker and he had blood and urine so\nAnother teaching point abnormal blood is a warning sign of abnormal blood you may want to come into the U.S normal blood in the year and he went to see your hours just which is a doctor specializing in the urinary systems surgeon who specializes and that sort of looked inside and he saw cancer\nAnd the problem is you saw cancer but he didn't do a biopsy deep enough to show us how invasive the cancer was the patient at a high rate invasive cancer but he didn't take any muscle now though Blatter has two parts one has the lining where the cancer usually starts and then the\nMuscle the muscle the squeezes pushes you you're in my ear and out into the world what we need to see if that cancer invades in to the muscle without knowing that the doctor just started superficial treatment the CGI for superficial cancer but we don't know if he as superficial\nCancer invasive cancer they started treatment\nThat may be totally inappropriate for invasive cancer and the surges already told him that he probably needs to remove the bladder well this man\nCame to us because he does not want to have this bladder remote does it seem like a fight between us and the surgeons weld is but the surgeons don't tell you about us we talk about the surgeons in surgery but certainly didn't know that we exist because if they\nTell each patient the options the true options probably no patient or a few patients would have radical surgery on their own weather are\nNon invasive treatments like\nOur treatment for bladder cancer and that's why this man came to learn to truth to learn what's going on\nHow we could save his life and how we can save his bladder and what he should do and we made arrangements for him\nAnd he understands that the surge and discovering them treatment not knowing if the answers to the base of or not this is the work we do treat bladder cancer every day why because most people want to urinate in the same way that the ... and say we're toddler they don't want to go through a radical surgery with the same success rate\nWith a good quality of life with avoiding treatment fan I saw sixty four year old man this week he's married has five children he came in with a PSA fourteen has been seen by doctors ...\nFour times a night the doctors to help them with the urine and they didn't tell them that the PSA fourteen was off the wall normal PSA considered up before\nSo it was more than three times higher he's never had a biopsy exam but this prostate as prestigious large so what does it need well repeated the PSA we're giving them medicine to help with his urine and we're finding out if he has cancer or not this is so important he wants to live\nHe does not want to die of prostate cancer and he knows the people that are treated for prostate cancer have a twenty percent reduction in death rate from\nProstate cancer and I want to speak about a man who sixty years old is the counted\nHe was diagnosed with colon cancer the past two thousand eight and well he was doing okay until this past year it back and he was found to have cancer spread to the sacred he went to one of the super biggest hospitals and the tri state area the biopsy the bone marrow biopsy the sacred than the gave him Fifteen general\nLarge treatments to the\nPelvis for cancer was in the bone instead of doing what we do which is focusing on the cancer old Lee and give a few very intensive treatments he got\nLarge fields of radiation Fifteen treatments that three times more treatments two hundred percent more that was great that doctors get paid by the treatment we give the leaf tree but why because we want to do what's best for the patient focused to be on the cancer not hurt the healthy tissues was a super duper big place gave him Fifteen treatments\nTo general areas and chemotherapy and now he's lost control of the euro and the radiation after he had the radiation he's lost control of the year and that he believes that the emptying

New York\nState feels rated number one seven ten W O a voice of New York and\nWilling to throw it the constitution and the presumption that all women should be taken at their word\nAs right all the time anyone\nTaken at their word well I Know but no one's declaring that O'Malley always right [laughter] right now all the way we don't always right right now and I'm Sorry I don't think that's the case we have a foundation in this country\nAnd we can't just just throw it out just because right now they happen to be a lot of allegations in the media that suggest that there are a lot of creepy men out there which we all knew\n... el ... Democrat [laughter]\nSo um I was very impressed by the fact that we learned some things from this entire episode so and we learned how far the left will go to achieve their and will continue to go goals we know that\nThe establishment and the conservative wings of the Republican Party are United in this particular effort at least to preserve the court um or to reverse some decisions in the court that they found were\nProbably took away the balance of court because where it should start is not\nPro life or pro choice that's not the basis for this folks the bases was that the judiciary is supposed to interpret the law\nNot make the law and by the by virtue of the Nineteen Seventy three roe versus Wade decision they waited into uncharted territory they should never have gone there that was a state those were the state issues on life that were\nTo be decided because life abortion is not in the constitution\nI just like gay marriages end but look where that went to people in California spoke the people of California said it did not support gay marriage and the activists took it to the court to have what the people of California wanted and voted on overturned\nExactly so the crisis right now and how this is all going to go down as this way no one wants to say it out loud but right now\nThe Supreme Court is in a position to absolutely overturn roe versus Wade they're not going to do it I'm not saying they're going to do it folks that is not what I'm saying but they can if someone who was brave enough to pursue it and that would have to be chief justice Roberts and we know\nSince he rewrote Obamacare to having pass muster with the court he's not going to be the one to do it but that is the fear that is why people are in a panic that is why our side is elated because as you know\nPresident Donald Trump was very smart on this issue he put out the list of the jurors that he would choose\nFrom to sit on this court if you elect me I Will get and choose from this list all of those jurors were conservative they were pro life conservatives um\nThey are what else can I have served in the pro life right [noise]\nUm and they will he will choose from among these people they knew it they didn't think he'd when that was their first you know that was the first hurdle and that obviously open the door to a whole bunch of other issues that we have discussed over the last six months okay\nThe whole idea of taking him down well here they are\nThis was their worst nightmare it's come to pass a I Do not believe fun to\nWatch except for the senators and the innocent bystanders who are being targeted\nWell it is really tragic to find that the personal lives of good people can be orderly destroyed yes public Lee or by the machinations of a few because this really had to do with\nSenator Feinstein gets a letter telling her that someone is alleging some things that happened which were less than you know less than virtuous are involving a Mr ...\nShe left out the person that is making the accusations was less than virtuous whether or not or\nThat was the case it was supposed to be dealt with by the committee in private it was disregarded\nAnd brought to the public spectacle\nThat I came probably her\nAnd here we are and that was the whole purpose of this whole circus was to get it to be public so that in the court of public opinion it didn't matter what a what the law said and that's exactly where we were took us it took this to the brink of having public opinion override\nLaw and it took\nTo establishment senators okay call themselves Republicans to save the party so how about that the irony I well Andres ironic three two one zero seven ten joined us if you want to chime in about this incredible three weeks I mean it was\nReally nice to just not think about this\nFor um you know for about twenty four hours\n[laughter] but you want to get back to your point about her being a credible witness I mean how credible is somebody that\nI remember something that thirty five years later I mean the man was that age\nWhen he was appointed a federal judge where was she all of a sudden now this woman comes out of the woodwork with such incredulous accusations of or he is he was leading a rape gang and I\nWas a victim wouldn't do that I mean how do you remember\nThat and she had relationships and she never mentioned once about being raped she never told anybody this story entails thirty five years later when this man is now coming up to be a Supreme Court justice and when they first started reading her testimony she started changing stuff right then and there\nSo I don't\nTo me she was never a credible witness because if she was she would have been there when he was first appointed a federal judge\nBut by credible I mean there are acting abilities then we're quite a beating\nShe's a grown woman speaking in a child's voice of a five year old I think you can I please have caffeine\nIs that [laughter]\nI'm not even going to go there to characterize her her her her her voice on it I'm just going to say that\nI mean the whole idea of the the law is that it's blind and we shouldn't have to deal with things like ... down in ... not the adult and some [laughter]\nI agree that some parts of our debts money we're absolutely Lewis changing so\nHard to believe any by their her a motive state her uh her her\nHer distraught surveying cute it was it it made people consider what she was saying that was in fact true and it wasn't until he kind of\nDid the same for the other side that you had to stop and really have the dilemma and the dilemma was solved in this country thank goodness by the fact that we need corroborate nation of and evidence to prove\nThe mere fact that she wanted him to testify first and then her second I mean\nReally [noise]\nAnd then everyone else ... work all the other allegations which is that was part of the parade that we had all I I mean up to this point ah which we all predicted last season we predicted this is going to happen\nRight and look they're old summit goal is to try and put off this don't until after the midterms and they failed miserably a show with a bunch of lunatics they actually are and they hurt themselves and we couldn't have done a better job at destroying them then they have done to themselves\nWell I have to say they gave us a good handful of him is\nHe right to use an outcome in this election\nAnd for all of our criticism of a McConnell leader McConnell who you know is is not our favorite leader ah for the G O P\nHe basically kept it together and he uh basically coalesced all of this and all of the factions did come together and unite and that was probably the best part of this going into the midterms because now the party's United we stand the resurgence is now being called\nCabin uh effect\nNow how is that I waited for as he starts getting some liberal or cases coming out of court has reversed\nWhat was going to be a blue tied and it may just cause a red tsunami will see we've got a whole months ago who knows that'll happen in the next month I mean anything's possible\nThat he's not going to be moderate anymore when he has been the victim of the unhinged left\nThat opens the door to so much more drama because the next thing is\nDemocrats seize control of the house they will seize control of all of the committee heads who will demand an investigation of justice Kevin up with the intent of impeaching justice cabinet to unseat justice cabinet\nThat is why is that he ... as well as the results of the\nNever heard about pro ... still going on that was bumped off the front pages by this mess okay so that will come back in full force to obviously tried to impeach President Trump live oh what's going down a as we approach the next\nThirty days as we ticked down to the election\nFriends that can be falsely accused people that you love and care about the fact that you can just go out and said this now what does this do to male female relationship is moving forward you know what kind of protection does a guy I have to bring with him on a date now a camera and microphone\nI Will not ideal of either [laughter]\nAt work by myself with another female I just don't do it you'll I met right I don't do it or not and I've been challenged to you know I've been called\nYou know I've been called actually you know the people have laughed at me as I wait on the floor until the next car comes because I Do not want to be faced with it 'cause you know what in this environment and certainly at certain types of businesses you will not even be given the opportunity to ex marine\nBut it's just respectful to another woman anyway to not get in that elevator she's by herself why make her feel uncomfortable as well as you could be accused of something I mean and let's think about what they did to vice president Mike Pence because he said you'll never go out to dinner with a female colleague unless his wife is there\nNow here's a man who is respecting his wife respecting the institution of marriage\nAnd yet that's not good enough for feminist they want him out and about why so that you can accused him [laughter] falsely accused him\nSee no but you see what you're saying is not something that in my current nine to five I Would ever hear\nYou represent a very very small minority of fat or well the ones who are in the office sometimes Monday through friday the career women some of them yes very much into this whole\nFemale empowerment you basically support females regardless of situation that is what happens yeah\nAnd gets right down the line women are going to be hurt by that because what\nMan in his right mind is going to be bringing on women like that he's just not going to\nSell all that they supposedly fought for are being treated equally in the workplace now they've set themselves up to not be treated equally because they're not going to treat their male counterparts equally why should they be given the equal treatment\nWas very interesting that you bring up that kind of looking forward I don't think a lot of people men and women really conceive of what is going to happen years on down the line as we indoctrinate this entire society into this way of thinking\nIf it's going to destroy the male female bonds lately if the family unit even the the long term the wonder meant of dating you know an athlete and everything that we have built this society on what is at risk\nTo what happens to dating now okay so\nYou finally got to a point where you feel safe enough to ask this woman out so now you have that murky little middle ground right of how do we proceed\nSo are you going to have a question answer now oh can I hold your hand can I put my arm behind you on the back of the chair oh can I kiss you wow doesn't that sound romantic\nI mean the whole idea of our mission is to get everything goes either way really ridiculous I've never done it\nYou just go and hey you know and that's what ... did in his little his little these is Cory Booker ... guy de ... pay anyway he claimed he just went in for after she said no he went in for the kill even though\nThat was probably made up story doesn't matter he wrote about it and ah you know we're not going to debate that but the point is that you wrote about it and said she said no first and then he went in and try it again so I mean how how men supposed to take this relationship now and proceed\nWhat ... how how does it go from okay yes to a day to to being able to get married and have a family\nOr you complimented at the office do get compliments office\nYeah I I guess I guess\nReally I I don't ... women at the office anymore right I just don't you especially you're in a new place so I definitely want every night and I had that culture down I mean I've seen women who I'd like to compliment I've seen women who I admired probably\nIn front of ... million me like they actually want to be complement and and then I don't and that gets me up on their own foot [noise] well\nI Would just say in a workplace environment that I Would I Would depend on the compliment well let's get no job as a guy\nIn the office and you know we know that you are married I married guy and you're taking\nIn all I got to tell you to I I I'm loving this conversation right now this is great this was an award winning episode of the Jersey ... do I have to tell you because this this whole conversation it's a feel good conversation is taking me back to my high school years of this is one of those I err\nI'll tell you why sue end because you know in high school when you when you were a teenager you feel like you can conquer the world you feel in some ways in some ways you feel very vulnerable but on a lot of ways you feel like you've you've reached your stride you know now you get to be\nA grown up now you're someone who's approaching others with grown up coordinates and things like that and it all comes down to ... do you think she likes me do you think she likes me hope I say hello to her I'm going to feel it's such a geek\nWe've returned to that all of a sudden we've gotten back to this\nAh what do you think she thought when I said hello what do you think she thought when I said can I borrow your pencil and and now we are as old as adults were taking it back to that but it just to tell you quickly you know what a everyone has something they like or don't like about this whole cabinet escapade which which really [noise]\nIt's a little more defying if you think about it for both sides it's more than ... you know they're like I I I think I mentioned is on the show not long ago you know it it's young people are watching this there's there is no\nReal parental discretion in terms of like I'm sure you know the parents of kids that are watching this in school teachers and others are trying to provide a little guidance in terms of just filling in the blanks as to what this all means and\nAnd trying to bring some sort of proper moment I Am and what what is the lesson to little girls it's it's okay to lie what's the lesson to boys what what what is the lesson to the young people just looking at this with with you know if they were cartoons they'd have question marks\nOver their head and can you imagine what's being produced now or as you as young boys listen to this you're ready to get enough that they\nThink masquerading men are by putting them in skinny jeans and man bonds and making them look like feminine women is the answer to suicidal ills but we need\n... it goes beyond that sue and you know what what's happened this whole cabinet they mean everything you're you're you're citing here is absolutely true the this has been an issue and it continues to be an issue in the end as friends move along it'll always be an issue with the male versus female\nSense of of of who we are and what we do but the problem with the cabinet ... situation which is one thing in itself what is it done to err on the social and on the social and it's done it's actually done something kind of poor something kind of bad which is that\nYou know when you are when you take a room I'm In the walls are beautiful white and then you decide oh let's go blue with this well when you paint those white walls ashore blue what you've actually done as you've changed the tone of the room what's happened with this uh Kevin what I'm saying is that\nIt's actually painted our sense of character with our politics and now with his painted politics over character so suddenly it's not about how we behave towards one another anymore suddenly it's about for just British this one brief three week two week period of time\nSuddenly it's turned character into something political\nYou're right and and that might have done it in that area without conquered but to tell you the truth who needs it right in the personal relationship that's the last\nThing you're going to the personal relationships more than ...\nWell now we're getting back Joe we're getting back to the issue of well how should you know it's all going to come back down to just talking about office politics and all and these are very very significant important relevant vital issues because when it all comes down to is us people we all have to you know we are swimming\nSwimming today in the deep end of the red sea\nPersonal electronics virtual reality social media artificial intelligence or something when I was a kid\nI knew I was going to grow up and live in the world I didn't quite think I'd be growing up in a world full of this okay the Internet is great and I remember when that first came around but now it's we've we've surged way beyond that all we were doing is just living our lives but now we've surge way beyond that\nAnd what's happening is we have to at some point bring this back to our anthropological nuts and bolts what it all comes down to yes there's all this technology but who was it for who is it for it's for\nUs you ever heard of that term in the constitution I think it opens with the phrase we the people are you familiar with that phrase we the people you're you're you're a constitutional\nPolitical like that's where we'll ... we'll find you had to be a reality show is just right we the people that look we\nThe people who is it for who is the constitution for who's the technology for who are these advancements for it's for we the people and we the people are the ones who in the final analysis\nNeed to learn and understand how to inter relate with one another and I've never believed you know growing up there was a I'll tell you something I've never actually liked and uh okay shame on me I never actually read the book but\nWhen a book came out some years ago called men are I think I got this right men are from Mars women are from Venus perhaps the hours that I was a big big Oprah no your course or my horse yes I I ... the the the author's name jumped out of my head but but he's he's way to famous so\nYou know everybody else knows who knows the name but the point is that I never really grasp on to that concept because and this was long before long before I was married long before I was heavily into dating and\nYou need a U Haul make it a one stop shop ask about their ... rates they will pumped gas and make your next move real easy\nFor you hovers rations on the Jersey side called to zero one six one zero zero seven eight to again call to zero one six one zero zero seven eight to ... and let them know you're busy Joe sent you\nHire very welcome back in droves\nComing out of that animated male female thought\nThat was that was fun uh it's not fun that when you're in and now they buy their size in the house how men can be um\nWhere opinionated overbearing and we're we we stay prior to our state our case put it that way and you know sometimes I think part of the interactions that happened to the officer all based on\nPeople you don't like and learn to like or live with don't you think have you ever dated that guy who you loved and then you ended up hating two months later or haven't ever been really attracted to the girl who really drives me nuts now in the office [laughter]\nYeah I think it's more maybe you it's happened a on\nMore than one occasion at the office I think that's where the relationships for most people start in the office and that's why the whole idea of keeping relationships out of the office I never understood it because I think that's where you get to know most people that's what you spend most of your\nTime until you know you take somebody off and now you have a whole war on your hand in the office it's always interesting to watch but\nThese are the kinds of conversations people are having now um because it's become you know I don't want to be I don't want to be at odds with females at all in every facet of my life I just don't\nAnd I don't want meant to be afraid to have a conversation with me as a woman because of all the nonsense that is going on so how do I want a man who does not buy into this feminist crap\nI Move forward in you know being single and the dating world when now we have many scared to even want to look at your way\nYou know the men who are who are who are ...\nYou don't that's not the question they're going to have to you know the guy wants to look your ways going not going to let anything stop them but it gets harder as what you're doing right\nNow there's you know just another a stumbling block put in their way of of that happening not just me for for many women who now don't buy into this I guess we have to wear a sign that says\nSo that states are affiliation or we are going to hear a shortly from Cindy gross who's going to join me next week or two I'm going to make an announcement or on something that's going down next week but have you been listening to\nYour Facebook timeline lately\nMe yes I've seen you post a ... and stuff I've been kinda quiet this week okay we didn't cover it last week so I I generally like to put up the Facebook metrics for the week so what do you think was the most popular storyline on Facebook\nIt was basically cleaner now yeah exactly so it was what everything we just discussed and one thing though that has you know not gotten as much um\nNotoriety because of all this is the fact that everyone forgotten about the probes and it was forgotten about the people standing in sitting at the national game the football games and\nThese things have kind of been cast aside so in a way what's happening before the Supreme Court has done this all the favor and I would just really want it all just to kind of\nGo away for thirty days because I'm thirty days it's all going to hit us like a ton of bricks and hum\nNext week we are going to be joined by Cindy gross ... who ... who coined shortly but I Want to give us a the contact information for me you can follow me on Twitter at Jersey Joe Show\nOh

be joining us on the twenty first yet amazing how did you get to know him\nThrough Facebook we start making so many connections it's uh it makes the world a lot smaller doesn't it\nHe must be facing

banned in ah Palestine\nUm the death threats have decreased but I have followed threads of his um this man received received death threats on a you know a minute by minute basis not only death threats these uh Islamic men threaten to repay him\nI mean the sickest most twisted stuff that can come out of people's mouths a that man has heard and has been threatened with\nSo he's a real hero for standing up for free speech and that shirt that I wore last time I was on air of course with John could save their unless they went on to our Facebook page [laughter] I Love free speech so um\n[noise] well does sell his draw Mohammed taught um\nCartoons on his website so you know I I buy T shirts as a way to support what he does and to support his ability to continue to speak the truth because the truth just that you free and all of those that do not know about Islam and defend it without a having\nThe wherewithal to do a little bit of research and argue with me about it in an argue with him on

Michael Savage and not only the ... a journalist but apparently he's also somebody who could like tell the future because he was writing this\nBook for months and son have the tide of not being more finely then this week with that mass hysteria\nCan't win the next week Cindy grocers Jersey Joe and who are kind of signing off to the Jersey jokes show and the voice from New York Democrat wor\nWhen a parade program sponsored by Julia's on media incorporated W O lawyering of this program constitutes neither an endorsement of the products offered over the ideas expressed killer you are you a exhale eight detail in New York\nYou know one step\nIn and do you all our voice of New York and I hardly\nHave Seventy three degrees at eleven o'clock good evening I'm sue ... four sisters are among the ... people killed in a limo crash in upstate New York\nBy coming to the academy ... becoming educated and not trying to do it on their own is that there's a simple step by step process the system regardless of how old you are your background your education level if you're someone who's coach ... somebody has committed you can make money trading the markets like the banks do\nYeah and when you look at how we learn how to do anything it's really how we learn how to trading invest as well that doesn't change just because we're in the investing world and and the thing that the thing I always stress inside of my classes is that we focus on the skill and that was one of the things that my\nMy mentors really pushed on me about Fifteen sixteen years ago was focused on the skill and the money will come the the the issue ends up being is it's a natural tendency for us to stare at the money right out of the gate and we want to make I got to me I Want to make a hundred dollars a day we've got to be that starting right now right rather than building the skill if you have the skill you can generate the money but you have to have the skill first so many times\nWe tried to put the cart in front of the horse there and that's where the appropriate type of mentoring and teaching a different things like that can can can really help you know too many times we we approach the markets and and and when I talk to people it's very normally that did they say\nIf I say I I lost the question are you looking for a get rich\nQuick program you know and and everyone always says oh no no no I'm I'm not looking at looking for that and I say well good 'cause that's not what the financial markets are this is where you really have to develop the skill to be able to go in and generate income but once you have the skill you can generate the income but the skill has to come first and\nIt's the the patience of developing a skill that really determines in my opinion whether or not somebody is successful or not it's just like I I compared to flying an airplane I mean how comfortable would you be if you sat down a inside of a seven forty seven and you're about to fly from LA to New York\nAnd over the intercom you heard the pilots say well good afternoon ladies and gentlemen I just finished my Youtube video on drag versus lift we are ready to take off\nRight and that that's not going to get you there you have plenty of knowledge on on how flight actually works the mechanics behind it but as far as the skill to fly and navigate that plane across the country that's a\nThat's a whole different conversation and we would never get on that plane because that's a life or death situation but unfortunately we do that with our money all the time we did that with a lot of things all the time and and and when we're dealing with our money is a financial life or death situation that we could be putting ourselves\nAbsolutely let's face it we've been doing this for over Twenty one years right now we've had over half a million students have come through the academy to learn how to trade the right way the way that the banks make money that the end of the day what you're really hoping

Wall Street dot com that's O T a Wall Street dot com\nWelcome back you're just tuning in humans Larry Jacobs and director of instructor development and half instructor it online training academy the brains of the operation here that's for sure he was getting some light on how to make\nMoney as the markets are going up down or sideways how to generate more money how to generate more income and consistent income\nNo matter which way the market is going and whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time was there maybe you've been with us for the whole show don't worry the best is yet to come and learn a lot of our listeners are looking to really replace their income with trading and investing in some of them are just looking to you know fulfill that New Year's resolution of upgrading their lifestyle with a little bit of it is of additional income\nUm you know some of them are looking just to kind of supplement things other people are really out in that situation where they want to fire their boss there's a whole a whole gamut of kind of ultimate goals that people have when it comes to generating more income but there is that one consistency between all of these groups it all boils down to another source of income we've talked a little bit of a multiple streams of income passive income\nActive income and I want to use as you were saying the last in the last segment want to spend a little bit of time kind of diving a little bit deeper into these topics and when you guys are working with people specifically looking to to branch out their streams of income what's what's that starting point and what does that pathway kind of look like well\nStarting off with your whole idea about resolutions I mean we're coming up at that time of year Ryan where we start getting a barrage of videos and and ... and all this stuff about why we have to go to the gym you start seeing TV commercials\nBecause one of the biggest resolutions is what losing weight the second biggest is getting out of debt and this is something that a lot of students come in and out of the reason why most people are poor\nP. O. R. because they're passing over opportunities repeatedly we've been talking about this in the last segment you have to make a decision right now you have to shift\nFrom worrying about how you're going to make money to being able to think beyond just survival and a lot of our students come in they don't realize is a simple step by step process of how to make money is like institutions do you've mentioned this many times we talk about J. P. Morgan Chase for example\nThis bank has only had what was it nine losing days and five years\nCrazy well a lot of people are constantly going into the markets uneducated not really understanding how the markets work and then scratch their heads when they lose money the market was designed for people to make money if you understand the rules\nSo a lot of times like anything else with a job out there people start working they spend time at a job they get better and better at it before they know what they're getting promoted they're getting to do other type of things and get more and more responsibilities\nWhat I've talked to students about their biggest concern is right now is what we have another major correction where they're going to be able to make up that income\nAnd you know it's not a question anymore of if it's when we're already starting to see\nReminiscent of what happened in two thousand seven or the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates again we're starting to see housing prices going down again the construction industry is starting to to go down again so there are opportunities here for people to not have a situation happened to them again like it did before\nAnd I don't think anybody out there as on their deathbed going you know Ryan I Wish I could a worked another day\nYeah yeah that's not the that's not the norm when it comes to New Year's resolutions it's like you know we did a big news resolutions piece back in January on the show and then it'll be fun to do another one this next January but one of the things\nThat we we went through if you recall as we went through the top the top ten on New Year's resolutions and and one of them was like I Hope I work like you were saying I Hope I work till the\n... the day I die and and and other ones were I Want to downgrade my lifestyle and and and and unfortunately those are those are reality is that that that a lot of people end up in but they don't need to right they don't need to end up in those situations and it really just takes a couple of small tweaks\nI I I did a I did a lecture I don't even know it was it was probably eight years ago and I stumbled upon a recording of it a couple of days ago\nAnd the whole point of the lecture was about how little things become big things\nAnd so you can look at it you can look at things where you say okay well well what if I could generate a little more income and what if it was five dollars a day right and that five dollars a day could turn into ten dollars a day could turn into twenty dollars and it started with that five dollars a day and next thing you know a few years from now or maybe five years from now it's five hundred dollars a day right but it had\nTo have a starting point it goes back to some of the phone calls you always throw in like the ... and stuff like that where I I and I might miss this up so if I Do correct me with it on it but it is you don't have to be great to get started but you have to get started to be great right there's there's all sorts of fun things like that\nThat are out there that are that are will call cliche but they're also so true right there is so true and they're they're they're they're necessary\nTo say they're necessary for us to hear but then there are also\nNecessary for us to take action on if we want to generate that extra income because that's really what ends up failing in our New Year's resolutions as we say okay well I Want to make more money I Want to lose weight well there's there is a step by step process to both of those\nPensions intentionally because they want to make sure that they have this money available through our taxes will right now you should be thinking about and especially if you're putting money in every two weeks into your Ira we're four one K. you're investing at all time highs\nHas he might have mentioned I don't remember but let's just worth repeating that the market falls three times faster than it goes up so right now if you've been investing the majority of your money in the last couple of years at all time highs right now than it is a lot more room for this money to fall you should be concerned\nBecause we saw what happened back in two thousand eight it was a four O. one K. the became a two oh one K.\nAnd again it took about six years to recover well this is much higher than we've ever seen before in fact if I look at the Buffett index speaking of course of Warren Buffett right now it's higher and more extended\nThan we ever seen that index of been in the past and they simply means that if we have a correction and things continue what's to say this for all and K won't become a one oh one K. and do you have the time right now to be able to put off your retirement and still work\nWhen you thought you were going to be able to finally retirement and start living your life\nAnd the the the the the way to make money in the market hasn't changed or a thousand years we're talking about it earlier when you brought up shorting and making money as the markets are going down it's always been by low so high and it will always be by low so high so what's the probability of buying an all time highs as being by low up or opportunity\nRight can markets go higher than they absolutely can we're taking on a lot of risk in those situations\nThere's ... there's constant pull back there's constant wholesale offerings even as the markets are going higher and over paying for things is is really what limits are potential upside and what opens up the downside for ah\nFor for risk you know we we talk a lot about the the bullish biased and how as consumers we just usually sit there and buy everything we Bye bye Bye bye bye And right now the markets are going higher and higher and every pay the average person buys more stocks they buy stocks through their mutual funds to their four one case\nAbout through there are a speed through their IRAs doesn't matter what account type it is that ... that the general practice kind of around the world is on payday we just buy stocks\nWell it doesn't matter what the prices though just matters that it's payday and so we are going to invest into it now the markets are collapsing our financial advisors have a brilliant way of of of talking to us about why it's okay to continue to buy as the markets are going down\nRight a ... dollar cost averaging as the markets are going down and they say by more by more by more is it's going down and then when it comes back you're going to be rich and while that math actually makes a whole lot of sense the problem ends up being is we don't stop buying when it's on its way up if all we did was by on its way down dollar cost averaging would be very powerful strategy but\nWhen you're averaging your price back up buying it these all time highs offsets all the money that was invested in that for all and came back in two thousand nine and we're taking the\nAverage price up with this which which raises are risk exposure and lowers are profitability and in the end it's for one reason in my opinion my humble opinion and it's because Wall Street's businesses to sell us products and that's OK right we just have to know that\nA Wal Mart's businesses to sell us products too and that's how they make money and I don't think they're evil right and they'll think Wall Street's evil but as the customer not client noticed I use the word customer\nAs the customer we have to understand\nThat what we're what we're doing when we're when we're engaging with somebody when I go to Walmart I realize that I'm not planning on making money I'm just buying something from them and if that's the same thing that that's happening with us with Wall Street we've got to kind of take that into consideration with the\nWith the kind of analysis that we're doing on the situation are we planning on making money on this transaction if the answer is yes\nHow do we plan on making money on this and usually the answer after that unfortunately is is I don't know but that's where getting a little bit of education on how the markets work can go a long way and I say a little bit can go a long way and it really can a little bit of education\nWill put you miles in front of the average investor one of the ways where we can help you do that as we got a few more tickets so we can do a little give away as long as I said okay let's do it right now I've got to have their class coming up in your area they have to classes where you can see exactly what it takes to keep that retirement grown whether the market's going up down or sideways have more income for today and more income for tomorrow\nAnd just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these have take classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluding with your passes is going to be a professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional insider kept makes it so you get started right now\n... century twenty when he did a call now and reserve those seats the number is eight eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com and see if you can scores and passes there\nWe've talked a lot about the growing side of things with their retirement accounts really getting those retirement accounts to generate more incomes what about the protective side of things we've got we have a group of people out there who have made a bunch of money as the markets have been going higher than piling money into those accounts and what can they do to protect against the downside without limiting the upside\nWell most importantly you need to understand where your risk reward relies so many people imagine if I took it back to two thousand and seven what if you learn a skill that have told you to go to cash back in December of two thousand seven\nAnd then you would have had cash in your account basement bargain prices buying stock back on the way up and that's really what banks were doing they had one of the best years of their lives in two thousand eight fact I speak to our students all the time they're waiting for the next correction Wall Street has been waiting for the next correction at\nSome point they'll be another decade long windfall coming back\nAnd it's almost like you have the opportunity here to get a nice financial do over but most people again think they know best a lot of people I talk to you don't even know what they have in their retirement accounts how much they're paying fees I mean what if I told you\nThat about thirty percent of your say retirement money is going to go out the door in fees to your brokerage company that would probably infuriates you switch you have to start doing right now is thinking well if I hadn't been able to put aside money right now learning how to trade for income\nEnables you to start saving money what you can put toward retirement once you understand the right rate of return that you need to be able to compounded annually\nYou can start thinking about generating money you need to retire the right way and again this comes down to ...\nSenior cells educated what I said before earlier is that most people make the greatest mistake possible try to wing it on their own by reading books are watching Youtube videos and\nYou see right right I I'm not going to go on line learn how to fly a plane from a Youtube video then go up to fly in school and go watch Youtube video can I get in the cockpit right now and take off\nDoesn't make any sense well the same thing can be said about your money as as I Love from the movie the pursuit of happiness Chris gardener mother played portrayed by Will Smith once said the cavalry ain't come and you have to care more about your money than anybody else and that means protecting yourself by getting yourself educated as quickly as possible\nWhen whenever you'd whenever you bring up the pursuit of happiness and you say to covering coming it always reminds me of another quote a and I don't know where it originated from but our our our friend Keely would always say it over and over she'd always say this life is not a dress rehearsal\nOver and over I've heard her say that a million times I don't remember where she got it from but we'll give you credit for that one right now now one of the things about the fees that you were touching on that I just want to elaborate on before we jump into this break is as you were talking about thirty percent can end up going to fees and there was an article that I saw a little while ago that shows how the average person spends three years of their life\nPaying for the fees so if you make fifty thousand dollars a year you can expect to be about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in fees if you make a hundred thousand dollars a year you can expect to pay about three hundred thousand dollars\nIn fees one of the things you can do to avoid those fees it's really take control of your of your money but before you should do that you need to know how to do it\nWhat great place to start that just start that educational process is out of one of our half the class and we just happened to have a stack of tickets here Larry are you ready I'm ready All right well right now we've got to have their class coming up in your area and a half the class\nAs we can see exactly what it takes really take control those retirements generate that income for today and make sure that you have that income for tomorrow and it just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes on one of these have take classes\nSo if you were driving that was a great time to pull over and get that phone ready now included with your passes it's going to be our professional insiders kitten is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors my favorite thing about the professional insiders kittens it makes it so you can get
