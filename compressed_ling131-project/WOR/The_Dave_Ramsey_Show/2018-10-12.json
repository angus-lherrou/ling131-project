{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "And needed to capture a and so that's a lot of in the end you need a closer to rebuild your rotation and even with all of that you still have some unpredictability withheld rotations but maybe you go for it but you don't have a real farm system and so we can maybe try to compete for the next couple of years\nBut if it and and even what that you've got some questions\nOr that you're going to be able to because you didn't really compete last year you thought you might be able to and you don't really have much of a farm system ... feet\nOr so at some point\nYou're going to have to train some guys to restart your farm system because if you play it out to the end try to work with every body let 'em go to create the then and then you're really starting ... years from now starting to restock a farm system in your ears chasing her tail until you get there so the Mets are interesting but they're also somewhat complicated\nAlthough the farm ... it's not great but it's in a far better position than it was it said this time last year and they're not\nIt's it's yeah I think there's there are some guys but it's not it's not the bigger system yet I mean that's the thing is it's not really the feeder system you're not anywhere near where the blue jays are right now is they're getting ready to you know for the rebuilding they're ready to\nYou know breaking Vlad to grow junior and I don't play poker shot at some point Kevin ... uh they've got the Danny chance to get up there you know they're not where the Yankees are with that sort of south right now or in so they have some\nSome potential impact guys some of them a little further away but they like some other guys but you know it's not really the feeder system yet it's not like two years now they've got all\nYour system the way you want if you want to have waves of talent so you've got some upper level guys ready to hit the big leagues as they get ready to impact the major league level you've got that next group of guys to come in\nTo be able to protect some of the other veterans are aging or to be able to trade some guys to fortify you're basically roster you need that the players to play for you in trade\nTo be able to supplement your roster during the course of the season that's the level of depth of the Mets don't have ...\nYeah we're talking again with steam Philips a former general manager of the ... serious acts Sam ... as far as how the Mets are handling the interview process or the first interview will be with Jeff well bond as well as John ... general manager and then a down the line when their final candidates Fred will ... will get involved\nHow how differently when a candidate have to approach let's say Japanese friend in terms of their philosophies on the game they try to win both of them over\n[laughter] yeah I think it's I I think Jeff has probably more the guy\nThat will be breaking down the everyday responsibilities of the general manager and what his expectations are federal certainly have some of that but I think at this stage rats probably more the macro view of\nYou know what your general philosophies your general sort of approach because I don't think France is false chapters on a daily basis any bore a self ... got a lot to make sure you got a good represented the organization that you're going to be a good spokesman for the organization or that you're you know that you understand analytics that you understand people\nAre that you know 'cause I think they're going to look for more of a hybrid\nExecutive not somebody who's strictly analytics is a a strictly you know what I see is what I Believe or in some comedy too uh but\nYou know ... and I think the other important question here is do they want somebody with experience or do they want a fresh\nMined the fresh voice a young guy who has done it just yet um you know I think that that um\nIt's easier for Jeff in his level of involvement if it's somebody who has less experience but because they can kind of grow together in in that role and Jeff can have a little bit more input there are a more experience guy will likely say I got it\nI'll I'll let you don't want to do it but I got it right now ah and it's a little different sort of relationship so I think that will be an interesting part of this right that it's easier\nBandage on new guy a young guy like I was just easier for her Fred to have more involvement in in in ... that he was\n... he had the oldest of Christianity you know done it before he did he did he's an older more bitter guy or you don't have to kind of grow up with them at the big league level so I think that dynamic will be very interesting as well\nHow active with friends and your time as GM was it simply you go to ... I Want to do this and it gives me a thumbs up thumbs down how would you describe it\nI I I thought it was very active or I mean I talked to Fred probably every day for six years I was general manager maybe twice a day on the weekends and the off season I talked to all the time it and we became very close ah because of it uh he was he was active on a daily basis and\nAnd that involvement in you know I think that that ... you know every owners different everybody's style is different ah and you know Fred was keep play devil's advocate which I like you know he he challenged the thinking right so he didn't he didn't say this is my belief\nHe would ask questions to challenge the thinking to make sure that we're doing our due diligence you'll lie believe was I'm going to kill them with information\nSo that he understands that we're we're looking at this ... every possible angle and I wanted that to write so I when I Would interview you know interview when I Would be with my staff you know and they would have ideas I Would challenge the idea even if I thought it was the right idea\nI'd say yeah but what about this well what about that and I want to hear every angle and every side of it ...\nDoes a lot of it too and did a lot of that those sorts of meetings or will we get everybody together there and and uh uh you know and so he was pretty active or back then and I don't think he's nearly as active anymore I think ... probably takes on board that day to day sort of\nOf of uh you know be a part of those conversations and sometimes you just have to listen and you come out of a thing and I mean these guys are really looking at it from every angle good go get 'em sometimes you ask questions just make sure they know that you're still involved in it\nUh but uh you know I think that in the long run they'll let the baseball people make most of the decisions or it will just you know they'll work within the framework of a budget plan\nIs there a person you think is the best fit for this job\n[noise] well you know it's so hard to know like I like I I really like bed sharing to I think he's but he's he's not really in it or ah and ah but I really would have liked him to be a candidate for it\nUh but I think he can kind of weight pick and choose a little bit they got some really big things happening in Toronto there was some other young guys that that he can wait for the right job for him or to be part of it all uh I loved him during a with the Yankees uh you know no I don't know necessarily whether\nThat go to Peter writes ... for Neary or or whether the Mets go that route but I'd love to bring over some of the Yankee analytics so that Yankee way of thinking the ... you know to steal some of that information I think it'd be hearings for them or to be able to do it now David ... with the brewers there was a terrific job I Can't imagine why they'd let him out\nOf his position there are used on a ... a great job for them um you know dirt Porter with the Diamondbacks has a name that a lot of people have respect for as Jason McLeod\nYou know anybody who's worked with Theo Epstein in ... in Chicago would absolutely be somebody that I Would would want to be involved with it would give some strong considerations to uh he's been a charge a player development in scouting\nYou said side by side with deal and a lot of the decision making based on their way of thinking of the analytics the growth and everything and it's a large market team which I kind of like a show you know I could see clouds below the guy that could get so strong consideration\nHow 'bout uh Gary Little Rock ... director when you're the general manager of the team oh what what are some of his strengths and weaknesses\nOr tell you if if if Jerry can be included it is I mean I I'm shocked that he has a better job will be on your part of it is\nNot a self promoter at all if you in some ways probably to his detriment for his career because there is still part of it that if you want that job you've got to put yourself out there are a little bit she does it ever do that she is as organized\nIs detail a guy's is with the game a shoe chip player development in scouting does a great idea for talent has a great organization she brought us you know when I when I brought he'll be he got us\nYou know with our computers you know up to speed which will how far we we're lagging behind their up he has has drafted players he's developed players he's hired wired coaches and scout uh absolutely negotiating contracts he's a truck he's got a great resume\nFor it and I know he is so well respected in St Louis right now where they keep getting this this ... Charlotte coming up\nThat Gary Locke that she'll overseer player developed scouting a in St Louis so I think he'd be a terrific\nCandidate to be a general manager I just never seems to have gotten his do yeah he's a worker be not a guy that's out there you don't do it every interview wanting to do it he just goes about his business but it very well respected guide your district\nIt was walking down the street in front of a an appliance store\nAnd they had like ten televisions and the window and everybody gathered around the TV to watch the launch of the challenge him so we're watching the launch of the challenger\nAnd yeah you really can't tell what happens first but if you remember there was the explosion which weren't sure what it was but you knew something was wrong when the the plumes of the ... of the uh uh the booster rockets they started to go in separate directions and then you couldn't see the shuttle anywhere\nAnd that's when you know everyone is Katrina watching people got silent something's not right about this law well I was sitting in a car\nIn a Boston I was a I got up there to do a college basketball game and I was going to visit a friend in Newton and I was listening to the launch on the radio they broke into the launch all because\nIt was a schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe was drawn to New Hampshire right that she was on board so they they they cut and it was a bigger story in Boston the costs of Christa McAuliffe\nAnd I just remember listening on the radio and just as you said\nThere was silence for a few seconds and I believe I I'd have to look at the actual transcript or listen to it again but I think mission control says something like ... and there's a malfunction yeah just very matter of fact and I said oh my God\nI Believe that cold ... on the nominal yes yeah there yeah yeah your job actually 'cause I I I was broadcasting and don't you remember the ... ... ... and the pilot was in his uh his last words was I'm like go with ... ... and you also worried there seems to be able to see on the radio and I says\nThere's an anomaly now you see all night and I'm like God and I have read that you know the cockpit broke free yes and they they they were alive today were alive when they were headed back in Philly\nThing too I think and I'm always they they apparently um and I think in the case of Chris McAuliffe they had a personal recording device so they were sort of describing what was happening to them obviously when the the launch occurred yeah so ... recording devices would have still been live as the home and I think that some of them there\nWas evidence that one of them turned on the special oxygen they head and turned on someone else's oxygen so they were definitely alive\nSo when you say we learning the vices where they're recording audio here are a lot of weird theories about what they said in the audio no one's ever heard that on a our ability to archive deep away somewhere it's never been really never been ... they were all sorts of our theories about what they said in their arms of you know report cetera unfounded about him brain you know all that but we don't really think about that well we do know that they were alive\nIf he's just tuning in and wonder what we're talking about about four forty this morning our time and American astronaut anti Russian cosmonauts blasted off from Kazakhstan there was a booster failure\nThey had to make an emergency landing back in Kazakhstan and apparently they're safe they've been in contact with them they haven't reached the scene yet but they came crashing back there's actually video which startled me from Reuters of of the a parachute and the and the and the\nBook you know are actually bags are not ... that's\nThe way they land in Ohio every single time you know with that but my yes ... and Apollo they used to have those gentle landings in the ocean ocean float down you know the capsule and with Russians do not they land on land why do I I guess I don't know ... and for them I don't know I saw him\nWhat I Want to land the land I Want to go into the water ...\nThose two guys may be okay but that's got a shaky up when I'm ... the the thing is built to do that anyway so the video startling and apparently these guys are okay we'll have more in the morning I was on but if you just happened to be too and again that's what were you asking about ... you have the hurricane that now a ... and the CNN for one now I wasn't doing a lot of flipping I just had it on his back round\nThere were like nonstop wall to wall of all their correspondence getting rain down and the wind blowing away I'm not sure all the networks did that but uh uh do you watch some of the coverage\nI did that hurricane went through really quickly though it's already down to a tropical storm now now that well known that we've been downgraded to a drop by now but it went through George as a category three right right but if we have through which I guess I mean who wants to hurricane\nSlower fast but a fast one apparently is better than the slow one because it doesn't hang in there and drop all that water but they still have flooding and lots of damage and I believe the only only two people to too many are are dead but it could've been a lot worse well I have a feeling\nThat number may I think so I'll probably because they were fifty percent of the people didn't evacuate the the lot didn't evacuate there was a lot of structure I mean there's houses have been destroyed\nI Can't imagine what happened on a barrier island we will be checking in a little bit later on in fact at the at the top of the seven o'clock hour peak combs remember we had him on from Panama City beach one of those barrier islands I'm\nCurious what happened there Pete will give us the lowdown but I'll bet you are the homes were destroyed powers out\nSo I you know you fear that there's more than a more than one or more than two who have died now\nI'm getting a little tired of the grandstanding from the reporters do who loved to show that they're tough guys by standing out there in the rain ... the wind blowing them and they're holding on to the ...\nIt's just a little too much yesterday because it really was just wind and rain at one point they barely couldn't show\nThey all want their Anderson Cooper moment you know they all dream of being Anderson Cooper being a big cheese having their own show in Anderson got it because of his coverage of Katrina and you can just see in their eyes thinking if I Do this well if I hold onto this tree I could make my bones as an anchor person one day you're just jealous\n[laughter] see I'm not going to hanging out in a hurricane I don't want to hang on to her to a you know now that he's he's conquered radio\nAnd uh some of it not most Soviet associated with the front coming through so tough sort of store for some there will be power outages even through the Carolinas too and more flash flooding couple of flood warnings currently\nAll ride race aging W ours meteorologist he say Michael I think to myself my spray\nOr anything like that that's just with the Carolinas need more rain or after all the flooding they had in the rivers are at such a high level\nWe're going to get some rain here today which and I think it's\nGonna affect the giants game tonight do while they go they're playing in the Meadowlands against Philadelphia So I think they'll they'll get hit to\nThis is a really wanting to today's Len Burman and Michael read all in the morning catch them live tomorrow from six built in on seven ten W O law [noise]\nThis is a rewind to today's Len Burman and Michael read all in the morning catch them lives tomorrow from six built in on seven ten wor\nAfter you got it in my family has all these\nStories out to us this says sixty percent of people say they've seen ghost in our lifetime really why not sixty percent how about this group have you ever seen that goes\nI have not have you Natalie might have helped the printing goes now\nHow about the two Anthony's in there we have one and bringing the board and one is an assistant producer and they need us anybody knows that's ah let's see if we don't have you ever seen a ghost never so far have never seen one in that lose felt the\nPresence I have a ghost story for you though what my grandmother told me this my grandmother had this mean old spinster aunt\nNamed and ... and ... she was an amateur painter she died and my grandmother was one night when I was kid sleeping in an old leans old bedroom you know and there was a painting that anti olean had painted on the wall and it kept\nIt was crooked all the time and my grandmother would straighten it and she'd go out all the rooms come back in and it would be cricket again\nProbably wasn't center that was like you know I think it was just crooked all the time and she she she is like fixed it and put it there was just going to mess with her well then Angelino so she turned around after she straightened the painting and anti ... voice head straight in my damn painting\nGrandmother to row paintings upside down as wow yes I never went into their bedroom and I that's a great story that both\nOf them had a fight you know you hear you hear a lot of the Broadway stories of the theaters which are very very old people don't really tell all these theaters are oh yeah I wanted\nTo let you hear stories from the actors you know what they say for sure yep well ...\nThe Glasgow theater is haunted by that goes to David Alaska who built it and he used to dress as a priest\nWearing a collar and he'd have the chorus girls come up to his apartment which I've been to which is above the theater and they would have to confess their sins and for each day and they'd have to remove an article of clothing and people who worked at the ... theater say sometimes when they're on stage they look up and then blast goes box they see a man with a white collar sitting there\nKind of freaky I bet you if we we ask our audience they've ... I'll get a lot of those story\n... ... you got to go straight give us a call your one eight hundred three two one zero seven ten let's get ... get that if\nYou ever seen it goes we want we want we want the Dietz give us a call and they are they a arrested this guy that\nSun ... who runs the limo company where the twenty were killed up of states go Harry near Albany a so they've arrested ... Hussein twenty eight years old it took him into custody it was up\nOver a and the the reason why they arrested him they said the charge was based on the failed September inspection\nA at which the limo the crash was ordered taken out of service apparently this limos order taken out of service a failed inspections they rest of them I ... a charge with homicide\nProbably also people are dead it was a he was a ticketed for not having the proper license behind the wheel so the driver didn't have the proper license so they're holding the operator of the limo company responsible for that and this is state police superintendent George beach yesterday that vehicle\nWas placed out of service for the department of transportation and September of this year and should not have been on the road\nOr I'd ask for the driver Hussein\nThe operator prestige limbo in Saratoga county was issued written violations by the New York state police\nAnd the New York department of transportation\nThat the driver he hired\nShould not have been operating the type of vehicle involved in Saturday's crash\nSo they hold the operator ... Hussein twenty eight\nWas taken into custody in charge of cruelly negligent homicide in connection with Saturdays deadly losing crash that killed ... people\nI Wonder how that would have that is going to ... there'll be a trial obviously I Wonder how that will turn out\nWell he was told by police I think they saw him in the car driving dilemma when they said get that thing off the road at one point I mean that's how dangerous it was so we have a story about a ... guide Lindy bomber up in Rockland County a poll Rosenfeld his name is ... he had a functional devise a bomb Wayne two hundred pounds\nFound in his basement and his plan was to detonate it on the national mall in Washington DC on election day because he wanted to draw attention to this is what he believes in ... now you probably don't know what ... never heard of ... I actually can tell you what's rotation is ...\nNo no no because I happened to be interested in Athens and the history of Greece have a ... is election by lottery instead of voting for person you draw lots you know and you become the elected person because you\nDraw the line to be there and that's why I was going to set off a bomb because he wants a lot of leaves he wants he wants to elected official to be chosen by lottery not by popular vote and that's how they did it in ancient Athens but he was willing to kill himself over this yes ...\nSo clearly the guy's nuts lately gardening this is the uh on that story of town supervisor of course they know where exactly this happened this is a Rockland Rockland County yeah okay\nAnd they found the actual explosive device he had called him a known his intend to do something and explore blowing stuff up in Washington DC on election day so this was an actual act a thing and it was a real threat to the safety of our country\nNo I haven't heard the ah what the neighbors had to say I wonder if they're going to say I was a quiet guy guy has got yeah let's see what the cells kept himself the very hard\nI Can't believe I'm\nNot the millionaire how 'bout them some more does that surprise me no doesn't surprise me that happened in the community like this yes uh-huh\n... he got caught because uh somebody tipped off the feds uh he texted a guy in Pennsylvania He was communicating with them about the bomb and this guy a told the feds and so they went up there and they found those two hundred pound bombs so there you know unbelievable\nBut but to be willing to uh let's see authority search the home they found eight pounds of a black explosive powder so that translate into a bomb that would do weigh two hundred ... that's just unbelievable\n... about ... might not be a bad thing that she was our officials buy lottery\nBecause that eliminates faction wasn't you know people are making promises they can't keep building of blow yourself up over this for for for an ancient practice from Greece you know he's he's a loony tune you one of these what's he drink it up as a parent\nThis is where this happened to ... ... that's unbelievable two hundred bond bond though I mean he could have taken out more than just himself with that thing on the on the national mall it's just ... it was a lot of wacky people out there what what was the ah the Unabomber had some\nWeird belief that he was all caught up and he built practice some odd oddball thing really yeah I Can't remember what he's his shed by the way the Unabomber shed you can see it in the Newseum in Washington DC\nYou actually ... they had to shed where he'd reconstructed ... it's the shed yeah they put it in the Newseum as a model thing yeah if you lived in a small he lived in this tiny wouldn't shed and it's there and then you know\nThe actual make believe south of well nobody but anybody hit ... ... I was a sound very similar to that for what we could tell I mean you'd think you'd you'd launch it over the ocean those if they have to abort and come down they're going to land and now the now the miles away and then it's a remarkable that the\nTwo guys are alive and they have according to CNN they've been rescued alright also in the big four well hurricane Michael my namesake whipped through the panhandle\nCausing massive destruction wins getting up there to a hundred and fifty five miles an hour so far two people are dead but I think I Hope not but we'll probably find that may be more victims of this\nGo live in just a few minutes to Panama City Florida so we'll get a lot of reporting the moment\nAlso in the big four there's been an arrest the owner of the limo company that limo that plowed into that killed twenty people over the weekend no on ... Hussein twenty eight he was running the limo company been worn many times to get that car off the road he did not he's been charged Wednesday\nThe deaths of the twenty people near Albany and rounding out the big three not a good day for your ... or ... or your four O. one K. plans stocks tumbled eight hundred and thirty one points yesterday and it was led fall off was led by the uh the tech sector Amazon Netflix apple\nThey were probably overvalued they've fallen down\nAnd we have some audio now from mission control the American and the Russian cause were not in the astronaut they uh had a booster failure they had a crash land but they're okay but here's what it sounded like a mission control\nTheir own pace feeling down\nThe something's going down that was the translation though that's the Russian mission control this trap tighten up the straps area we're going to land\nAt that time there has been an issue with the ... and we're standing by for information and we continue to get it from the Russian control team that everything seems to be fine with the currently I can come with them and they're okay\nHow would you like to hear this if you're up there tight this trap yeah that is that affecting the cats and the strap years seatbelt around fasten your founder seats are going to be not just going to be a bumpy landing\nThat her they must have had airbags in that cat I Hope so All right now let's I jumped in to Panama City Beach Florida checking with ABC News correspondent Pete comes good morning Pete\nGoing and guys we've been tightening the straps here for a couple of days\nYeah yeah yeah so we got\nTwo dead uh fears that they're going to find them more victims of this hurricane Pete\nYeah and there's also Michael that there was going to be a people who go out and do things they probably shouldn't be doing then the immediate aftermath of the store and that's what kills most people in a hurricane is not the wind is not even the power of the surge of of water it's\nPeople doing stuff that stumped very bright at the at the aftermath of the storm right now six hundred forty thousand people without power to people have died one in Georgia and one in Tallahassee, Florida as the storm just\nTurned up path of destruction through the Florida Panhandle and into Georgia now I'm In Panama City beach I've been looking around that damage of Panama City as well it's it's\nDevastating it really is it is more than I think anybody estimated here on the island looking at they are going through the storm and looking at what happened here when you get into the mainland there are capsized boats are right there on the shore there are houses with\nThe garage completely blown off of trees down into houses trees down in streets making them absolutely impassable and of course as I'd mentioned nobody out here has any power\n... columns the ABC News correspondent and Panama City Beach Florida barrier island and ... can you give us a sense of what it was like at the height of the storm when it was passing through\nIt was incredible I I was outside a lot of the time sheltered at the uh building between me and them and the bulk of the wind but just watching this tremendous\nForce of nature blowing trees down knocking signs out a blowing power poles down with such forced that the whole added inverted than this one case in the ground with such force that it\nReally blew out of water line uh uh and the sound guys the sound was like nothing you'll ever ever hear again and it was this low\nBail full mourn the kind of sound that just you know makes you think haunted house and raises hackles in the back of your neck it was amazing\n... ... ... feet up to what do they look like they're prepared for this ...\nYou don't have a free place to a lot of ...\nThat sets around here and the first order of business for FEMA and for local emergency responders will be to find out if anybody needs to be rescued as I mentioned you've got a lot of trees down into houses here and that's going to be a priority also\nPeople uh I don't think high water rescues will be a major issue here with a storm surge is is come and gone uh the flash flooding will just one of those tax so fast that there really isn't a lot of flooding in this area I mean even last night there was a great sunset and the payment was dry that was amazing I've never seen that after hurricane so I think\nFinding people who need help getting out of homes that have been demolished by the storm a by trees falling and that kind of thing that'll be the priority today\nMaybe you told us yesterday that you thought maybe fifty percent of the people were staying and sheltering in place and this is kind of I guess makes it okay for instance the came through and they seem to be okay I guess in future storms people aren't going to heed the idea to evacuate I think that that may be a problem\nYou know I asked about that to a couple of people are actually several people who stayed and you know every one of them said to me I never doing this again I mean they were just devastated the the the shock of writing that storm out I mean the the four hours roughly of of this incredible\nWhen storm and and the rain you know it left them are really really shaken and I think a lot of the people who did ride the storm at will be the first to leave the next time a storm hit\nWhile the storm is not finished yet and it looks like the Carolinas are going to be hit with a lot of rain the\nYeah that's going to get it a gift shop to eight more inches of rain they really just don't need because you've heard the Cape Fear River and some of the other rivers there I've just started to subside from flood stage and now it looks like there might be more flooding before this was all over\nA period before Iran I Know you're located at the Panama City Beach Florida you described it as as a barrier island so I I counted up this thought that it was just going to be wiped out black and you give us some idea of what actually happened to this island\nYeah you know this was a resort islands or from Pedro there are a lot of really big condo buildings a lot of big a resort hotels that was damaged or at the holiday inn express resort and sweets uh the big canopy this huge canopy that over hangs but Dr Andrew drive it\nIt collapsed and crushed to a number of cars that God nobody was in there um I've seen a lot of street damage of power poles lying in the road it's going to be a big cleanup effort uh but I I got to tell you the damage here ironically was\nNot as bad as it was back on the mainland I can explain that that's just not the norm but that's the case of this in the store\n... alright ... comes down in Panama City Beach Florida Pete thanks for your time that guys\nAnd wow I just uh but the idea of a of a power pole and burning and the crashing into the ground breaking a water main I mean that's\nCrazy and his description of the sound of the hurricane is like a low bail full moon ... I think I said it was almost like a haunted house\nWell this is a Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum now uh you have your doubts about putting him on\nThe air is that what you were saying yes you ... you know listen it's the governor's job here it's not the guy running to be gone all day in and gave them plenty of opportunity because I'm sure they're supporting him oh so you're saying this came from CNN to the ... I saw him pop up on CNN I followed this is just an opportunity for this so Jill him to a\nShow that he's up to the job and a little little boost for his campaign will ... will be the judge\nA lot of people believe that we dodged the bullet today\nUm it's hard to say if you've got a three across your house and so I Want to keep that in perspective but as we think about the potential consequences of the storm in this area [noise] um I've seen it a much worse\nAlright rather hear from the governor yeah there was one on the job alright heres Rick Scott we're deploying a massive wave a response will be sending help from air land and sea\nAll right and we just had a peak combs in Panama City Beach Florida this is one of the people who stayed put her name is Colleen swab\nOr if it came out fine for down\nWith all the fans for family and friends here are very lucky and I turned around our storm\nDo there you go that's what people were saying did you know they did it they but they may not do it again here's some more of this or a resident Colleen swab\nI had my whole family and my daughter and we packed on food\nAnd water cooler and put it in our downtown or [laughter]\nIn there and it was over its\nKind of the response to like when NATO some people are saying this is similar in nature to kind of a tornado I lesson I'm not saying around invading army that a category five is coming my way and I got out and I know they're they're saying that OK Now so I mean maybe it was a mistake but the ... that was fascinating the way he described what it was like coming throughout a unbelievable\nLow bail full moon ...

O. R. dot com slash letter Michael speaking of turkey on a much\nMuch more serious note Michael yeah more details\nAre emerging or the disappearance of Jamal ... now he is the Saudi Arabian journalists who became a dissident and I was writing American citizen I I heard somewhere to you know for the Washington Post he did he did but he's from Saudi Arabia he was very close to the royal family at one point but he turned on them and was writing critical articles\nOf Mohammed bin salaam NBS they called and he's the prince of Saudi Arabia the crown prince of Saudi Arabia\nAnd he was in Turkey he was going into the Saudi Arabian embassy to get to some papers he's divorced and his wife and he was going to marry his a Turkish fiance and he needs to have some paperwork done at the embassy in the Saudi embassy in Istanbul well they have pictures of them going in\nBut no pictures on going out and it appears that Fifteen Saudi Arabians came in on a gulfstream jets to turkey\nAnd we're waiting for him when he entered the embassy and they believe although the Saudis denied this that they murdered him in the embassy and dismembered him because one of the people who came in was carrying a ... and one other one was a medical examiner\nNo they haven't found they believe this is under the orders of the Saudi crown prince who called NBS and ... yeah um\nHow ever there's some back play here and now that that's an ally of ours and we Saudi Arabia's long been one of our our gym a lot of arms but there are those critics who are claiming that ... that we have an Bolden this NBS guy to do it every once because we have is back\n... so the U.S has gotten some criticism and his two now\nFinally now you know there were some senators on both sides they put out a bipartisan statement to the president say hey come on we gotta gotta look into this and yesterday of for the first time the president did comment on this little bit\nIt's very sad situation is very bad situation and we want to get to the bottom of the kind of generic well I have to find out who\nPeople so we go in and that they didn't see him come out as they understand it so he's reporting what we've\nHeard this is a bad situation we cannot let this happen\nReporters anybody\n... grams all hyped up about this he said on it if if it if they can prove that the Saudis killed this guy that was going to be a real problem for our relations but you know the fact the matter is Len we live in the real politic world Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is a very important player in the middle east and we have to deal with Saudi Arabia we often have to deal with slugs\nBrutal dictators bad guys that's just the way you handle the world there are those\nWho are saying that you know come on the new sanctions against other countries you need some sanctions against Saudi Arabia you're even though we know so you're saying we're in bed with these themes but so you been in Saudi Arabia a long time can sanction him at all\nWell look I mean a number of the nine eleven terrorists were Saudi Arabian absolute and what do we do about that not much I mean the problem is that we've been dependent on Saudi Arabian oil for too long which is why we she should be developing our own oil resources here in America we were not what we're we have big fight to do it\nThank God Trump is drilling baby drill and\nThat's the only way they're going to distance yourself from these brutal regimes that we need the oil from\nI just remember you know when I started the show and how much criticism a Obama was getting when whenever something happened in the world the China or Russia Syria\nThe argument was well Obama's softer these other countries are emboldened will now their shoes on the other foot maybe this guy is a NBS guys embolden to do whatever he wants because he thinks a Trump has his back\nI mean well it's both ways Michael you know well see I think Trump can is quite capable of being tough on Saudi Arabia if it's proven that they did kill this guy well someone's got to figure out what happened to this guy he's not just walking the streets somewhere you're not hanging out in the embassy anymore I think drinking tea that's for sure\nThis is a really wanting to today's Len Burman and Michael read all in the morning and get them live\nTomorrow from six built in on seven ten W O R tomorrow from ... on seven ten
