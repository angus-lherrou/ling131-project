others sick a viral outbreak at a rehab center it turns out it was a very simple virus but these are their immune systems had already been severely compromise but this is gonna be a lot more that comes out of the story of what period of time are we talking about when did they for one of the first child pass away and I don't know I can be a lot a lot more coming out on the story have a hunch\nAnd it was interesting we were talking to a doctor Jennifer and Ashton yeah and I asked her what ... would be an example of how how kids immune systems should could be compromised and she said well for kids getting chemotherapy wouldn't be awful if all my kids who died were battling knowing or these\nWell we'd like to from time to time uh at this hour talk about what's going on in the morning talk shows yeah rounded up so you don't have to yeah well the hottest issue was caused by their own show and Megan Kelly yesterday on her show was talking about a black face and she'd understand exactly why that was offensive\n[laughter] you'll get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on Halloween or a black person that puts on weight when I was a kid that was okay as long as you're addressing other character\n... back in her day was I don't I'm not sure I I Know back in my I'm a little bit older than Meg and I don't think it was ever okay it was you know black people find that extremely offend basis\nI think making forgot yours on ... and ... and NBC and touches on Fox there for\nWell what does she the one who said Santa Claus is white yeah so she's she's stepped it up before yeah so anyway uh she went on her own morning show moments ago ... and now she's apologized\nShall I Megan Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry\nWhat was the way to handle it [noise] yeah but really arise\nThat's the way now I'm watching her and she's having a discussion how do we talk about race in America it's alright tap dancing so fast on this one what are you dumb thing to say ... now that Israel you know raise your your aligned is going there and outline okay I mind the idea and I did not go there now\nAs it was a respectful and part of the Halloween costume it's fluid okay well I was wrong and I am sorry\nI'm sincere there you're gonna have to say you're sorry\nThe things she sounds just you know putting on just putting on ... on the fake I'm Sorry what was he got to can you do the exactly well the ... her third comment\nI learned that given the history of blackface being used an awful way by racist in this country it is not okay for that to be part of any costume Halloween or otherwise\nI have never been at the same kind of person but I Do understand the value in ... sensitive to our history particularly on race and ethnicity\nThis past year has been so painful for many people of color the country fails so divided and I had no wish to add to that pain and offense\nYes one more high profile democratic figure has a suspicious package has directed at them former President Obama\nThe secret service intercepted a suspicious package that was sent to the Obama home in Washington DC obviously that's probably a closely filtered a ... no chance and he's going to go to email box to pick up anything but um they did the intercept this suspicious package and again it's just a couple of minutes\nAfter one was discovered at the Clinton home up in ... that when they say is pretty similar to the one that was founded the home of George Soros the big democratic donors so will lend you better check your mailbox\nAnd this is sounding not like a copycat deal but the the same kind of per seems pretty coordinator yeah wellbeing you of course a predictably Ewan Michael read all say this is a you know I say well if someone's targeting Democrats you guys say yeah the Democrats are sending it to themselves just to make Republicans look bad you\nKnow the point was huge automatically assumed it was a Republican\nIt could be some crazy far far lunatic left shoe doesn't think Obama and the Clintons are far enough left it could be an anarchist\nYou don't know yet line you know but you guys you know and I immediately jumped because it's you people who say all the Democrats who are the violent ones they're the ones I've always advocate violence they're yelling at people well they are ... they are yeah well it wasn't the Democrats wasn't the Democrats carrying a tiki torches ladies and gentlemen it was a\nAnyway so this argument is not going to end right here but it is a serious serious and what are you a target all these people uh yeah you want to get to the bottom of this and and and let's hope there's no more let's hope they get this guy because this is this dangerous bombs\nEl box and taken him no there's no chance anybody's going to open anything but the the thing is I mean everybody has video Soros probably have plenty of video around the house and I'm sure they have the audio video around language in the house so they may find the president did this er and says the breaking\nNews it was ... than it was the Clintons now's the Obamas with these devices being targeted their way we will continue to follow the story as

cheer like hell and then go home and ah and hug each other why can't it be a lot and there's politics is a very it's a nasty business I'm becoming increasingly\nNarrow really has but I agree with you though I think you can have a spirited debate you know God Knows we do every morning folks but you can get along as Lenin I well we we get along\nSort of well I'm going to start a few human not Jewish people [laughter]\nYour wife ... who wants to be ... white um so obviously the Caribbean and getting most news will have a ... report because we have an ABC reporter embedded in the Caribbean and ... will tell us the latest we have him I think about nine twenty three this morning if you want to check that one out oh\nI just heard from Natalie we may I don't know we may be getting a call from the oval office do today around in Fort ... keeping my ... now I Know John Carlos definitely joining us from the White House usually outstanding\nUh ABC News White House correspondent I saw him on world news tonight last night he's up there'll be with us today at a clock plenty to talk about well obviously the caravan and the big issue is the president says well who's better there and you have these terrorists and you have a\nThese people from the middle east but the more they pressed him and the more they press my parents they don't have any proof they just they're saying well they they could be they may be\nI think there's a very good chance honestly that said you have people in there tight I also think there's a very good chance that over the course of a period of time you have for they don't have to necessarily be in that group\nBut certainly you have people coming up through the southern border from the middle east and other places that are not appropriate for our country\nYeah that's true but what you have a problem with it if you're a terrorist organization and you now see that seven thousand going to ten thousand swelling everyday people\nAre trying to cross the United states border wouldn't that be a pretty clever thing to put some sleeper cell people in that caravan land you know you try to deal\nWith facts or something that though you and your president sometimes don't deal with and what about the proof so he was pressed yesterday by the White House press corps including John Carl who we'll hear from where's the proof\nOf interest there they could very well be [noise]\nAnything there's no proof of anything but they could very well be\nHe is very clearly he is simply taking precautions and saying and this is the sensible position to have land we cannot allow these seven going to fourteen thousand people on fourteenth out well it's growing now you ... can we go up a number it's growing they're ... they're picking up people along the way\nIt is it's swelling up it's a river of\nWell I was on Fox News as a second caravan forming in Guatemala I got another hurricane does\nOr they get the and they're all going to come and they're going to swarm the borders and the Democrats are gonna want them all to come here because they make a voters by giving them handouts that is the big democratic gain here\nBecause there's no ... well that's that's the ... there's no proof of anything so that's a direct quote from our president All right then he talked about the um the whole thing with the Saudi journalist and let's see what the president had to say about that he said the wasn't good he actually focus more on the cover up in the crime\nThe execution was no good and a cover up if you want to call it that we're certainly no good [laughter]\nYeah it was botched botched cover up right totally by just show the outrage for the crime not the cover\nUp at a never been done OK well there you know they thought about it he should've done it better
