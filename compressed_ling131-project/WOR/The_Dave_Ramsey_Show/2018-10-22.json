{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "So we ended up hooking up with a company out of Florida instead which takes children with a cancer cancer patients and they give them a full week vacation stay in the sunny beaches of western Florida\nAnd we don't need fifty gets to a organization called sand castles cuts but wow that's\nReally great so uh our our listeners can go to our website the passage to profit page of your heart law dot com and they'll be able to see the product the castle molds that you sell as a kid\nAnd so these are really neat it's about the size of a paint can write and it has castle parts on it and it looks like brick and and you you feel the bucket with sand and then turn it upside down and you split it open now I'm getting a no\nThat's all but you don't turn it upside down by right well it gets away from having to do that so you Philly I stand\nCorrected actually actually ended up frightening time All right you know no no no no tell us how it worked so hard to explain to me\nTo go back to what you said you can flip at you in many situations you actually can invert it it can be used either way All right so you can use it flipped upside down or right side so\nI Want to go back to the question I asked you before the show what's the longest one of\nThese that you've ever done or seen close to fifty feet Long Beach with that not beach Massachusetts that's where you're from Massachusetts right oh you're from Connecticut an advocate are very important question so have you considered including adult beverages with\nThe sand [laughter]\nWhen I had to build these things for my kids I Would have had all this time to enjoy an adult beverage instead of spending all their time building\n[laughter]\nSo how this no one's turned out\nThe snow it's been really interesting and a lot of the Tory insiders are actually telling us that that's the game changer for us 'cause we've basically hit the holy grail with inventing a Tory that has year round usage and\nThese would I think is one of the coolest things mean these are very cool is that you have these little light whose idea was lights was\nThat that was actually my idea I was going to um Clearwater, Florida last December\nAnd I said you know this this system well wow everybody but let me take it to the next level and they had this beautiful boardwalk where thousands of people cross by and I would have crowds at fifty two hundred people at a time asking me oh my gosh how did you do this some people thought that there was a landing strip on the beach 'cause it was so bright\nSo those are little Eli ... are they single Eli disease that you stick\nOn there the other single ladies there's a record you pull out you just put the record into a safe place and when you're done you clean the lights up and you put the record back in and it's reusable that's very\nCool it adds a whole new dimension to San ... right I mean if if you're if you're using one of these cuts I guess you're sand Kessler right is that the the terminology that if you're saying Kessler\nYou can decorate your sand castle with all sorts of LA do lights they're very small and they go around the parameters all of the round surfaces\nAnd it looks fantastic and I think it really adds something that we hadn't seen before in the world of sand castles and you told us before the show that you're close to getting on Oprah tell us a little bit about your experience with Kelly in and Ryan to\nKelly was phenomenal just such an exciting day to be on there and as we sat back and looked and here\nIs our create a castle sand table with the same table that was made in our neighborhood by our neighbor by and were next to all these toys Mattel has bro Nickelodeon all these big companies that were like\nOkay this is this real you know within like the first year of having it so that was just a phenomenal experience with um with Chris Byrne and then with the will\nTo being on the show help promote the business\nAnd a half after you were either got a lot of inquiries yeah oh yeah all over the country or even out of the reaction we\nHooked up to Canada I mean we we tapped into markets we didn't even enter\nThe ad that we didn't yeah and with with regards to we had pitched one me pitch to this story the retailer I'm In New York city is Adam ... happened to be on the panel um and you know they like the ...\nProduct everything is very excited about it and then we happen to see him again in at a gift expo in New York City and he came by and he realized that it worked in the snow as well which is again the big thing that's a game changer for us and he was just very excited and he said can you make them fake snow he\nSaid if you can make some fake snow will think about maybe I'll show this to Oprah so we have no definite plans with that but we emailed them last week because my husband decrease the creator of everything isn't a sitting in our kitchen table and came up with fake\nSnow [laughter] now that works I don't even have to be an Oprah's or if you're a consumer products I mean that's wonderful so I Love the smell idea too that's tragic but\nHe'll did both you guys put your fulltime jobs to do this then like how did this happen\nNo I'm actually by trade I Do website design and development some system in work and it got to a threshold where basically I have to hand off a lot of that work to Laurie so that I could focus on the side of the business so lawyer is doing a lot of the front and engineering our trained her\nOh cool so one thing I Want to say you

voice of New York [noise]\nProceeding was or paid programming W a large airing of this program constitution either an endorsement of the products offered for the ideas expressed\nDo you are you a exhale HDTV in New York\nCity you know one tune you out of New York and\nWithout forty two degrees at nine o'clock good evening I'm sue Gusman uh queens drag racer was killed earlier this morning when he slammed into a light pole in mass bath details from W O R snowing Laden\nThat often there's the maximum treatment I've seen so commonly woman have cancer of one breast they walk into a big hospital and the surge it ends up moving both\nBreasts they remove the cancers breast and that healthy breasts and\nNumber one if that women to come to us we would never even talk about removing the healthy bras [noise] and I can tell you one more thing while the big hospitals were moving brass for treatment in Ninety seven percent of women\nAt our facility in my practice Ninety percent of the women keep their breast sort of lots of reasons why so many women come one is that we're open minded one is regarding principles to do what the woman wants\nBut first to inform the woman of all the options we talk about surgery and we talk about came only talk about hormone so we talk about [noise]\nRadiation and radio surgery but it's up to each person the woman for example with breast cancer to decide does she want to have surgery or not the issue what came or not to shoot what or moments or not\nThe shoe want radiation or not we don't push people to do things against their wishes and that's the most likely why she came here [noise]\nIt's likely came here because she understands that we have a large experience of putting women with breast cancer for forty years or the thirty five years with radiation we see so many women with early breast cancer sometimes for them to come to us with a little ... little ... like that of a pin breast cancer\nAnd sometimes women come to us with breast cancer that has traveled and sometimes women come to us with breast cancer like this woman with a mass of local cancer just being through the breast and later on today we're going to talk about other examples of women that I've treated like this\nWho's abreast as healed who's cancers gone away masses even up to ten centimeters loving centimeters who's mask goes away with treatment here at Thirteen eighty four Broadway\nAnd this is the work we do this woman sixty five years old with this huge mass hole in the press about ... fun getting bleeding losing massive cancer\nHas had no tests when she walked into my office yesterday it was the first day she'd seen a physician about her cancer\nAnd we offered to stage are up and get a biopsy a biopsy can be easily done with a tiny little needle into this mess it's painless and easy we'd do blood tests including cancer markers markers for breast cancer\nSo she can evaluate how she is doing she can evaluate our physicians are doing\nAnd she we've asked to get a pet CAT scan to stage upper whole body to see if this cancers traveled\nBecause when cancers grow to such a large proportion they have time to believe their primaries site like in this case to leave the breast and travel elsewhere whether that might have been to the lymph nodes lungs or liver elsewhere\nSo she should know that it allows for a better treatment decisions for her and her physicians to help guide her I always believed that the physician doesn't decide anything\nThe physician makes recommendations to the patient and the family and then the patient mainly the patient the patient is the president of United States of his or her body\nThen decides it should not be the physician deciding it should be the patient who is informed and so she decided to go ahead with a little biopsy she's decided to go with a PET scan and we did the blood test already\nAnd then she'll come back the next few days and have an answer and that's the work that we do it'll keep you informed about what happens is woman with this\nHuge fun getting bleeding mail order as right breast cancer that has never been evaluated until she walked into our doors at Thirteen eighty four Broadway\nAnd speaking about women with cancer I Want to talk about a woman who has had a long journey\nComing not only from Canada where she resides but then to Mexico and Austria in Europe and now here to third today for Broadway what drives or what motivates or will tell you about this woman [noise]\nShe's sixty years old she's married with kids she comes with her husband from Ontario says about an hour and a half west of Toronto\nAnd there's many many hospitals and Canada's Canada's homo nationalized healthcare so you'd think that everything would be so fantastic there [noise]\nBut she found a lump in the breast and chest pain and well she went to the hospital with his chest pain and her doctors do an X ray and I said it was a normal ex rather center at home and they told her to come back in a year in the year\nAnd she came back in the year and she said everything is worse and everything was worse much worse and she had more and more pain and suffering and what do they do\nAnother\nChest X rays chest X ray is the most I Would say it's one of the most antiquated test it's been around for decades and decades there's much more sophisticated test to evaluate a person with chest pain if you're going to take them seriously and that's what we do here at third shitty for Broadway\nThe cancer was eventually diagnosed when she had a CAT scan it took a almost a year and a quarter to get a CAT scan in that country and Canada\nA lot of people say oh well nationalized medicine so fantastic as an example where she can get a test she couldn't get a test she eventually took them more than a year to get a CAT scan\nAnd when she had a CAT scan showing what was felt to be a lung cancer [noise] it took six months for her to see a doctor a cancer doctor in Canada\nTo see a specialist treating lung cancer\nAnd so what did she do she went to Mexico Tijuana where she paid tens of thousands of dollars\nTo get concoction ...\nHeat therapy some chemotherapy\nAnd some very low dose of radiation to the spine then she came back to Canada and by then that delay period had lapsed her doctors saw her gave her some more chemotherapy\nBy then it seemed like the chemo wasn't working very well the cancer was widespread and then she traveled to Austria where she spent tens of thousands more tens of thousands of dollars far from home she got hypothermia immunotherapy chemotherapy [laughter]\nThen returned home and for the last five months has been receiving vitamin drips and Adam has an ozone and lay a trail none of which has worked her last skin in Canada was three months ago her last PET scan while she only had one PET scan\nAnd comes to us that was terrible pain and our sacred honor pelvis or tell bone she's losing a tremendous amount of weight to the last six months she's lost fifty pounds she's gone from two hundred and four pounds down\nTo a hundred and fifty two pounds just terrible pain she's suffering terribly her cancer markers cancer markers or markers we talk about them ... at a doctor's in Canada ... to the markers\nAnd what did they find well her cancer marker six months ago was two thousand normal cancer markers three three point zero\nHer cancer mark was twenty three hundred\nA month and a half ago was more than six thousand and now it's twelve thousand it's doubled in the last month reflecting most pro with the cancer has doubled in the last month [noise]\nShe's suffering terribly she has trouble breathing because her cancers blocking the airways in her long she's having coffin shortness of breath\nAnd number two she as intractable pain because the cancers growing through her sacred ... spine bones growing through\n[noise] and so we remember all this has taken place over more than a year and a half\nA year and a half we in one half of day we're able to stage or a get cancer markers got a PET scan and get rid of the results of the same day\nAnd plan the treatment the same day together out of pain and suffering to open up her airways all the same day and we've got a PET scan gave her the results shelter where the cancer was showing where the cancer Israeli\nOffered to plan a combined modality planned to treat her to treat the cancer in the bloodstream treats cancer and the bones to treat the cancer in the long haul within the\nDay we did more in a few hours\nThat she had it in a year and a half in her home and traveling the globe being in three countries on two continents she finally came to Thirteen eighty four Broadway where she had\nAttention care staging blood tests physical exam explanation understanding and treatment to treat this painful cancer to treat this cancer\nBut the other hand the hormone treatments takes away testosterone takes away erections takes away libido often men gained twenty pounds often men grow brass and get sending of the bones and there's other on power both things have happened to men in hormonal therapies\nBut the main thing is it doesn't cure anybody with prostate cancer doesn't cure by itself [noise]\nAnd so eventually he saw urologist urologist who knows me into the ... just to the second biopsy and the second biopsy this is a decade later showed five areas of aggressive cancer\nHis PSA still elevated the scans show no spread of the cancer and so this is a kind of patient that we could offer a second treatment his first treatment was not adequate we could offer a second treatment and attempt to cure him\nI'm like the first treatment which did not hear him unlike the hormone therapy which we know doesn't cure men with prostate cancer by itself we have a chance to try to cure this man this is why this\nUrologist urologist as a surgeon who specializes in the urinary system\nSend them to me because he knew of her

your doctor said oh everything's okay and you said but Dr and tell people what is\nYou know okay let let me just backtrack a little bit I had been taking annual physicals for many years and uh it was a point at which they started doing he said and I think\nThat was in I'm just gonna say Nineteen Ninety nine two thousand when the place I was going to started doing the essays the first one I had was like point eight point a sitting\nNext year was one point to the next year at that at one point eight\nAnd ... up to two thousand and\nFive and went up to three point three now none of the GOP is that I had been going to during this physical exam that that that was a problem because it was on the federal\nThey didn't even speak about it too right no one spoke to but it\nWon't know absolute only one person said you know the last one I says it's three point three to put it on the cell you save a are you know without being that it was going up over those over those years I said you know what it wouldn't hurt to get it looked into\nAnd you were smart because going from zero point eight to three point three\nIs an increase up to four hundred percent more than it was four hundred percent increase is a high PSA velocity PSA velocities how rapidly PSA is going up\nRight and I have five men out there that that\nWell before the advice of men so you had a biopsy even though you're PSA was

perfect candidate for surgery to have the prostate well no but he never said what the side effects are going to be at that time I wasn't aware\nOf supply getting all of a cause that the harmful effects I just didn't want to get operated on\nThat was after the robotic surgery\nWon't your body surgery so they couldn't get an election anymore um and what happened to the cancer at a ranch fully eventual lay it came back and he's getting came on out right isn't that what you're told ...\nI haven't seen him in a long time because the keys I don't know what else happened to him while he's in a wheelchair now\nSo calamity so he had robotic surgery and it's a calamity really right\nAlso Lee ... was a I I Can't say that but I Know that is the fact that he's in the wheelchair has anything to do

R. voice of New York and\nIt's the wild west in the middle east folks and if you were to line up\nOur enemies and our allies and they are very very few who I Would call allies one certainty Israel our ally or democratic ally non Muslim Jewish below them far below them as a quote unquote ally I Would count\nSaudi Arabia and Egypt okay\nI Would certainly not put them in the same category as Iran and Syria so folks you have to use your judgment are we now going to\nHave the cancellation of not only one deal worth a hundred and ten billion dollars for arms so to the Saudis okay absolutely\nUm perhaps notified okay that's what they're calling for but other deals worth far more notified which means jobs to Americans okay\nWe have to tread lightly we're not going to base our foreign policy on an outcry from journalists because one of their own has its in Kenya which journalists\n[laughter] you know it's ... keep chime in in their slammed because it's the truth this is what people have to see I'm trying to be even handed but I as a you know a common sense\nAnd uh you know a\nA person is looking at all the facts here yes this man was murdered it was a horrific murder I don't have to see an audiotape you when we saw the ... the video of him walking into constantly never came out okay we know Fifteen people went in there okay we know what they're capable of\nBecause we have evidence of behaviors of such people slicing people's heads off\nIn camera view it Pearl\nThey have no shame they'll do this however we have to think of our interests okay Rand Paul\nWho we appreciate\nRand Paul's big mouth we do sometimes I agree sometimes I don't I never want him to shut up I Believe everyone should have their say but we cannot just discontinue policies that are helping the American people in that by that I mean the sale of arms to Saudi Arabia who relatively speaking is an ally of ours\nRelatively speaking so and do you agree or not\nI'm I'm just kind of caught up on the whole arms deal and then having them\nWe for the most part provide the Saudis with defense okay this is the first time we're really we are going to sell that because we defend them uh that's why they are so opposed to Iran obviously having nukes because they can't be left new clothes okay\nThere in the middle of the um\nYou know a very very uh\nIt's an inhospitable place to Middle East\nIt'll be interesting to but ... I guess\nThat we will all on the U.S yes or ... thousand ... joins us in the second segment who I'm sure has um worth the insight into all of this he is a cartoonist um who is a self proclaimed he's walked away from the Muslim So\nVery interested in hearing his take on all of this it's a complicated subject or I mean I myself am and charm but I'm not\nTorn on where we stand on it I'm torn on whereas policy the United states should fall I mean should we just say now that we're going to walk away from all nations who\nEngage in\nUncivilized behavior because we wouldn't have no we have to have no allies at all anywhere China okay do you do think that they do horrible things to dissidents people who disagree with the\nEven in Syria to our um the ... as far as I'm having a brain freeze\nOn drink country Syria a yeah I'm ... [laughter] ... yeah um\nHe's he's\nHe's not aches sounded Nobel Peace prize winner by any stretch of the imagination but he is secular and under his reign at least Christians were able to live and flourish once the a religious leaders come in certainly that is when all the churches start coming down and Christian start you know being the victims of genocide\nSo that it in the middle east is what it is it's it's never going to change their history is never going to change there's I don't believe there will ever be peace in the middle east it's just a manner I guess of managing it and making sure that he doesn't spillover into our shores\nAs the European countries have let it overtake their countries\nAnd with that as an example why we're not strengthening in Iraq thing a wall tomorrow I don't know\nI I Know everything is and the truth is in plain sight and everybody wants to turn a blind eye to it and we're all\nBecoming very very into related isn't it as these things are come closer and closer to home in the age where technology allows us to be in a conflict via a camera okay via satellite or within you know seconds [noise]\nThis is all coming home to roost I mean this is at our borders we have an army of people whether or not they are hungry or empowered is not the point if we were ... allow this over time we would not have a country folk\nCan it doesn't solve the issues of poverty and hunger\nLetting a few people in you'd still have left the majority out so I guess those people don't count so instead of fighting for our policies and ways for people to survive and live in their own country they all want to spill into this country and eventually there just is no more\nI mean I can only work so many hours to support people that are not my family\nAs rational thinking people with heart\nCan have sympathy but it doesn't mean we break the law\nSay because there are sympathetic at all not at all because when we fall everyone's going to fall right where they where do you go [laughter] we're supposed to be the example that other people other countries follow now that other countries\nCome in and invade and take over and make into the country that they just left\nSo it's interesting though that these two stories these two major national stories all come down to security of borders integrity of the people borders a language and culture is a a famous or online or you know radio hosts says\nI'm this is a a time when I'm\nOff things are going to absolutely come to a head because this midterm election where these things seem to be top of mind now are are there for one reason too when your vote for or against the policies of President Trump\nThis midterm election in less than three weeks ... is going to determine whether he has any power to do anything that next two years\nAnd let's talk about what anti plus he said that if they win a well conservatives are just going to be collateral damage so to bad to you who do not agree with us when has that ever been said or come from our side never\nBecause when you believe in what we believe in that means everybody prospers and everybody can when everybody can have a piece of the pie if they're willing to play play the capitalist game by according to Nancy Pelosi if you don't play hurt game and if you don't think her way you know it seems like\nWe're no longer going to be treated as an American citizen but rather as a second class citizen and our own country love are footing the bill\nAnd you probably won't have the avenues to speak of let me tell ya\nYou will be shut down on Facebook and Twitter and Instagram and every other\nAnd we see that happening right now the radio station that we are on a\nEmpowers all Americans all people to speak\nVery very freely over the air I don't have any doubts that should we have a change and not in this country than that because they made so much progress under President Obama okay to suppress this all started\n... the border issues the children in cages that started with President Obama it just wasn't reported folks this man President Trump who is doing both things maybe not speaking as\nA eloquently and we don't care\nExactly but a man of action who is turning back ... years years of a violation of constitutional laws okay that ... was supposed to protect the sovereignty of our nation\nYou may not disagree how he does it but it has to be done and if ... if it's not done now under him it will never be done\nAnd isn't it interesting that the Democrats the socialists the left is that they all are if their policy and their ideas were so fabulous why do they have to cheat to make them a reality they don't win by playing fair and square they win by\nVoter fraud dead people voting bringing in a legal isn't registering them\nUh that's why they continue you know going on defeated this is a very weak enemy if you really think about it you know historically speaking yeah they are weak but we're weaker or because we are dishonest we're we're not willing to see them they're killing thousands of us at ... for the last you know Seventeen years\nSays ... till now still allow them to remain undefeated it's it's it's sickening but it's it's also it's our refusal to to respect disparate and to demolish because we can do in a short for if we were honest\nAnd certainly a boss you need that kind of a it's a merger of dishonesty from\nLeadership coupled with a population of naive people who still are hoping and willing to embrace\nThat this kind of person can't their neighbor could never be like this but in fact they are\nAnd you have to use your own commonsense you have to use your own judgment you cannot follow what others are telling you because political correctness has led those people who are not knowledgeable down these very very scary wrote about political correctness\nWe could say is is sure yeah\nI mean and this is a dangerous I mean this we're in danger or are sold by ... and also it's just these you know [noise]\nAnd you know the average Muslim and a lot of ways even moderate Muslims and the west or Muslims [noise] I Can't stand when people look at American law somebody born and raised here there are more American than Muslim and they try to say that Islam right no no it's not I mean I I have cousins who\nEat pork they have dogs\nThey treat their women you know fine and you know who he calls us from my generation are and they're looked at as she is as long as fine well they're not following Islam their American right first and foremost good for them good for us\nBut don't tell me that the ... probably the only one in my family who is the wrong critic twice I um my mom had to occur on [noise] on a shelf it was it was written in an Arabic because she kept we are the ... ...\n... is the part about having it in the house is it ... it's a port in aspect and that's why you know shoo shoo Fitzgerald from ... to speak about the atmosphere is of his long meaning\nYou don't have to be a devout Muslim to be affected by it in some capacity in some way in some form you still pick up certain things certain aspects uh\nAgain they they didn't have like I didn't have to read the Koran to beat their wives it was\nIt's culturally instituted\nAnd it's also it's just it's inherently violence and this one aspect also bought in my family my cousin just to get into fights ... I mean I Want to almost like an everyday basis\nIt's just a brutal ideology my my father beat up to you know the entire family my cousins if you got the wrong pork sort of the bologna deport baloney right\nYou got it you know you got beaten up and this was just it it's it's a brutality or without even being again a devout Muslim it's still a brutal algae that affects those who aren't even observant of the religion\nIsn't it fascinating how the salmon is and the gay community have gravitated towards Islam\nMakes me sick I mean there there was a there is I'm a cartoonist again cartoonist that I was speaking to head I was speaking about you know ... he completely didn't want to hear it at all or nothing and then the horrific attack at the pulse nightclub happened right and you know I didn't follow them\nWell I bet you he hasn't changed his mind I bet you because the majority of people they don't even when faced with facts and the the thing that is so ... baffles me or is that given\nThe the fact that these\nIncidents are becoming more common place here where you hear of these killings you know ... what are they called the so when the when the father counter to honor killings they are they're happening in this country\nWho they are and music and how did they will but it happens often enough where it's a problem it's a real problem you have this ideology coming in in the country doing things that are absolutely antithetical to our\nTo our system to our sense tore tore civilization this is not us as a lot of America coming and they're\nForcing it and this has become a common thing and again if the media can hide it they will and they do ... they don't call it ... what what is ... ... I think you know and that's why I wrote a special job which has to translate a lot of the articles that he puts on a site\nRight over here this is what's actually happening\nAnd and ... out there speaking the truth I mean I cannot claim to be a scholar on the ... I have done some simple research to learn but I have learned\nAnd but yet when you speak that truth people look at you like you were the heat or someone on Facebook made a comment about Turkish restaurant\nAnd she was upset how the woman yelled at her about parking in the parking lot and I timed in saying well you know the parking lots of leaves the worries you should find out what the law is on the side and so I think when were you trying to go with it I'm trying to tell you one hundred dollars and you find out what it is and being an American and\nYou know having such an incentive for animals you probably would want to know about how food is primaries\nOn every car here in New York City hello hello hello hello what does it mean no one knows until you just you Google and you'll find out right\nBut the point is you know I'm being attacked for bringing out the fact that they will they exploit or their meat in such way\nSo let's let's just clarify for our vast audience allow means that this animal for your consumption was killed in a way that allowed it to bullied over time in the most rule way in the most painful way\nAnd you have to heat up people the first night a la carte explained it to me\nWell I mean it just as I said oh this is this just the way it is again it's something that is an alien to us\nBut they do they do want to express express this you know especially to us because then we would maybe he'll oppose it all and they hide it yeah so you know and this whole thing about this Muslims cannot be honest about Islam They can't\nThey they they have to lie they can live by the ...\nAnd they just can't let in the kennel of people in on it [noise] you know there was this attitude in our home to everyone outside the the whole more or less was what was the others yeah so and even again even moderate Muslims everyone was everyone was\nOutside that there was just no damn good especially if the Jews my you know they would they were to deal with the skill of the earth\nInteresting because we do we stay on the line\nBut they yeah they adopted the uh arbiter for Jews yo which was not at all but that's how the Cape seeded the Islamic hatred of accuses words you and your old language is used in the Arabic language\nRight well Farrakhan has just just recently come out and said horrible things and he was there was it was very little outcry from those in leadership because I I have to blame those in leadership and those in the\nMost of the media who have little to say about fire a gun you know saying are basically saying that the Jews are termites\nWhere she lived with that and I think you put it on Twitter as well and then she says something else she called him something else was was another derogatory to another nasty term and its audience has chocolate away and it's just just like you know this guy is a ...\nAnd they don't have to believe he's still on Facebook by the way and others who are decrying Planned Parenthood aren't\nBanned on on Twitter right and I ... with all the death writes none of those people have been banned\nUh no no they haven't and I ... I felt I complain about it but it just doesn't matter if you look just like well if you and this one one aspect of it will also issued discuss it honestly\nYou sound like you're talks about horrific things that's what they they they feel that you're saying some hateful only by merely by speaking the truth about it ... if a person\nThat's how horrific the ideology is ...\nYou know ... if if you if you discuss what the effects or if you to discuss how emission betrayed if you discuss you know kill themselves were were you find them it's it's a number of times in the crowd that's just sailed that's quote unquote liberals ... don't you hate speech right now we have a whole book of hate speech the training that this being a support\nAcross the west right as a book of peace\nThe other thing I I Want to touch on Bosh is how I'm Muslims can use our laws\nAgainst us and there's there's two interesting terms that I recently found and one is he's here which I may not be saying right but that is current for twenty eight which has other wishes to light and the burden for man was created week\nWhich then leads to the term director I DARE you are a which says if it is necessary\nWhat is permitted what is forbidden is permitted so if\nI'm if Muslims are not in the majority and let's say for instance allow food which there\nHave to eat is not available it is okay to eat non huh law if they are in a situation where they cannot pray five times a day it's okay to make it up later boy do\nThey have this ability to work around they've made it because in there's exceptions like we see all of these lawsuits being brought against companies against their religious right well brings out these terms\nAnd remember to let them know Jersey jokes that you ... line filter systems is a certified small and woman on business\nWhen you're traveling to Jersey City via the Holland Tunnel and you actually on the Jersey side make sure you take the first Exxon on the right you heard me the first X on on the right that's the Holland Tunnel Exxon let them pumped gas because in New Jersey we used to let you stay in your car\nYou need a U Haul may get a one stop shop ask about their ...

the truth which is less punching a fascist and that's a man punching himself that all comes from a ... you know store on right or what you mentioned so\nI you know and the interesting thing is how I posted a picture on Facebook and I always love when I get these little pleasant surprise the people who like my stuff and it's like Oh nice it's nice to know that that person is that it's always a pleasant surprise to find out\nAt a very powerful appreciate your point of view and you're on the same page\nYeah them you know it is\nIt's amazing how\nWilling people are in order to keep things calm\nYeah well not confront the truth and you know ... that is you know a lesson hours hide can take from the Democrats they don't care they are if United in what ever they desire well\nThe reason I say that the reason I Believe I they are United\nIs because conservatives are made up of free thinkers when we see something we don't like we say it even if it's against someone on our side someone with pretty much the same belief system where we're so individualistic\nThat we cannot be herded like sheep for a single mind thought\nCannot and that's why we have a bit of disarray on our side but we can't be heard it's like the left can\nWe value individualism and you know more craziness which uh that sense of um you know this\nWhole sense of um tribalism feeds is I heard from you that the new thing that trans gender is folks has seemed to eclipse feminism\nThe crying call up the left or as women unite for this cause when it's self defeating I'd absolutely self defeating tell me about it\nSo more men are infiltrating Women's Sports claiming they feel like a woman they are transgender they feel like they're a pony and trapped in a man's body without the literary that way\nYou can just thinking now you can just think it say it and you are ... and you're on the female team and you're on the female team and this man just wind it's cycling event I Believe out in California and the third place winner is coming out and she's picked up about it the fact of the matter is\nThat her only to ... you can cut off you can add you can do whatever you want your your mom\nFor a female male only now that are there are only two ... I don't want anything to say you're gay\nYou're a lesbian whatever changes trans gender ...\nDoes not have a basis in reality because a man cannot become a woman a woman cannot become a man you cannot change a person's genetic makeup you cannot change their DNA you can change can change their bone density none of it you cannot change its strength\nOf a man Women's Sports were segregated so that women can compete fairly amongst women and now these wimpy men who can't make it in men's sports are now infiltrating Women's Sports\nWinning coming in first taking their prize taken their scholarships\nAnd leading women it by you know eating dust\nAnd it didn't very aiding and the feminists are okay with this you're now you hate men but you are now okay with men pretending to be women taking over your [laughter] your sports how how is this how would they find the WMBA how our female\nBasketball player's supposed to now compete with men coming in on the other team they can't until we acknowledge simple reality that we are different but equal equal but different we bring different things to the table and\nIt's just amazing to me how feminism is posted I Know we talked about this last time I was on feminism is supposed to be so pro women\nFor a woman but yet they want us to have all the characteristics of a man none of none of feminism celebrates the fact that we can be mothers and we can have children\nIt's feminism tells you you should not have children you should be the c._e._o. of of the board of of your company and none of it\nWill be pushing on its face the same as to say that right but that's not what I learned our well you know I'm I'm told by the true feminist that it means that you can make your choices but then I see when a woman who actually make that choice big attraction you\nMade the choice to stay home you're no good you're not a real woman ... it's just it it's just pure silliness that a feminist is supposed to celebrate women but yet crushes everything had a woman is supposed to be and want you to be more like a man who they claim to hate\nThis patriarchal society supposedly that we have\nIt's amazing that some people will overlook\nThe facts they'll overlook history they'll overlook countries which are self destruct things they will overlook um a movements\nThat are self destructive in because it's a political correctness I Am because of absolute adherence to something that has no basis in fat\nPeople that are supposed to be defending women are nowhere there in his transgender situation to defend women they're not there for them in the bathroom by allowing any man who says today I feel like a woman and it's going\nAnd where is a woman's protection in a bathroom now she doesn't have any\nSo now transgender ism definitely Trump's feminism because there has to be a hierarchy and victimhood because we can't all be the top dog a victim's we have to share\nFolks Iraqi now\nAren't Lee transgender that stop\nFree to send us your thoughts and suggestions at a Jersey Joe choose your own energy male dot com like my book or a Facebook page the Jersey joke show and visit our website the Jersey drove show\nDot net also want to give kudos to our colleague a Cindy gross who tonight is the recipient of Rachel's children reclamation foundations Rachel him a new ... award for her uh her commitment\nTo herself was commitment to Israel and just cause and we congratulate Cindy or for that honor and I believe she got a big award in a ceremony tonight\nSo very good for sending Cindy was wonderful and she joins me next week folks uh when we welcome Anthony Scaramucci the ... ... ... who will be on the Jersey joke show\nFor the very first time so you don't want to miss it so back to some easing story about\nHow people look the other way because they don't want to ruffle any feathers right there are women are not doing themselves any good by allowing men professing to be women or on their way to women are trained to eat\nIn there a sport but it happens when it's\nJust the world is upside down inside out left his right right is left and um I I don't know how we write it all I just don't and you know facts or in front of us it's in plain sight\nThe truth is in front of you in plain sight but yet so many people um refuse to see it because they have\nTo uphold both folks using an ideology but when you tune in here to the Jersey joke show expect to hear it thank you ... a great show she produced in tonight this is the Jersey shore showed Joe ...

Wall Street dot com that's O T a Wall Street dot com\nWe'll come back if you're just tuning in human is Larry Jacobs and director of instructor development and half instructor it online training academy\nShed some light on consistency in the markets were talking about\nGenerating more money we're talking about generating more income whether the market's going up down or sideways we're talking about how much the market dropped a little bit ago you know it's been about a week or so since we had the big drop in the markets but when you look at those opportunities they are they are that they are opportunities to generate and again generate more income and fish and give yourself a raise\nAnd it really is important to remember that\nThe more that money is made on the way down just like the money has made on the way up and so really we wiped out number one we wiped out three months worth of games on this last market drop\nIf we didn't know how to make money as the markets were falling\nIf you do know how to make money as the marks were going down if you have that skill\nYou're able to generate as much money in a week\nAs over the last three months combines so it ends up being these great opportunities as one of the reasons why whenever we have a market crash there's a new wave of billionaires that come out of it yes billion with a B right billion with a B come out of it and a lot of times they are looked at as a\nA a not so they're looked at with not such a pleasant light we could say because when they made all that money a lot of people were losing money you know a lot of people were losing money in there and those are individuals though who look at a down market as a bad thing now these individuals that were turning themselves in for millionaires and billionaires\nThey were looking at a down market as an opportunity they had that skill set they had that knowledge\nThey knew how to approach that down market\nSo to think about a job if you had a job where you got laid off one third of the time that wouldn't be a very consistent stream of income\nBut a lot of times with the Bush biased with only making money as the markets are going up that's\nKind of the situation our income in retirement accounts or in if we are reliant on just one simple direction the markets go up down or sideways and if we only make money when the market goes up well there's two thirds of the time two thirds of the direction where where especially laid off or we're not allowed to go to work and so that's one of the reasons why\nIt's very difficult to follow kind of that classic just simple bullish biased and have consistent growth you look over the last nine ten years we've had this great bullish move\nBut how much opportunity has been lost on those down opportunities how much opportunity was given back in two thousand eight when the market crashed and if we don't have that skill set going forward this could be the beginning of this next big downturn where we could give back fifty or sixty percent of our retirement account how that instead of that\nInstead of going through that process again how about we understand how to make money is the market's going down we start doubling up on this stuff\nNo absolutely you know it's funny because one of the things that most people don't understand they start trading on their own and they make mistakes all the time and here's why the number one mistake most people making their lives when it comes to trading if they want to try it on their own first and then maybe get some educational ... later on well here's the problem that most people don't understand\nFive percent of the wealth right now is being shared by Ninety five percent of the population were Ninety five percent of the wealth is shared by five percent of the people so that means there was five percent of us who have understood the right way to trade how to make money\nAnd what's really scary right now and I talked to a lot of students says I ask them a simple question\nDo you work for more money or just money work for you and most people are working for more money they always believe that they're going to get ahead if they're going to find their freedom and let's face it people who start trading are people looking for multiple streams of income and most millionaires we discuss this right have a an average five income streams\nThey're doing so not because they're working harder they're working smarter they're figuring out how to work right and what that simply means is if there's a way to learn how to generate income without having to put more effort that's the best way to do it and most of the time\nPeople don't understand that trading as like a system what's the system\nIt stands for save yourself stress time energy and money love it if you learn how from professionals to do things the right way there's no reason why you can't be generating income as well most people either don't know how to do this or are afraid to do this and honestly\nThey keep going out there in thinking that they're going to attain freedom by working more and more well most people I talk to my students give me an example mc ... used to work in the workplace he quit he wanted to work for himself\nHe wanted more time with his family well if you can learn a skill that will allow you to make money the same way the banks to and you've shared district me many times Ryan J. P. Morgan Chase had only nine losing days in the last five years\nI don't know about you guys but I Want to be on that team that keeps making that money and the only way you're going to do that is by investing in the education learning how to do that can you see how this could help lead you to spending more time with family or just leave a job you don't like anymore\nSo many times individuals get caught up in the rat race and you start hearing people use phrases like time it's\nMoney right and that that's what you're talking about earlier as is exchanging just time and getting a wage right getting paid for our time now that the thing that we always like to focus on his money is money Ryan how can we make money how can we make money worked for us rather than like what you're saying working for working for money and that's really what starts to to to separate\nThe the the financially independent from the financially dependent out there are those multiple streams of income and a lot of that comes from having our money work harder than our body is working in the the whole time is money concept is something that I used to uh\nA lot of our students come in they want to learn the right way to be able to preserve capital how to make sure they're in the right funds when they're putting on their trades to be able to maximize for their retirement and well a lot of things that we hear right now is can you see or do you see how this can really help you pretty much preserve capital over the long term\nIt's always buy low so high it has been for a thousand years it will be for another thousand years that that has never changed and that was one of the topics are ahead of my class last night as as the markets don't change the marks don't change we look at it on a phone\nInstead of looking at it on a on a on a ticker tape\nBut getting printed off right but the markets still don't change it's all about by low and it's all about so high and somewhere along the lines we kinda got distracted from that and I think the average investors out they're investing their money on payday and they plan to sell when they're sixty five and none of that has anything to do with price and so\nIf we're not buying it a low price and we're not selling at a high price\nIs pretty much impossible for us to make any money now one of the fun things about the markets whether it's your retirement account or whether it's your income and count it it's the same right it's it's all about just identifying a low price and buying and identify a high price and selling\nNow we get kind of caught up in this\nWhole emotional back and forth of maybe stocks that we love her or or or things that we want to be invested in rather than being invested in the right things and and uh there's this guy Dan that ah when it first started trading I I I did a lot of work with Dan he was a a great friend ... you know acted as a mentor and many different kinds of aspects\nAnd then used to always say you can't live your stocks they're never going to have you back and he would talk about and he had a little story to help you remember it I won't share it out there but it was just kind of funny ... you would say you can't live their stocks they're not going to have you back\nAnd think about it if you're invested into a company right now it doesn't matter what it is if you called them up they wouldn't even know who you are right but for some reason we fall in love with potentially investigated this company who number one doesn't know who we are number two doesn't care about us they don't care about us at all and and honestly why would they\nAnd Larry you're talking about you know taking care of our retirement accounts and how nobody's going to take better care of it than we are and and it's it is true and the reason that I firmly believe that is because nobody has to live off of our accounts except for us right nobody has to live off of your account except for you\nNobody has to live off of my ... for me and so in the end as kind of courses that can sound nobody cares right there's there's not an institution out there that they that they stay up at night going men I Hope I Hope John and Mary have enough money in their retirement account\nYou know what they say that because they want to make sure they have enough fees being paid to them as long as their monies in retirement account but every day there's a new twenty two year old that opens a retirement account replaces somebody who is closing their retirement and they had this perpetual\nKind of ... income stream that comes from that anyway so at the same time though we stay up at night right the average person\nHas many sleepless nights over money but how much time as the average person spent getting educated on how to make sure their money is growing right I I find the financial markets very interesting because we go to a\nA car dealership and there's a car salesman there and we really don't take his advice on what we should buy but yet we go to a car dealership\nThat has the uh financial institutions name on the front of it where they're selling mutual funds and we take the cells persons advice to heart we go well he's the professional in the situation\nNow with a lack of education that's kind of where we end up ah falling behind the eight ball in the financial world one of the things that we can do is we can help a few more people out with that because we still got some tickets we can give away let's do it\nRight now we've got to have to a class coming up in your area that the cost of ... exactly what it takes to really take control those retirement accounts and have them growing generating more income whether the markets are going up down or sideways\nNow included with your half the class including with your past is going to be our professional insiders kit now this is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nThe professional insiders kitten makes it so you can get started right now because ten through twenty when he did a call now and reserved those seats\nThe number is eight eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com\nAnd see if you can score some passes there\nNow Larry still kind of on this retirement check I Know there are a lot of people concerned about growing their retirement how can somebody number one protect against this potential downside\nBut also inside of their retirement account is there a way for them to continue growth as the markets are going down absolutely a little out of\nOur students have figured out they can use other type of leverage assets to actually start accumulating wealth well our stock market is in a downturn so this great ways that students can protect their wealth they can hedge against it they're learning about options\nAnd that's why they can do this three hour session to understand what's possible in the marketplace I can tell you firsthand talking to our students students like myself and you too we've been waiting ten years for this correction think about that\nMost people are dreading a correction we are\nFrantically waiting for it because it could be one of the best years of our lives a lot of people don't understand that again the markets go down there is an opportunity to make money just as the markets go up so imagine learning a skill right now to preserve your capital where you can lock in profits imagine you did that back in two thousand eight\nAnd you had money sitting in cash waiting to buy those bargain basement prices\nOf stocks and they got back to two thousand nine well this is going to happen again it's been happening over and over again\nBut most people continue to do nothing and wait for something that happened like I said again the cavalry ain't come in and the reason why so many people are poor P. O. R.\nIt's just they're passing over opportunities repeatedly so if all this did right now by spending three hours of your time is help you learn how to preserve more capital so that you can retire and the lifestyle that you're interested would not be worth it\nYou know we always look at things in the investing world is risk to reward how ... what do I have to risk and what's my potential reward\nWell your investment in this case is going to be about three hours worth of time or half day classes about three hours long so that's your investment that's your total investment is three hours worth of time so\nSo even if you were to say that's your total risk is three hours worth of time what what's the potential reward what if you ended up generating another source of income what have you ended up adding another couple of points have returned to your to your portfolio every year 'cause really your risk is only time as far as you're investing three hours of your time to come out to this after class\nBut the rewards are potentially limitless that's a pretty good ratio\nAnd imagine that you learned for the first time that you've been in the wrong things in your mutual funds and your four one K. and you can learn how to ...\nYeah allocate to give you that rate of return that you that you really want that's what a lot of students are really excited about\nIt goes back to some of those are some of those unquote so we always like to throw out in here as far as you don't have to be ... and I'm going to do this one wrong or you take it it's yours ... yeah ... I used to always say you don't have to be great to start but you got to start to be great\nAnd unless you do all you want to Ryan's is you don't want to spend your golden years at the golden arch absolutely I Love that one\nYou know and and it's all the way over these fun cliches things that we love to throw around but they've been around forever 'cause they're true\nRight and we've heard him so many times because they are true no\nNobody ever says well no you you don't have to get started in order to be great you know you do you have to have to be great you have to get started but you don't have to be great in order to get started right it's awesome and and I love doing uh I get involved with a lot of different races were actually doing a charity race in a in a couple of days\nAre raising money for cancer and and I always compare it to just a race you have to cross the start line before you can cross the finish line it is necessary\nRight but it is it a lot of fun and trading investing you can take this really whatever level you want but imagine imagine if\nI imagine if it just made that slightest impact in your life to the positive how worth it with a three hour investment be now before we can get people in the class they gotta have tickets we got to do it give away\nLet's do it All right we're right now I've got a half day class coming up in your area ... really where you'll be able to see exactly what it takes to keep their retirement account growing whether the markets are going up down or sideways and now including with your passes to have to class is going to be our professional insiders kit\nIt's packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nNow the professional insiders kitten makes it so you can get started right now ... century twenty when you just call now and reserved those seats\nThe number is eight eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com\nAnd see if you can score surpasses there\nWe've got to take a quick break we're going to be right back Larry whatever force next\nYou know let's talk about the lifestyle of a trade or a lotta people now are sitting\nHere me interested in ... and they want to make a change to make a change in our lives but talk about what the facts are\nWe're going to fall back to current and show you what that looks like right around the brake ran and Larry we'll be right back [noise]\n\nIf you can invest just about three hours to open yourself to strategies that can make you financially secure for life would you do it\nFor over Twenty years on line training academy has transformed lives worldwide with their exceptional trading and investing education and they would like to invite you to a free half day investing class near you\nHere's one one recent graduate had to say\nOnline trading a cat I mean has taught me that he got to have a plan and they gave me the food is maybe a better trader a better plan or I'm a better father\nLed online training academy help you pursue your financial goals so you could have more time to focus on what really matters\nThe kid there static because I'm I'm available now and we can eat together as a family um I get my trading nine and ... they're happy", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "New York", "day": "22"}
