in and these two guys don't make it in time they start pounding yelling for the conductor and open it and then they realize they look inside and say boy\nAnd realize that he's in there eventually with this never happens I conduct or actually open the door again\nAnd doesn't leave these people's screening they come in so voice like all these guys are going to mob me like they're going to be annoying no they sit down next to him and just want to talk baseball so for the whole ride they're just sitting and talking about baseball wanting to pick his brain they know their stats and everything and he loves this and says it's his first real New York experience\n... so what I Can't believe about this story somebody recognize look void yeah like months ago I mean if it happened yesterday or in the

have nice things exactly I guess he didn't like his nice things he had\nNice things they didn't like them very much so uh\nI'm just glad the caller didn't get hurt and I think that's the whole story Todd butter leaves a couple of feet ... if the parents are saying oh so I mean it it's just dumb especially\nIf you're ... leads to like I think it was a pulled back or something of that nature or at

Clarence Thomas is stoic\nAnd he was empathetic to what grant cabin I'll went through he went through it too\nSo now we have two guys accused of sexual misconduct on the Supreme Court does a great court you guys must be so proud\nAccused Leno right David total evidence neared smeared by Democrat but you could be accused of something to do you want that to go travel with the rest of your life lend them you're accused\nAnd it's not proven for the rest of your life you're accused well are you in your heart of hearts sure that there was a complete investigation here now I Am sure that there's no evidence that you know where's the evidence\nI'll tell I'll tell you you know Susan Susan Collins went through it very for five hours okay and she concluded that there was no evidence and we don't know it was in the report but I'll bet you this was the clincher I'll I'll let you can do on this was the clincher that mark judge the key witness came out and said this did not happen\nIf he didn't happen it might have that it doesn't remember are are fine you want to parse it fun\nAre say All right now we're joined by our good friend Alex ... ABC News political analysts good morning to you Alex good morning gentlemen\nHey Alex I Want to ask you I I watch the swearing in of Brett Kavanaugh and a little old Ruth Bader Ginsburg she looks like not sleeping but expiring or the Democrats going to go completely insane of Trump has a chance and they know they're conservative justice\n[noise] oh I think completely and change a milestone we uh we hit last week they'll stay complete\nAnd yes uh this is now the motivating force for the Democratic party keep Trump justice is off the Supreme Court would drag women back to the stone age but Republicans got a lot out of last week to for the first time they have a message unless it\nIs not about tax cuts and losing your tax go to the economy going backwards not about issues have you on Love Rule in violence to ah to dominate washing do you want to make Washington even worse that's pretty powerful\nNow so you bring up a great point and I was ... that led to my next question because both sides are claiming that this will be motivating tool for the midterms which are less a month away so which side you really think motivates more\n[noise] well I think Democrats been motivated they're going to stay motivated you know democratic women are on fire you can't set fire on fire they can't get any more motivated so I don't know that it helps Democrats as much it'll it'll help them maintain their intensity\nBut Republicans were cool they didn't have anything to get them out to the polls go go reelect swamp it wasn't working\nAnd now they do they have something which by their problem is they want and successes uniformly fatal in Washington you know we all survive\nFailure we'd get up try again we're angry we'd go out and vote\nBut success makes people can place and that's going to actually hurt Republicans you a little bit\nI see Trump now going into a suburb of which are not too long ago a lot of the uh analysts were saying oh he's got no chance there he's going to places now which people were writing off\nMistake drill stay home or go to rich states the suburban vote is still\nDominated by angry democratic women and and I think that's going to hurt Republicans look this is helping Republicans in rich states like Tennessee in Montana but fish is hurting Republicans in states like Nevada and Arizona where you have large superb\nThe vote and and that's going to the intensity there's not going to go to Republicans look Republicans still have a very good shot of keeping the Senate House is still looking bad for Republicans ...\nOh I may ask you that were on with Alex Cross the honestly we see this book and why was joins this this week every time I I'm guessing you've done the math uh what does it look like right now in the house\nI think I think it's going to look for Republicans would have said a few weeks ago the Republicans could lose forty to fifty seats [noise]\nNo I think they're going to lose to us but maybe only Fifteen maybe twenty uh but I think it's going to be much better a bad situation is going to be a little better\nAlex how do you think this a big New York times story that the beltway has been touting about the Trump family tax evasion how is that really playing with voters\nJeep Donald Trump plays fast and loose like he does everything else shocking news news you know no one cares more about their own paychecks which seemed to be doing better than whatever Donald Trump did\nYeah you know I have a friend we were talking about that times where he said jeeze I Want to hire Donald Trump's accountants who wants to pay their taxes\nExactly nobody loves the Irish nobody loves Washington nobody loves government nobody wants to pay for it\nSo so let's say the or the Democrats take over the house does that mean the ways and Means Committee\nWhich will now be run by Democrats does that mean the subpoena the president's tax returns\nThey'll ship you know the president's shutters that means Jerry Nadler for\nNew York who will run judiciary will open investigations against Kevin maybe try to get to impeach Trump beach Kevin\nChaotic hearings on anything that walks talks are ... washing the first two years of the Trump Administration will be forever known as the years\nWell that's I mean this sounds like it'd be excited about it great for the newspaper business great radio [laughter]\nHey I one last question Alex for you\nWhen I see the protesters and I see these strident feminist going crazy literally clawing at the door of the Supreme Court it puts me in mind the old silent majority that elected Richard Nixon do you think there's a wide group of voters out there who are just appalled by that kind of behavior\nI think so I think there there's the Supreme Court was the last respected institution in government and those days are gone now it's it is a\nPlace where you play politics just like everything else it is it is from their respective structure that it had and I don't think we can ever scrambled eggs\nAnd All right Alex ... of ABC News political analyst joins us every Tuesday at this time it's going to be a fun call Alex\nWright Alex good luck to watch\nYou know I guess the most people are saying the Senate cannot be flipped but now if that were to happen there will be well raise the town\nCrazy to I think the Democrats that smear campaign against Kavanaugh backfired in many ways in many ways hey uh Eddie in\nPaterson one of the way and we're talking about the tragic limo accident said in your driver yourself any\nGuide them why they want me to make it quick I just wanted to mention and regal is not going to like this because I'm a Republican is always advocating\nFor business is regulating themselves you know self regulation that was not some work in this case you missed company had been wanting to regulate it and then saw Dr Robyn invented this would have been prevented man\nMaking regulation is one yeah\nWell we don't want we don't want may not regulated entirely I agree with you the way that they've got to look into these limo drivers in these crazy limousine that they're constructing out of control you\nKnow ... obviously ... certainly need that regulated ... alright coming up next to a game\nGoing on tour [laughter]\nCrooked coughing Hillary lick willy are coming to a theater near you God help us\nWhy this is a re wanting to today's Len

I Believe on Instagram page filling Bush a wrestling spandex outfit well he was wearing an odd outfit well how about I don't know or now to make a list\nWas in some strain of gay wrestling or was that we will put up the she want to put a ... budget in a span there was an odd I just wonder if that was part of his message I couldn't figure it out there has to be a reason\nWas seems like a permanent punishment for him it died in a way you know I think he served his sentence well it when he got off a pool here that have taken a page out of the Trump playbook and said\nSo what big deal go forward instead he folded he got all upset he tried to be sympathetic tried to be sad he tried to be remorseful he thought the liberal media the cocoon he lives in would forgive him but they didn't\nMm Mm\nWell I ... I I think I think he's I I saw I think it should be able to go back to work really well what was that comment again one of my most of the thing I thought\nYou were putting them in jail forever yeah I I don't I don't know how to use for a little Billy Bush [laughter] okay do you think\nAbout anything other than some of your Broadway cronies the have lunch with well I didn't know Billy Bush is intimately as you did apparently it's about ... but I worked with your pal oh yeah we have Cuba Gooding ah like Cuba Gooding junior coming out with us right yeah\nA forty right and we have ... yeah so the hope you nice to these people because I mean I used to run today you've been nasty the Hillary and bill you know ... the people who aren't around to speak back to me that's how I Do Atlanta\nAnd Missouri places like that where there's some tough a re election campaigns right now for Democrats I think it's smart point that a Republican made last week was that you know it's a lot easier to energize a voting base a voting bloc\nA around anger frustration and not getting something so the idea that Republicans could ride at this momentum Kavanaugh's confirmation for four weeks into the midterms\nThat's a tough challenge because they got what they want it and now that chapter is in some ways closed he's on the court and that's it whereas Democrats can keep pointing to that as a way to rally their side it's a lot easier to do that out of frustration and anger this is one point from a Republican who's been very involved in this process\nRama ... be seen as White House correspondent and Karen I'm surprised the president's been so quiet this morning because\nUh by all accounts he's had a good week some of the polls show him nudging up but of course\nIt depends on which poll is still very low and many of the Gallup poll for example buddies extremely high in the ... and Paul which always a treat some more timely um those whose Twitter silenced this morning so harsh surprise you in that regard\nHe wasn't tweeting yesterday morning either so you know perhaps doing other things this morning he'll I had actually no public events here at the White House today but he'll leave this afternoon to head to Iowa for a campaign rally is south of another aggressive swing for the president he's got four rallies over the next five days\nSo it's kind of keeping that are aggressive campaign schedule going between now and the midterms which is just four weeks away and that\nBig bombshell report is Len likes to refer to it in the New York times about the Trump family finances and possible tax evasion doesn't seem to be sticking it or they riled up about it at the White House or do they get a sense that the this is just not going to take him down and you know\nThat the press briefing last week after the piece had been published Sarah Sanders was asked about it and she very quickly just dismissed is false didn't say what was false of course it's a very large reports over a long period of time that they did this research\nAnd she was asked for specific she didn't say and the president yesterday also is dismissing it you know saying that he's done very well I think they're just trying not to talk about it\nBefore you run out about the romance now between the president and Rod Rosenstein who hitched a ride on air force one with the president yesterday\nThe president made you know I think is what his most definitive statement about Rosenstein job status he was asked before he left for a air force one if you had any plans to fire Rosenstein and the president said no I don't\nThat's as far as he's gone to say that at Rosenstein can stay in his position as the number two at the Justice Department the question is for how long I think the president certainly has been convinced by allies and advisers that don't do anything dramatic before the midterms but after that we'll see how long Rosenstein than this but he did say about two weeks ago\nHis preference was to keep them in this position\nSeems to be holding for right now the president said yesterday they have a good relationship\nAlright ... Travers ABC News White House ... thank you I can say Michael was a surprise you how absolutely dead quiet the more we don't hear anyone motion mall or we don't hear anything about the ... is that intentional on\nEveryone's part not to interfere with the midterms are well how do you judge that thing well it's\nInteresting I did see a reporter over the weekend that Mueller has been quietly letting staff members go which some people read as a sign that he's wrapping up the pro that would make in which case Boylan you might be really disappointed when there's no evidence of Russian collusion\n... but I don't know [laughter]\nBut I don't think he'll issue anything before the ... no I don't think so I don't it's not an ... character to throw a wrench into the whole war don't be so cocky and confident on this one I don't think he's going to spend all this money you spend all this time and say nothing to see her let's move on\nTo come up with something oh great so that's that's what you want just how I got to we're spending money so we gotta come up with something anything please desperation pretty much get back to the Yankees are on the brink last night so stark loss\nAnd do we shall analyzed can they come back\nTo this is a re wanting to today's Len Burman and Michael Louis ... morning lived tomorrow from six built in on seven ... W O R\nIs Len Burman and Michael real in the morning we'll be back with a new show tomorrow from ... W ho\nEverybody good night for the for the Yankees for the rent\nFor the I get to that earlier today yeah you said you have some appearances some arts club yeah the ... well you said it was the

Solomon goody as well George ... to ... does even though the correct name of the venue is speaking out\nWill undoubtedly bore those assembled not be Solomon Gundy club up the Selma gundy club it's what our gundy Osama gundy\nAnd um well you I heard you were saying before it was a food dish style but gun do some kind of a food dish it was a stew\nThat the ah club members used to eat back in the nineteenth century\nIt was also based on a name I guess so Washington are being put out something\nCalled ... or so there's no such person is Solomon Gandhi and it's not even a whole Solomon there's those from Georgia who calls me inseparable George if you're listening to put you on the guest list tonight okay you're going to see what they say it's one of the oldest of how ...\nOh it's beautiful it's a beautiful building on Fifth Avenue around eleven twelve streets gorgeous building but I Will be there six thirty date panel about the future of arts journals Len will be there in the front row cheering the on right Lynn\nRuth Bader Ginsburg will be there and what\nDoes it does I was there as [laughter] would\nYou open a drag leave that out by your drink okay well now you see the other way or the Yankees never in their history they lost the so badly so poorly they lost sixteen to one of ... the Yankees piled on as soon as several Reno came out of the game this happened\nOn right now the white feline bearable skills little store Bradley comes in life either like he's going to get waves home a judge or a problem getting a bottle of water faces\nAnd the red Sox late at seven foot\nAs joke is typically on a W E radio in Boston but while they're really a problem as you know because we discuss little for and you figure it out the cycle so we're very proud of you make him a first time in major league postseason history the one player at a single a double\nTriple home run in the same game that someone would be rock hold\nOur here's the rock star with an ID sad\nThat's cute Joe the rock star a rock star oh the ... very cute wasn't none of that often you don't hear this on a New York broadcasters abroad\nWait to read what they found a line toward the corner hooking\nHomework for the rock star [noise] he\nMe [laughter] time in his career\nWell the real headline there's this never happened in the postseason ... that's a that's pretty well so it's an either or it's all on the sea sees the bath usual out a lot of pressure Yankees have to win and if they got tell you a I don't know a real judge shows over\nThe line as New Year's breaking up a now I Know I don't know I don't know how\nYou see what the caller has in it that way [laughter] let's get back to our lead you in the sports casting world you were just inducted into the Syracuse broadcasters hall of fame I ask you a simple question what is your gut tell you and you say I don't know\nNo one's going to hold it against you\nI tend to think that the Boston move very well rapid uh though I think it's an action when you walk\nOut on why why why\nI just I've had a very bad gut feelings before most of its you know just from working [laughter] what do you want a good feeling of sports you never know that well how would have guessed sixteen to one last night I thought the Yankees had the edge of the odds makers last but he thought yesterday with Bartlett\nI wouldn't have been dancing in the aisles the way you were with Kevin all but I if I were here I said well who has the edge off the Yankees have you back home the crowd is going to go wild\n[laughter] you know you first have to credit Ryan Murphy 'cause he was a visionary for the project and when we met with me he put that question to me he said OJ Simpson is bigger than life and you are show me the buddy\nSaid okay to go so I got to make that transition I said Ryan I'm not here to be OJ I'm here to find the emotional trades and the character and if you look at my rules for boys ... to ... to Jerry Maguire there's an emotional through line to the corridor this passion of these people and\nI you know it ... had said that he didn't want to make it about his guilt or innocence but he wanted to make and an indictment at that time in Los Angeles a Nineteen Ninety two so we needed people to help them tell the truth that said well I Will tell the emotional truth to whatever you want me to\nDuring whatever take if you want me to play him guilty of play I mean guilty for they play an innocent I'll go into that mindset and um but I think because of that it was the tools they need to tell this story to the character\nYeah it was a very subtle and nuanced performance now I Will tell\nYou a new ... anyone who hasn't seen that series on ... where it was more of a sterling K brown who swear was darn I mean it was really it was more and and uh John Travolta\nWho is one of the producers was a terrific Robert Shapiro I thought that was a great series\nAnd don't forget about Courtney prevent people killed at a Johnny, Johnny Cochrane\nOh oh Oh absolutely the guy ... I'm\nOld enough to remember seeing court Courtney the bans bands when he was opposite James Earl Jones in the original production of ... ah hey tell oh yeah that was great with terrific tell us about a ... are you a new movie\nWell by you caviar came to me as a script that was in development\nWith an director attached and when that director fell out they offered me to direct it like I said oh you would if you allow me to do it three week pass on the street script if you like it but I Know that this is the project for me and basically it's a story of an impoverished community in New Orleans a of a group of\nGood people who get caught up in a bad deed a sex tape my character is an ex I'm a professional boxer who's ... who gets recruited why I'm I'm a mob boss ... played by Richard Dreyfuss a to get some dirt on one of his employees and so\nThat begins to hygiene Sydney collaboration with I'm a photographer played by Sam ... chance and uh her uh subjects cats or make the and then this underage girls played by live a Johnson and it's the you know the\nJust the they all go on the road to redemption ultimately but that goes to the city part of life and um\n[noise] and I think it's something great New Orleans which is a community who upset about\nIt ... ... well I'm just I'm just amazed the range here from the TV to the stage the films are they doing it all you know this that behind the scenes and they made me promise I Would ask you this but I don't listen to them I just wanted about how many times are Muslims up to do with the show me the money that's all I Want to know\nIt area damn day\n[laughter] I I got a\nVery good hey we're envious of you because I Know a Chicago very well and you got some very attractive women that you're performing with who surround you on that stage night after night\nUh I I tell ya it there's something about this role and the reason why there's been ... Seventeen twenty different famous Billy Flynn's they\nIt tricky issue in such a way where they they endured for your presence and when you're not on stage they're talking about yeah so your presence is so\nAll the way through the musical and ah and then that that you know all I care about numbers just you know it's it's a showstopper and dumb and we're having a ball every day and the you know the um [noise] some of these characters in this play have been on this thing Seventeen Fifteen Twenty years doing the same musical and the\nAnd you feel their prestige you feel their energy feel their expertise in their roles and it's just easier to just play with him every day\nAnd age shows a week six days a week it's great\n... Gooding junior through an absolute pleasure having you on the broadcast this morning thanks Cuba\nOh thanks guys thanks for having me get to talk to you and\nGo see him in Chicago will be there through November the teams playing the legendary belief when I was a lot of fun\nYeah at the ambassador theater and he's right you know ... every\nDamn day why passes like me say this is my first time I saw that she and I said why abuse you you know the loan or you didn't know how you did oh my God and he looked at me like you to know when I was talking about I think it was just the way back when you ran into\nThat two hundred and ten thousand by the way it doesn't include an outstanding forty five thousand dollar loan from his running mate\nJulie Chilean that eventually has to be repaid so I mean we had him on the show and I said it seems like an impressive intelligent guy to me but uh it's tough to tough it was still ... break your bones machine\nNow what is going to happen in New Jersey Joe with them and then does fascinating Bob Menendez of course was found not guilty and his trials of corruption but he's up against Bob ... a ... they're saying he should be a little bit worried here because the latest polling shows ... and every five Hispanic voters hasn't\nDecided yet and and Hispanic voters should be a slam dunk you should be getting eighty Ninety percent of the\nEnd is could lose although he's making the race now that he voted against Kavanaugh and that uh you know he will blocks further Trump Supreme Court appointments so that's that's just that's that's the way he thinks he can win yeah\nYeah but I don't think anyone really saw this race tightening up as it has ... gonna sail right to reelection he's pretty tainted in terms of what he was accused of and not good stuff no no no be fun to see the Republicans snap up another seat I can tell you what fun for ... for ... for me that's what I mean yeah\nAll right we're making the rounds in the morning talk shows when we come back the lawyer for the dead low ... deadly limo company is speaking out we're going to have that for you\nThis is a really wanting to today's Len Burman and Michael read all in the morning catch them live tomorrow from six built in on seven ten W O law\nThis is a really wanting to today's Len Burman and Michael read all in the morning catch them lives tomorrow from six built in on seven ten wor\nEverybody we are awaiting the arrival of Dr ... swinging by the studios you give us a lesson in CPR which\nIs a very important skill set to have I Do not know how to administer CPR too you\nKnow I really don't know either so I'm looking forward to learning I don't even know how to the Heimlich maneuver apparently you don't have to do mouth to mouth resuscitation anymore near ...
