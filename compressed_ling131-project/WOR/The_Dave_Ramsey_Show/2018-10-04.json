tell you something all those feminist theories out there they think they're going to topple this man well the what they haven't banked on is that men are beginning to think wow what culture are we

doesn't\nBother you limit this guy's career I mean ...\nThat's not bad anyway it's hurting the subject the subject is what he did serve her which is despicable so you turn it and say well what do they

Lincoln yes we will see it\nThe ... parents are not gonna be happy at all there is not federal enough yeah exactly our time\nWorked out for a fact not talking about her All right through the big three\nWe go all day without\nPaying for a Trump rally he is taking the gloves off on professor Ford\nThat he our time says oh a bombshell bombshell story about oh boy can you believe that Trump's data he put some money aside for his kid oh my gosh\nMight win a follow the IRS even though the times itself says the IRS did not pursue the matter Lou and rounding out the big three what a night for whether well lead was trying to read that Fifteen\nWere peace in the New York times freezer filing NATO's were practically a log island like nobody nobody I got to finish this story [laughter]\nBy the way some half truth is that my wife and have dinner I said that I [laughter] I wouldn't say I read every word\nBecause it printed it out it was thirty seven thirty seven I printed it out so I Will say whatever I did give it as a highlight certain sex which happy happy to read about the ways\nThe only thing you need to focus about this story is and this is what the New York times itself says the IRS did not aggressively pursue these tax strategy that Trump's father is set up to uh put some money aside for his kids that's that's where the New York times says\nAnd then they go on and on and on and they could well couldn't couldn't be illegal could be wrong and of course you've got that New York state tax department are going to look into it oh yeah it's only it's what Seventy two years ago that they're going to look into it this is ridiculous and Yoda shows it shows that desperation on the part of the media\nThat is trying to take this man down because I think they're getting the sense that that blue wave is beginning to crest and polls now show these races are much tighter than we thought\nWatch out in the beginning\nThat he could shoot someone on the guy just probably defense land stand your ground [laughter] last ... there were two aspects of the time\nSaying alright there's so little tiny aspects number one\nI started off in Brooklyn my father gave me a small amount of a million dollars I came into Manhattan and I had to pay him back and I had to pay him back with interest that\nWhole premise that he was given a million dollars by his dad and you pay them back as a total lie\nHis dad according to the story in today's dollars\nGave him roughly a four hundred and thirty million dollars bailed them out on many many occasions including the time\nHe went down to his casino in Atlantic City and just through three and a half million dollars on the table took the chips never use them and walked out so that was an illegal three and a half million dollar loan it was fraud there's no question there was tax fraud now if you\nThink that's OK and his whole life was built on this one million dollar lie and tax fraud is okay because quote all the rich people do it then fine I assume that's going to be your point of view simple and his entire life was built on a ...\nQuestion for you and if this is as much fraud as you claim how can the IRS never looked at it the ... the Irish did not aggressively pursue it which means the implication that they knew about it but they didn't do it he had phony\nAssesses undervaluing properties and listen if you tell the IRS okay this is worth twenty seven billion isn't going to go out and check it\nOut on ... the IRS is the biggest hound out\nNow than I Am so the point that the IRS really does not go after these undervalued things and these these ... money is handed down they they kind of take a look at it a wink and that's the bad rap as well as true\nAll right when we come back to something big is going down to Eighteen this afternoon you got to be prepared and we will tell you why\nWhy is you're spending your evening with our ... morning show catch just for a brand new one burning and Michael ...\nYou want to see the breed getting kicked up that means that that it's actually touching the ground and that's when it's officially a tornado funnel is just not a funnel cloud when it reaches the ground touches the ground or the water which then it's called the order spouse that we are going to continue to that's when we see it confirmed officially as a tornado so we'll go out to do the ...\nThe good news is

rent here we are to tomorrow's rain looks like beautiful weather with the warming trend sixties on Saturday seventies on Sunday or tomorrow actually reach eighty degree and what's good for the Yankees\nAnd eighties ... that's right the game tonight yeah All right thanks had re cigarettes you had to go check on that tornado forest get back to hold onto your hat you know\nYou go or you know

around trees ... or ... that was a tornado was it a straight line wind or would that have twist on water spout [noise]\nThis is a rewind to today's Len Burman and Michael read all in the morning shift in lives tomorrow from six built in on seven ten wor\nToday's Len Burman and Michael legal in the morning catch them live tomorrow from six till ten on seven ten W are a\nVery good Wednesday morning everybody now this is a this is a really nasty stories and so a fourteen year old kid is in Paterson New Jersey the doorbell rings he answers the front door there's a knock actually he answered the knock at the front door he finds himself staring\nDown the barrel of a gun it turns out to be a painful gun and is a awful idiot is guy shoots the kid with a paint ball and leaves the kid with severe wealth and he had to go to the hospital\nBut why well we don't know why it's not clear it's not clear what happened and we don't know who it is yet they're looking for this person and a mate but why and knock on somebody's door put a papal gun in their face especially a fourteen year old kid will anybody but a teenager and you shoot the kid with the painful right up close it's crazy that papal\nGame as you know we they play that out in the woods and I guess the ... now white place I've never I've never I can see you playing paintball on sale but do they also do it in a don't paint poll facilities yeah yeah they do\nThey have inside and outside and I my daughter went to camp you know trip for ... camp now she was at the white cat and camp ... band camp see why and they hated the hated every minute of it I mean they could put on these how did oh yeah yeah yeah that's it I mean these ... we're talking wealth\nHe's were golf balls sides circled all\nOver him read and they were turning purple\nYeah it was to be this kid got it right up close and I don't think you're ... you're not supposed to do it up close ... across the firing range and I don't understand why you would let your kids play paintball anyway it sounds like a\nViolin awful kind of a game to me that she wasn't into it she had to go on the traps Kaesong around they they put a painful gun to her head and made her place people I don't really think she probably even went out there\nWell this kid has deep bruises all over his body's traumatized doesn't want to go to school here mom we know the youngsters name a mom is ... is\nIs actually nervous challenged by some panic attack\nWell I think the guy just comes up and start shooting obviously has some kind of an issue at school or somewhere gangs or with thank God it wasn't a real gun yeah painful thing yeah but they haven't found as a idiot who did this you know here's a here's mom again\nSo we never been in this way no\nI wouldn't think so [laughter] knock on the door and you get a papal writing your forehead how about a situation\nLike this I mean it happened in broad daylight does in Queens\nMom is a thirty five year old mom is walking with her four year old along eighty fourth street in ozone park near Atlantic Avenue and the homeless guy just comes up punches are in the face and head and chess than back until she's on cautious\nAnd then the guy runs off I don't believe all the resemblance out trying to\nHave the kind of happened to me well how can I turned to\nYeah well this is from uh ABC those uh eyewitnesses and then here's some reaction from a channel for\nMe to say he's not wanted back there and he was asking for help and obviously knows and I hope I'm just trying to get away with always nervous declines the to another route to CBS has roof and he just went out of the video and I don't know where you want to\nLet it would happen but he he climbed the roof of a CVS after he got away and then he climbed down this happened Monday afternoon police got um yesterday it turns out he's a homeless guy his name is Derek sheer ...\nElicits home addresses the Kingsborough storm and shelter in Brooklyn he was arrested Tuesday because uh uh a police officer recognized his wanted photo that was put out by cops I Wonder how the cops or was there surveillance video of his beating\nBut oh yeah you well you don't see the beating but it looked like she was back at her home or somebody saw him when he was trying to get in here is throwing things at the door and went after a second time it just seems like to me and I know the national ... attack\nHappened in an alley way and she was walking and then she had gone home the neighbors saw him in the yard they're trying to attack them with a broom handles Chris throwing chairs at each other when you see him climb the roof to get away\nWith that like a rabbit and all that smell CBS but anyway so they obviously got a picture of the guy they put it out for police and boys cops are great they recognize the guy from this photo that were circulating among the police and they got 'em is\nThough which is great because a lot of these communities have the community policing and the officers know who the homeless people are in the neighborhood they probably already you know had in ... in their head it was like okay this guy is always around when they saw his face they knew he was\n... yeah well they got him in a terrible I could imagine this four year old kid traumatized by the way it was quite a violent\nDay yesterday with the paint ball and this poor woman being beaten up and how about this one there was a Brooklyn fender bender uh this guy delivery guy he'd crashes into a car\nAnd then we'll see um W and BMW yes are you and then two thugs come up to him and said they're going to kidnap him why yes\nThey these guys come up to them after he's bumped into the b._m._w. and they said I gotta strap we don't play they forced the delivery man to call his boss and ask for seven hundred dollars in rent some cash supposedly to pay for the dented car he called but fortunately his employer called the police\nThe police came and they uh foiled this bizarre sort of impromptu kidnapping plot I guess these guys just cooked up a kidnapping plot right on the spot after the car was it well they got both of them\nThey got both of these guys yeah what are these clowns name some coming through the story you're in the post but they got these two guys\nI'm Francisco humanism rumble handle Haley yeah Eli yup Alex Haley yup yeah these guys uh let's see the criminals arrived at the bank with the delivery guy into [laughter] I guess when they couldn't get through the boss he must have started they marched them off to the bank\nRight to to to get out the money to pay out of the better better but is that they were waiting you know it always reminds me I've always heard that is crazy\nYou know they used to tell me that if you ever get hit behind don't get out of the ... which is called the police or at least because you don't know did they do it intentionally right\nThen could it could well have been you right now yeah they made any of the guys\nThat are ... are these the guys that that caused the accident\nIt appears to be on details are still a sketchy my wife had that she had a bumping running they stole their car oh really she got out to look like many many years ago yeah we're near where we live while and he's a as they they ... back in the back of her car she gets out to look they jump in the car gone and they're gone and
