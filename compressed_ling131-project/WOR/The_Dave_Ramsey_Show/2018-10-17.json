{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "Try as hard as it all that but still that's coming up for the giants I think the next four I'm not sure I looked at it as I look at so many things but like I said there's there's going to be some chance she'll lose things start rolling and said calling Barkley I have no doubt before the years up\nA city that two games of at least a hundred and Seventy five plus shards of brushing maybe that won't happen because there are those times in swing passes and he's going to pick up thirty or forty so you know he he's probably\nI'm what I've seen he's better I thought he was really really good and I thought he was worthy of being the second ... picking the draft buddies\nProbably better they even have thought he's better than that second pick he's he's been phenomenal what he has a chance\nWould you have made the same joy smell over the quarterback to take Barclay\nLook when you make the deal and used to decide that you're going to go with Eli Manning that there's no question\nWho you're going to take in the draft you take say Kwan Barclay\nBecause you're looked into when right now they tried to change the office of blind that has a work but they brought in some veteran defensive players are and and you bring in St Paul I'm Barkley you've got Ingram you know all del shepherd\nSo you're thinking okay we can piece this thing together and give it one more good run and um you know unfortunately and has worked in ... and you know I get a little sensitive about it because\nI have to talk about it and I think I've been very very fair\nAbout the giants but like I said a couple of people said things to me then I went you know what I mean come on or what are you kidding me I just it it's been rough in it\nWhen the owners that these embarrassed that people are saying that you can't criticize it a little bit\nYeah and uh yeah I Know I just go there one in five they win yeah was it three and Thirteen last year\nIt was a good enough to be number two overall back\nWell that's right so I'm just saying I just go as there's a lot there but what we will see it it's still it's one in five\nI look I don't think they're going to win the Superbowl [laughter]\nKnow there's ten games that go ten games in the NFL is three lifetimes and ... and ... I'm not exaggerating you look at an NFL season it it turns about three or four times so we think we know who's going to be in the playoffs all this stuff that those X. games and I'm just telling me that we all know\nPhil Simms legendary giants quarterback with is right now CBS Sports show times inside the NFL as far as this murky quarterback class goes who has impressed you the most\n[noise] well I said it was though not not even close to its Baker Mayfield clear cut winner but seemed Arnold the last two weeks has played really well and his his arm even looks\nBetter to me now than it did early in a year ago that you let it go and roll with tremendous confidence\nKnow he's built to be and to withstand the punishment and he can move so there's nothing but good stuff to say about him and Baker Mayfield was really rolling and all that then he ran into the ... uh well almost said at the Los Angeles charges last week who really put on a clinic and\nI don't blame Baker at all because I'm telling you the chargers they did everything on the ... say had for safety's into corners they did it and it was like I was like oh my God I ... I couldn't\nFigure it out watching it on to tell you I could tell Baker may feel was confused wasn't so sure what he was doing and when you would you like that you don't throw it as well you don't make as good as decisions and it it was by far his worst of his works out in the year\n... Baker though um you know in the head and shoulders meant along those lines when you compare him to Darnell than the rest of this class\n[noise] well you know I think you look at him and Arnold you say right now for governor size two games you kind of put them in the same category what I like about um both is they have great beat the pocket the NFL is about\nThat's what it's about it's about all the players they're ... they're open we can hit it but when it's not there can you just move a little by time make us special throw something that sets you up or from other ... just like last night if you watch Monday Night ... CJ back third hey\nThe game plan plays or working guys are wide\nOpen wide open but then it came to a part of the game you know about mid third quarter okay now we got to go back to our core set of plays and now it's about making plays\nAnd then the forty niners couldn't do it so that where if you're good quarterback or not I'm not saying see against CJ ... but yeah you know you give that same situation to the top Fifteen in the league we're going to make some plays either moving great throw or do something the kind of changed the rhythm of the game\nAmazing watching Rogers last night on one leg just flinging around and it's like there is no doubt he's going to walking down the field\nWell you know listen I I really I said this the boomers size that they've tapered Showtime message oh bummer I really believe he likes short off balance more\nThan he does that what he sets up and really kind of gets everything into it because when he solved balance he has on believable touch with the football and those two throws down the left side\nI'm at the end of the game but those were phenomenal minutes out and he\nWas actually falling back on one foot Mica fade away jumpers yeah and it\nBut it was the philosophy yeah fade away jumper great example\nThe velocity of the football the absolute perfect spiral and the perfect spot where you couldn't miss it and and um but I didn't sit there and go oh my God I Can't believe this because I'm like you I'm a fan\nAnd I'm going well Rogers all the penalty and Richard Sherman they're going to lose [laughter] you know the forty niners\n... he's gonna make it happen and it's I think I heard it today or read it he's told Islam and in the ... most are gonna rush for I'm a move around them and make something happen so give me [laughter] and just you know that's on all I can say is that's a different game that I remember\n[laughter] no doubt that ... and the guy's got a huge price on his left leg and he still or make it plays with oh\nYeah he's still you know you see that's a great example\nHim there's Tom Brady is going to be forty water is he I don't know it doesn't matter\nBut do you watch his feet when he plays\nIn it that's what I always talk about and you know after all with a lot of quarterbacks peak during the summer at every level pros college high school grade school but I'm always talking about you've gotta have that pop into your feet to balance the move just to shuffle from\nYou know behind the center to get behind the guard real quick keep body type and then make the throw that is what the game is\nTo get out of pocket like pets are more homes\nWho I said it's not like super fast but to be able to be on the run and make throws him you that's what the league has turned into and we're going to see more and more quarterbacks like that that's why I like Baker Mayfield and Sam Donald more than I did\nJosh Rosen who's more of the very traditional get it in a pot it gives them a little time he'll make the throw\nIn last thing he is moving around a little more with the cardinals probably to save his life then he did at UCLA when he was staying in the pocket in wait wait wait for the thing that happened but he was such a great thrower he got away with that\nSo they bring in full circle and and quickly here with Eli or maybe not so much even to him now but when he was coming out the kind of quarterback the he's been throughout his career and we reached a point where that kind of quarterback for the straight up pockets statue quarterback just is going to have a hard time surviving in today's NFL\nWell you know it's not even that I I don't even see like any of those guys coming out that I look at I I watched to try to kinda see who's coming out and everybody I've looked at alike and all that is one thing in common that you really control it you know they've got all the other things and they can move\nAnd it just it it's ... there's too much going on and off\nAnd send there's too many places to be had by having a quarterback cricket moved just a little and again you don't have to pass a we we've seen that Baker Mayfield ran off for a five to forty\n... Iran faster than at ... or you know uh so that does it it just it's about grape put work yeah being having that bounce just to get out of trouble do\nThose things but there's no question oh you you you don't see those pure dropped back pastors anyway in college very much very few teams and the whole country have won so\nWhat are you got to choose from when they come to the NFL you're going to find a guy that could move mhm who's got you'd love to have decent size but of course she wanted to be a great parents are also\nDo sense great stop and uh I Know you're busy mad as you're busy season they enjoy the rest of your Tuesday nights in debt thanks so much\nBut you know what you talked me into it and we'll watch a little baseball\nMan I Want to take a break for football but listen great talking to you thanks for having me on\nThe great Phil sands CBS Sports Showtime inside the NFL and of course two time Super Bowl champion with the New York giants that'll do it for the show tonight now tomorrow night it'll be short show for a ... will have an ... game five between the Dodgers in the brewers pre game coming at ya\nAt seven thirty ... six o five until seven thirty when we talk about all that tomorrow as well as opening night for the New York next\nAnd during the rest of your Tuesday night I'm Pete McCarthy thanks again for joining land and Michael rewind comes your way after the news\n[laughter] view rated number one seven ten W O R do voice of New York and high\nWhen we have fifty three degrees at nine o'clock that evening I'm see guys men and Wilbur driver is facing federal charges and kidnapping and wire fraud after he allegedly kidnapped sexually assaulted in terrorized a woman before dumping her on an interstate\nHe died of a heart attack when we do know was what was the interrogation that went wrong they don't need 'em upside that we don't know\nAbout you know why there is absolutely nothing to be done about it we are not going to alienate the Saudis no way and there's no administration that would do it\nTrump all the pomp pale will meet with them come out with their excuse will say you were very bad that was a terrible thing to do and then it will be business as usual because that's the way the world Wilkes Trump says he's going to take action so tell me what action the whole might maybe a minor sanction a slap on the ref you rest you're not going to alienate\nSo you don't have a level of protest a couple of they'll find a couple of Saudi guys say it thrown under the ... you know right now is that prince who was guilty as sin so maybe maybe the dead the king didn't know but you know that\nPrince was definitely involve has his fingers all over this and he'll give up those lesser lights and say hey listen I wouldn't ... we're gonna we're gonna execute him aware hope I don't want to be part of that are Fifteen member a rogue squad arrows those guys are not long for this Merrill no matter what\nAnd that's it's just going to be business as usual because we need the oil and we need Saudi Arabia is our ally in the middle east and they're bad actors but that's what you live with in\n... been going on for years I mean this is not the first administration I mean this has been out of ministry ... up to these guys Bush's really loved overlooked all the abuses and all that Obama's ... everyone oh I'm not saying one part of the other they said All right so the Saudis for years\nCivil rights are overrated keep them in the west stop you can actually you can't have other countries behave the way we do All right we tried to export democracy and freedom and look where what we wound up with an unending war in Iraq doesn't work keep our values to ourselves in the ... and let everybody else live the way they want to live isolationism\nHuh well what you want to you want to throw out or a hundred billion dollar contract you want to throw out you want to put people on the unemployment line because this guy has got hired him with the president I mean I'm not sure that's what you do all the\nWay she wants to see what Congress does because I have a funny feeling\nThat the the the uh the legislators going to overrule whatever ... come up with something that Trump doesn't come up with as much as they did with the Russians there it was Congress the put the sanctions on the Russians and and you know from how to put his tail between his legs and say okay that may be the same thing here I don't I don't think Congress is going to sit idly by and large family you know they don't get away with it\nGot up and they'll make speeches denouncing Saudi Arabia and they'll pass mild sanctions because they need to recognize we can't function in the middle level sent out an alliance with oh ... okay not going to happen nothing is going to happen except those Fifteen hit squad guys they're going to be sought up they're going to be ... I think you're right\nI I think of the you know what is it called themself NBS the uh MS MS MS and B. S. and M. S. N. E. Thirteen\nOh boy he's interesting though because some people I saw this in the Washington Post they think that the king of Saudi Arabia who's given a lot of power to the sprints they should knock the prints out and find someone else because this prince has gone after a lot of people in his family\nAnd he started this war in Yemen but he has like winning Dr ... he's the guy\nHe's very clever that he's cozy up to the west is let the women drive he's let movies come in there there was very clever along those lines but the same time let's see\nIf this isn't the ... that went wrong they were going to bring this guy and kidnapping and bring it back to Saudi Arabia is a journalist right now that's not just peaches and cream right there that's not what you're supposed to be doing with journalist so right off the bat they were doing something that was totally a borrow so what are you supposed to do a journalist and\nGive them an interview well I think they should could that you and bring you back after ... ... that's what I probably thrive and another by urban like that actually really I Know where the powers I chose you have to power a very very well [laughter]\nFaking you want to go see a Broadway play but actually I think I got out of that oil money and everything is why do I hated it but I've got a house seat story that everything has\nGot to be fine so what do you think the uh what do you get the Proud Boys Lynn you think here's a question for you do you think that they should be allowed to speak anywhere or what they say is so hateful they should be prevented from speech Cuomo seems to know them though he's all upset that the Republican club even invited them to speak\nI think and and I it cuts both ways I thought it was absolutely wrong when Berkeley wouldn't allow and culture to speak I mean that's just ridiculous I mean I think people in free speech is fine we're crosses the line is if you advocate violence though I didn't hear the Proud Boys what they're going to speak about and what they're going to say\nAdvocating violence is not protected by by the first amendment you know it's a\nFree speech but not if you advocate a vial you can't yell fire in the you know not being accurate violence you just can't you just can't get up there and say oh we're going to chop off the heads of all the people on the left that's not protected by the first amendment so I think you have to be careful what they say but in general the answer to your question is they should be allowed to speak wherever they want us to be\nYou know I I Am still concerned about this because now you can be getting to this territory where he defined well what does it mean and you can call for if somebody calls for a revolution\nThat is technically advocating violence nonetheless says we need a revolution we have to overthrow the capitalist we have to over ... yes social is that hate speech land I think should they be silenced I don't feel well say you're a sensor you believe in censorship\nI don't believe in advocating violence on either so you're going to start looking at I yesterday I made a little a little funding I said you know there were bad people on both sides\nAnd ... said yeah do you do like Trump\n... done I wasn't choked Trump said there were good people out there are no good knots these ladies and gentlemen so and somebody says there's good people on both sides that's nonsense\nI was making a little twist to that by saying they're bad people on both sides and here there were I mean it was the ... guys who had what masks on and get started to Robert so they started to it appears from that video so they started in the Proud Boys finished it but they're looking for nine Proud Boys to arrest\nAll right well we can Baquet there were no shots fired at all over the weekend that's a first in a long time but I think it's because everybody's not fight with their fists yeah sure\nThis is a really wanting to today's Len Burman and Michael legal in the morning catch them live tomorrow from six till ten on seven ten W O R\nThe commercial airline industry is booming\nWith this level of demand the industry needs more aircraft technician we are the aviation Institute and maintenance and we trained tomorrow's technician for bureau of Labor Statistics report the average aircraft technician in the DC area makes over sixty six thousand dollars a year\nWhen he suggested she had lied about being threatened to keep quiet about their alleged relations county judge genes are Tara in Los Angeles ruled that Trump's speech was protected by the first amendment and it was kind of\nRhetorical hyperbole I pretty much what Trump Trump Trump does it go in ...

Trump's attorney Charles hater\nHard harder here's what he said he said quote no amount of spin or commentary by Stormy Daniels or a lawyer Michael every body can truthfully characterize today's ruling in any other way than a total victory for President Trump and total defeat for Stormy Daniels\nYou know I think ... is fading from the scene because I Believe he made a very big miscalculation\nWhen he came out with that woman sweating at Ku claimed that Kavanaugh I'm involved in gang rapes of which there was absolutely no evidence whatsoever and the number of Democrats\nThink that ... hurt the cause by airing allegations that were so completely outlandish as to gin up as to galvanize support for cabin on the part of the Republican so I think your ... has missed plane is cards lend you mean he's not going to be president\n[laughter] running that seems what he's sweaty I mean he's not going to run now or he may run but he's not going to get a nickel will be his running mate sweat no stormy will be as running that I don't know so ... now but as part of this ruling was I found fascinating\nIs that the stormy has to pay legal bills I think that's kind of an interesting twist the it's\nAbsolutely true yeah no she went after him and I got off on the grounds of a rhetorical hyperbole which is a very good description of his speech patterns\nRight hey I have a new dating out for you do you like dating apps are no I'd never use you ever been on one no of course not with your girlfriend approve your big of what I Would know that [laughter] well there's a ... half of its out at a Emily Marino put this together she's a former GOP aid\nAnd she found that it was getting very difficult uh to date anyone who didn't like President Trump her quote\nIs for many young Trump supporters liberal intolerance has made meeting and dating nearly impossible\nThat's probably true if you still support for the president has become a deal breaker instead of an ice breaker so she created a new app\nAnd you can and if you're a Trump lover you go on there and you only find other it's called Donald dangerous I\nWonder if Stormy Daniels on there well it's just a I downloaded it but I didn't want to fill out the whole thing because then you have to give a profile and they want to\nI didn't want to add up to date other people that theory level of Trump supporters [laughter] but the the whole idea of Donald ... is an online dating app aid Donald day there's got to come up with a better name than that I think that's cute Donald de Donald day there was a as opposed to you that Donald hater\nI that's that's just not fair [laughter] I don't dangers is an odd like can I read this okay go ahead is an odd lied data ... that brings together like minded singles who share believes the President Trump and on the up and I and I just download it says meet the rice how capital\nPriced meet the right match for you literally that's cute anybody goes on these apps\nRight well I mean it's going to be popular in places like Washington New York and San Francisco because let's face it are going to have a hard time finding Trump supporters in ... like that if you're a Chrysler listen it's getting interesting you know my girlfriend is by no means a Trump supporter and a\nAnd you are so we we must be fascinating yeah we don't discuss politics or in the house anymore we just don't because they don't know it becomes to include it and ugly and I got to tell you there I was walking through a minefield\nDuring the Kavanaugh nomination 'cause I supported cabin all but\nI'm One said that in a sort of blew up in my face there so we just agreed to not discuss political thing\nJust entirely is it impossible it is it absolutely impossible for a a a Trump supporter and now today the Trump eight or vice versa is that really a deal breaker\nOn that day or could well be I Would think I mean I as I say my girlfriend and myself we just we simply just don't discuss politics anymore we can't do it what do you talk about um oh this is this'll be good subject [laughter] well we talk a lot about me a\nShort and like my career and talk about a lot about about a lot of money that's why I talked to a lot about he lives in ... that's a sad all of Brooklyn are you going on the on the Trump dating app or what\nI'm not going to gain yet are happily married but in my mind is nothing better than being at ...

O. L. dot com slash when Michael\nWe've been discussing nature for six months now and nothing has happened nothing has gotten cleaned up nothing has gotten fixed and now they got rats all over the place I feel sorry for these we just talk about\nProblems we don't fix Joe you've been at this a lot longer than us this is this is nothing that this has been going on forever ...\nExactly you know why people living those major buildings really don't have any influence so they don't vote they well they may vote but you know probably nobody cares yeah\nEven the politicians ... on the left wing politicians like the ... who claim that they're for the poor downtrodden people don't look to finger to help these people\nIs probably pretty simple to deal with rats you spend it in the exterminator right I think yeah\nWhen was the hay on the bright side of things guys and\nMost beautiful morning we've got rascals tickets coming up at eight thirty this morning there was a concert on the twenty sixth of the town hall we got your free tickets so at eight thirty boy we announced this yesterday mhm the phones when while we're doing it every every day this week every day this week at eight thirty\nAlright so uh we'll be joined momentarily by Alex custody on those are the ABC News political analyst lots to discuss as you know I Want to ask them about possible sanctions but I'm a Pocahontas [laughter] I thought so Steven called bear had a pretty good line you know she took this DNA tests now that she's\nOne thousand per se we're all one thousands of Native American we probably got called bear had a good line you heard of them right\nThis test accurately reveals they high confidence that Elizabeth Warren is running for president [laughter]\nNot a bad light right you know what I think Trump should paid a million to the charity I think you should make good\nOn ... really is you can't claim she's Native American\nWhich is one thing you cannot put it down on an application you get and she was listed as Native American and Harvard went ... from what I understand she also contributed to Native American cookbook well there you go into ... recipe yeah\nAll right let's see what Alex ... joins us every week the NBC News political enlist All right Alex you you decide your the final vote as she native America what\nWell I think clearly she is in Trump should make that contribution but it should be to the Washington Redskins\nNow [laughter] what any organization the deep south it's an NFL the path a plate hey\nObviously we're talking about you know in the last segment\nBecause I wanted to get your estimation on this up clearly the this a journalist was murdered in that consulate the Saudis will leave it admit to such everyone seems to agree there should be some kind of sanctions\nThe president says it shouldn't have to do with arms sales he doesn't want to hurt American business well what what those sanctions look like if they were not arms sales\n[noise] well this is what are those are times where Donald Trump's a string of uh is is not a straight pitch a weakness is\nBluster with which we expect Trump to deal with situations is not what's needed here this is something that is handled behind the scenes to these people have a tremendous amount of leverage on the global economy as well as our allies in the fight against terrorism\nAnd so for right now Trump to squeeze them publicly which is what the demand is is a is not going to be productive over all the U.S interest elapsed the battle Trump is fighting\nI'm ... but again diplomatic grace has never in history there's subtlety so let's see what the ... of the world can pull off here\nBut what can you specifically do besides just cut back I was ... any idea what a lot of sanction would look like other than cutting back arms sales\nArms sales is really what they need the most we can't really threatening them economically\nUh in any other way I mean that there are now the second largest oil producer in the world we're the first we can continue to expand the American the Aleutian energy a restrictions that keep American energy off the\nThe whole market but there's really not a lot of liberal each other than arms sales which is the one thing we don't want to do\nAnd Alex you think in the political arena the left is going to be able to capitalize on this troubled with Saudi Arabia now or is it just something that the American people are going to sort of shrug off\nI think the American people shrug off this kind of stuff and I think they do understand that a little bit of a ... year do you uh you know the the leader of Saudi Arabia say hey we didn't know our hands are clean somebody else a rogue regime\nUh but I don't think it's going to have much impact on the politics here what used to having a big impact on the politics here turns out to be the cabinet nominations\nThat has changed the world which seems to be the first time that American saw Republicans actually grow up there and stand up against Democrats like back in Washington\nAnd just stand up against the swamp which they were a part of and Republican sure no energized and I think we have a jump ball in the control of the house of representatives\nAs you look at these races for the house are they tightening up across the country\nI haven't talked to a Republican pollster in the past two weeks who hasn't told me that\nThis week surveys are better for Republican little last week's wow and and so it is tightening up everywhere with a B C survey still has the largest gender gap in history twenty to pull each wheel and voting more democratic than men\nAnd a huge advantage for Democrats except\nThe Democratic advantage is concentrated in the cities ... they're winning an urban areas by more than they were winning but in the suburbs if you ask people\nDo you want to vote Democrat or Republican the actual forty six to forty seven race in the ... house districts that are rated is ... ... that's a jump ball Democrats may not take the house I think they're still favored while this is a huge change\nOut of your emotional political implications of the Kavanaugh story and how it's galvanized Republicans are the Democrats will say it's galvanized galvanize them especially among women so who really has the advantage there\nWell it's galvanized boom boom women but it seems to be helping them the most where they were already winning it's just hoping that by running up the score actually looking at those tossup races\nHere it's Republicans who lack the energy who now are energized the Democrats were already on fire show it this was a pretty stunning development that is I think under reportage Republicans are catching up\nInteresting but Alex help out a women in these suburbs of it I you know they've got they've got sons they've got husbands they've got brothers I get to say that you know I'm not a pollster here but I get a sense and talking to you know moderate women that they don't like\nA country where an allegation can be hurled at you and destroy you\nWill were seen both I think that's right for for a lot of women in urban areas like Andrew dice clay is running for\nPresident [laughter] or\nFire to come on folks but in another America what America saw like people that Washington is America saw Washington at its worst destroying to good people Kavanaugh and Ford and they want to stop that Washington and Trump in a Republican I'm sure there are only vehicle to do that show\nThe big huge there still are to Americans just like Donald Trump was ... when he was elected you\nKnow Alex is always a pleasure ... political aisles and Washington and talk to you next week Alex thanks Alex well that will be fascinating bad news for your team lined up and hiking up there you go so you're so tribal might do but seriously if it is a jump ball in the house\nDemocrats just assume they're going to take it if they don't oh my

Elizabeth Warren a million bucks are going to parse it for you\nWe're glad you're spending your evening with our replay of this morning show gets just for a brand new my moment of Michael ... in the morning tomorrow from six to seven Ben wor\nSecond what you might have called reinforcements Bartlett came running it here oh let me out or\nLet me add Pocahontas All right the ... who you want to go out on the air go to the cavalry the\nQuestion on the table as Elizabeth Warren have some ... ... per se alright she took her DNA test\nAnd she claims it shows that she has Native American ancestry in her blood there your God if you look closely at the test it's barely a trace and probably most of us who were born in this country\nHad a little trace of it as well as white between one sixty fourth and one hundred and twenty fourth Native American ... twenty fourth one thousand which barely qualifies for anything she certainly can't check\nOn her application Native American so should Trump pay up the million or not you know let's let's let's\nParse it here's what Trump said at\nDollars for your favorite charity\nIf you take the test your\nAnd then here's what Trump said yesterday\nA million dollars\nNow listen no way you know what I'm gonna defend them here\nHe said he didn't say that he said listen to the whatever uh that that part where he says I'll I'll offer a million dollars ... we didn't have the first part of that he said if I were to debate her this is what I Would say to her during the debate\nIf you want to parse the words he really oh it was a condition was kind of award if if I ever debate her one day this is what I Would say to her it wasn't like he actually came out and said I today and they're showing this challenge so in a in a way if you want to be fair and parts of the words she's writing and she's not then\nYou can't claim she is a Native American she can't claim\nIf it's on what the President Johnson count doesn't count you probably have that amount of Native American in your ancestry really yes okay I've I had I been through Europe but I\nI don't think that All right maybe or maybe you have that amount of a black\nEye that's OK eastern Iraq as a black person manure and I might have a little bit of Asian aren't they have all of them I Do have relatives look ... yeah the Georgian types wallow fire you as an Asian absolutely [laughter]\nThese are the same land [laughter]\nOut here I I just\nDon't believe that for it and they had I had I actually had a relative who you could look shiny I Swear to God\nHe says I'll tell you that we care about\nLeaving Len Len in the case of Warren she went around and said she was dark and she did she applied for jobs as a Native American listed in job listings as a Native American as a minority the Cherokee Nation says she's not part of us now she's a phony you know what\nI think Kobe or how to write a lot of walking that person is it cold there had to write you heard them right\nThis test accurately reveals with high confidence that Elizabeth Warren is running for president\nAll the way Israel yeah I Hope she runs 'cause boy Trump would clean her ... just the way he cleaned Hillary's\nWell lock she's at our website from from a guy named Richard mhm sent me a very funny picture it's a it's a big white duck like the ... and the captured is\nOne one thousand twenty fourth bald eagle [laughter]\nBuddy very ... very generic\nChance to become the darling of the left I read a New York New York magazine profile on ... urging her urging her to run she's the only person who has the guts and the toughness to take on Trump I could just see here in the debate with her for licking her away like that no guns 'cause she's got no sense of humor\nWell just school she's a humorless school ... and there's not a guy out there who would\nVote for well I'll tell you a a Trump was talking about the million dollars you listen to what he said\nWe're much one one thousand huh here's a country an apology\nOn our country should get the\nWhere I was going to have to do that if I can test her personally who will not be something I enjoy doing\nThat trust ... whoever did this to some Stanford\nGuy and he looks all kind of cooked\nUp yeah ... well she put out this video I guess of our conversation with the globe or whatever it is in Boston now\nLikes to call my mom a liar what does it say that we have a Native American ancestry and you're\nThere you go now come on land that's all at all these with that but you say you have a little Chinese nights I could I think I could I don't know have an egg roll I don't know I've never taken that to me like Elizabeth Warren ... thing I could do it on my application\nTo get it to Syracuse [laughter] from Asia China [laughter] but you always against these days anyway it's true that right if\nForever and ever or you know at some point the gas is gonna run out and they need a different plan so everyone wants you to think that this guy was different and therefore they chose to ignore the human rights records you write he arrested and put into the Ritz Carlton and this is a really\nFancy she she style hotel it says the woods and stuff I don't see is a prison he put them all in that basically until they signed agreements they go along with is a a control of power\nThat they would end up with some of their assets to him at the same time this guy is buying a multi million dollar your um what are spending money left right and center the ... ... ... ...\n... or so he's doing now is arresting critic was actively involved in a bombing campaign in Yemen is killing men women and children leading to mass starvation we chose to it and all those things that that is that they weren't happening now we know the truth\nAround with and panel the ABC News senior foreign correspondent symbol an E N you said that perhaps the thought is that the body or parts of the body removed from the Saudi conflict to the residents ... what do they do with it after that they stick it on the airplane that when those Fifteen guys left what happened\nYeah great question again they're looking at that as soon suggestion that sets might want to dig up with a ... I mean at some point it just becomes too much of it in ... the sound is I mean surely at some point and this is why we're hearing these rumors that repairing the statement they got to make them announced ones\nIs that that they gonna have to come out with some plausible explanation will happen day after day it sounded a coming of criticism and that being public came barest these are the two sings above all else\nIs the new crime cranes absolutely have so we'll see what secretary of state ... comes away with after he's ... he's coming here to eat and then he's going back to Washington to brief the president I Would be surprised by the end of his trip we don't have some answers\nMm All right in panel ABC News foreign correspondent thanks a lot in ... so you guys\nTake now you know I think what's gonna happen I think are they going to find some scapegoats\nI think the crown prince is going to say all those guys those Fifteen guys went over there they were kind of on a rogue mission chop off their heads and I think of the world to say okay that's fine but he had to do we don't want the economy wrecked by Saudi Arabia and its control of our oil let's go back to doing\nBusiness as usual now I think you're probably right I I lean towards ah your opinion that this uh this prince is going to find the scapegoats and and scapegoat them a big way but\nUm I just want to know this so called interrogation that went wrong with me what it takes ironic to sort of cut out for what exactly went wrong and his interrogation were Fifteen guys against one I mean come on really I mean the bone so\nI mean that's just unbelievable what a what a horrible story not his fiance you know he went into that conflict I Know some kind of paperwork I Know some areas fiance ... she actually wrote an op ed the other day and she said yeah no no I didn't get to read the whole thing but she was talking about him and then the situation but um\nWell he was very very close to the Saudi family he you know he worked with the Saudi family before he became a journalist before he turned on them he did so and the reason that he's was perceived as a threat to them is that he really knows the inside secrets of how that regime functions\nSo this gives you the real insight to how they operate over there sure\nThis prince allow the women to drive allowed them to go to movies a lot of movies to open in general but\nThe real guy is the one who doesn't like the criticism and that's why they were they were interrogating him and they were going to bring them back basically kidnap him and bring them back to Saudi Arabia because they didn't like the criticism that tells you the true colors that has a the prints who supposedly western he's not western these cozying up to everybody but he's a he's he's not a good guy and like all the\nPrevious ah princes crown prince of Saudi Arabia he spends like a drunken sailor he bought a five hundred million dollar yacht he's buying a lot of artwork and is he in pointed out to us not has money he didn't earn that money\n... all in the back of oil but there's nothing we can do you know I think that that the real issue is the Saudis can throw a monkey wrench into the world economy\nThey just turn off the spigot that's power I thought we had our own oil not enough need more and more more fracking that's right hey we've got entertainment news when we come back now get this I find this fascinating there's a movie poster out there\nThat's worth one point five million dollars really yes even guess what it is before we come back to really interesting poster with one point five million dollars\n[noise] this is a really wanting to today's Len Burman and Michael needle in the morning catch them live tomorrow from six built in on seven ten W O R\nPlan Berman and Michael real in the morning we'll be back with a new show tomorrow from things than on seven ten W ho\nLot going on in the morning in about five minutes

Elizabeth Warren will take your calls around eight forty the president has a lot to say listen you just put out to the weights he says Pocahontas the bad version\nSometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren is getting slammed she took a bogus DNA tests and it showed that she may be one one thousand and twenty fourth far less than the average American now Cherokee Nation denies or DNA test is useless even they don't want her phoney\nAnd then she waited now that her claims of being of Indian heritage have turned out to be a scam an ally Elizabeth Warren's you to apologize\nFor perpetuating this fraud against the American public Harvard called her a person of color amazing calm and would not have taken or otherwise I'm not sure that's true anywhere you are ... you were talking about a movie poster worth how much\nOh here's a ... well you know the answer I was going to jail or here's this movie poster it's about to go on sale ... and it's expected to fetch one point five million dollars making it the most expensive\nMovie poster in history now if I had not read the story my guess would be King Kong I think with the wind from the rich well no uh I myself would be the original Nineteen King Kong okay but I'm I'm In the realm because it is a horror movie you know what it is it's the original lithograph\nOf the Nineteen thirty two Boris car last classic\nThe money really it's

that are rich or higher quality paper then what is used today and these movies horror posters are very rare because the studios didn't release them they didn't make lots of posters to give to people\nAll the way you get you know baseball cards and kind of books they were just send out when the movie was playing in the theater you put the poster up outside the theater when the movie let you take the poster down throw it away so they're very very rare you should check out the poster on our website seven ten W.

I don't think you got that about ... Tricia pie in La Grange real New York hey Patricia\nHow you doing this show I think\nIt ... I think Trump should pay if he had that qualify ... earlier I didn't realize that he said well if I was\nYeah he said to be fair but I have to be fair he said if I were to debate her this is what I Would say during the debate that's the part I really haven't played\nOkay then I had to change myself he doesn't have to pay and Kenny debate there and I hope she learned because then you can vote to Charles and you don't have the holiday\nNow well I think she would get absolutely ... I think it'd be such a ... I really do have\nOh I did the DNA test or to incorporate and ... ... samples from South America through and to other countries because there wasn't enough of the Cherokee sample in Vienna aged qualified for a death in the past\n... cook to resolve their nose or you\nKnow I heard this morning on a oh I'm shocked that went on Fox and I have a good day\n... banks say let's go to a Danin a Kendall park good morning Dan Dan\nHi guys I think that trucker offered to take the money and donate it to charity or alleged show up and leave bags for because he's already made a fool of herself with this because\nI think anyone who could trace any an structured back to this country is going to find out what I heard something like that at least one point two percent Native American somewhere\nSo she's a phoney and she's made a fool of herself with this so they should get the money to charity\nYeah he would look good he wouldn't look at doing that but I don't think he has them to give out buddy I really don't\nKnow either that or they don't\nPut the ... but I think you're right you're absolutely right it would make them look good and become off like a bench but I'm not sure he and he continued on her about relentlessly\nI think it would find that it had to make her look that\nHe would he would he would indeed [laughter] and I saw I'll tell you ah I mean that sweets\nCalling or hypocrite the uh the emails I've gotten to earn one after the other one sent me a picture you know the land the lakes butter is of course so they had her is have her as a an an Indian school was to feathers\nIs says great great grandma Warren this comes from and our listener and and the butter she's holding up says\nLand the liars [laughter] she's had one's got something to say about his feathers in her hair and feathers in her head I think well I mean but you have this ... this one but but I I I Will tell you have to be fair and all this because when Trump said that you don't hear the first part the only the second part of the quote Michael the first part was\nIf I were to debate her this is what I Would say and then he said this after if I were to debate or I'd I won't\nMillion dollars to your favorite charity\nIf you take the test your\nWell that's what he said but I think he has to be fair and as you said if I had to ... so then of course he said uh yesterday for the\nMillion dollars\nI didn't say that they didn't say it but a different context that's hey let's go to Vinnie in New Jersey ... many\nMany of the poor guy and I'm I'm In Dolly and I'd like to say thank Elizabeth Warren is probably related to somebody elite Eric is war party\n[laughter] oh really\nYeah I think so it it sounds about right mathematically\n... interesting do you think Trump should pay up\n[noise] I think he should pay five bucks\nFive bucks just pay for the test\nSugar challenge right\nNow was supposedly going to be a million dollars to her favorite charity I mean no\nThat's all I got buddy\n[laughter] not out of Iran has already ...\nGreat lady with the many with the extensive material out there and that guy that makes me I I don't I don't you think there's backfired on a on Pocahontas Marilyn I'm not itself seem odd\nThat she would make a big deal out of being one one thousand the twenty fourth and don't you\nThat that seems odd that someone make a big deal out of that how about the uh you listen to her and she made the announcement she's got that uh that soothing music in the background we got this is the interviewing the ... and she put out that this video now\nLikes to call my mom a liar what does it say that we have a Native American ancestry and your\nHas Native American ancestry\nAnd ...\nBut those are her political instincts I God I Hope she runs I think I think Kobe or how to write\nYou heard them rice test accurately reveals they high confidence that Elizabeth Warren is running for president [noise]\nPretty much sums it up so you got you guys were saying like ah during commercial you think she's like the not the best shot of any Democrat neither\nDo I do I think she leads the field I think the mainstream pay a Trump painting media they love her 'cause they think she's got the guts to take on Trump and they're going to be very supportive\nOf her hey Robert in holy Pennsylvania thanks for listening on the pay Robert what are you got\nGuys that he was a mass which other than other radio hosts too yesterday a one thousand one horse ... of one million dollars is a nine hundred dollar check so that's what ... said to have to face\nOh that's good that makes sense and\nYeah because that's what it is so you know if it was just a five hundred thousand dollars whatever those but I think you get caught fire honor and everybody that goes up against Trump's if they don't play at his level they're never going to wait\nAnd you know what Robert should make the checkout to walk him yeah Thanks Robert thank you for listening about it [laughter] yeah don't\nGo against Trump that's a fair warning from Robert so when we come back ... in pursuit of cornerstone Caroline\nWe'll see if she's cornered reminders venting
