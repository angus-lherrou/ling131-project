[noise]\nThey're proceeding was a paid programming W O laws airing of this program constitutes neither an endorsement of the products offered for the ideas expressed Shelley you are you asking you age detail in New York\nDelays the one you're statutory bar ... or in the U.S so if you want to file a pat and then the U.S you have one year from the day it's publicly disclosed so if you tell somebody about it\nThan that one year bar begins if you have a confidentiality agreement that doesn't start because the inventions not in the public domain so it's very important to get the agreement in place to make sure\nThat you protect your patent rights and also you what the other person that you're serious about this and you want to make sure that\nYour ideas going to be protected and the confidentiality is going to be taken seriously\nVery seriously and that's important is one thing I wanted to bring up you do not put your name on your clients patents now I Know from having worked with you did you have a lot of brain input into their projects\nBut you let them have the patent themselves some people we've worked with people in the past who in similar positions you who who insist on having their name on the pat and to and this could be something Richard speaks to as well if you're working with somebody an engineer who's helping you develop a prototype and they put some ideas and but it's really your ideas starting out\nWhose name really needs to go on the pat and\nThat's a great question as a matter of fact we're dealing with an issue at the firm in that line right now we have somebody who hired a software developer they didn't have a contract and the client paid the software developer to develop the software\nAnd because they paid the software developer they think that they're the only inventors and in fact\nAh anybody who contributes to the technology and the patent is an inventor and the way that gets handled is that the\nSoftware developer should assigned their rights and the pat and to our client and we're working with that right now but they have no contract no confidentiality agreement and it could be a big issue because if you don't get the inventor ship right on a pat McMahon validate\nSo getting through all of these steps in the right way is very important and it's important that you get professionals involved or in some level of professional advice\nEarly on in your project so that you can make sure that everything is in place and that everything is clear with the people that you're working with\nWell it's less about thirty days okay honestly and it's also depending on what you put in of course if you choose to use your perfume or cologne it may not last as long as a stronger oil that you can get for like a bed bath and body works or something like that is really dependent on what you put a new it's your choice to put your favorites and\nI Love this I think of this is a razor blade product meaning you could sell it over and over again so I mean the outside part probably last what about a year or so what do you think they'll say container but you can always find a new sent this it comes with the essential oils come and how many different fragrances doesn't come with\nWell it's I have two options right now working with a lavender and also I'm working with like a tropical sent ... but the beauty of this park again if you don't like that\nYou could put what you want inside and eventually I'll I'll definitely offer um certain um options for you to choose from and wants to get for the long in this process but again the beauty of this product is you can put you on it because again my inspiration was there was no option available at that time in a store that I Want it that's great\nThen I see that you have a poor spent on the back let's see this yes it comes down to ... see this is awesome\nComes with a funnel would you be selling the different elements it comes inside the ... yes okay everything it felt so when I say razor blade product I mean you can actually offer these vials individually also empty right mhm and just put whatever you want in the ...\nAnd there is a removable cap on the top of the air pressure giving you access to the spray\nSince we are talking about manufacturing today Chris than you do have a a product there it's wrapped and packaged and ready to go can you tell me a little bit about what you went through to get the product made and how you went about doing it\nI began working with my prototype manufacture he was in house complete manufacturing however once we got to the tail end\nHe lost his contact twist sourcing age and he had to start all over so I was left just hanging in a win hanging a dust for about two to three miles with no idea who to reach out to 'cause it's very scary\nI didn't know who to trust so I remembered I met Lisa before in the past I notice she does is she helps a lot of people so I reached out to her and she helped me out to get to the point was manufacturing\nI'm working with one of her great contacts and right now I'm at the very end of manufacturing and I'm just waiting for my final samples before I can actually bring us to market\nWhat were some of the steps that you went through you went back and forth with Lisa yes you had different drawings that circulated back and forth also tell us a little bit about\nThat ... has been great as far as the communication and whenever I answer Amir caller she picks up right away I Love ... thank you [laughter] not that but what I did I've been sending pictures like so I had my prototype accent or pictures I center my cats are already had that a little further along than\nUm clients per se who've come in the beginning and um she's their responses she sent it out to her manufacturing contacts sent it to China and they actually began the process of creating my molds\nAnd that's where we are right now just finalizing the product with the molds mhm yes [laughter]\nSo are the ... or I owned them all okay very important because if you decide you don't like the factory that's making your product and move them you can move them right big important part they're\nSo are

I Would say\nThe least Ninety percent of the time that's what we're doing we're cleaning off that pop up supper\nAnd were clearing the drain so light bulb went off my head and I said wow you know look this is this is amazing this is really the problem is the pop ups up the assembly it's really what's causing a lot of the blockages so let me create something let's use the same concept let's create something that would\nBasically you would have the same function you be able to use it as your pop up and show your sink and open your sink and and you'd be able to easily remove it and take it out and just clean it and from that point on you'd be able to do it yourself\nAnd you know take it out whatever you saw the water was draining slow and you'd be able to clean it and take it apart and basically drop it back into the next time and then I equate also the tub one you know because again the basket catch is a lot of hair\nAnd it was just it was just something that constantly moving it with taking it apart and we're just basically cleaning out the the drain area and that would solve the problem so I also created the stop a buddy suffering for the bath tub\nWhile I think it's ingenious and my daughter has beautiful long hair I Can't tell you how many shower drain clogs we've had to call somebody to help with that tried to get out ourselves\nUm so I she's moved now she's on her own but I'm definitely giving her best because things are [laughter]\nYou know that she put all the call a plumber now an average call could be anywhere from one fifty three hundred dollars depending ...\nAnd then you have to be there and sit around and\n... you mentioned something to that that that people buy chemicals you know I've bought chemicals to to clog drains and they've never worked I mean I just doing it wrong or\nWell yeah you know why because most of the time if you have no water flowing at that point when you're using the chemical\nThe chemicals are getting to the blockage it's basically just if you're lucky maybe it'll clear it but it it's a lot of times what happened is you'll leave that chemical in overnight and a lot of times what it does is it deteriorates the picture the the chrome ing and ...\nAnd uh you know very thin some of the thin pies below it it can eat away at it even sometimes I sing products at heart and open the drain so becomes more of a problem\nYeah remember one time probably tell you about that that's\nGoing to say yes [laughter] [laughter] that's okay hide anything on the radio [laughter] lace your wife\nWell I got out of the pie and Lincoln was luckily he had to face shield I'm thank God because that's why I came out [laughter]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Pete McCarthy", "city": "New York", "day": "29"}
