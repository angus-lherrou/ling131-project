T a Wall Street dot com that's OT a Wall Street dot com\nWe'll come back if you're just tuning in humid Larry Jacobs and director of instructor development and half instructor it online trading ketamine\nShed some light on consistency in the markets were talking about\nGenerating more money we're talking about generating more income whether the market's going up down or sideways we're talking about how much the market dropped a little bit ago you know it's been about a week or so since we had the big drop in the markets but when you look at those opportunities they are they are that they are opportunities to generate into give generate more income and essentially give yourself a raise\nAnd it really is important to remember that\nThe more that money is made on the way down just like the money has made on the way up and so really we wiped out number one we wiped out three months worth of gains on this last market drop\nIf we didn't know how to make money as the markets were falling\nIf you do know how to make money as the marks were going down if you have that skill you're able to generate as much money in a week as over the last three months combines so it ends up being these great opportunities as one of the reasons why whenever we have a market crashed there was a new wave of billionaires that come out of it yes billion with a B\nRight billion with a B come out of it and a lot of times they're looked at as a\nA a not so they looked at with not such a pleasant light we could say because when they made all that money a lot of people were losing money you know a lot of people were losing money in there and those are individuals though who look at a down market as a bad thing now these individuals that were turning themselves in from millionaires and billionaires\nThey were looking at a down market as an opportunity they had the skill set they had that knowledge\nThey knew how to approach that down market\nSo to think about a job if you had a job where you got laid off one third of the time that wouldn't be a very consistent stream of income but a lot of times with the Bush biased with only making money as the markets are going up that's kind of the situation our income in our retirement accounts or in\nIf we are reliant on just one simple direction the markets go up down or sideways and if we only make money when the market goes up well there's two thirds of the time two thirds of the direction where where especially laid off or we're not allowed to go to work and so that's one of the reasons why\nIt's very difficult to follow kind of that classic just simple bullish biased and have consistent growth you look over the last nine ten years we've had this great bullish move\nBut how much opportunity has been lost on those down opportunities how much opportunity was given back in two thousand eight when the market crashed and if we don't have that skill set going forward this could be the beginning of this next big downturn where we could give back fifty or sixty percent of our retirement account how 'bout instead of that\nInstead of going through that process again how about we understand how to make money as the market going down we start doubling up on this stuff\nNo absolutely you know it's funny because one of the things that most people don't understand they start trading on their own and they make mistakes all the time and here's why the number one mistake most people making their lives when it comes to trading if they want to try it on their own first and then maybe get some educational a bit later on well here's the problem that most people don't understand\nFive percent of the wealth right now is being shared by Ninety five percent of the population when Ninety five percent of the wealth is shared by five percent of the people\nSo that means there was five percent of us who have understood the right way to trade how to make money and what's really scary right now and I talked to a lot of students is I asked him a simple question\nDo you work for more money or just money work for you and most people are working for more money they always believe that they're going to get ahead if they're going to find their freedom and let's face it people start trading are people looking for multiple streams of income and most millionaires we discuss this right have a an average five income streams\nThey're doing so not because they're working harder they're working smarter they're figuring out how to work right and what that simply means is if there's a way to learn how to generate income without having to put more effort that's the best way to do it and most of the time\nPeople don't understand that trading us like a system what's the system it stands for save yourself stress time energy and money love it if you learn how from professionals to do things the right way there's no reason why you can't be generating income as well\nMost people either don't know how to do this or are afraid to do this and honestly they keep going out there in thinking that they're going to attain freedom by working more and more well most people I talked to my students give you an example mc ... used to work in the workplace he quit he want it to work for himself\nHe wanted more time with his family well if you can learn a skill that will allow you to make money the same way the banks do and you've shared district me many times Ryan J. P. Morgan Chase had only nine losing days in the last five years\nI don't know about you guys but I Want to be on that team that keeps making that money and the only way you're going to do that is by investing in the education learning how to do that can you see how this could help lead you to spending more time with family or just leave a job you don't like any more\nYou know so many times individuals get caught up in the rat race and you start hearing people use phrases like time is money right and that that's what you're talking about earlier as is exchanging just time and getting away ... getting paid for our time now that the thing that we always like to focus on his money is money Ryan how can we make money\nHow can we make money work for us rather than like what you were saying working for working for money and that's really what starts to to to separate\nUh the the financially independent from the financially dependent out there are those multiple streams of income and a lot of that comes from having our money work harder\nFor their retirement and well a lot of things that we hear right now is can you see or do you see how this can really help you pretty much preserve capital over the long term\nIt's always buy low so high it has been for a thousand years it will be for another thousand years that that has never changed and\nThat was one of the topics are ahead of my class last night as as the markets don't change the marsh don't change we look at it on a phone\nInstead of looking at it on a on a on a ticker tape but getting printed off right but the market still don't change it's all about by low and it's all about so high\nAnd somewhere along the lines we kinda got distracted from that and I think the average investors out they're investing their money on payday and they plan to sell when they're sixty five and none of that has anything to do with price and so if we're not buying it a low price we're not selling at a high price\nIt's pretty much impossible for us to make any money now one of the fun things about the markets whether it's your retirement account or whether it's your income and count it it's the same right it's it's all about just identifying a low price and buying and identify a high price and selling\nNow we get kind of caught up in this\nWhole emotional back and forth of maybe stocks that we love her or or or things that we want to be invested in rather than being invested in the right things and and uh there's this guy Dan that ah when it first started trading I I I did a lot of work with Dan he was a a great friend ... you know acted as a mentor and many different kinds of aspects\nAnd then used to always say you can't live your stocks they're never going to have you back and he would talk about and he had a little story to help you remember it I won't share it on there but it was just kind of funny ... you would say you can't live their stocks they're not going to have you back\nAnd think about it if you're invested into a company right now it doesn't matter what it is\nIf you called them up they wouldn't even know who you are right but for some reason we fall in love with potentially investigated this company who number one doesn't know who we are number two doesn't care about us they don't care about us at all and and honestly why would they write and Larry you're talking about you know taking care of our retirement accounts and how nobody's going to take better care of it than we are\nAnd and it's it is true and the reason that I firmly believe that is because nobody has to live off of our accounts except for us right nobody has to live off of your account except for you\nNobody has to live off of my account except for me and so in the end as kind of courses that can sound nobody cares right there's there's not an institution out there that they that they stay up at night going men I Hope I Hope John and Mary have enough money in their retirement account\nYou know what they say that because they want to make sure they have enough fees being paid to them as long as their monies in retirement account but every day there's a new twenty two year old that opens a retirement account replaces somebody who is closing their retirement and then this perpetual\nKind of ... income stream that comes from that anyway so at the same time though we stay up at night right the average person has many sleepless nights over money but how much time as the average person\nSpent getting educated on how to make sure their money is growing right I I find the financial markets very interesting because we go to a a car dealership and there's a car salesman there and we really don't take his advice on what we should buy but yet we go to a car dealership\nThat has the uh financial institutions name on the front of it where they're selling mutual funds and we take the cells persons advice to heart and we go well he's the professional in the situation\nNow with a lack of education that's kind of where we end up ah falling behind the eight ball in the financial world one of the things that we can do is we can help a few more people out with that because we still got some tickets we can give away let's do it\nRight now we've got to have their class coming up in your area that the cost of ... exactly what it takes to really take control those retirement accounts and have them growing generating more income whether the markets are going up down or sideways\nNow included with your half the class including with your past is going to be our professional insiders kit now this is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nThe professional insiders kitten makes it so you can get started right now because tender twenty when he did a call now and reserved those seats\nThe number is eight eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com\nAnd see if you can score some passes there\nNow Larry still kind of on this retirement check I Know there are a lot of people concerned about growing their retirement how can somebody number one protect against this potential downside\nBut also inside of their retirement account is there a way for them to continue growth as the markets are going down\nAbsolutely a little out of our students have figured out they can use other type of leverage assets to actually start accumulating wealth well our stock market is in a downturn so this great ways that students can protect their wealth they can hedge against it they're learning about options\nAnd that's why they can do this three hour session to understand what's possible in the marketplace I can tell you firsthand talking to our students students like myself and you too we've been waiting ten years for this correction think about that\nMost people are dreading a correction we are\nFrantically waiting for it because it could be one of the best years of our lives a lot of people don't understand that again the markets go down there was an opportunity to make money just as the markets go up so imagine learning a skill right now to preserve your capital where you can lock in profits imagine you did that back in two thousand eight\nAnd you had money sitting in cash waiting to buy those bargain basement prices\nOf stocks when they got back to two thousand nine well this is going to happen again it's been happening over and over again but most people continue to do nothing and wait for something that happened like I said again the cavalry ain't come in and the reason why so many people are poor P. O. R.\nIt's just they're passing over opportunities repeatedly so if all this did right now by spending three hours of your time is help you learn how to preserve more capital so that you can retire and the lifestyle that you're interested would not be worth it\nYou know we always look at things in the investing world is risk to reward how ... what do I have to risk and what's my potential reward\nWell your investment in this case is going to be about three hours worth of time or half day classes about three hours long so that's your investment that's your total investment is three hours worth of time so\nSo even if you were to say that's your total risk is three hours worth of time what what's the potential reward what if you ended up generating another source of income what have you ended up adding another couple of points have returned to your your portfolio every year 'cause really your risk is only time as far as you're investing three hours of your time to come out to this after class\nBut the rewards are potentially limitless that's a pretty good ratio\nAnd imagine that you learned for the first time that you've been in the wrong things in your mutual funds and your four one K. and you can learn how to reallocate to give me that rate of return that you that you really want that's what a lot of students are really excited about\nIt goes back to some of those are some of those fun quotes the way I always like to throw out in here as far as you don't have to be ... and I'm going to do this one wrong or you take it it's yours ... yeah I ... I used to always say you don't have to be great to start but you got to start to be great\nAnd unless you do all use when a Ryan's is you don't want to spend your golden years at the golden arch absolutely I Love that one\nYou know and and it's all the way over these fun cliches things that we love to throw around but they've been around forever 'cause they're true\nRight we heard him so many times 'cause they're true no\nNobody ever says well no you you don't have to get started in order to be great you know you do you have to have to be great you have to get started but you don't have to be great in order to get started right it's awesome and and I love doing uh I get involved with a lot of different races were actually doing a charity race in a in a couple of days\nAre raising money for cancer and and I always compare it to just a race you have to cross the start line before you can cross the finish line it is necessary\nRight but it is a lot of fun and trading investing you can take this really whatever level you want but imagine ... imagine if I imagine if it just made that\nSlightest impact in your life to the positive how worth it with a three hour investment be now before we can get people in the class they gotta have tickets we gotta do give away\nLet's do it All right we're right now I've got a ... class coming up in your area that the cost is really where you'll be able to see exactly what it takes to keep their retirement account growing whether the markets are going up down or sideways you know including with your passes to have to class is going to be our professional insiders kit it's packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nNow the professional insiders kitten makes it so you can get started right\nNow ... century Twenty one you just call now and reserved those seats\nThe number is eight eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up\nBeing colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com and see if you can score some passes there we've got to take a quick break we're going to be right back Larry whatever force next\nYou know let's talk about the lifestyle of a trade or a lot of people\nNow are sitting here me interested in ... and they want to make a change to make a change in our lives to talk about what the effects are\nBack the curtain and show you what that looks like right around the brake ran and Larry we'll be right back [noise]\n\nIf you can invest just about three hours to open yourself to strategies that can make you financially secure for

that's O T a Wall Street dot com [noise]\nReally what trading is is just the transfer money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing I think that's an important\nConcept to remember because it's not like the money just grows on trees and all of a sudden it shows up in our county right what happens is there's a buyer and seller and\nThere's a transaction that occurs and there's a winner and there's a loser and a lot of times we we forget about that side of the market but the markets are really just a conduit and this is one of the ways I explain it to my classes as\nThe markets are a conduit that just hooks us all together that's really all the market places it's a meet up we all go there to hang out and what do we do there well we buy and sell stocks and people who want to sell stocks show up with their stocks and people who want to buy stocks go there to buy stocks it's just like a farmer's market but at the stock market or commodities market\nBut it's just buyers and sellers and money transfers like a farmer's market when I buy tomatoes money transfers transfers from my account into somebody else's account and it's the same thing in the financial markets and a\nLot of times we don't realize that as we're losing somebody else who made the right decision is actually out there making\nYeah and they're also living their lives most of us right now which jobs are stressed out we're worried about losing our job especially with a correction comes again\nMost people are just one paycheck away from poverty\nAnd so a lot of our students are figuring this out how do I go from being emotional to becoming strategic and the way they do that is to get the proper education learning how a three hour session can completely change your life and you know Ryan you know I've talked about this over and over again\nHolidays are coming up it's that time of year again\nEveryone's going to make their resolutions yeah right well that's kind of silly because the resolution is basically your intention to do something in the two biggest ones we hear what\nI'm going to lose weight this year ... out of ... you know out of out of debt and made our money but the difference here right now is don't just make it a resolution make it a promise to yourself that you're going to figure out a way to get more financially secure\nYeah I remember my grandpa used to say this and I remember hearing it somewhere else too but I'm going to give him credit for it but it used to always say\nUh the goal without a plan an executed will plan is this is a dream you know go without a plan is a dream and and that's one of the things that we spend a lot of time on an online training academy is that step by step plan that step by step process on how to accomplish the goal because any and we are we're going to come up to the holidays here pretty quick\nAnd all of a sudden everybody is going to plan out their New Year's resolutions I don't remember all the statistics we went through it back in January on the show but it ended up being something like within four weeks eighty percent of the people have completely given up and I'm not even thought about their New Year's resolution and part of that is there wasn't an executed will plan\nThey didn't know exactly what to do tomorrow ...\nCould plan right now is the gyms knowing they're going to start running their commercials in there and you know\n... and they're going to make a killing thirty bucks a month but at the gym memberships skyrocket but at the same time\nPutting our our best foot forward and giving us an opportunity to reach that financial goal is critical out there as well and and we have to do\nWhat we have to do what it takes to accomplish the goal we want to lose a little weight we gotta spend a little more time on the treadmill\nAnd we want to make a little more money we've got to get those skills and one of the places where we can really start bringing the knowledge that we can work our way up into that skill set is I don't want to have to classes and we've got this stack of this decade tickets is dwindling we must be towards the end of the show but we got a few tickets left we do do they give away let's do it\nRight now I've got to have to class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you'll see exactly what it takes\nTo really live

S. dot com\nAlways enjoy my conversations with an analyst like Sam Stovall economic background I'd like to a size four of my background as well as we can have conversations that I think are easy to understand\nAnd yet very informative and one of the things I did not have a chance to talk to Sam about was what sectors of the market could really participate we'll going forward and I'm sure you want to hear what might do well no matter what the market does\nMy opinion if you're looking for growth you must be in technology\nIf you own a large cap growth fund you are in technology whether you know whether or not Amazon Apple Google net net flicks Facebook they're all in there so it's technology something that you should be frightened about\nAs anything fundamentally changed for technology even if there was a sell off for a moment\nAs a result of the year I don't think so\nI Do not think this is the top for technology stocks you need to talk to your own advisor to see if they agree if you're going to talk with me you're hearing my opinion the dynamic of technology could play out for the next number of years\nAnd don't be surprised to see stocks in that sector hit new highs this week we saw a recovery and an Amazon we saw a terrific earnings from Netflix\nWe are seeing a lot of volatility in that sector and if you are a money manager and if you've identified certain sectors you want to participate in and they've gotten ahead of themselves well\nYou look at the sell off as a buying opportunity a way to get some of the hot technology stocks at a cheaper price now we are not talking about the technology stocks of two thousand the bubbles stocks\nThe dot com stocks no thank you I never touched them never would we're talking about the fundamentally sound companies that are driving the economy not the speculative ones they can get speculative if they get ahead of themselves so what'd you do is you wait for some opportunities to buy and then you invest accordingly\nSo valuations and technology are often criticized I don't think\nThey're unreasonable a year after the tech bubble back in two thousand though technology stocks traded about two hundred percent\nOver the market right now they're trading at about thirty percent premium over the market even the fang stocks Facebook apple Amazon Netflix and Google aren't that expensive relatively speaking in terms of their dollar price Netflix and Amazon are very expensive but they also have the most growth\nSo ... you look at them individually you sit down with an advisor and you say okay this money is oriented towards growth this is for income is for a legacy and if you are not able to withstand some of the volatility well don't be in the market if\nYou have short term money don't be in the market but if you are willing to buy quality\nYou can buy them at track their prices when they come down and the problems in the economy are not necessarily going to affect the technology stocks as much as some of the other sectors of the more of the market\nWe have learned that China has inserted some spy chips into some of the servers\nThat were used by apple and Amazon and some of the others and the companies have denied the allegations\nBut it certainly raises concerns for companies that rely on China for their manufacturing and if the apple and it's all the bank stocks who\nAre withstand China intervention or start to do their own investment in security for themselves that could affect some of the profits but ultimately that will help that's the way you look at market volatility you don't get spooked you look at it as potential opportunities you buy when things are on sale\nAnd you sell when they're over priced ideally you can do it ideally a good money management firm can help give us a call one eight hundred three seven seven fifty seven fifty seven find out how we have managed money for over forty years on Gary Goldberg\nWe will be back with William Donald send the former head of the SEC former chairman of Aetna\nFormer founder of the O.

into what it currently is because when I first started\nI worked in an office on Wall street that had a ticker tape it was a paper tape bubble you remember those days\nTo do\nThis evolve meant into what is basically a lot of algorithmic trading a computerized trading what's your reflection on what is it doing for the industry and is it better for the average individual\nThat that's a complicated question uh you have a\nHigh speed trading and and so forth and so on and uh it makes it a\nDifficult for a vigil to buy and sell securities and the stock market particularly they are stock exchange
