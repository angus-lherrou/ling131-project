two\nFour six eight seven five one that's eight hundred two four six eighty seven fifty one\nNext we'll listen to an interview that I had this Dr Douglas Howard the founder and formulate or a balance of nature [noise] this is a conversation you don't want to miss as we discuss a variety of important issues related to health I Want you to ask yourself how can better nutrition improve my life\nHe's a doctor chiropractic he's also director of Medicine He's a leading researcher and fight on nutrition he's a good friend and he's the man who created the product that has changed my family's life and so many others\nDr Douglas Howard a balance of nature hello Hi it's great to be here again it's wonderful and I'm also so very glad\nTo introduce the very original health coach of balance of nature a a a wonderful title because it's something that's so unique to this company will be getting into that as Well hi Suzy Hi Laura good to be back to hear your voice it's become quite familiar to\nPeople all over the country in terms of ah encouraging people to take their fruits and veggies everyday\nDr Howard this is really revolutionary and yet it seems like the most simple concept in the entire world where did you come up with putting fruits and vegetables into a capsule and why\nBoat actually years years of study you know it's interesting the other companies now are starting to think they can catch a fad\nWe're not a fad or something that for many years of study and research and figuring out how to do this has made it happened and I always ... me when I hear other companies now they're starting to say oh we have more fruits and veggies in ours and blah blah blah we have fifty instead of thirty one and I'm like\nThey don't get it it's not how many per se it's how they interact with each other and we're not just a business it's trying to get on the shelf and convince people we're about results\nAnd that's why we offer like you said at the health coaching for example that's why we offer that is to help people accelerate the results there's no extra fees there's no extra charge for it\nInfects business management companies have said oh you need to get rid of that department it just costs and your money no that is what we are about results\nSo people say to me off and oh I take vitamins um I don't think I Need to take you know balance of nature because I keep I I'm such an advocate now because I've seen and I'm One of those that actually feels the difference when I don't take my balance of nature I Am so sluggish and\nFuzzy and when I take it and this is literally on a daily basis I can literally feel my body pick up at night and my thinking gets clearer me so I'm One of those people and I my parents are as well because they tell me about that fact but when people say to me\nOh no I take the vitamins I don't need to take balance of nature I'm telling them you you need ten till eleven servings of fruits and vegetables per day in their most potent nutritious like Ninety nine point nine hundred percent of ... like a raw vegetable almost\nAre you getting that a and B\nThey are not a vitamin and in fact you can is this not true Dr Howard you can forego some of those multi vitamins big companies put out here and just substitute it with nothing but the fruits and vegetables is that correct\nYes in fact I'm going to reverse a little bit you you don't you don't substitute vitamins just they're they're all of its there plus hundreds of thousands of other chemicals that buffer and assist those chemicals to make them work hundred fold and that's what's important about it\nWell the reason people take vitamins is because they know that their diet is substandard if they were sitting down every day and eating more than ten servings and then friday of thirty one different fruits and vegetables do you think they would even think about taking vitamins\nNo I think they would though because that's why I'm already marketed as true\nAnd let me tell you every time you extract a chemical or every time you you consume an isolated chemical there is a side effect is one of the first things you're you're taught and pharmacology in medical school is there's a side effect every chemical\nBut in a fruit and vegetables and fruit or vegetable then there's hundreds of thousands of chemicals that counteract those negative side effects consistently and there is a side effect of fruits and vegetables good helped\n[laughter] so part a lot of the so called lifestyle diseases I've I've heard you mentioned before and I've read on your literature that a lot of the life style diseases that we know today can be prevented from the taking of the fruits and veggies\nOn a daily basis how and why is this\nWhat I Want to go back to one of the thing really fast is because sometimes on on the vitamin aspect sometimes there's even a point where we're help coach will be working with somebody and they just aren't getting the progress that they would like to be happening and then they find out the person is taking\nA whole bunch of vitamins on top of it somehow they missed that hopefully not but\nAnd then we'll talk to them and say you know what let's start taking off some of this other chemistry so that the ... the chemistry from real fruits and vegetables can start doing its job and they start seeing the results that were really wanting to to progress with\nThe reason being is the chemistry from the fruits and vegetables has to go in and counteract some of the chemistry that they're\nUsing they're trying to ... the extraction so they have to use some of the chemistry from the fruits and vegetables to counteract some of the effects of those vitamins that aren't necessary in the body so it actually most of the time works better without that now there's not a danger you can continue to take your vitamins if you want\nBut frequently and most of the time you'll get a better result if you drop the multivitamin and I just ask myself is see which one smarter God or a scientist ...\nFor those that are just tuning in I'm Talking with Dr Douglas Howard the formulate or of balance of nature's fruits and veggies and fiber in size\nAnd I'm

other and studying that through and then doing studies with with the electron microscopy to different universities so they could study by electron microscopes\nHow it was affecting the DNA the very best and then some of the studies we were doing was how it would affect the immune system the most you\nRemember the game pacman of course okay well you've got white blood cells in there that run around like pacman going you know to to eat the the bad things\nAnd that's what those white blood cells are out there to do so we tested how many of those white blood cells could be out there to eat up the things that shouldn't be in your blood\nAnd how quickly they could respond those immune studies\nThose DNA studies and studies about how the red blood cells could receive the nutrition and receive oxygen so get out to where it needed and also even studies about the ... the blood or in other words the thickness of the blood flows through the beans and can get to the smallest possible vessels\nAll of that put together then I studied which fruits and vegetables and combining those until we had sixteen different fruits and Fifteen but different vegetables\nThat made the greatest impact on those things and in the DNA for example how could protected the most and how quickly the DNA could repair itself wind damage to those are all things that help prevent aging diseases\nIt's

going online to balance of nature dot com or by calling in at eight hundred two four six eight seven five one that's eight hundred\nTwo four six eighty seven fifty one\nNext we'll listen to an interview that I had was Dr Douglas Howard the founder and formulate or a balance of nature this is a conversation you don't want to miss as we discuss a variety of important issues related to health I Want you to ask yourself how can better nutrition improve my life\nWorked with and and your your good physician does work with that and and and you know if you've been to a physician and you walk out I don't care if they save your life to the surgery but they're rude and mean then you don't really feel real great and you might go home still depressed or whatever it is more depressed or more depressed\nAnd more fearful ten yeah that's frequent and more fear that drives me crazy when when we're taught and medicine to use fear to get people to do it we want no bounds of nature we use education jobs here means teacher so so that people can make that choice not fear I don't believe in fear factor\nAnd the house Chad is also just magical and ... ... one wonderful thing as a health costs when you're working with people\nAnd sometimes there's decided they helped try ad that people can't face you know they're just they been working on it long enough and they're done they're like I'm given up on the physical and I can't lose weight or I can do whatever I'm done I'm not going to work on that anymore and so\n... the health coaches that\nIf you just work on two sides of the triangle the third one comes up naturally on its own so we just say okay let's set that aside for now and let's look at the other two ... and ... it improves and then as things improve than they get more\nWilling to look at that site that so difficult for them\nSo you have a health coach that takes a customer or through the various ways in which the fruits and veggies interact perhaps with other medications or how much you should take what time you should take them what are some of the different roles that health coach fails when they start taking balance of nature\nWell the main goal of a health coach is\nBecause we are results based company is to make sure that our customers are getting results or you know we all there's always results with balance of nature all you have to do is take it and and we teach our health coaches that because that is absolutely true we've done the research we know that we know the results that you're getting\nOn the human ... if you'd just to swallow them but you don't always feel it\nExactly whether you fill it or not the result is there and you know I I Hope this person doesn't mind that I use the example not use names anyways but just just yesterday I had a wonderful experience speaking with a man\nAnd I'm an in relation to what you're talking about what do we talk about with our health coaches his it's based upon the try out of help and that's what I built after five six years of practice and I started to realize and see this that\nEverybody's health is based on three factors and and a lot of people think oh I've heard this before but not this model of it\n'cause we're based upon a chemical aspect of health that's nutrition that the air we breathe the drugs everything in our body it's a chemical we are a chemical laboratory so everything's based upon the raw materials of ... of of chemistry\nAnd then then there's good and there's bad okay and then there's the physical side of help and that's an aspect we have to we have to address always and then there's the at the the mental spiritual emotional side of that is all one that's not three different things\nThat's one side of your health tryout and so we work on goals on all three of those sides to help people really see the greatest benefit and for example I was with somebody yesterday and ah\nAs I was talking with him is a good man and so one of his goals you know they'd written down be good to people do kind things for people and those are all important but I just looked at him finally I said\nYou do all those things you are that person you could just see it in him and fill it from him and violence looked at my you know what you're what you're dealing with is fear\nBecause fear and face cannot coexist you can't have them in the same space one chases the other out and so\nWith tears he finally said you're right\nI don't trust I Need to change the trust in my life and he left with a new resolve to trust to trust in the process of his body to trust in the process of things to trust in people\nAnd he he will have a whole change in his life because now we're working all three sides and we had some other goals of walking and being active and and and obvious\nThe was it with nutrition we had several several goals but until we found that one he wasn't a change person he will see results now\nWe're going to take a short break and we'll be right back with more from Dr Douglas Howard and Susan Howard don't go away\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule\nReally does work I had a great expense and not not getting the little allergy calls and stuff in the spring and in the hall tribute it to that because I I shut down\nUh I actually stopped my vitamins that I Would take you know sticking a regiment of vitamins I basically stopped all of them and then went on this and this seems to be beneficial for me\nThat made me feel better I mean you know at my age if I can keep up with all the animals and they work\nIt just helped me feel

nature show I'm your host Laura Smith and we are talking about why whole foods or the answer to many health problems versus taking supplements that have vitamins\nI'm the founder and formulate or of balance of nature Dr Douglas Howard and his wife Susan Howard\nDr Howard is a medical doctor had real practical Dr researcher\nAnd specialist in spite of nutrients Dr Howard what is new that you can tell us with balance of nature and and truly what do I know you do research continually you're one of those perpetual scientists\nTell us what you're learning ... even more and more as the results come into the company about what the wonderful people who are taking this product what it's doing for them\nYou know what is beautiful the balance of nature is it's not new is the oldest form of nutrition on the earth and that's exactly what it was made for us you know yes I'm always researching and finding and driving of how and why does it work\nBut the beauty of it is we don't have to reinvent it every couple of years and make a special and knew\nBecause the formula for balance of nature has been here for thousands of years on the earth day it's one hundred percent pure fruits and vegetables\nThere's nothing added and nothing taken away from it except for the water it's pure produce it took years of which fruit and which vegetable and and how they would interact with each other and studying that through and then doing studies with\nWith the electron microscopy to different universities so they could study by electron microscopes\nHow it was affecting the DNA the very best and then some of the studies we were doing was how it would affect the immune system the most you remember the game pacman of course okay well you've got white blood cells in there that run around like pacman going you know to to eat up the bad things\nAnd that's what those white blood cells are out there to do so we tested how many of those white blood cells could be out there to eat up the

columnist Jamal 'cause Yogi was killed during a fist fight that broke out inside the Saudi counseling in Istanbul\nThat she's not getting care because she's a fully\nCompliant woman who can respond and wants the best care and now she had a biopsy get a biopsy about two years ago showing invasive cancer a bill last brass and took him so long to start treatments giving him the wrong treatment how do you know it's the wrong treatment what's not working right is that the definition of wrong treatment\nAnd that can be right treatment but it's not working and endless chemotherapy for most people is just not the right treatment\nMaybe there's a few that fit in that category but most people if the chemo doesn't work at the beginning it's not going to be better news or it gets worse because the cancer gets sensitized to the chemo the cancer mutates to cancer changes in fact maybe even the chemotherapy causes the cancer to become more aggressive like in this woman and what she needs to do is to be staged\nI examined to her and he got blood tests and we arranged for a test to see where the cancers traveled she's at the super duper big hospital giving her chemo but no one\nGot her state's up they never got her staged up and she's got a pain in the grass she got pain in the armpit there's a suspicion of pain and cancer and the opposite breast\nWeight is following two years ago it was a hundred dollars Ninety plus ten percent of our weighed the tumors out of control and that's why she came to register to New York city for Broadway she came to me\nGet a better choice a better option not just to be told ... chemo that's how the southern choice is a fear that isn't working though for this woman is lots of points\nTo be at a hospital and not good good care as a reason to leave it would be on chemo and not good results is a reason to stop\nThe chemo stopping chemo doesn't mean you're going to stop your life so many people think oh I'll take chemo even if it's not working the must be doing something it's not magical key Moser kind of poison is trying to poison the cancer more but then the body love the cancers growing and you're still getting chemo that just poisoning the body so many reasons for this woman to stop\nThe chemo come here which is what she did\nWere staging her up and then we're planning to offer treatment that's a fact\nOf to try to shrink down this cancers growing through the breast and growing through the skin and growing to the armpit and we have a long track record anyone with breast cancer\nWhen I came to New York Ninety seven percent of women are we getting mastectomies that we're losing their breasts for treatment of breast cancer whereas in my practice Ninety percent of women were keeping their breast exactly the opposite so we have one of the longest track records in New York probably the longest in preserving women's\nBras have breast cancer who wish that obviously if you don't want to save your breast at something else a

it looked like an DVD hey Dr Lederman walked by\nWe are back again my name's center Lederman real doctor MD board certified\nTalking about cancer cancer patients and what the\nHeck is going on and so many facilities around town here's a man who was born in Nineteen fifty four and Morocco is sixty three years old the single it came with his brother and family\nAnd loved ones and he went to one of the big hospitals a couple of years ago and amassing as thyroid and you had two surgeries this big hospital for thyroid cancer and then the cancer came rip roaring back and then he went to even a super super bigger hospital and\nThey had more surgery and he had thirty five radiation treatments and really hurt him it destroyed his teeth and his swallowing you opened up and showed me his mouth when examined them and almost all his\nTeeth and been destroyed by this treatment of everything good was destroyed\nBut the cancer wasn't destroyed but the exact opposite of people wanting to go to get cancer treatment to get the cancer and gone and he lost his teeth and the lost weight and he had pain and suffering in\nThirty five seven weeks of daily radiation which just doesn't work well why is that well because thyroid cancer is often resistant to standard little dose of radiation or why do doctors give lots of little dose of radiation while they get paid by the do so it was great for this super super big hospital and great\nFor the doctor and great for I guess everybody except for\nOne person again and that's the patient and he had five major surgeries and his big super hospital in thirty five radiation treatments and nothing worked okay the cancers come back in the neck to return to the neck now they want to do another radical surgery they've already done five\nRadical surgeries in this hospital and thirty five radiation treatments and they want to do another radical surgery even though the cancers traveled to the lungs and the family came when we go we called over and got the records the family was never told the cancers in the lungs\nWow what what does it mean when the power to cancer spreads the lungs it means and stage for cancer when the cancer travels from one Oregon to another it's usually stage for cancer Kansas travel to the lungs he had\nFive surgeries on his neck thirty five radiation treatments that there's a big St Elsewhere nothing work and now they want to do the sixth operation than that and they didn't tell them the extent that the cancer and he was angry and I understand why he was angry because he's in pain and suffering his teeth and been destroyed his neck has been hurt\nNone of their treatments words he said five surgeries radical surgeries on his neck and thirty five radiation treatments and nothing's work and that's why he's come here to Thirteen eighty four\nBroadway Broadway and thirtieth street to understand what's going on he had no idea that cancer traveled he had no idea you had stage or cancer he had no idea he had options till we came here to Thirteen before Broadway and that's why so many people come to radio surgery in New York why other surgeons keeping on fish pushing surgery\nWhen the surgery didn't work five times before and why they're pushing treatment\nDoesn't work and why don't they tell them that the cancers travel to the lungs and allows him to prepare his life and tell us loved ones why did they not tell him well this is the work we do to get fresh and second opinions to shoot straight with the patients huge trade with the loved ones and do it in a way that people could understand what they have\nAnd then make the best possible decision this is the work we knew by the way we have lots of information to send to you have a book with DVD which we send out at no charge in his car office day or night and\nYour address and we'll send out a book within the next business day if you want an appointment if you have a cancer suspected\nCancers same thing cause day or night and um you know how the news if you want to come into our office to pick up information and lots of people like to come in because when you come in you get more booklets in more information and more languages so many\nNewly diagnosed it's happening now and his PSA was found to be two hundred and Seventy one while a normal\nPSA is considered up to four and his was to Seventy one his last PSA was five years ago said to be normal so lots of teaching here so if you want to try to avoid the dying are\nSuffering from prostate cancer you may want to come in and get checked out for your prostate a PSA a physical exam and other tests if you wish this man didn't do that is because they went from normal to two hundred and Seventy one in five\nYears now he had a bone scans turned the cancers traveled to the ... the three ... and the lumber spawn and the hips get a biopsy showing a belief in nine cancer Gleason was a doctor tried to tell us how aggressive cancers would be in the prostate\nAnd the old days when they did a ... of the prostate you were told yes or no yes it's cancer no it's not now we have an idea of the aggression and this man you know aggressive with his\nBecause the Gleason score tied number the higher the number of the more aggressive cancers loosens range from two to ten so the higher the number of the more aggressive cancer everything more than\nSix is considered aggressive PSA more than ten is considered aggressive his two hundred and Seventy one is pain and suffering low back pain and this is the work that we\nDo to put together a program for this man to tried to get his pain under control is cancer under control and this is the work that we do every day [noise] they're at thirty fourth Radley that would have been a woman who flew in from Mexico she's Seventy\nSix she lives in\nTijuana shed symptoms two years ago she had nausea and vomiting and her skin turned yellow she had a CAT scan stirring up pancreas mass surgeons in Mexico opened her up\nDidn't find anything enclosed her up well\nAnother teaching point just because the surgeons wind I cut you off but it doesn't mean you have to be cut open she got cut off by it served no useful purpose\nThey couldn't see the cancer they didn't buy up to the cancer they didn't do anything they opened her up and took her months to recuperate\nAnd she's still the cancer the cancer was still growing so when you do it\nFor ... you should understand what you're going to get out or the procedure for the ... and to open you up and look around and close up well maybe it's good for the surge and maybe it's great for the hospital but again the question\nIs it good for one person is it good for the patient and that's what we're talking about is it good for the patient\nAnd for this woman and it was not good wasted a lot of time and the cancer kept growing should a mess in the pancreas eventually she got an a plane in Tijuana and came in New York and came here and diagnosed\nPancreas cancer and then she shopped around town decided to start on with the chemo doctrine that came on doctors all you got I got off chemo only came on like well the problem with chemo only for pancreas cancer is that it doesn't work to cure the cancer maybe it slows the\nCancer at the beginning but then after a short period of time to cancer resisted cancer mutates that cancer\nIs unaffected in and then the cancer just starts growing so there's only two ways really to keep your pancreas cancer and that is either surgery which is not very effective or\nRadio surgery which has a high control right where we attack the cancer and\nEventually the woman understood that the chemo wasn't particularly fantastic to cure her and the best treatment would be combined modality therapy and that's what she chose she came to me and we treated her two years ago for pancreas cancer she came from Mexico and she was very nice lady a very very nice family and her daughter lives in New York and\nWorks in other nations and her son in law's an immigration lawyer and they used to bring\nMexican cookies which were pre particularly tasty and she was treated here at thirty for Broadway with pinpoint treatment invisible beams for her pancreas cancer and she just came this past week and she just went home\nWith a clean bill of health\nTwo years after treatment PET scans negative cancer markers negative she used to see a Nineteen nine when all is way high sky high when she was diagnosed and we treated her and it's been going down ever since\nHis new PET scan showing no it's a cancer she is happy she's got one of the most smiling nice faces you can imagine a smiley nice family in a loving family in the loving daughter and the Lovings on law\nAnd lots of support and she just went back home to live her life cancer free after being treated here\nHer pancreas cancer where's the being placed in Mexico they did surgery for no good he started chemo in New York\nFor a little good until she came to registered in New York and was treated with pinpoint treatment invisible beams and his cancer free in remission doing well with no further treatment since our pinpoint non invasive out patients dairy tactic\nBody radio
