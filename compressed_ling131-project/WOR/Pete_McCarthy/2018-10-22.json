... sixty feedback right\nHow long did you actually keep your day job before you quit thought you were successful enough to ...\nIt was until I really couldn't pull it off anymore so I I just went to the bitter end I was a consultant for medium sized manufacturing company\nAnd I kept that job it was a work from home job I kept it to the bitter end I had three people working in my basement that the point where I finally had to quit that job because I just couldn't handle it any more with what I needed to do for my own business\nWas it like a year six month must have been about two years two years so for two years you develop your own business and so you work sixteen hours now twenty hours a day\nI worked a lot at the beginning not for sure and uh\nI probably worked sixteen hours a day a and I\nThink if you look at the history I probably got my first sale after six months OK er which was ... just a couple of thousand dollars then I hard my purse employee after probably a ... a year and then the second employee few months after that and then like around the third employee\nI was getting in trouble with the police because we have so many cars point [laughter]\nYou know we live in town but you know our way out in the attic and we're like the neighbors that are not called the cops but\nWhen you were working in the project\nWith this we had gone to our high school faculty and then with our teachers they helped us ... our vision and make it grow even bigger to something we're now we're going global in the future\nThat's really amazing you know I Love Puerto Rico we've been there a few times it's such a beautiful island\nThis isn't just an excuse to go like the other kinds of ... going on\nYeah and we broadcast from their next phone line so really what made you pick that just because of the hurricanes the devastation\nSo I'm One of my aunt lives in Puerto Rico and after the hurricane she was telling me a lot of stories the hell out of the schools were really devastated and how education was really being impeded by these natural events and we really want it to be able to make sure that no one's education is hurt by this\nEvent that occurs we wanted to make sure that we're all to help people who are less fortunate and impacted by these events so that's why we chose to go you know\nYou were at our meet up the other day and somebody asked the question was really interesting I I'm just gonna ask it again it is his age or problems so when you get in front of these uh entrepreneurs and their two or three or four alarm probably five times your age\nYour high school students how did they take that how do they do they accept the fact that you're the expert in certain areas and how does how do you pull that off\nWell when when we first went to Puerto Rico and then we got up in front of around fifty people for classes there are a little surprised expressions on their face seeing that Seventeen year olds are teaching them about business what do they know will store experience and once we finally got into teaching the classes\nThey realized that oh well they actually know a little bit more because while we go through this academy for international business and finance\nWe went about the basics of counting marketing technology and business so all this background and experience helps us to create business boot camp and to properly teacher classes so once you just get out of that little ... about oh they know what they're talking about it's okay that they teach me a little bit it all works out you also like\nI think uh that was a major problem with the business consulting because we were helping implement advice to a group of people who are almost a lot older than us so they really struggle with that ability for uh for them to implement this advice but I think the Morris county school technology's really prepared us and wants to hear us talk they're really more accepting of our advice\nThat's really great I mean we'll take advice from anyone who's willing to give it here on passage to profit so thanks a lot I mean can you talk about some of your success stories of students actually going out and started businesses based on your curriculum\nYeah so one of our classes in Puerto Rico she was planning on starting a tourism company but it was really unsure about what she wanted to do and how she would get there so ah throughout our classes we taught her how to start started small business how to acquire funding how to manage a lot of the technology that goes along with it\nAnd after that towards the end of our one week course she approached us was I'm really thinking of starting a business now she gave us her business card\nAnd we're keeping in touch we're helping out with all the steps that she moves forward and we're hoping it around a three months she's hoping to release for business and\nThat's great that's an inspiring story and congratulations to you both for having such a powerful influence on this I think one of the great things about being an entrepreneur as as you get to see the fruits of your labor you you help people find themselves through work or work is one way that we express ourselves as persons\nAnd it's wonderful that you're hoping this process uh especially for younger people who are in the past would have no way to do that\nAnd I think that the\nIn this country and worldwide as you guys are brought up is really changing and this is more at the forefront of education so it's up to the young people like you to really keep pushing this forward and pushing the new things and the future of what education is really going to look like\nAnd young people get a bad rap these days everyone saying oh they're always looking at their phones are doing this I think that's completely wrong young people who want to do things if they put their mind to it they can do it and you guys are proof or that it's awesome\nThank you and then they learn in school source who was working\nFor
