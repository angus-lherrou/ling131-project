stories of the week and I want to invite anyone listening that also has a success story to share it with us by going online to balance of nature dot com or by calling in at eight hundred two four\nSix eight seven five one that's eight hundred two four six eighty seven fifty one\nNext we'll listen to an interview that I had was Dr Douglas Howard the founder and formulate or of balance of nature this is a conversation you don't want to miss as we discuss the variety of important issues related to health I Want you to ask yourself how can better nutrition improve my life\nHe's a doctor of chiropractic he's also a doctor of Medicine He's a leading researcher and fight on nutrition he's a good friend and he's the man who created the product that has changed my family's life and so many others\nDr Douglas Howard a balance of nature hello how are you it's great to be here again it's wonderful and I'm also so very glad\nTo introduce the very original health coach of balance of nature a a a wonderful title because it's something that's so unique to this company will be getting into that as Well hi Suzy Hi Laura good to be back it's great to hear your voice it's become quite familiar to\nA people all over the country in terms of ah encouraging people to take their fruits and veggies everyday\nDr Howard this is really revolutionary and yet it seems like the most simple concept in the entire world where did you come up with putting fruits and vegetables into a capsule and why\nBoat actually years years of study you know it's interesting other companies now are starting to think they can catch a fad we're not a fad\nOr something that for many years of study and research and figuring out how to do this is made it happened and I always ... me when I hear other companies now they're starting to say oh we have more fruits and veggies in ours and blah blah blah we have fifty instead of thirty one and I'm like\nThey don't get it is not how many per se it's how they interact with each other and we're not just a business it's trying to get on the shelf and convince people we're about results\nAnd that's why we offer like you said at the health coaching for example that's why we offer that is to help people accelerate the results there's no extra fees there's no extra charge for it\nInfects business management companies have said oh you need to get rid of that department it just costs you money no that is what we are about results\nSo people say to me off and oh I take vitamins um I don't think I Need to take a balance of nature because I keep I I'm such an advocate now because I've seen and I'm One of those that actually feels the difference when I don't take my balance of nature I Am so sluggish and\nFuzzy and when I take it and this is literally on a daily basis I can literally feel my body pick up at night and my thinking gets clearer me so I'm One of those people and I my parents are as well because they tell me about that fact but when people say to me\nOh no I take vitamins I don't need to take balance of nature I'm telling them you you need ten till eleven servings of fruits and vegetables per day in their most potent nutritious like Ninety nine point nine hundred percent of ... like a raw vegetable almost\nAre you getting that a and B\nThey are not a vitamin and in fact you can is this not true Dr Howard you can forego some of those multi vitamins big companies put out here and just substitute it with nothing but the fruits and vegetables is that correct\nYes in fact I'm going to reverse a little bit you you don't you don't substitute vitamins just they're they're all of its there plus hundreds of thousands of other chemicals that buffer and assist those chemicals to make them work hundred fold and that's what's important about it\nWell the reason people take vitamins is because they know that their diet is substandard if they were sitting down every day and eating more than ten servings and then friday of thirty one different fruits and vegetables do you think they would even think about taking vitamins now\nI think they would though because that's why I'm already marketed as true\nWell and let me tell you every time you extract a chemical or every time you you\nConsume an isolated chemical there is a side effect is one of the first things you're you're taught and pharmacology in medical school is there's a side effect every chemical\nBut in a fruit and vegetables and fruit or vegetable then there's hundreds of thousands of chemicals that counteract those negative side effects consistently and there is a side effect of fruits and vegetables good helped\n[laughter] so part a lot of the so called lifestyle diseases I've I've heard you mentioned before and I've read on your literature that ... a lot of the life style diseases that we know today can be prevented from the taking of the fruits and veggies\nOn a daily basis how and why is this\nWhat I Want to go back to one of the thing really fast is because sometimes on on the vitamin aspect sometimes there's even a point where we're help coach will be working with somebody and they just aren't getting the progress that they would like to be happening and then they find out the person is taking\nA whole bunch of vitamins on top of it somehow they missed that hopefully not but [noise]\nAnd then we'll talk to them and say you know what let's start taking off some of this other chemistry so the ... the chemistry from real fruits and vegetables can start doing his job and they start seeing the results that were really wanting to to progress with\nThe reason being is the chemistry from the fruits and vegetables\nHas to go in and counteract some of the chemistry that they're using the ... the extracts and so they have to use some of the chemistry from the fruits and vegetables to counteract some of the effects of those vitamins that aren't necessary in the body\nSo it actually most of the time works better without that no there's not a danger you can continue to take your vitamins if you want\nBut frequently and most of the time you'll get a better result if you drop the multivitamin\nAnd I just asked myself let's see which one smarter guard or a scientist\n... for those that are just tuning in I'm Talking with Dr Douglas Howard the formulate or of balance of nature's fruits and veggies and fiber in space\nAnd I'm

it and nothing taken away from it except for the water it's pure produce\nIt took years of which fruit and which vegetable and and how they would interact with each other and studying that through and then doing studies with with the electron microscopy to different universities so they could study by electron microscopes\nHow it was affecting the DNA the very best and then some of the studies we were doing was how it would affect the immune system the most you remember the game pacman of course okay well you've got white blood cells in there that run around like pacman going you know to to eat up the bad things\nAnd that's what those white blood cells are out there to do so we tested how many of those white blood cells could be out there to eat up the things that shouldn't be in your blood\nAnd how quickly they could respond immune studies\nThose DNA studies and studies about how the red blood cell could receive the nutrition and receive oxygen so get out to where it needed and also even studies about the discounts to do the blood or in other words the thickness of the blood how flows through the beans and can get to the smallest possible vessels\nAll of that put together then I studied which fruits and vegetables and combining those until we had sixteen different fruits and Fifteen but different vegetables\nThat made the greatest impact on those things in in the DNA for example how could protected the most and how quickly the DNA could repair itself wind damage to those are all things that help prevent aging diseases\nIt's always such a great pleasure to speak

I says about the nature you got to get on it it will save yet\nI just can't\nHang Dr Howard enough he's brilliant\nWelcome back to our show we just heard our top success stories of the week and I want to invite anyone listening that also has a success story to share it with us by going online to balance of nature dot com or by calling in an eight hundred two four\nSix eight seven five one that's eight hundred two four six eighty seven fifty one\nWorked with and and your your good physician does work with that and and and you know if you've been to a physician and you walk out I don't care if they save your life to the surgery but they're rude and mean\nThen you don't really feel real great and you might go home still depressed or whatever it is more depressed or more the more fearful to ya that's frequent and more fear that drives me crazy when\nWhen we're taught and medicine to use fear to get people to do it we want no bounds of nature we use education jobs here means teacher so so that people can make that choice not fear I don't believe in fear factor\nAnd the house triad is also just magical and ... ... one wonderful thing as a health costs when you're working with people\nAnd sometimes there's decided they helped ... that people can't face you know they're just they been working on it long enough and they're done they're like I'm given up on the physical and I can't lose weight or I can do whatever I'm done I'm not going to work on that anymore and so\n... the health conscious that\nIf you just work on two sides of the triangle the third one comes up naturally on its own so we just say okay let's set that aside for now and let's look at the other two ... and ... it improves and then as things improve then they get more\nWilling to look at that site that so difficult for them so you have a health coach that takes a customer\nOr through the various ways in which the fruits and veggies interact perhaps with other medications or\nHow much you should take what time you should take them what are some of the different roles that health coach fails when they start taking balance of nature well\nThe main role of a health coach is\nBecause we are results based company is to make sure that our customers are getting results or you know we all there's always results with balance of nature all you have to do is take it and and we teach our health coaches that because that is absolutely true we've done the research we know that we know the results that you're getting\nOn the human cell if you just to swallow them but you don't always feel it\nExactly whether you fill it or not the result is there and you know I I Hope this person doesn't mind that I use the example of not use names anyways but just just yesterday I had a wonderful experience speaking with a man and um and in\nRelation to what you're talking about what do we talk about with our health coaches his it's based upon the try out of help and that's what I built after five six years of practice and I started to realize and see this that\nEverybody's help is based on three factors and and a lot of people then go I've heard this before but not this model of it\nBecause we are based upon a chemical aspect of health that's nutrition that the air we breathe the drugs everything in our body it's a chemical we are a chemical laboratory so everything's based upon the raw materials of ... of of chemistry\nAnd then and there's good and there's bad okay and then there's the physical side of help and that's an aspect we have to we have to address always and then there's the at the the mental spiritual emotional side of that is all one that's not three different things\nThat's one side of your health try out and so we work on goals on all three of those sides to help people really see the greatest benefit and for example I was with somebody yesterday and ah\nAs I was talking with him is a good man and so one of his goals you know they'd written down be good to people do kind things for people and those are all important but I just looked at and finally I said\nYou do all those things you are that person you could just see it in him and fill it from him and found that I looked at him I mean you know what you're what you're dealing with is fear\nBecause fear and face cannot coexist you can't have them in the same space one chases the other out and so\nWith tears he finally said you're right\nI don't trust I Need to change the trust in my life and he left with a new resolve to trust to trust in the process of his body to trust in the process of things to trust in people\nAnd he he will have a whole change in his life because now we're working all three sides we had some other goals of walking and being active and and and obviously was with nutrition we had several several goals\nBut until we found that one he wasn't a change person he will see results now\nWe're going to take a short break and we'll be right back with more from Dr Douglas Howard answers and Howard don't go away\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule\nReally does work I've had a great expense and not not getting the little allergy calls and stuff in the spring and in the fall and I attribute it to that because I shut down\nUh I actually stopped my vitamins that I Would take a regiment of vitamins and I think sickly stopped all of them and then went on this and\nThis seems to be beneficial for me\nThat made me feel better I mean you know at my age if I can keep up with all the animals that they work\nIt just kept me felt that I

nutrient\nDr Howard what is new that you can tell us with balance of nature and and truly what do I know you do research continually you're one of those perpetual scientists\nTell us what you're learning ... even more and more as the results come in to the company about what the wonderful people who are taking this product what it's doing for them\nYou know it was beautiful the balance of nature is it's not new is the oldest form of nutrition on the earth and that's exactly what it was made for us you know yes I'm always researching and finding and driving a how and why does it work\nBut the beauty of it is we don't have to reinvent at every couple of years and make a special and knew\nBecause the formula for balance of nature has been here for thousands of years on the earth it's one hundred percent pure fruits and vegetables\nThere's nothing at it and nothing taken away from it except for the water it's pure produce\nIt took years of which fruit and which vegetable

that hurt ourselves or a loved ones out her about sixty five year old man from Jamaica and we know Jamaica is a hotbed of cancer is a lot of cancer in the\nBlack community number one and the Caribbean community even more so\nThis is a man he's the father of five percent of with a PSA that went from for all the way up to nine and one year\nAnd his biopsy show the Gleason seven cancer so hit a rapid PSA velocities ... say more than doubled which is a warning sign\nHad a Gleason score when they had the biopsy show more aggressive cancer police in everything more than six is more aggressive seven eight nine ten the cancer was growing along the nerves [noise] he came to me you know CAT scan in November I has no pain he wakes up twice and I ...\nHe I offered to medicines which she declined isn't what medicines he's way it is two hundred and Seventy five pounds is a very robust man\nAnd well I spoke to him at length he has no family history of prostate cancer known and his family and I examine them and they had an a large prostate so he had this Gleason seven PSA nine rapid PSA velocity\nPerry neuro invasion grown along the nerves and we talked about all the options one more thing I should tell you which I did it as these Jehovah's Witness\nAnd that means he will take and does not take blood or blood products so why did he come well I came to me I Believe because we have better success rate for Gleason seven we have Ninety percent success rate with other mothers of radiation or surgery sixty percent with open surgeries sixty percent with [noise]\nRobotic surgery sixty percent of the most men who have robotic are open surgery and up and put a turn confident whereas with us most fans are cancer free [noise]\nMost men keep their sexual life most men keep the urine or your life\nAnd one more thing I should tell you about this man\nIs coming to me now six years after treatment cancer free doing well\nYou could look at the scandals yourself in New York Times articles by Charles Ornstein or an S T A N and Katie Thomas T H O M A s now\nMore involved more doctors getting millions hundreds of thousands thousands of dollars and all kinds of drug schemes\nNow the president of the hospital who makes six point seven million dollars doesn't make six points out from the hardest by treating patients you tells other people how to run their hospital and how to treat people and\nThey get six point seven million dollars so when you go to the super duper hospital and you wonder where all the money's going they say it's going for ... or something well if it's going for cable that's one thing but how do they pay him six point seven million dollars if your money's going for your care\nYour money's going for other things and that's why the prices in hospitals are much higher than the prices in free standing cancer centers like ours in fact the journal air Pete recently wrote if you want the best value for the money go to a free standing radiology center\nThat hospitals are get charges in surcharges and the charges of the most so that's how they pay him six point seven million dollars plus that's not enough\nBecause he also got hundreds of thousands of dollars from a drug company and the other company gave him\nTens of thousands of dollars plus hundreds of thousands of dollars in stock plus the six point seven million dollars now if he's directing a Cancer Center is getting all this money from a drug company or two or more [noise]\nWell what about his loyalty the loyalty\nThe patients that sure it's probably loyal to the hospital because he's getting six point seven million dollars\nAnd it's probably loyal to these companies is on the board of because when you're on the board of a company you're supposed to be financially responsible for that company\nAnd these are some of the biggest drug companies so if he's on the board of the biggest drug companies and he's responsible for their financial success and then he goes to the hospital or a six point seven million dollars\nHow is the neutral when they asked to see or as a shopper honor to see a patient like you and well this one was on the boards of these companies and then uh\nAnd the other doctors come forces yet another doctor has been investigated this is one of the directors of the big directors one of those super duper hospitals and he outlined his ties to many companies according from this article in the New York times you can see here so\nSays he outlined his ties to many companies back to thirty one companies\nReceiving consulting fees owning stock options are being a founder of the company and some of the companies pay them were huge companies like the most famous companies like Bristol Myers and Merck and other genetic companies which he owns stock options about\nAnd he put forth a statement [noise]\nAnd uh the statement was the authors apologized for any inconvenience this is because they didn't tell other people about their conflict of interest well conflict of interest is not an inconvenience\nIt's being misled it's misleading other people if he owns stock or companies are getting paid or is on the board of companies\nThat have that promotes the products of that company without telling you or me or other doctors that he is an owner on the board that's not inconvenience that's misleading\nAnd he writes the authors apologized for any inconvenience no you should be apologizing for miss leading other doctors of patience and other people and when you go to some of these super duper hospitals and you wonder\nWho's side is the doctor on is pushing chemo we'd talk today about people women getting two years of chemotherapy when it wasn't working and they keep on giving more and more chemo", "show_name": "Pete McCarthy", "year":
