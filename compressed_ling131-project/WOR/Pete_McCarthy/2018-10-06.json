{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "Triple board certified Dr lead among ... to win two choices for innovative cancer treatment that is to me Dr lead in person called killing to truly have ...\n[noise] looking back to the radio surgery hour\nDifference Rob redstone here with Dr gill Lederman W O R studios in the heart of New York city which is a few steps from the radio surgery New York and cancer\nTreatment center on Broadway and thirty eighth string Dr Lederman leading cancer and prostate cancer not in the spring in the first New York with Frank need to bring radio surgery first in America\nAnd in the western hemisphere plus my radio surgery you can also call Dr lead a minute to ensure killington for free informative booklet and DVD paid doctor Lederman we're\nBack where back I just want to spend a few minutes to talk to you about this big scandal I often talk about the big super duper hospitals and what they do for cancer patients you've heard today oh\nThey do these radical surgeries super radical surgeries and cut off people's mouth and John remove the leg bone and\nAnd then years of chemotherapy riverside working well there's a big scandal going on out another article came out this week of the New York times by orange staying and Thomas orange juice or an S T E R A N\nAnd now the chairman of the board of so how's the hospital organized well that there's a board and the board executive board supervises all the actions of a hospital and then under the board\nOr the doctors who do the work so now the chairman of the board of a super duper [noise] hospital\nDisparage I'm using the word of the orange tint and Thomas in the New York times the chairman of the board bluntly disparaged the hospitals former chief medical officer and I remember the chief medical officer is a doctor in charge of all the treatment\nAt one of the most prestigious biggest places giving hundreds of millions of dollars of chemo and surgery\nThe chief medical officer was caught taking money and he was reprimanded for taking the money he was reprimanded because he didn't tell other doctors when he reported that in medical journals\nThat he was on the payroll these drug companies is on the payroll is on the board of twelve different companies his own salary in the hospital was one point five million dollars is collecting millions more for the drug companies\nNow what happens with this doctors on the board of the drug companies and it's getting a million and a half dollars from the hospital and he sees you and he tells you or maybe you should get drug acts\nBut he doesn't tell you that drug axes made by the company that he's getting money back from or he sits on the board member when you sit in the border for that sort of responsible for that company so I say the board for that is a responsible for that company\nHe's the chief medical officer in charge of all the doctors and the treatment in this big complex multibillion dollar facility\nAnd he comes to seize you or his disciples come and see you they say well take drug act so they don't tell you that the doctors getting millions from these drug companies well now the chairman of the board says the article says that in New York Times I'm not making it up you can look at yourself disparage\nThe hospitals former medical officer chief medical officer stopped ... months ago he was considered the most prestigious Dr around and now the chairman of the borders disparaging him telling the hospital staff\nThat the medical chief had crossed lines and gone off the reservation in his outside dealings\nNow who caught him going off the line in off the reservation and who taught him it wasn't the hospital was supposed to be supervising it wasn't the chairman of the board was supposed to be supervised him it was an article in the New York times that cost him\n... eighty or Ninety percent of time he was not telling other doctors is articles that he was getting kicked back money from the drug companies wow it failed to disclose is industrial affiliations in medical journal articles okay\nYou can read the article yourself so you go to the big famous super duper places\nYou get said oh you have to chemo you after chemo like the patient I talked about the just a few minutes ago ... four years of cable never worked shut CAT scan after CAT scan it doesn't work the cats are kept growing says what we're going to change from came away the chemo be it doesn't work well we're going to change from came up ...\nIt doesn't work well why why are they doing that is it for the patient\nTo give years of useless came well toxic came on rubber what chemo is Kmart chemicals usually or other substances to put it in the body to try to kill the cancer well poisons to try to kill the cancer often have poisonous effects of the body that's why a lot of people don't like keyboard that don't like the side effects of chemo or they don't like the fact that\nFor many diseases like the ones we're talking about here and I've talked about beneficial uses of chemo today\nBut I also talked about useless chemo which is so often the case and most ... given that I see is useless ... useless Keli Goff [noise]\nI just wanted to get clear there are some useful points of chemo we could talk about that if you have a cancer You're welcome to come in\nAnd talk about it if you want but what's this particle the whole scandal about the scandal about giving millions of dollars to doctors doctors are under any obligation to tell you the patient because they're getting money\nHow are things different here searching for Broadway Dr Lederman radio sort of New York well here is an independent cancer treatments center there is no chairman of the border there is no president not working to pay the presence in this case this super duper hospitals the chairman of the board of the president the president was getting\nSix point seven million dollars plus he himself had other kickbacks from drug companies here we worked for only one person not the drug companies not the pharmaceutical companies not to surgeons thought the president of the hospital not the hospital\nKicks back by giving salaries we work by treating patients\nIf you wish and come to search for Broadway if you have a cancer suspected cancer\nWill talk to about all the options here you'll hear about surgery chemo and radiation radio surgery combination treatments and no treatment we're not afraid about talking like so many surgeons ever tell you all the options and so many chemo

show host Kevin McCullough this is a conversation you don't want to mess as they discuss a variety of important issues related to house\nI Want you to ask yourself\nHow can better nutrition improve my life\nIs often said that a medical doctors and the in the world of medicine\nVery suspicious of nutrition and nutrition is ten by nature to be somewhat suspicious of medicine and the truth is there may be need for both in wisdom is knowing the difference between the two\nMy special guest today is none other than the creator in originator of balance of nature though he'll say he didn't create it and he'll just say he discovered it Dr Douglas Howard Dr Howard it's good to have you here what'd you say on an average basis that we're under nutritional lives in this country that we don't have the nutrition in our bodies\nThat are that they were originally created with to be able to fight disease on a natural level\nOh absolutely in fact I started specializing when I came back I I was being a foreign student affairs and Pavlov Medical University in Russia for several years and when I came back I started concentrating more on the geriatric patients at that point in time [noise]\nHow many people do you know and even if you're listening how many do you know that have bleeding gums bruise easily have low energy and losing hair you know anybody like that will\nFare last aside well for me to sort of [laughter] I Know but I think everybody in my peer group an older than me I Do I Know people that have that ... those are sub clinical\nSigns is curvy ... now we think oh we get out you know I take vitamin C. pill will all of those are signs of different disease aspects and those are things we look for the first thing is as cells start to die those are things that are happening\nAnd you know it's interesting as even with balance of nature I'm not here to tell you that everybody's going to grow a full head of hair back and some people do but that's not what this product is about but hair loss slows down an even even hereditary hair loss seems to slow and I'll never forget a patient that came in once and\nShe said oh I've got to show you this and my husband I got to show you this I said OK okay and on and she showed me his head you know take your hat off took his hat off and yeah he was about ... and she goes no you don't understand she showed me the line of hair that had all grown back about two inches of it was coming back and she's I have been saving his head\nFor Twenty years and I know that head and I know where it was and now he's starting to let me you know want me to grow some of back and then another one game and she says that you've had a mayor would we had to go in another room and I said okay and she said she said a Lee\nTake your shirt off [laughter] okay [laughter] as I took a ... had this you know chest of hair and I says a nice she was even understand\nThat used to all be gray and I said well great you know and so and this man happened to have a breathing disorder and because of his meds and some other things and what and he was able to become more active and becoming more activities able to get some his meds because he was taking a balance of nature and it's all a big cycle\nBut as that those things happen then that was an unnatural graying and so when the body was able to do with it needed to do those things rivers\nAnd so there is a lot of lot of fun things\nFriends if you're interested in in knowing more about balance of nature there's people standing by right now that want to talk to you and you can call them simply an eight hundred two four six eight seven fifty one you're going to get more information about promo codes and so forth coming up in our next break but to write that number down one eight hundred two four six eight seven fifty one\nDr Howard the reason you and I are talking is because a number of months ago maybe a little more than a year ago now [noise]\nAh I called you desperately on a weekend and I said Dr Howard I have the worst flu I've ever had I've never I've never felt this way I've never suffered this way\nYou ask some questions about my ... my nutritional background I struggled with chronic bronchitis growing up there were regular chest congestion issues and sinuses and ah allergies and so forth it I was dealing with for a long time in fact when I was a kid\nUm I Would get bronchitis nearly every time the weather changed or if it went from real cold to real warm in a fast short period of time in fact this spring here in New York we had one of those days and I could tell my body want it to to go there didn't get there\nThis time but uh you you talk to me about the difference in the spark and a flame and the way infection works in the body and you said ... which is easier to put out the big roaring fire or little tiny spark and of course the answers to spark [noise]\nUm but you did I'm impressed you remember the you oh man he made such an impact or in in you you basically did say basically your flu is a big giant roaring fire right now you've gotta you've gotta get that doused but once you do or the balance of nature with the nutrition from the fruits and vegetables can't put out those sparks much more quickly\nAnd I found that to be true because then the next year and a half or so since I've been on the product I have not had any a serious re occurrence of bronchitis and when I when I feel like something starting to go up the dosage take a few more fruits and vegetables for a few days under the directions you gave me\nAnd it has worked every single time

nationally syndicated talk show host Kevin ... this is a conversation you don't want to mess\nAs they discuss a variety of important issues related to house\nI Want you to ask yourself\nHow can better nutrition improve my life\nIs often said that a medical doctors in the in the world of medicine are very suspicious of nutrition and nutrition is ten by nature to be somewhat suspicious of medicine and the truth is there may be need for both in wisdom is knowing the difference between the two\nMy special guest today is none other than the creator in originator of balance of nature though he'll say he didn't create it and he'll just say he discovered it Dr Douglas Howard Dr Howard it's good to have you here what'd you say on an average basis that we're under nutritional lives in this country that we don't have the nutrition in our bodies\nThat are that they were originally created with to be able to fight disease on a natural\nLevel Oh absolutely in fact I started specializing when I came back I I was being a foreign student affairs and Pavlov Medical University in Russia for several years and when I came back I started concentrating more on the geriatric patients at that point in time [noise]\nHow many people do you know and even if you're listening how many do you know that have bleeding gums bruise easily have low energy and losing hair you know anybody like that will\nAnd they came in and they they wanted to invest into us and so that I sit down and they said so what's your exit strategy how we can make money on this and I said\nMy exit strategy is is the epitaph on my on my tombstone is says made a difference in this world and changed lives and quality that literally that it was my answer to that after we just couldn't ever get it together and there's and Lex got the experience of seeing many times for example I'm just going to put it out there but the\nPeople wanted us to go multi level time after time and companies that wanted us to and then we would sit down 'cause yeah I mean we needed to make money and we need to be right through the bad times\nIs just as a business you started this as a way to help your patients so that business side of it was something you had to get a learning curve on and grow and kind of shepherd from day one\nThis is not something I never thought I'd be doing right I Love practice I Love people\nAnd so so as we started doing this do people started coming out of the woodwork and it's interesting that people then we would say no there's some there's a ... a major\nThere is a major health food chain that wanted to do something was but when they\nThey wanted us to change it every one every single time they want us to change it\nEvery single time they wanted us to to cheapen it because it had to be cheaper anyway there was this one multi level that\nThey were doing something and then in some third world countries and helping people and they said you know if they get to these it's better than having to to capsules is is better than nothing and they started to convince me to some things like that and so we started talking with them came down to the line\nWhen they were they had already a multi level business they were doing they just wanted to replace it with a slugging play yeah and so we found out they were paying how much how much like was it that they were paying per bottle for those vitamins a dime a dime and they were selling 'em for sixty dollars ...\nAnd and and so on and that was from the manufacture of manufacturing without making money too that's right that was their prize they weren't even making themselves\nAnd they were then they they just had a good story they were telling these people that they would be commended financially independent and blah blah blah when it came down to it they found out that over half of our costs are actually in the product [laughter] they were like well what we can't do that and where you got to do this or that and that's when they came you know how about two and a CAT scan\nIt obviously we could never make it work one of these guys that that was doing this one son he just wanted to make something work\nAnd we've and flew we had flown out with our attorney 'cause we thought something was going to work with this and everything and\nAnd and it just and then it got down okay so how are we going to make it cheaper and I was like I won't change the product I won't change what we do\nWe won't do that these are the studies I have this is why it works is how it works I won't change it we're about changing lives\nAnd if if you could sit in fact I invite you Kevin come and sit in on one of our our staff meetings and just to hear it on the phone is one thing but you should come and sit and see the tears that are set by some of our our health coaches when they tell the stories of who they help to this week\nThat is what our staff meetings are about ... they talk about their successes\nAnd we share them and we and that's what we are and so any ways that we actually produce our own product we've tried we have tried to to get it out because we we thought it'd be easier working with government entities and things that that it would be easier to do that way\nTheir quality could not pass our standard right we wouldn't send it out we literally would not send it out I said you know give me those bottles I'll take them home and eat them but I'm not going to send those out to people\nThe the fact that there's such a high standard in the a product that's in your capsule and the\nContent of what's in every bottle a is really unparalleled and so it's one of those things friends where when you get in and Dr Howard says this and the commercials on a regular basis\nBut when you when you when you pop open the plastic live the bottle and then you pull the the sealed\nFoil seal off [noise] if you don't get a whiff when you open the fruits of very strong fruit and it just it just walked right up to your house and the same with the with the veggies or if you don't ... then you're not you're not taking balance of nature\nIf you don't get that smell if you don't think that there you can take one of the capsule and open it up and taste it yeah I I challenged with anything else out there and you won't get it we don't use and we don't fill up with things like like\nWell and the thing is you've picked thirty one fruits and vegetables as the combination of this all base going back to our previous discussion on the chemistry of what those specific fruits and vegetables mind you take the three\nAnd they work in combination how they work in combination and you take those three and three every day you're going to be taking the equivalent of ten servings\nOf a salad made of those thirty one fruits and vegetables now I don't know how much salad you're currently are ingesting but if you're not eating ten plate fools of it with these thirty one specific fruits and vegetables in it you're gonna miss the nutrition that isn't the compact form of these caps with nothing but whole food\nAnd when you say whole food it's skin it's it's see it's it's all the stuff that that in that food when feasible yet right or example is the whole apple it's the whole pineapple now we take the skin off of some things right 'cause that's not necessarily the edible\nPortion right [laughter] but yeah every edible part is there and it's very important and we're the only ones who do that we have to have that made special for\nA while and you have to do it under your control because again if you try to outsource that than even the producers will try to cheapen the process and you can't do it can't it just doesn't\nYou can't run the risk friends I Hope that this has been informative and helpful because you're not going to find anything anywhere like balance of nature you're not going to find stuff that says potent that's as nutritious that has the uh the overwhelming healing composite a benefit of what's in there\nAnd that's why you need to call that number we've been giving you a eight hundred two four six eight seven fifty one one eight hundred two four six eight seven fifty one\nI Know that education is of huge importance to Dr Howard\nUh you you spend your whole life pursuing\nKnowledge on these things and you try to break it down in and help people understand that balance of nature dot com\nIs where you can find all the stuff that they've written on uh the uh the product in testimonials there's so much there is a really great website you should check it out you can also order

seven ten W O o voice of New York Hi\nHit sixty five and cloudy at seven o'clock good evening I'm no one Laden Brett Kavanaugh is the newest member of the Supreme Court he was sworn in just a short time ago this afternoon the Senate confirmed the judge in a razor close vote that was presided over by vice president Mike Pence\nAnd she was seen by a surgeon so rubber ... started eating ice was the name became caught us can be found the cancer went to a surge and that surgeon cut out part of the cold and it found two of sixty eight lymph nodes positive [noise]\nShe told me that she had no cat scans and no PET scans before that surgery that I Would say wow wow oh wow a while\nBecause generally if you ask me I think people should know what they have which is a biopsy of the cancer and where it is before they started doing things [noise]\nWell my guess is the surgeon was so hot to cut on her that he cut on her without doing a scan she said\nAnd then she started came all the ... excuse me the chemo doctors started giver came over there give me a ...\nBecause there are some studies show if you have a colon cancer lymph node positives that'd be stage three that people who take chemo live longer than those who don't take it doesn't mean keep up for the rest of your life it means a short course of chemo\nAnd there's a big difference I'm not talking about came all the rest of your life or whatever that means a short course of came over to try to kill the last cancer so well there's some studies show benefits and she started the chemotherapy and then\nNext thing you know she gets a CAT scan finally she gets a CAT scan she didn't get a CAT scan before the surgery she told me she didn't get a CAT scan before the cable she told me finally after the chemo she has a CAT scan and voila there's cancer in the liver\nYou imagine that you went through the surgery to do a scan through and through cable into a scan finally after the chemo she gets a skin showing liberal metastases and then the surgeon opens up\nAnd and cuts out to liver cancers to liberate tumors these are metastases or what is a metastases metastases as a cancer the travels from one part of the body to another [noise]\nSo in this case it traveled from the cold doesn't remember it was already lived also founded traveled from the coal into the lymph nodes making his stage three [noise]\nAnd then to the liver making his stage four [noise] so then the doctors at the super duper ... remember she's already been getting chemo there then they stuck a pump into pump it came on tool ever and give him came over to the liver and came onto the vein\nAnd she got nearly two years of chemo and the cancer just kept on growing it kept on grow and grow and grow and grow growing [laughter]\nAnd she was getting cancer marker so they were doing the right test she was getting PET scans and see a those are the right tests [noise]\nSee a is a cancer marker a blood test and this blood test tends to correspond with the amount of cancer in the body and she had a PET scan then she went to a doctor shut the pet scan showed the cancer marker\nAnd the doctor said well the cancer markers don't mean anything and the pet scans show some shadows don't worry about that everything looks okay membership that two years or chemo multiple surgeries surgery on a colon surgery on the lymph node surgery on the liver\nCame out came on the van came on the liver and her doctor tells her this cancer marker doesn't mean anything in the pet scan doesn't mean anything and then she comes to me well why do you think she comes to me well most likely she comes to me because she's concerned about her body in what this all means\nAnd she comes to me with her two sisters in his late afternoon it looks like they're going to go out and have dinner afterwards [noise]\nAnd so I reviewed the reports and found that the C. E. S. was going up to ten point seven the normalcy a cancer markers up three\nIn her been around for someone from before and four point to up to ten point seven\nAnd a doctor told her this rise in a cancer marker which measures the activity of a cancer\nThis could be a cancer marker rise doesn't mean anything well if it doesn't mean anything why is that Dr doing it wisely poking vein wise you spending our money to do the task ... doing the test if it doesn't mean anything why\nAnd then the pet scan he says or doesn't show anything well\nI had the pet scan on the report it said the cancers back in the liver right where she had the surgery right where she had chemotherapy infused into her liver cancer is right back there I said look the cancer markers up the pet scan showing recurrent cancer\nThis is Rick current cancer and then I said oh well it's even proven more that's called the radiologist and but now it was after hours that I got a hold of the radiologists at the super duper famous place\nAnd the radio just got to ... and I said well I got to report on this patient and tell me about this report and they punched in the computer and you had the pictures and the pet scan showed increased activity in the liver [noise] exactly where the surgeon cut on her liver before\nAnd the doctor said well this is recurrent cancer and the patient hurting me speaking and heard him speak gene in the I asked the doctor the radio just to read this report at the super duper big place could be anything else\nAnd they said well she had surgery recently it might be but otherwise this is most likely cancer he said\nAnd then I said well she hadn't had a knee surgery recently that surgery was about two years ago [laughter] number one and number two\nShe has a rising cancer marker he said well this is the current cats are and I can tell you that the patient and her two sisters were shocked because they've been going to the super duper famous place for two years trusting the doctors to do the right thing trusting trusting trusting to give ... came up chemo\nAnd then when the cancer marker goes up and the pet scan goes abnormal the doctor says well doesn't mean anything well it means a lot so what does exactly I mean when the cats are Margaret goes up\nWhen the cancer market goes up let's say if it goes up once maybe it's celebratory air so we can repeat it and we offered to repeat it for this woman [noise]\nAnd then I said well what about the pet scan will the pet scan becoming abnormal is a worrisome sign that the cancers back [noise]\nAnd then she said but the doctor told me it's just a scar shadow and I said well that something else\nIf the cancer markers going up in the pet scans becoming abnormal this doctor who's been giving a chemotherapy for two years don't remember the average chemo is ten thousand dollars a month or two years of Kmart talking about a quarter million dollars of chemo that you and I and everyone else is paying for\nAnd it's not working and this doctor who you trust or did trust to infuse chemicals or poisons into your body\nIs now not telling you an explanation of why the cancer markers going up and why the pet scan is abnormal and there's only one answer and that is that the cancers back\nAnd the doctor who you've paid a quarter million dollars that famous super duper hospital is not telling you the facts and I said we can prove it we can get another ca today and we offer to get a new ca and this lady\nToday and we did it and now it's Thirteen it's gone from four to tend to Thirteen so it wasn't a laboratory era when it went up the tab it was a sudden the way station going from lowered a hired is still going higher and that's what she has and the sad fact is number one\nShe had lots of tests but they were always done and they were done so that she couldn't benefit from the ... she got a CAT scan after the surgery after the chemo rather than to know exactly the stage of the cancer nationally\nShe then was found to have liver metastases and got surgery\nAnd that certainly doesn't work the cancer came back in the same spot and the chemo into the vein of the liver doesn't work and the chemo into the vein of the body does it work it doesn't work the chemotherapy didn't work the surgery didn't work she has returned cancer\nAnd her doctors not being straight with her the doctors not telling this woman the truth the truth is that the cancers back and all that treatment doesn't work [laughter] maybe it's a shame to maybe some barest\nBut he should tower the truth\nAnd that's why she came to thirty for Broadway she came here to learn the truth to enter the fanciest dancey super duper pooper scooper hospital but they couldn't tower the truth but there are options available for her like radio surgery\nShe's had chemo it hasn't worked she's had surgery doesn't works at an infusion do\nArterial a chemo and to the liver doesn't work and that's the beauty of about radio surgery that we're able to take a patient like her\nAnd treat cancer but said deliver the longer the breast of the kidney or the bladder or the prostate or the Boehner the live load and offer highly successful treatment\nAnd unlike chemotherapy which has low chances of success that often in this case to even work at all with us we have about a Ninety percent success rate in the liver and elsewhere [noise] we are the first\nOf America do body rid of surgery when I brought radio started to America everyone's at all but blah we don't need that well sure they don't need it because they want to give came or surgery or standard radiation and they didn't understand the benefits of a non invasive highly successful\nPrecise dream and focused on the cancer and this is the work that we do first of America First in the western hemisphere first to New York\nThe heart of New York city at thirty eight street where we work for you we don't take money from drug companies pharmacies pharmaceutical industry will work for a president of a hospital says oh Dr Lederman you better treat ten thousand patients today or you're going to lose your job\nHappens doctors who work for the hospitals they look at how many patients should treat we don't have that because we\nWork for you the patient\nSo when you come here there's not a conflict of interest with a hospital without work for the hospital and all the conflicts the president of the hospital drug companies the pharmaceutical companies we work for you and can report honestly to you\nJust reported to this woman this woman with colon cancer spread deliver shed chemotherapy they documented itself themselves that they came out that doesn't work that came in and work a cancer is growing and deliver the cancer was\nCausing the CPA the cancer marker to go up and then when the cancer market went up they said oh it doesn't mean anything well why did they do the test if it didn't mean anything\nWhy did they do the pet scan if they weren't going to look at the results why couldn't they tower the truth is they have the strength to inject poison into her body chemotherapy and poisons in her body though they have the strength to tell her the truth that the cancer is back the chemo doesn't work and you should go see someone else\nCan go see a doctor Lederman go to treatment that doesn't rely on chemotherapy\nGo gives treatment that has pinpointed precise\nWhy do you think we brought story tactic body radio started to America because so often there's so many people like the sixty year old woman with her two sisters who came in\nAnd she had two years that came out it just doesn't work it didn't work they can give as much chemo as they want it's not working the Kansas getting worse than coming back\nWhereas we have the Ninety
