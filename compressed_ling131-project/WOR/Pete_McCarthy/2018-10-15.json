but it's also with um a mole separate bowls a female half and the male half\nThe male have is going to the front of the real\nFemale is the back part around and on the male front on the other side you have holes on line ... ... holes who had a ... a screw hold that thread it and one of the most that you have\nA lot of pigs and a\nLot of holes that are no three as of ... through that goes to all of us out\nWith a ... male sad as it and also have a gasket that last along the edge\nBehind a lemon pigs when these two peas are molded the wheel assembly itself is loaded onto both pieces separately and when that is done you have a course where you're bringing a to piece together sandwich in a tire\nBy ... the lemonade pay will come together and you put the both in their ... six years the tie you owned a room\nAnd one's debt is compress the ah the gas itself was compressed air from escaping anyone can do is appropriate age anyone is simple mhm and a key issue for running back and forth to work

Trump's mhm cars motorcycles and buses mhm\nAnd I I just like the act now invented it is capable of various arrangements and it's not limited by ... manufacturers or materials used the aim about system it's about a new and improved tire ma'am has all and bandages and none of the disadvantages up typical rams\nThe construction about we'll assembly will equal or see or exceed the strength and integrity of current ram systems law allowing case of extraction and replacement so wouldn't you want to ... on our rooms\n[laughter] and I guess one question quick sure so don't write you told me the story of how you came up with is so funny [laughter] you want to go through that again\nRight LA ma'am I'm it started off I had this um particular town car and um it was several days I was trying to pass this a hole in the ... and I just couldn't get that thing path with the plug\nAnd I was frustrated so one day I got up and I was on my way to work now we only had one kind of family so that didn't take me to ... work she cheated call\nSo I'm lost that and I look at the time is is flat I said you know no problem I got a spare time to cook so I look and get to spare time flight\nSo I've had enough and tired to get to the gas station and this and the time so I get to the gas station was about two or three miles from home and ... was Bruce [laughter]\n[laughter] I said I said I I drove back on the flat tax\nOf court frustrated and lay for I got my bicycle pumped well and I pumped up enough to get me to another gas was ... out by got I got the um I did when I came off work and there's something that'd be done with this\nAnd I was I sit on my step and I just came to me I said well if I can start changing time myself at home and just stop plugged it up you know you get a a hole in the attack the title good still not just the um the circular around but um that's the sort of [noise]\nSo uh so so I had the opportunity to see the as the room in in the waiting area before the show and it really is a an incredible invention so what it is is if you can imagine\nA attire room and that's cut in half down the center so you have a back and and the front and center and those two pieces can be joined together\nAnd there's a gasket and there were they joined together and you can put it takes you can you have alignment pegs to make sure that everything winds up right menu sandwich this between your tire and\nRussia are given a slush and no grooves ended is like a ...\nAnd so lush normally if you want to change the tires on your car you have to go to the gas station which may not be convenient\nAnd they have to have a special tire machine that wrenches the tire off the room\nAnd so this invention eliminates the need to go all that to the gas station all of it you have to and you can swap out your tires at home you can replace that you can go to auto zone pick up your own tire bring it back to your garage or just you can separate the rooms\nYou can replace the put it on the new tire and you can close it up yourself and you don't have to figure out some way to get this high retire and room to a gas station\nTo have it haven't fixed recession and so it's a very simple easy way to improve your uh\nInto the swap out tires and um another great thing about the invention to is that if you wanted to change rooms styles right you could do that you could have different room styles and it would be very easy to switch the rooms styles without having the yeah the ... the front side\nRight you only need to buy one hand one hand the new half\nAnd you can get a different room style to it and you can change that if you want to there's a lot of car people out there who really like to swap out as are there different rooms cancer so it's really an extraordinary step forward and I would encourage all of our listeners to go to the website ... dot com\nAnd look at passage to profit and we'll have a video posted there of a do Roy's invention and I think any car aficionados gonna love this\nSo Richard you have four tires sitting in the garage waiting for the tires on the track\nThat out that they can you can change the south so I mean\nThat's a great point because those are snow tires right and I'm In order to to get them swapped out I have to load them into the truck and drive him to the gas station and pay some somebody to take all the tires off the rooms and\nLots of times if you have a broken room or something like that too or a bent room and it doesn't keep the air it's a lot easier I think if you use a ... system right certainly\nIs only done
