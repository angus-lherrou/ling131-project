his face and part of the muscle is removed and distorted his face it as a guy in the mouth and well ... where the surgeon\nOperated under surgeon never told him he didn't need that surgery could have the surgery but he also could have told them paying go after Lederman undo pinpoint treatment had a neck cancers respond very well to our treatment they often usually melts away where this big mess\nAnd well the cancer gr right back where the surgeon caught so now not only to the form of the and this appearance of difficulty with his mouth and there's a high but the cancer came back right in the middle of it and he went back to the same surgeons they want to cut\nOff his face again even more and he declined he's had enough enough of this failed surgery enough of the failed treatment and he came here and remember the ... most of his right face whatever was left and all the other area\nAnd then he came to me we staged them up and we found a second cancer under the chin the cancer already traveled so not only was a surgery of failure and all the surgery distorted his face and they'll never get his face back cancer ... did not respond to the surgery and the cancer traveled\nSo

can start learning a skill that can make money and not have to sit there and think about a second job again tell but later\nBut one of the ways I look at this and I get this analogy all the time when people are just simply trading one direction or they're waiting for the markets always go up it's like a car imagine that you were told you can get in a car tomorrow and you can drive somewhere but you can't put the car and reverse\nYou're gonna go in a lot of circles eventually going to get there but you know it's a lot of time energy and money getting to the same place if you simply had all the tools to get you there faster so a lot of what I'm seeing our students learning the first time is it there be coming\nTo ... ... they don't care if it goes up down or sideways as long as the markets are moving they can learn how to make money and what a lot of them are seeing right now is they can create more freedom for themselves because they're able to make money no matter where the markets go\nYeah absolutely and I love I Love the analogy of the car there's so many so many other analogy that we could pull into this that in in I always say in real life you know outside of the are investing life in our normal everyday life\nThere's no way we buy a car that didn't go on to reverse right but so many times we find ourselves in investments that only have one direction or one avenue where they can profit\nYou know it's it's the same thing you go back to our you know go back to high school education and where was your stock picking class where it was how to balance a checkbook class right the law to check it out right I just dated myself victory over there but it is it's true though I mean we we really didn't have\nThat stuff and so we're left to to rely on the quote unquote professionals really guide us through this process\nWhere unfortunately they make a commission off of these transactions and I say unfortunately kind of tongue in cheek there because\nThat's okay with me that they make a commission that's\nThat's what they do for a living you know real estate brokers make a commission when they sell real estate so stockbrokers should naturally make a commission when they sell stocks\nBut when we buy a home it is up to it was up to the individual to make sure that they're buying the right home for them in the right market place in the right area that the right payment the right everything it's up to the person to do it\nThe broker just completes the transaction and unfortunately it's up to the person to also make sure that they're making the appropriate decision when it comes to their investing but when it really boils down to about Ninety nine percent of the world hasn't ... they spend more time analyzing the menu when they go out to dinner\nThen they do analyzing what investments to to select\nIt it just puts us behind the eight ball and it's something that I think if we did a quick give away with a few more of these passes we could probably make a dent in and help people start making better investment decision I think it's a great idea let's do it All right well right now I've got a half day class coming up in your area

they're happy\nAre you ready to start living the life you've dreamed of learn more visit us on line at O T a Wall Street dot com that's O T a Wall Street dot com\nWelcome back and if you're just tuning in Missouri Jacobs director of instructor development and top instructor at a trading company really shed some light on consistent returns in the market\nSo one of my favorite topics though talking about consistency in the market\nSo many times I'll run into different traders different investors and they've had some success they've had some success in the market but they really had a hard time duplicating it and that ends up being the key really in anything that we do is how can we make money consistently how can we make money over and over and the financial markets are no different it's all about that consistent approach\nBeing able to make money as the markets are going up being able to make money as the markets are going down and also being able to make money as the markets are going sideways we need to be generating income whether it's income for today or income for tomorrow in this segment we're going to spend a little bit more time\nTalking about the income side of things but whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time listening or maybe you've been with us for the whole show get excited the best is yet to come and learn a lot of our listeners like we were talking about are are are looking to replace their income with trading investing some are looking to upgrade their lifestyles with a little additional income\nAnd and you can even call it maybe that that supplemental side that you were talking about a few minutes ago and and some are looking for this to go kind of beyond that supplemental and be their primary source of income\nAnd I've even heard people say that they're number one goal is to be able to fire their boss now now whether they're going to or not you know being in that position where you can make that call you know that starts to be that primary source of income but what are some of the key things that you guys work with students who are looking to supplement or they're looking to even build this is a primary source of income is a great\nQuestion right you know what I find with a lot of our students they first come into the academy thinking they want to make a lot of money when reality what they're looking for is freedom we've been doing this for over Twenty years we have over four hundred and fifty thousand students now in the academy and what we find over and over again especially coming to this class\nIs that they are really looking for freedom as I mentioned that could be they want to leave a job they don't like they want to spend more time with their families\nThey really are looking to take a vacation make people now are so nervous about going on vacation because they'd lose their jobs if they even took a day or two officer we're living in this constant stream of stress right now and what I'm finding is a lot of our students who come in thinking they want to make a lot of money\nIt's really about that freedom and it's funny a guy named Adam was one of my students\nAnd he actually did just what you said he wanted to come in here he was miserable at work and he finally got to a point we could trade and actually go into his boss and say I have enough\nAnd I had enough think about that to be comfortable enough so if all this did right now is bring you one really profitable trade wouldn't it be worth just coming in and exploring the opportunities here\nAbsolutely just kind of checking things out and seeing what it can do for you and that whenever we talk about the half day classes whenever we talk about anything even at the half the class we always talk about risk versus reward\nAnd really specifically when you tie it back to the half the class you know they have to classes or three hours long and say if you end up winning a a set of tickets to one of these you really investing three hours worth of your time and what if\nWhat if that three hours worth of your time was able to show you how you really could replace your income or how maybe you could raise your income by ... percentage so that you could have that financial freedom that Larry it was just talking about and that's really\nKind of the key to all this and you know what you were touching on was was the freedom side and and really those conversations go go fairly deep with ... with individuals one on one where you say you know what are you looking to accomplish this I go I Want to make an extra thousand bucks a month and\nThat's a pretty quick conversation but then you say why\n... why do you want to make an extra thousand bucks and now that financial freedom conversation starts where you know you ... it's a it's a nice detailed process of well you know what my kids do this or I Want to do that and there's all these goals that they want to start accomplishing\nAnd part of what you need usually to accomplish those is a little more time one of the ways that helps you have a little more time is to have income coming from somewhere else having that supplemental\nSide of income you know where there's lots of different ways where we can build out the supplemental income it can be through a passive channel they could be through an active channel it can be through commodities that could be dropped as it could be their stocks but\nOne of the things about it is is we ... is one of these you always talk about I guess I should say there is is how multiple streams of income are are really kind of crucial throughout this whole process and you know the the average millionaire I think has has five or greater\nStreams of income and so when you think about like that that is that those those pieces supplementing each other if one goes away it's really no big deal you just get strategic and you build out another one now it's also one of the reasons why the the word job Jay obese stands for just over broke because if we just have one stream of income\nAnd it goes away well we're we're in her city right we're in stress city we're we're we're scrambling hopefully we got\nSo the savings to buy us little time but it ended up being that kind of that that that downward spiral or even just stuck in a rat race so to speak of well if we lose our job hopefully we have some savings we use our savings while we find another job and then we just getting another job and doesn't the cycle probably just continue\nWho are really out there trading they do have their retirement accounts and and when I talked to our students I'm hearing a lot of people say you know number one they either don't have enough money to retire on you know our number to those that do they're not quite sure really how to continue the growth\nAnd to protect the downside right and that's really that point you were getting at a before he took the break and so I'd love to give you kind of giving you the floor here to take that back over voter some of the things you and your instructor team are doing with investors to help make sure they have income for retirement\nAnd the number one mistake that most people may cause they think they can do this on their own then they wind up coming back and realizing they need the education so we start talking to our students about is how\nThey can start creating a strategy for success when it comes to the retirement right now you know it's funny when the market started to go down this week a lot of my friends call me and they started going what does this mean they started getting all nervous now one student\nEmailed me and said Larry do you see this is a bad thing in fact\nMost people who know what they're doing they're elated that this is starting to happen most people waiting ten years\nFor another market correction why because statistically the markets always tend to correct about every ten years or so last major when we had was obviously in two thousand eight here we are in two thousand Eighteen so what's now becoming more important than ever\nIs it took people about six years to recover from the last correction\nPeople out there listening if you don't have six years right now well you're planning to retire\nYou don't have anything saved right now you need to figure out how to create a plan to help protect you and a lot of our students come in the door\nReally nervous about I don't have enough money to start well you know what they're doing right it's pretty fascinating they're starting to learn how to trade other asset types like futures in ... and they're saving that money from trading and they're starting to fund their retirement accounts\nSo again a lot of people first thing they always say is like the mortgage I've got the kids' college up on\nTheir retirement always comes last so we start to teach her students read out the gate\nThat they can come up with a plan they understand most importantly\nWhat you are in need is because a lot of people the one size fits all does not work when it comes to retirement you can't just do this you first have to figure out what your needs are learn how to manage that need most importantly how to learn some really important risk management and how to protect that money\nAnd then at the end of the day you'll have enough to retire on based on what you need not someone else who's telling you what you need\nYeah and you're talking about the kind of the cycles with the markets go through the big ups and the big downs and we do generally have a crash about every and we call them crashes but we do generally have a nice big drop in the markets about every ten years\nAnd one of the things about that is if you go back and look at um how often\nThey're forty fifty sixty percent drops and so kind of that average uh that we can expect is about fifty percent if you go back into two thousand and eight and you kind of measure that you got about a fifty percent drum Becky fifty eight percent about fifty eight percent you go back into their early two thousand fifty say the same thing\nAnd so if we come to here and we say OK here's here that's kind of what we can expect again that's kind of the new normal\nThat the thing that I went through with my father about ah we had a conversation about this you know back in about two thousand and eight\nOr you know we're talking about drops in the market we're talking about drops and accounts and and one of the things that we're we're kind of walking through was\nIf somebody had a fifty dollar if somebody had a hundred thousand dollar account\nAnd they lost fifty thousand and they lost fifty percent will they lost fifty thousand so now they're account value is at fifty thousand that happened in one year\nAnd that drop happened I think it was fourteen months total rights that happened in pretty much just a year it went down when they take that average rate of return on the way up and let's just be very very generous and let's say somebody is averaging ten percent on the Web\nThat's ten years just to get back to break even 'cause when you take a hundred and you turn it into fifty\nTo take fifty and turn it into a one hundred requires a one hundred percent return on our money and so one of the conversation we're talking about was how long does it take the average person surely even get back to break even after going through a big catastrophic drop like that\nSo one of the scariest things right now is that people just don't have a plan that don't know what to do they haven't been educated and so unless you're really sitting there thinking about this and say to yourself fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me and\nAlbert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes was the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again it's amazing how many people are not willing to spend a little bit of money to get themselves educated to invest in themselves\nInstead of taking this big roller coaster ride and think about it Ryan going back to two thousand and eight if you knew when to get out of the market and locked in profit\nAnd then in two thousand nine you were sitting in cash it could've been one of the greatest time of your life right now so we had a three hundred percent increase since two thousand nine yet most people had no money because they lost it all in the correction\nAbsolutely one of the things we can do to help a few people really start to identify where to get in and where to get out where to protect where to grow as you get 'em out to one of the half day classes you ready for a little give away let's do it right now we've got half the class coming up in your area and a half the cost of ... going to see exactly that how to generate more income how to keep that retirement account growing\nHow do I identify these turning points up down or sideways\nSo you'll know when to buy and you could know when to sell you could you could go back to the old\nKnow when to hold them know when to fold 'em type of the conversation on just a second you have a chance to win a set of passes or one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving right now is a great time to pull over included with your passes is going to be our professional insiders kit that is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nThe professional insider kitten makes it so you get started right now ... through twenty when you get a call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three\nIf you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com\nAnd see if you can score some passes there\nNow Larry I always I always said everybody when and I tried to say it on the show as much as I can well you have two dollars or two million dollars adapted classes where you really get to see exactly what it takes to really get that money working for you and you were talking about it earlier as far as having our money working smarter for us and that's just doing the right things with our money\nYou know we've always also been talking about the market's being at all time highs and the risks that we have in there and then my dentist office I bring this up a lot on the show but it just it's so true inside of the financial markets\nThat might Dennis off as a kid shout out to Dr are buckle there's a plaque on the wall and every examination room where it says\nFor don't worry about your teeth and they'll go away you know being that same situation here that unfortunately has been proven true time after time but it's don't worry about your money don't worry about your retirement account\nGo away you know well let's just think about what people are doing right now in this moment we've been told that every two weeks is supposed to be investing in an Ira or some type of retirement plan which is great and then nothing against that\nBut what people are not paying attention to is where they're investing that money and for the last two years people investing all time highs\nAnd so think about it you're in an all time high\nWeek after week that's investing your money and\nAll of a sudden the market corrects well that correction is going to impact the first amount of money or the last amount of money that you basically have invested into\nSo now you've put majority or money in the market the last two or three years when it's been higher and higher and it takes a tremendous fall and this is why we said it earlier the market falls three times fast and then it goes up\nAnd as a result people see that fifty percent evaporation of wealth\nAnd that immediate sea of seeing that freaks out now let's take it a step further when the market goes down that dramatically like it did in two thousand eight what's next the loss of jobs the four pictures and housing dividend cuts vivid and cuts so all these things\nHave a greater impact than most people believe and yet there are people out there that continue every single day to roll the dice and take a chance and say this won't happen to me\nYeah there's a huge risk out there and that is a huge need for multiple streams of income and not just today but multiple streams of income throughout our life throughout every stage of our life\nTo create that stability and one of the things we can do to really help people get kind of jumped started\nEnded his multiple streams of income lifestyle is to get them out to one of the half the classes we still got a few passes here we can give away let's do it right now I've got to have to class go up in your area that the classes were you'll see exactly what it takes really keep that retirement account growing\nMake sure we have income for today income for tomorrow and really generating and focusing on building out those multiple streams of income when the second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of pastors doing these half their classes switch phones ready and if you are driving now is a good time to pull over\nIncluding with your passes is going to be a professional insiders kid now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation ... capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now\nThe ... century twenty when he did a call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nWe've got to take a quick break we'll be right back Larry what do you have\nA force next let's talk about the lifestyle of a trade or a lot of our students are so happy they can move out of where they were to where they are now let's talk about what they do my favorite part\nOf every movie is going to see the editors cats that's what we're going to do when we come back from this free back the curtain on the lifestyle of a traitor right\n\nWhat I find with our students Ryan is they're not\nFrom a certain way or education or background\nThere simply people that are ... and they're passionate about learning something new again I mentioned this earlier the number one mistake the most will make with their money if they think they can do this on their own and then they'll go to the education later well that's the wrong thing to do one creates bad habits\nAnd number two they never do go back to the education 'cause they blown up the money they had\nSo what do good students do I talk to them all the time number one\nThey realized in the twenty first century that they can take a laptop anywhere in this world right now it doesn't matter because as long as they have an Internet connection and their laptop\nThey can trade all over the world in fact we had a student named B or and he's in San Diego and a lot of times are students feel it's too hard they can't do it well not only has ... done this and his left his job which is exactly what everybody wants to do right we want to quit a job you don't love to do something we do love\nHe's become a excellent trader and he's also now started funding as whites real estate business\nSo the two of them are doing something together\nSpending more time together spending more time on vacations in family but the important thing here Ryan is it they're loving what they're doing and there's so many people out there and if you're one of those people hopefully you can see how you can benefit from just learning a skill that can give you the freedom that you desire\nYeah absolutely and it's it's kind of interesting as ... as we're sitting here talking about and the lifestyle of a traitor I'd just literally received a text message from a dear dear friend of mine\nAnd it just popped up on my phone and he was actually somebody who got me started in trading he was one of the first people who said this is how you open an account these are the steps you go through it very very first conversations these just become a lifelong dear friend of mine and he's a huge ski bum he lives up in Salt lake you just ski travels around it as a great time\nHe just texted me with a picture of snow ski saying hey can you use these this season or should I take him to the ... because if I go up to Salt Lake I usually just bum a pair of skis from him rather than the hall and mine around\nIt it's just there's just so much freedom that can come with it and it and it really ends up just pulling down to a couple of basic steps a couple of basic as you were saying changes or actions that need to be taking because I think it's very critical it's very important it's it's very powerful once we do understand\nThat that the poor is just a state of mind right that passing over opportunities repeatedly\nAnd it's something that can be really easily changed just by stepping out of our comfort zone right just by stepping out of our comfort zone and doing something different we talk a lot about kind of cliche statements on the show here but it's because they're so true and they're so useful and it goes back to if we've always done if we always do what we've done will always get what we got in\nAnd if we're completely satisfied with where we are then\nThen great let's continue to do what made us so happy in the first place\nBut if we want a little bit more for trying to cook it created a little more income if we're trying to create a little more freedom if we have a specific goal\nThey were trying to accomplish that we haven't been able to get to we have to make the necessary changes and that's one of the life lessons that my grandfather shared with me my whole life growing up he would hold up his five fingers and I would have to ... the first one is no your business the second one is be converted\nAnd that converted one as a youngster I honestly didn't understand what it meant and as I got involved with trading and I really started to go kind of soul searching down is is this something that's gonna work for me am I going to be able to do this\nThat converted when I started to realize was make the necessary changes the necessary metamorphosis do what's necessary\nAnd and and in the beginning and that was the one I always kind of didn't put as much emphasis on when I was like ten eleven twelve even Eighteen Nineteen twenty you know but then as I really started into my my grown up years I started realizing how be converted that pointer finger of the five to me became the most\nIt's valuable because if we don't make the necessary changes we're never going to accomplish that kind of outlier goal that were after that one of the things we can do to help a few people get started with this we still got a few tickets we can give away let's change some lives right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area\nThey have to ... ... exactly where it takes to really take control of the finances really take control your retirement account generate more income inside of the market's really live that life drafter and just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of pass was one of these half the class was to get your bones writing if you are driving now is a good time to pulled over\nIncluded with your passes is going to be our professional insiders kit now this professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now ... century twenty when he did a call now and reserved those seats\nThe number is eight eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up\nBeing colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nNow Larry one of the things that I always like to say and I said earlier on the show is doesn't matter if you have two dollars or two million dollars it's all about getting that money working for you and really getting it to generate that income so you can live the lifestyle you can reach the financial freedom goals that you're after\nBut what are some of the things are what are some of the other kind of examples I Know you have your bags and bags loads of these of these examples of our students that you've talked to that we're in one place there now and another well the first thing we always understand here is that with\nTrading it's simply a transfer money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing\nAnd what's really sad is people will get themselves stuck think about this time right now people can sit in front of a television for hours versus going out there and learning a skill that can help them and every year and you know we're coming up to the holiday season again we started seeing all these Jim commercials again right\n'cause here comes resolution time and one of those things I hear are students say over and over again is beside wishing having had more time was\nThis was the year I Want to get out of debt and I want to turn my finances around and what's amazing is how many students\nCome in through the clashes that we're doing right now and simply imagine what their life would be like if they can learn a skill to help them generate more money\nAnd that's the key it's about doing something taking action and getting out there to change your current situation again if you're a coach shovel and something that you are really interested in learning how to do there is no limitations here in fact one of my students June\nShe actually came to my class and she said all she wanted to do is play golf in Costa Rica and so she started realizing that by learning how to trade gave her the time to do that I said it's great just sent me a postcard and she did and she said she was trading 'cause that's a whole nother piece of it\nPeople go on vacation Ryan right and they decorate the vacation they're making money to pay for it and so I asked you or your training before after golf she goes\nBefore of course and I love that of course\nWe're talking with a group of students just a little while ago that did a big trip through Europe and I remember him saying\nYou know where we were trading out in Europe and we made as much money out on our trip is we actually spent on the trip so it's kinda fun to come back from a trip with a with a with a flat balance or even being up after having a great after having a great time\nAnd that's the thing is it doesn't matter where you are you just have to have an Internet connection doesn't matter where you are and it doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter what your background is it's all about just proactive we identify good opportunities and that's really what we introduced you to insure you exactly what it takes how to do that\nInside of the half the class and we are pretty much at the end of the show but before we end where you say we do another give away\nYeah let's give at least ten more people the opportunity to get some tickets here\nOh right right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area and a half the class is ... exactly what it takes\nTo really reached that financial freedom generating more income in the markets like I always say if you're why is big enough you will find out how how is out at the half the class you know just a second you're going to have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these have to classes to get your bones writing if you're driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluding with your passes as our professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nLessons on topics like Hansen your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional insider kitten makes it so you get started right now ... when he did a call now and reserve those seats\nThe number is eight eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up being\nColors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ...

[noise]\nI Want to re introduce you to one of the program\nSo we have here uh Gary Goldberg financial services it's one that you have never seen at your own from ah you're sure you wherever you are doing business they don't have a program like the one I'm going to tell you about because we created it here we trade market here\nAnd it is known as the G G fs tactical exchange traded funds strategy\nIt's our ATF program exchange traded funds now for those who don't know what he ts are they are index funds they trade on the stock exchange they um are giving you an investor an opportunity to kind of slice and dice what sectors of the market you want to be in\nBut do you yourself know which sectors of the market you should be in so we developed\nA program here which is driven by a software program that we created\nAnd this ATF strategy are tactical ATF strategy tries to achieve some long term capital appreciation because we invest primarily in a diversified portfolio of different exchange traded funds\nSo we do is at a probably a couple of thousand each ts we will select or track sixty of them and of those sixty what we do is we isolate twelve of the sixty\nOf the twelve we then determine which parts of the market\nYou should have your money and so for those twelve I can tell you our core holdings we don't trade them those will be the S. and P. five hundred the Russell two thousand and international ATF so put those on the left side of your mind they stay as core holdings\nBe other eight are dynamic\nBy that I mean they're in different sectors of the market and we developed a software program that tracks the flows of institutional money where money is going run institutions pension funds hedge funds into what sectors of the market and what sectors of the market is it leaving\nAnd every night we get a report where are the flows of money from institutions heading or leaving\nWe then rate those eight that I just described into a rating system of a B C and D keep in mind the aid that we choose for you\nAre going to be a rated\nAnd if in a falls to a de because we get a notice every night as to what's going on with the flows of money if it goes from an eight or D we sell it the following morning\nIf it falls to uh see will hold it for up to thirty days and see if there's a recovery if it falls to a beat goes on our radar screen and when something is sold it goes to cash\nSo to summarize we isolate eight sectors of the market those eight sectors are computer driven based upon flows of money from institutions\nIf money is going in we will get a bye signal if money is leaving will get a cell signal if something gets sold it goes to cash and we wait for another a rated exchange traded funds to appear\nSo it removes the emotion of selling\nIt removes the emotion of buying it isolates various sectors of the market that are attractive or an attractive and we've had a lot of interest from our clients in that particular program if you want to learn about our tactical exchange traded fun strategy\nOr tactical E.
