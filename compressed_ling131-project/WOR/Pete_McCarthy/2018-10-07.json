nutrition is ten by nature to be somewhat suspicious of medicine\nAnd the truth is there may be need for both in wisdom is knowing the difference between the two my special guest today is none other than the creator and originator of balance of nature do he'll say he didn't create it and he'll just say he discovered it Dr Douglas Howard Dr Howard it's good to have you here would you say on an average basis that we're under\nNutritional lives in this country that we don't have the nutrition in our bodies\nThat um that they were originally created with to be able to fight disease on a natural level\nOh absolutely in fact I started specializing when I came back I I was dean of foreign student affairs and Pavlov Medical University in Russia for several years and when I came back I started concentrating more on the geriatric patients at that point in time\nWere to take a short break and then we'll be back with more information\nI'm Johnny brags and I'm here with Dr lead them in my prostate cancer doctor ten years ago I had prostate cancer today I'm cancer free my PSA zero\nThank you Dr Lieberman I Know the power of prostate cancer my uncle died of prostate cancer my step father died of prostate cancer I Know prostate cancer can be devastating that's why I went to the doctor Lederman\nFor ten years my cancer has gone my sex life works my year in every life works\nI was able to avoid radical surgery and all the complications with duct delete 'em and treatments my prognosis is great I'm happy that I went to the doctor lead them in the changed my life you can see Dr lead them to call him at two one two choices two one two choices\nThirteen eighty four Broadway at thirty eighth street even safe most insurance is Medicare Medicaid see Dr Lederman two one two choices two one two choices\n[noise] we'll come back to the radio surgery our doctor Lederman leading cancer\nProstate cancer not in the first New York for ... century first in America and in the western hemisphere mind waiting on it or you can also call Dr lead a minute to when you're killing for free informative look like and DVD pay Dr Lederman while back\nWhere our back and I want to talk about uh Seventy four year old woman she had again a uterine cancer and the mutual cancer ten years ago she had surgery for it and again that surgery did not cure this woman of endometrial cancer cancer came back\nShe had no other treatment besides that surgery ten years ago she advantage no bleeding which led to the diagnosis shut the DNC which confirmed a diagnosis then they removed the doctors removed her uterus now just a month ago so ten years later\nShe was diagnosed with a disease called I. T. P. which is a disease where people are bleeding where the body consumes platelets and she had a CAT scan would show to rip currents\nOf the cancers shed a big mess in the pelvis all cancerous mass from that prior cancer that was supposedly treated with the surgery with a hysterectomy so Chet colonoscopy shut in the ... masses mass was crossing on the Colin the surgeons who wanted to remove part of her\nColon and give her chemotherapy the chemo doctors wanted to give her came up the ... part of our colon and she's refused all of that and she has the large swollen leg\nProbably because the ... masses blocking the blood supply she has pelvic playing the swollen leg she's losing weight you went from one sixty to one fifty\nAnd she doesn't want the surgery she doesn't want the chemo examined tour of the right leg is markedly swollen she has a recurrent and to be true of cancer so we asked to get re stage with a new PET scan and certainly this is a kind of work\nThat we do treating individual cancers tried to stop the pain and the bleeding obstruction and to avoid the need for that radical surgery\nI Want to talk about a Seventy one year old woman she was born and Romania it's interesting that she had a thyroid cancer about four years ago in two thousand eight she had a CAT scan of one of the another big hospital in New York showing a lung and dodge all which is growing so from two thousand eight to now\nThe tumor has been growing but she went to one of the super duper big hospitals and the doctor only look at the new CAT scan and told her well you would want to see her back in six months to see if it's growing but he never made the effort\nTo get her scans from two thousand eight to see that in fact the tumors already been growing you don't have to wait another six months waiting on other six months is silly it's a growing mass a growing tumor and I showed this woman's someone had gone to two surgeons before she came to me\nOne surgeon looked at the old two thousand eight study and saw that I was growing and recommended treatment he wanted to cut on her\nAnd the other doctor was even more famous didn't look at the old scans only looked at the new scans and told her to wait and I assume he told her to wait because he didn't see that the tumors the mass was already growing well that's a matter of poor communication and ah I guess a lack of diligence and medicine we need to\nBe diligent and try to look at all the records so\nShe came to us we looked at all the records we got the records over so many years nearly ten years we found that the mass was growing we advise through the same we got a new scan and we showed her the mass is growing and she doesn't need to have certainly one sort of recommended to weight which shows me the way the masses already growing we know that\nAnd the other surgeon told her she had to have surgery which doesn't need surgery either Jeff surgery she wants to remove this mass but there are other methods of treatment like\nRadio surgery our pinpoint treatment non invasive invisible beams to hit the cancer\nSo we told her and the option that she wants she gets to choose obviously every patient is the president of United States of his or her body but she has a growing mass\nShe could wait she can have surgery or she could have radios surgery non invasive treatment our patients like to have non invasive pinpoint treatment because there's no downtime to collapse of the lungs as though I visas the week in the hospital there is no pain\nSo without the patient is lays down our technology finds the tumor\nWe sending beams from thousands of NGOs to hit the tumor\nTen minutes later the patient gets up and goes home or goes to work or goes across the street the Macy's the patient gets to do what they want and don't get stuck in the hospital with the complications of open surgery so for this woman she saw three two doctors to surgeons and me\nAnd she now knows which is a growing mass in the long inches choices\nBut no one ever told her about radio surgery non invasive treatments\nAgain that's another time where the surgeon doesn't tell the patient all the options why is that we talk about surgery we talk about chemo we talk about no treatment boy also talk about innovative not invasive treatment like radio surgery when appropriate for patients why didn't the surgeon tower her\nShe could go to a doctor leader but didn't have radios surgery noninvasive pinpoint treatment in ten minutes with a high success rate and keep her lungs and to avoid the surgery and avoid the pain and avoid the suffering of surgery on her\nLong so this is the work that we do every day this is the LBJ that we brought to America we have the longest experience we actually have book with some

program constitutes neither an endorsement of the products offered boy the ideas expressed selling\nYou will are ... ... New York\nNew York state feels rated number one seven\nTen W O R voice of New York Hi\nSeventy nine and mostly cloudy at six o'clock good evening I'm the one late and\nInvestigators in upstate New York trying to figure out what led to a limo accident that killed ... people on Saturday more from ABC's Chuck secrets in\nBy coming to the academy ... becoming educated and not trying to do it on their own is if there's a simple step by step process the system regardless of how old you are your background your education level if you're somebody who's coach shovel somebody's committed you can make money trading the markets like the banks do\nYeah and when you look at how we learn how to do anything that's really how we learn how to trade and invest as well it doesn't change just because we're in the investing world and and the thing that the thing I was stressed inside of my classes is that we focus on the skill and that was one of the things that my\nMy mentors really pushed on me about Fifteen sixteen years ago was focused on the skill and the money will come the the the issue ends up being is it's a natural tendency for us to stare at the money right out of the gate and we want to make I got to me I Want to make a hundred dollars a day we got to do that starting right now right\nRather than building the skill if you have the skill you can generate the money but you have to have the skill first so many times we tried to put the cart in front of the horse there and that's where the appropriate type of mentoring and teaching and different things like that can can can really help you know too many times we we approach the markets and and and when I talk to people is very normal that that they say\nThat I say I I lost a question are you looking for a get rich quick program you know and and everyone always says oh no no no I'm I'm not looking at looking for that and I say well good 'cause that's not what the financial markets are this is where you really have to develop the skill to be able to go in and\nGenerate income but once you have the skill you can generate the income at the skill has to come first and it's the the patience of developing the skill that really determines in my opinion whether or not somebody as successful or not it's just like I I compared to flying an airplane I mean how comfortable would you be if you sat down a inside of a seven forty seven and you're about to fly from LA to New York\nAnd over the intercom you heard that the pilots say well good afternoon ladies and gentlemen I just finished my Youtube video on drag versus lift we are ready to take off\nRight at that that's not going to get you there you have plenty of knowledge on\nOn how flight actually works the mechanics behind it but as far as the skill to fly and navigate that plane of across the country that's a\nThat's a whole different conversation and we would never get on that plane because that's a life or death situation but unfortunately we do that with our money all the time we did that with a lot of things all the time and and and when we're dealing with our money is a financial life or death situation that we can be putting ourselves\nAbsolutely uh let's face it we've been doing this for over Twenty one years right now we've had over half a million students have come through the academy to learn how to trade the right way the way that the banks make money that the end of the day what you're really hoping to do is find freedom you want to be able to\nFind a way to generate income to allies spend more time at your family some people want to move on to do a different type of job maybe one of volunteer locally in your community the thing that we want to do most is get back the time that we don't want to lose and so\nA lot of our students have been very grateful to come in to spend a little time with us and learn how they not only can generate more income but also save themselves more time\nYeah absolutely

development and instructor at online training and the brains of the operation here that's for sure he was ... on how to make\nMoney as the markets are going up down or sideways how to generate more money how to generate more income and consistent income\nNo matter which way the market is going and whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time listening or maybe you've been with us for the whole show don't worry the best is yet to come and Larry a lot of our listeners are looking to replace their income with trading in investing and some of them are just looking to you know fulfill that New Year's resolution of upgrading their lifestyle with a little bit of it is of additional income\nUm you know some of them are looking just to kind of supplement things other people are really out in that situation where they want to fire their boss there's a whole the whole gamut of kind of ultimate goals that people have when it comes to generating more income but there is that one consistency between all of these groups it all boils down to another source of income we've talked a little bit about multiple streams of income passive income\nActive income and I want to use as you were saying the last in the last segment want to spend a little bit of time kind of diving a little bit deeper into these topics and when you guys are working with people specifically looking to to branch out their streams of income what's what's that starting point and what does that pathway kind of look like well\nStarting off with your whole idea about resolutions I mean we're coming up at that time of year Ryan where we start getting a barrage of videos and and ... and all this stuff about why we have to go to the gym you start seeing TV commercials because one of the biggest resolutions is what losing weight the second biggest is getting out of debt\nAnd this is something that a lot of students come in now the reason why most people are poor\nP. O. R. because they're passing over opportunities repeatedly we've been talking about this in the last segment you have to make a decision right now you have to shift\nFrom worrying about how you're going to make money to being able to think beyond just survival and a lot of our students come in they don't realize is a simple step by step process of how to make money is like institutions do you've mentioned this many times we talk about J. P. Morgan Chase for example\nThis bank has only had what was it nine losing days in five years\nCrazy well a lot of people are constantly going into the markets uneducated not really understanding how the markets work and then scratch their heads when they lose money the market was designed for people to make money if you understand the rules\nSo a lot of times like anything else with a job out there people start working they spend time at a job they get better and better at it before they know what they're getting promoted they're getting to do other type of things and get more and more responsibilities\nWhat I've talked to students about their biggest concern is right now is what if we have another major correction where are they going to be able to make up that income\nAnd you know it's not a question anymore of if it's when we're already starting to see\nReminiscent of what happened in two thousand seven or the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates again we're starting to see housing prices going down again the construction industry is starting to to go down again so there are opportunities here for people to not have a situation happened to them again like it did before\nAnd I don't think anybody out there as on their deathbed going you know Ryan I Wish I could a worked another day\nYeah yeah that's not the it's not the norm when it comes to New Year's resolutions it's like you know we did a big news resolutions piece back in January on the show and it'll be fun to do another one that's next January but one of the things\nThat we we went through every recalls we went through the top the top ten on New Year's resolutions and and one of them was like I Hope I work like you're saying I Hope I work till the\n... the day I die and and and other ones were I Want to downgrade my lifestyle and and and and unfortunately those are those are reality is that that that a lot of people end up in but they don't need to right they don't need to end up in those situations and it really just takes a couple of small weeks\nI I did a I did a lecture I don't even know it was it was probably eight years ago and I stumbled upon a recording of it a couple of days ago\nAnd the whole point of the lecture was about how little things become big things\nAnd so you can look at it you can look at things where you say okay well well what if I could generate a little more income and what if it was five dollars a day right now at five dollars a day could turn into ten dollars a day could turn into twenty dollars in it started with that five dollars a day and next thing you know a few years from now or maybe five years from now it's five hundred dollars a day right but it had\nTo have a starting point it goes back to some of the phone calls you always throw in like the ... and stuff like that where I I and I might miss this up so if I Do correct me with it on it but it is you don't have to be great to get started but you have to get started to be great right there's there's all sorts of fun things like that\nThat are out there that are that are will call cliche but they're also so true right there is so true and they're they're they're they're necessary for us to say they're necessary for us to hear but then there are also necessary for us to take action on if we want to generate that extra income because that's really what ends up failing\nIn our New Year's resolutions as we say okay well I Want to make more money I Want to lose weight well there's there is a step by step process to both of those\nThose monies were protected because it was coming out of our their payroll are coming out of profits and it was put aside the separate account and it wasn't subjected to what was happening in the markets will everything in your four O. one K. is not protected in fact if you think about congressional people in senators they don't have for one case they have\nPensions intentionally because they want to make sure that they have this money available through our taxes will right now you should be thinking about and especially if you're putting money in every two weeks into your Ira we're four one K. you're investing at all time highs\nHas he might have mentioned I don't remember but let's just worth repeating that the market falls three times faster than it goes up so right now if you've been investing the majority of your money in the last couple of years at all time highs right now than it is a lot more room for this money to fall you should be concerned\nBecause we saw what happened back in two thousand eight it was a four O. one K. that became a two oh one K.\nAnd again it took about six years to recover\nWell this is much higher than we've ever seen before in fact if I look at the Buffett index speaking of course of Warren Buffett right now it's higher and more extended than we ever seen that index have been in the past\nAnd they simply means that if we have a correction and things continue what's to say this for all and K won't become a one oh one K. and do you have the time right now to be able to put off your retirement and still work\nWhen you thought you were going to be able to finally retirement and start living your life\nAnd the the the the the way to make money in the market hasn't changed or a thousand years we're talking about it earlier when you brought up shorting and making money as the markets are going down\nIt's always been by low so high and it will always be by low so high so what's the probability of buying an all time highs as being ... by low up or opportunity right can markets go higher than they absolutely can we're taking on a lot of risk in those situations\nThere's ... there's constant pull back there's constant wholesale offerings even as the markets are going higher and over paying for things is is really what limits are potential upside and what opens up the downside for ah\nFor for risk you know we we talk a lot about the the bullish biased and how\nConsumers we just usually sit there and buy everything we Bye bye Bye bye bye And right now the market's going higher and higher and every pay the average person buys more stocks they buy stocks through their mutual funds to their four one case about through their RSP through their IRAs doesn't matter what account type it is that's ... that's the general practice kind of around the world is on payday would just buy stocks well\nIt doesn't matter what the prices though just matters that it's payday and so we're going to invest into it now the markets are collapsing our financial advisors have a brilliant way of of of talking to us about why it's okay to continue to buy as the markets are going down\nRight a ... dollar cost averaging as the markets are going down they say by more by more by more is it's going down and then when it comes back you're going to be rich and while that math actually makes a whole lot of sense the problem ends up being is we don't stop buying when it's on its way up if all we did was by on its way down dollar cost averaging would be very powerful strategy\nBut when you're averaging your price back up by these all time highs offsets all the money that was invested in that for all and came back in two thousand nine and we're taking the\nAverage price up with this which which raises are risk exposure and lowers are profitability and in the end it's for one reason in my opinion my humble opinion and it's because Wall Street's businesses to sell us products and that's OK right we just have to know that\nA Wal Mart's businesses to sell us products too and that's how they make money and I don't think they're evil right and they'll think Wall Street's evil but as the customer not client notice I use the word customer\nAs the customer we have to understand\nThat what we're what we're doing when we're when we're engaging with somebody when I go to Walmart I realize that I'm not planning on making money I'm just buying something from them and if that's the same thing that that's happening with us with Wall Street we've got to kind of take that into consideration with the\nWith the kind of analysis that we're doing on the situation are we planning on making money on this transaction if the answer is yes\nHow do we plan on making money on this and usually the answer after that unfortunately is is I don't know but that's where getting a little bit of education on how the markets work\nCan go a long way and I say a little bit can go a long way and it really can a little bit of education\nWill put you miles in front of the average investor one of the ways where we can help you do that as we got a few more tickets so we can do a little give away as long as there he says okay let's do it right now I've got to have their class coming up in your area they have their classes where you can see exactly what it takes to keep that retirement grown whether the market's going up down or sideways have more income for today and more income for tomorrow\nAnd just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these half day classes switch phones ready and if you are driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluding with your past this is going to be a professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional insider kept makes it so you get started right now\n... century twenty we needed a call now and reserve those seats the number is eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nYou know we've talked a lot about kind of the growing side of things with their retirement accounts really getting those retirement accounts to generate more incomes what about the protective side of things we've got we have a group of people out there who have made a bunch of money as the markets have been going higher than piling money into those accounts and what can they do to protect against the downside without limiting the upside\nWell most importantly you need to understand where your risk reward relies so many people imagine if I took it back to two thousand and seven what if you learned a skill that have told you to go to cash back in December of two thousand seven and then you would have had cash in your account\nBasement bargain prices buying stock back on the way up and that's really what banks were doing they had one of the best years of their lives in two thousand eight fact I speak to our students all the time they're waiting for the next correction Wall Street has been waiting for the next correction\nAt some point they'll be another decade long windfall coming back\nAnd it's almost like you had the opportunity here to get a nice financial do over but most people again think they know best a lot of people I talk to you don't even know what happened to retirement accounts how much they're paying fees I mean what if I told you\nThat about thirty percent of your saved retirement money is going to go out the door in fees to your brokerage company that would probably infuriates you\nSwitch to start doing right now is thinking well if I hadn't been able to put aside money right now learning how to trade for income enables you to start saving money what you can put toward retirement once you understand the right rate of return that you need to be able to compounded annually\nYou can start thinking about generating money you need to retire the right way and again this comes down to getting your cells educated what I said\nFor earlier is that most people make the greatest mistake possible try to wing it on their own by reading books are watching Youtube videos and you see right right I I'm not going to go on line learn how to fly a plane from Youtube video and then go up to it flies school and go watch the Youtube video can I get in the cockpit right now and take off\nDoesn't make any sense well the same thing can be said about your money as as I Love from the movie the pursuit of happiness Chris gardener mother played portrayed by Will Smith once said the cavalry ain't come and you have to care more about your money than anybody else and that means protecting yourself by getting yourself educated as quickly as possible\nWhen whenever you whenever you bring up the pursuit of happiness and you say the covering coming it always reminds me of another quote a and I don't know where it originated from but our our our friend Keely would always say it over and over she'd always say this life is not a dress rehearsal\nOver and over I've heard her say that a million times I don't remember where she got it from but we'll give credit for that one right now now one of the things about the fees that you were touching on that I just want to elaborate on before we jump into this break is as you were talking about thirty percent can end up going to fees and there was an article that I saw a little while ago that shows how the average person spends three years of their life\nPaying for the fees so if you make fifty thousand dollars a year you can expect to be about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in fees if you make a hundred thousand dollars a year you could expect to pay about three hundred thousand dollars\nIn fees one of the things you can do to avoid those fees is really take control of your of your money but before you should do that you need to know how to do it\nWhat great place to start that just started that educational process is out of one of our half the class and we just happen to have a stack of tickets here Larry are you ready I'm ready All right well right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area and a half day class as we can see exactly what it takes really take control those retirements generate that income for today\nMake sure that you have that income for tomorrow and it just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of past is one of these half day classes so if you're driving now is a great time to pull over\nAnd get that phone ready now included with your past this is going to be our professional insiders kit that is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors my favorite thing about the professional insiders ... is it makes it so you can get started right now ... century twenty when he did a call now and reserved those seats\nThe number is eight eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three\nIf you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com\nAnd see if you can force there we've got to take a quick break but Larry what should we talk about talk about the lifestyle trader how your life changed once you're able to generate\nGoing to pull back the curtain on a daily life trader stick with us rent and there will be right back\nIf you could invest just about three hours to open yourself to strategies that can make you financially secure for life would you do it\nFor over Twenty years online training academy has transformed lives worldwide with their exceptional trading and investing education and they would like to invite you to a free half day investing class near you\nHere's what one racing graduate had to say\nOnline trading had I mean has taught me that he got to have a plan and they gave me the food is maybe a better trader a better plan or I'm a better father\nShe's younger she didn't want to want to work a desk job anymore she had recently gone through a divorce\nAnd when she decided to do is she wanted to pursue trading currencies and she realized that being in Europe was the center of the currency universe\nShe moved herself to Barcelona, Spain and she knew that she was young enough that had time to do whatever she wanted to do\nA lot of our older students are really starting to reassess what's going on in their lives right now and they realize they got to keep up with the cost of living right things keep getting more and more expensive every year but imagine that you go in the markets for a couple of hours a day\nCommit to maybe one hour a day to practice\nTo get the skilled down and then you could start generating money that you can pass on to future generations your kids grandkids anybody you want to help in the future\nI think the key to this too is it's not about creating a fulltime job it's about creating that full time life you know we talk a lot about financial freedom nuts that's\nReally what it boils down to is being able to move to Spain if you want to move to Spain you know for for a while I I spent my my winters in the Caribbean and\nI was living in Boston at the time and and I had somebody actually come up to me and say why do you go [laughter] I chuckle Everytime I think about it and he said why do you why do you leave Boston and go to\nA Puerto Rico in the wintertime and I looked at him and said have you ever spent a winter here in Boston and he was like well yeah and I'm like that's why when it gets really pretty for you and cold here in the wintertime and I'm running from it\nAnd that's one of the things that that the markets allow you to do is it doesn't matter where you it doesn't matter where you go as long as you have an Internet connection we've joked about it\nA few times Larry where back when I used to do that I when I used to go back and forth as I was down in Puerto Rico and I'd have that big a TNT air card hanging out of the side of my laptop that it was almost the same size as my laptop\nAnd even my satellite radio down there like it only worked for like ... it only worked from like eight AM to like noon 'cause that's when the satellite was over me and so it was it was hilarious but where we are from a technology standpoint is is is light years beyond where we were you know twelve years ago Fifteen Years ago when when I was just getting started in this\nAnd it's kind of a fun it's been a fun evolution to see but for everybody who is just getting started right now it's like\nIt's like you have no idea how good you have it I feel like when I talked to a new traders I'm like my grandfather and I'm like oh when I went to school I had to walk uphill both ways and the snow you know we had dial up Internet to now it's just in the palm of your hand but we have so much access to our money that really\nGoing in and just getting a little bit of skill and getting a little bit of a little bit of knowledge\nCan really go a long way we don't have to call up a broker and say hey you know what about this what about that it's just right at the ... hand identify the price we want to pay set the order and then wait for priced really come down to you\nIt it ends up being that kind of classic negotiating tactic\nYou say you know and my grandfather taught me this when I was like five years old I remember going with him and he was buying my grandma new car and he said watch this he says I'm going to tell them the price I'm going to pay and ... and as soon as he says no we're going to get up and walk away\nAnd that's really how you approach the markets you say you know what I Want to buy this these these shares a stock but I Want to buy this price and if I Am for this price that's okay there's lots of other stocks that I can go buy it a great price and you have to have that mentality and that is the mentality of the professional one of the things that can help you operate like a professional though is confidence\nConfidence can come from education confidence can come from buildings skill a great place to start that is a ... class we've got a few tickets left before the show is over and we're going to give some away as long as Larry says okay I think it's okay alright\nRight now I've got to have to a class coming up in your area that have take classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes\nTo really live the life you want to live life on your own terms have that financial freedom but a lot of that just boils down to having the income to create that freedom now just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluded with your passes it's gonna be the professional ...\n... know this kid is packed with us from

Gary G at ... dot com Gary Goldberg financial services money management for real people eight hundred\nThree seven seven five seven five seven or does it us on line at G. G. S. S. dot com\nFrom ... ...\nBack to the program ladies and gentlemen you're listening to Gary Goldberg on money matters as as I indicated ah my next guest is an independent economists a well known individual who you probably have seen on CNBC over the years\nHe was formerly a fund manager at invesco he's a market strategist and my curiosity as to how the markets are going to be reacting going forward as piqued my interest so Fritz Meyer is my guest\nBrits good day to you by Gary thank you for having me here I ah as a money manager I'm frequently asked Gary what do you think the market's going to do is the most common question and it's also one of the silliest questions because of I truly new I'd be sipping ... under a palm tree\nThe visa so let's talk about between you and me to professionals with a lot of with a lot of experience between us let's talk about what's on people's minds\nShould people be concerned about the market because there's a lot of noise out there about the market is going to run into real headwinds what's your opinion as a market strategist well\nI'm ... as you said it's a it's a it's a fool's errand to try to predict what the stock market's going to do in the next twelve months or even twenty four months\nBut what we can do is look at the history of stock market returns and that's so important\nI'm In uh in setting your longer term expectations are because what we see in common stocks is that ten percent compounded annually in round numbers is the magic number for common stocks and that's over two hundred years of us financially they\nKept that so over two hundred years people have gotten total returns of ten percent now is that on their portfolio or from the stock market portion of their portfolio that's\nA great point the stock market portion of the portfolio whereas bonds act as an anger to wind word however in the cart environment bonds are going to be very difficult a as a as a a return vehicle because so\nIf the bond market is currently let's say paying two and a half to three percent somewhere in that vicinity a and yields\nAre not going to be doing well going forward from what I can see which is why we don't have our clients\nAnd bonds are you saying that investors have to make it up by being invested in stocks and staying fully invested\nStaying fully invested in common stocks for the long run is the key to achieving your retirement goal now back to your point on bonds if you can get three percent on a U.S treasury today\nUm that compares to the ten percent long term and common Sox however\nIf bond yields do start to rise which most economists are expecting when the European Central bank finally\nBacks away from quantitative easing in that environment because of bond arithmetic you could be looking at close to zero returns in bonds over the near term and that makes stocks long term returns just that much more attractive\nSo they become more attractive are they more difficult to achieve I Would think not because with tax cuts and with the opportunity to reinvest that money that is being brought back from Europe\nAnd the fact that tax rates are lower for corporations companies are buying back their own shares so should people not be frightened for the next year or two about a major decline in the market in your personal opinion Fritz Meyer\nI yes I what you said is correct at least my personal opinion is that the Federal Reserve in the end will determine when this ah economic expansion comes to a conclusion that's been the history of the fed with\nRatcheting up short term interest rates historically\nHas engineered every single recession post World war two I personally think the fed is a long ways away from wanting to slow this economy materially I think they're going to be very attuned\nTo what their short term rate hikes are have accomplished so far and what they are are are apt to achieve a and the next couple of years as we go to three percent on that ... target right\nAt our from we are big fans of David and paying stocks we also like variable annuities because of the um sequence of return risk that's taken away from an investment portfolio can you elaborate on those two categories\nThere is a well known guy who's been appearing on TV or who has been trashing annuities I completely disagree with that I think I knew a days are one of the key ways in which investors can ensure\nA their long term uh in achieving their long term economic goals\nOne of the most important things is to ensure against a bad sequence I'll retire and so what that means as you are tired today at age sixty five what if the stock market took a twenty five percent hit and it's the first year in which you have to withdraw fifty or Seventy five thousand dollars to live\nThat puts you in a big hole right out of the box in it and uh uh an annuity a variable annuity in particular is a way to ensure against that\nAs far as the evidence over the years that has been a big favorite of ours your opinion on a new a on a dividend paying stocks\nThink the core of any investment portfolios should consist of high quality dividend paying stocks where you've seen growth in the in the er dividend pay out and if you look at the long term contribution from dividends to total stock market returns it's absolutely incredible over the last Thirty years dividends have doubled\nThe total returned from the price index alone\nHow much impact will they change mean\nTo the stock market if the Democrats are suddenly take control of or the house\nThat's a great question I excuse me I\nI think uh the midterm elections probably don't have much effect on the economic outlook after all the tax cut was the ... and ... those tax cuts aren't going anywhere as long as this administration uh it is here and that's another couple of years ...\nKeeps on giving as the tax cuts I think so I agree with you by all means\nUm Fritz I Wish we had more time perhaps on another time you can uh uh visited with us again I have just spent about an hour with Fritz Meyer and as a person who majored in economics in college I certainly respect a fellow economist of\nBrits Myers quality and um I Hope you found this interesting it was very quick Fritz but then because a certain time limitations but your knowledge is extremely welcome at our from thank you for tomorrow You're welcome Garry\nYou're listening to money matters what Jerry Goldberg\nIt's routine to get a second opinion on health issues it's also common to get a second opinion when getting work done around the house or

Goldberg on money matters one of the more frequently asked questions that I have to respond to is when should I take my Social Security\nYeah I Do think that that's one of the head winds were going to confront the in terms of the stock market so the next twelve months or so in that\nWay you know as as those interest rates come up you know this this market that was called by the named Tina there is no alternative now all of a sudden as interest rates come up you know investors are starting to see that you know what maybe there is an alternative ah particularly when they get a little bit is a little bit squeamish about risk\nOkay so let's talk about Tina T. I. N. A. there is no alternative there is an alternative and that has been did that in paying stocks and a lot of people have made money by not investing in the bond market we have avoided the marketed are from the bond market it off from the choose you have it in paying stocks\nHere is potentially a juncture point were bonds become attractive as Greg you have just pointed out\nI personally don't think if that juncture point is reached people will abandon\nPaying stocks which are a cornerstone of growth on a person's portfolio going back to Nineteen hundred so the bond market I don't think we'll ever replace quality dividend paying stocks your opinion\nI agree one hundred percent um and you know I'm invested that way myself personally I I Do think that the ah areas of the market that are going to be most susceptible to a pull back under that scenario are going to be these high octane ultra girls' names that we've seen that\nUh you know are really trading it nose bleed valuations and don't pay those dividends a nail Devon and paying stocks\nWhich show I've traveled the market here to date um they provide a great question when the market's going the other way\nOr the or the other benefit is you know through thick and thin you know a lot of these companies that have paid dividends for decades they have a track record of increasing their dividends or every year even an economic downturns that provides great the inflation protection for investors who are relying on the income that they get from those dividend bank stocks\nWearing a lot of our listeners have never taken in economics course in their life and they hear about the um yield curve being inverted\nLead you and I try to make it as simple as possible you take the lead what is in inverted yield curve and simplistic terms and what is the concern that investor would have if any\nIn a normal environment short term interest rates would be lower than long term interest rates because he was a as the economy continues to grow inflation will tire and so investors would come in higher return for tying up their money for longer periods of time relative to shorter\nPeriod let's be specific Greg so if long term rates are currently let's say three percent and short term rates or two percent I'm using this as an example what is the concern that an individual would have if all of a sudden short term rates and long term rates cross over what would be the impact\nWell they the risk of there is that it's often a harbinger of recession and the reason why is it that yield curve invert save those short term rates move above long term rates\nAnd it puts a cramped in lending a that it becomes more profitable for banks to just invest in short term security than it is to actually lend money out at those lower long term interest rates and credit is really the life blood of economic expansion so you know that's how the the dominoes fall\nThe that signal of inverted yield curve as predicted every recession for the last forty years\nAnd the other thing that's also happened to be over the last you know certainly last couple of recessions a is every time people say oh I yeah but this time it's different this time it's different and you know it hasn't been different so uh I Would caution people\nThat was the best time is different the most dangerous words in finance and you know I'm already hearing that phrase being trotted out again\nSo let's be against specific so banks borrow it let's say three eight zero percent they lend it for four and a half percent on mortgages and order loans and the rest so they're spread which is why the financial sector has done well\nHas really line their pockets so if short term rates go up significantly which the fed controls\nThe fed does not control a longer term race they control short term rates so short term rates go up significantly you might find banks less apt to make loans to bar was for mortgages and car loans at a lower rate\nAnd that is where that economic risk comes in that's where it becomes a harbinger of a future economic downturn because in foreign economy to grow a for an economy to continue to expand\nThat pipe line of credit whether it's to consumer borrowers to businesses um to municipalities whoever ah that the credit is really the lifeblood of of of an economic expansion lending doesn't happen or a really uh you know ... in a big way from economic growth\nSo there is the lesson and economics one oh one because you want to see\nThat banks continue to win because they don't win for new homes yes wide Home Depot doesn't sell as much caterpillar doesn't use the machinery to build more houses and I can go on and on the ripple effect though the rock and the pond\nWe'd have a deleterious effect to our economy and could cause a recession now to be clear this is not on the horizon but Greg as you pointed out all prior recessions going back forty years has resulted in what we just described\nAnd that's one of the reasons that people uh uh you know try it out that phrase of this time is different is because that inverted yield curve\nShould that happen it's a leading indicator of recession that often happens when times are still good people then dismissed that as a signal and then you get a couple of years down the road and then another recession happened so to your point is is not something that's on the immediate horizon but should that yield curve invert it\nSends a dominant signal about where the economy might be Eighteen twenty four thirty six months down the road\nIf anybody wants to learn about
