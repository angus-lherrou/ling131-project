{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "Welcome back to the radio surgery our doctor Gilead I'm In the leading cancer and prostate cancer ... in the first New York with Frank native brain radio surgery some first in America\nAnd in the western hemisphere ... radio surgery you can also call Dr Lieberman at two inches killington for a free informative and DVD hey Dr Lederman whereby\nHey we're back and we have a caller let's cut lawns through\nHey how are you I'm good how are you a a okay\nThis is it sounds like a leader among them\nI think showed at work yes of course I'm a working yeah what do you think about who's taken aromas\nWell then they had it on fire apps ... minutes to read in Utah\nYeah you told me she's from I think Ogden, Utah\nI think you're one of it to\nEr saint Georgia she's from St George return it or Fifteen Years ago and she's done very well yeah let me\nVery happy the as the hearing was preserved and he was really happy\nWell that's what usually happens is the problem is that people that go through surgery have a surgical experience which is usually deaf surgery causes deafness in Ninety percent of people with a coup sicker almost about fifty percent end up with facial paralysis our patients come in and get a treatment we essentially never lose facial\nFunction which are the one hand fifty percent people on the facial\nParalyzed with surgery with us non invasive treatment the faces intact and the vast majority actually about Ninety six percent of people have hearing and about eighty percent have serviceable hearing or\nWhat does that mean I mean I can call you up on a phone interview that aired on the phone All right\nWell it means that there's hearing in that era it's not perfect some people who have perfect hearing in the music conductor in Israel actually you know him he's a he had a three and a half centimeter acoustic normal retreated about Fifteen Years ago and this hearing improved his perfect tone hearing in this\nEra that had an acoustic aroma\nAnd that's a big went through our senator\nYeah it is and we treat big acoustic Romo says we treat small ones as well and they all said oh you can't treat is too big it's too small to this is too young is too old but the fact is young people don't want to go through their life\nWith definition facial paralysis older people don't want to go through life with deaf listen facial crowd knowing that no one does and I've had people I remember one man that was about fifty came to me and he was pushed by the surgeons have surgery went out west to have surgery he was a scientist\nPh the great man had surgery and he died on the table surgery has a death rate of about one percent of the complication rates that's obviously much more than that so radio surgeries opened up a new possibilities for\nPeople with a caustic aromas\nAnd I ... I remember there was a pilot who had surgery and he lost his job afterwards right\nWe met the man and actually we're in a\nIn Israel as a air force pilot for Israel and he went to a big famous surgeon in Germany it was a time consider the biggest surgeon in the world for clues to grow up has ended up man lost his hearing he lost his balance and he was at the home of the Israeli could doctor who kept his hearing kept us face kept as balanced kept\nEverything with the cutting and bleeding by coming to us at radio surgery in New York so what a difference a choice makes an opinion I also have a congratulations this is Dr are real Lederman on the line and you are or were notified that our data was published in the proceedings of\nThe Castro and then the ... journal so\nRight I I was that the opposite and opening up now and there was a journal I was reading it and I saw there I saw the article we're out\nSo it ... the data we look at patients who had met a static and it can't it along\nOkay so these are kidney cancers which means that starts in the kidney and it spreads so long and I know most people have surgery unfortunately for kidney cancer so these people mostly had surgery for the kidney cancer spreads all along and\nChemo immunotherapy is not very effective for kidney cancer so many people come to us with kidney cancer\nHas met a static and give the data of uh what's our success rate for kidney cancer spread to the long\nNinety seven percent control in the long\nSo what does that mean Ninety seven preventing kidney cancer\nLearn and we were able to make the cancer stopped growing shrink or disappear in Ninety seven percent of the patients\nWow you know people often ask what the long I'm breathing how can you hit a cancer my line when I'm breathing how can it be well the fact that speak for itself\nRight any famously beam only way that happy ground tissue\nRight so there's lots of ways we we get to the tumor number one we make a stereotype the frame I think we're the only ones still using a stereotype to frame we were the first\nOne in every facility every hospital every doctor and America was giving standard radiation one person said why not just hit the cancer why are we treating the healthy tissue one person rather than a great point and do you think that made him popular with all his friends and colleagues\nKnow they try you know why why why this person going against the Syrian\nWhy is one person out of ... going after the cancer and not hurting the healthy tissues and when you do that you can give fewer treatments more intense treatments and more successful treatments\nHer coming in general laid ready to standard radiation was even done for people who I met a study cancer long\nBack then they would have surgery I Know you've seen a lot of surgery for people who have metastases to the lungs wouldn't you rather have a treatment is Fifteen minutes you walking the treatment and walk out and have lunch or dinner or go to the movies or go to work or be with your loved ones\nYeah and one surgery so I avoided rather avoid it\nSo why do you think people end up having surgery I think it's because they don't know about radio surgery I think a lot of people don't tell them who is in the obligation isn't part of the informed consent process to tell all the risk benefits\nAnd alternatives\nYou're supposed to you so do you think that I mean it seems to me that the purpose of this radio show is to educate\nPeople foreign people what's out there and I think we have a lot of work to do because unfortunately a lot of surgeons are doing a lot of surgery on cancers that could be replaced by radio surgery non invasive treatment\n... very good outcomes so unfortunately some people say well maybe there's not a role for what we do in fact there's a bigger role than anyone could imagine it's just a matter of informing\nPeople that there are options and unfortunately so many people are still getting caught they're cutting kind of long or the liver or the brain when we could do radio surgery just to hit the cancer\nAnd then when you're at and you have to be kept where the organs so we're just cutting everything\nWell you can that doesn't mean you have a good result of this other complication surgery that infections and bleeding and fevers and car had pneumonia and all kinds of things even

always talk about that being a warning signs ... point\nWay not only a blood in the year but they had pain in the abdomen who went to the emergency room here than ever I had a large kidney cancer that already spread to the lung and he went to one of the super pope her big hospitals in New York City and he had stage for cancer and without telling them any options she told me had to\nHave is kidney removed even though the cancer already and spread it was already stage ... cancer the lower than that super super big hospital told him it could have gone to the doctor leader mother saved us kidney and avoided radical surgery and not have it in his kidney throwing out the garbage and not having at us the shut incision he could've avoided\nAll of that by coming here to the kid before Broadway where we treat kidney cancer well the surgeons there the big hospital never told about options that has told them you got to have\nThe kidney removed and then then the cancer lung of course kept on growing and he had chemotherapy in Sudan in Sudan into chemo and then the cancer traveled to the hip and\nThat means is to attend and all the chemo and all their mental therapy didn't work and then he had cancer surgery on his hip standard radiation stat or radiation for kidney cancer doesn't work very well could look up at a textbook\nIt's one of those cancers it's considered radio resistant and the radiation guys didn't tell them you could go after leader that\nRadio surgery with a Ninety percent success rate so yeah the kidney removed melon told him about radio surgery is saving his kid they he had cancer spread\nTo the hip no and told them\nA radio surgery a standard radiation which doesn't work weeks and weeks of treatment get cancer in the lungs of course the chemo guys didn't tell me could go see Dr Lederman about long\nRadio surgery and Dr are real Lederman has presented our data for kidney cancer medicine that come along and the world's largest radiology meeting with a Ninety seven percent success rate with no ... no bleeding just invisible beams from thousands of NGOs\nTo hit the cancer was and the kidney or the upper the lung no one ever told\nThis man about all the options ever until we found out finally by himself he started a new agent and a new agent\nDidn't work the cancer kept growing in the long and he had more and more cancer and the hip or you had the surgery and the standard radiation ended a memorized showing a large mass and he's been on narcotics for the mess and then finally when all those treatments surgery in years of chemo immunotherapy remember him into therapy costs about\nTen Fifteen thousand dollars a month to take four or five years of that it's like about sixteen months you're talking about\nHalf a million dollars of treatment down the garbage plus the surgery on his kidney plus the surgery on the porch to them to work and then finally came here to radio sort of New York at all the treatments that this man's head of all the treatments all those surgeries and years of chemo immunotherapy instead of radiation only one\nTreatment worked and that was our treatment to the cancer in the hip where the same place where standard radiation doesn't work\nOr surgery to work the cancer grew back only one treatment work for this man and that was our treatment radio surgery why\nWell this is why we brought radio surge into the western hemisphere this is why we brought radio surgery to you whereabouts has zero and find the cancer give high does focus of being hit the cancer not heard healthy tissues and do that all in ten

therapy was not standard radiation was only our treatment focused\nOn radio surgery pinpoint tree in a few treatments with invisible beams to\nAttack the cancer and that's the way it is speaking of
