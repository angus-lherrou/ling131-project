with absolutely nothing else in it how in the world can this be life changing and where did you get the idea for it and how did you know which fruits and vegetables to actually select for the product balance of nature\nWell started out I studied in Russia for several years and while I was there I started seeing the need for nutrition more and more and when I returned back to my practice in the United states\nThen I started seeing how lousy our diets really were when I started really realizing how important that balance of chemistry is how much a to see the deed easy and back then I still believe that the was the vitamins not hormone anyways and\nAnd I started seeing that the necessity of balance of chemistry and so I started searching which one was the best which vitamin was the best

hemisphere finding radio surgery you can also call Dr limited to ensure killington for free and DVD hey Dr Lederman\nWhereby we're back on TALK about a woman who's hippie two years old she was born in Colombia she is marriage as one child she came with her husband and son for lymphoma and we often talk about the people go to the hospitals they have something that they get admitted to the hospital next thing you know they're on the operating room having\nRadical surgery I often talk about that and people in the hospital think like they have no choice you can you have to say yes you have no options what's not true you can usually say look I'm going to get it checked out of that\nHospital I'm going to get a second opinion about this woman got pressured she got pressured you went to the hospital five years ago she found a lump it or add you went to one of those super duper us hospitals Charles ... and they said oh you have to come to the hospital they admitted ...\nBurns who robbed the neurosurgeon walks in with his big coats and a stethoscope does oh you out of your head opened up could be serious and they opened up or at without\nAny test beforehand without any biopsies just did a scab as at all you have to open up your head while they opened up or had probably could have just put a needle in this love and found the lymphoma instead of putting a needle which would cost about two cents and can be done about two minutes get it up whether I had opened\nUp in our brain exposed to the hospitals for for a long period of time in a bill of tens of thousands of dollars and she just had them fall but which didn't require had opened up at all\nAnd then they gave her a series of standard team on standard radiation and then the cancer came back around her eyes opened her up again and gave her more came on more radiation and then\nA big lump came in her chest the lumped has been there for two years and it's growing growing growing growing growing and they've done multiple surgeries on this lump and they've done biopsies and they can't get at it they have to remove our whole long because it's so deep and she doesn't want\nAny more surgery she's kind of waking up already to realize the game of the hospital big surgeries big chemo big radiation weeks and weeks and\nWeeks and months and months and months and months that big bills and she doesn't want that and a friend of hers\nAsked her said you might want to see Dr Lederman and she came in and saw me a few months ago and we saw this mask growing in the long we've got a PET scan it was positive but it's been growing growing growing growing for two years and she doesn't want to lose her lungs she doesn't want to have the same thing that happened to her head on her face that happened to her lungs she knows that\nAre moved along she's going to lose her ability to breathe like she couldn't breathe you need your lung you your long as you're breathing machine without your lungs and you're going to be short of breath you're going to hang a couple of stops the\nParenting for breath and she doesn't want that she's tired of surgery and weeks and weeks of radiation and months and months of chemo and she came and saw a man I analyze the case and we saw the case of got new skins who got the old scanned so we've got the pathology and we told her that she could have all those things that she wants the other big hospital\nHow open up or long and pick out the lung and do all the other things they've done they can do that\nOr she can just come into our office and have a treatment in ten minutes she lays down we've tried the\nCancer we sending beams from thousands of angles and she gets up ten minutes and she goes to Macy's or Bryant Park or go shopping and goes to work or go to the grocery store and she wouldn't feel a thing that you keep her lung function which one would you what well then the doctor from the big super super\nHospital called me up to super duper what do you think you're doing she need surgery and weeks of radiation\nI said that's your belief she's tired\nOf you she's tired of all those surgeries just tired of being formed she's tired of it and we treat patients like her every day she has all of them fall and most likely this little ... will\nMelt away and that's where we've been doing that is why we brought stereo tactic body radio surgery that's why we're the first of America when Harry hospitals including yours thought it was unnecessary that you keep on doing opened big surgery as well you could do it if you want\nIf she agrees but at least now she knows there's an option when you opened up or head she didn't know there was an option no one ever told her there there was no option but when you open up her face\nNo one ever told her there was no option here surgeons\nPushed her to have that surgery on now she knows there's an option and when she knows there's an option she doesn't\nWant your treatment anymore and the doctor was angry is on the phone angry well how can you prove what you do good work I've been doing it for Thirty years wake up already man wake up your treatment is a thing of the past and surgery in America's diminished\nThirty percent of the last five years why because more and more people get\nThe message that you don't have to have surgery to be cut open for everything in the world including for a lump in the lungs or cancer and the lungs or cancer the pancreas or the liver the bladder or the prostate or the kidneys or the Boehner sarcoma melanoma more\nAnd that's why we have Information Center that's why we're devoted to the radio shows every\nDay every day we're on the radio why to\nEducate so that you can get better care for yourself and your loved ones just like medical students learn case by case you learn case by case you learn about this woman and over there she is still being told the EPA caught up\nFor a long she's still being told that and she's getting bold after they cut open her head and cut up on her face it gave her all that other treatment and it didn't cure\nDoesn't cure that's why she was with me because of the cats are still growing then cure her all the weeks of cutting and bleeding and complications it doesn't cure her and she's learning and all the threats that they're giving blowing blowing blowing steam in the air smoke in the air blowing steam at me and that the patient their trick is being lost\nIt can do it wants to do it twice but she's learned a lesson and many other people have learned their\nLesson and that's why so many people come here for\nRadio surgical outcome for consultation you don't have to have a treatment with us you come in and out patient become and you can hear what you want to hear a few like a grade you don't like a gray you turn around and walk out you're stuck at a hospital bed pillow locked in fact you're obliged to have that surgery you not obliged\nThat cannot count on you if you don't want to be caught if you don't sign on the bottom line that cannot open your hat or your face or along that's why so\nMany people seek a second opinion because they want options who won choices and most people do not want to have radical surgery the donor weeks and weeks of chemo and radiation or ... when I see so many people getting chemo and they come to me with a CAT scan reports are pets gets ruined the cancers growing and\nStill they are getting more and more of the same came out of that didn't work before how does that\nWhy does that take place was great for the drug industry is great for the doctor it's great for the hospital but where doctors and we're here\nTo ask what is good for the patient with any patient comes into our door we are they're saying what is good for the patient what is best for the patient and yes I talk about all the options because of patients should hear all the options of the show here all the options and so frequently with the chemo doctors the surgeons they do not here\nAll the

Berg\nThat all of a sudden you can start learning a skill that can make money and not have to sit there and think about a second job again tell but later\nBut one of the ways I look at this and I this analogy all the time when people are just simply trading one direction or they're waiting for the markets always go up it's like a car imagine that you were told you can get in a car tomorrow and you can drive somewhere but you can't put the car and reverse\nYou had to go in a lot of circles eventually going to get there but you gonna waste a lot of time energy and money getting to the same place if you simply had all the tools to get you there faster so a lot of what I'm seeing our students learning the first time is it they're becoming\n... they don't care if it goes up down or sideways as long as the markets are moving they can learn how to make money and what a lot of them are seeing right now is they could create more freedom for themselves because they're able to make money no matter what the markets go\nYeah absolutely and I love I Love the analogy of the car and there's so many so many other analogy that we could pull into this that in in I always say in real life you know outside of the are investing life in\nOur normal everyday life we there's no way we buy a car that didn't go on to reverse right but so many times we find ourselves in investments that only have one direction or one avenue where they can profit you know it's it's the same thing you go back to our you know go back to high school education and where was your stock picking\nIn class where it was how to balance a checkbook class right the law to check but I just dated myself victory over there but it is it is true though I mean we we really didn't have\nThat stuff and so we're left to to rely on the quote unquote professionals truly guide us through this process where unfortunately they make a commission off of these transactions they say unfortunately kind of tongue in cheek there because that's okay with me that they make a commission that's\nThat's what they do for a living you know real estate brokers make a commission when they sell real estate so stockbrokers should naturally make a commission when they sell stocks\nBut when we buy a home it is up to up to the individual to make sure that they're buying the right home for them in the right market place in the right area that the right payment the right everything it's up to the person to do it\nThe broker just completes the transaction and unfortunately it's up to the person to also make sure that they're making the appropriate decision when it comes to their investing but when it really boils down to about Ninety nine percent of the world\nHasn't ... they spend more time analyzing the menu when they go out to dinner than they do analyzing what investments to to select\nIt it just puts us behind the eight ball and it's something that I think if we did a quick give away with a few more of these passes we could probably make a dent in and help people start making better investment decision I think it's a great idea let's do it All right well right now I've got a half day class coming up in your area that have take classes where you'll see exactly what it takes to generate more consistent income in the market\nUnderstand how the market works I understand what the risks are involved with a lot of different investments out there and early ... capital capitalize on the upside down and a half day classes about three hours long and so you'll be investing three hours of your time to really raise that financial IQ and start getting better and returns\nOn your investments now just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of past as one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a good time to pull over\nIncluded with your passes it's going to be the professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional inside of it makes it so you can get started right now\n... we need you to call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com and see if you can scores and passes there\nWe are up against it need to take a quick little break Larry what do you have a force actually\nTalk about more about the income they

Jacobs director of a structure development and top instructor it on the trading him he really shut the life on consistent returns in the market\nIt's one of my favorite topics though talking about consistency in the market so many times I'll I'll run into different traders different investors and they've had some success they've had some success in the market but they really had a hard time duplicating it and that ends up being the key really in anything that we do is how can we make money consistently ugly make\nMoney over and over and the financial markets are no different it's all about that consistent approach\nBeing able to make money as the market's going up being able to make money as the markets are going down and also being able to make money as the markets are going sideways we need to be generating income whether it's income for today or income for tomorrow and in this segment we're going to spend a little bit more time talking about the income side of things but whether you're just tuning in\nMaybe your first time listening or maybe you've been with us for the whole show get excited the best is yet to come and learn a lot of our listeners like we're talking about are are are looking to replace their income with trading investing some are looking to upgrade their lifestyles with a little additional income\nAnd and you could even call it maybe that that supplemental side that you were talking about a few minutes ago and and some are looking for this to go beyond that supplemental and be their primary source of income\nAnd I've even heard people say that they're number one goal is to be able to fire their boss now now whether they're going to or not you know being in that position where you can make that call you know that starts to be that primary source of income but what are some of the key things that you guys worked with students who are looking to supplement or they're looking to even build this is a primary source of income that's a great\nQuestion Ryan you know what I find with a lot of our students they first come into the academy thinking they want to make a lot of money when reality what they're looking for is freedom we've been doing this for over Twenty years we have over four hundred and fifty thousand students now in the academy and what we find over and over again especially coming to this class\nIs that they are really looking for freedom as I mentioned that could be they want to leave a job they don't like they want to spend more time with their families\nThey really are looking to take a vacation may people now are so nervous about going on vacation because they'd lose their jobs if they even took a day or two off we're living in this constant stream of stress right now and what I'm finding is a lot of our students who come in thinking they want to make a lot of money\nIt's really about that freedom and it's funny or a guy named Adam was one of my students\nAnd he actually did just what you said he wanted to come in here he was miserable at work and he finally got to a point we could trade and actually go into his boss and say I have enough\nAnd I had enough think about that to be comfortable enough so if all this did right now is bring you one really profitable trade wouldn't it be worth just coming in and exploring the opportunities here\nAbsolutely just kind of chicken things out and seeing what it can do for you and that whenever we talk about the half day classes whenever we talk about anything even have to have to class we always talk about risk versus reward and\nReally specifically when you ... back to the half day class you know they have to classes or three hours long and see if you end up winning a a set of tickets to one of these you really investing three hours worth of your time and what if\nWhat if that three hours worth of your time was able to show you how you really could replace your income or how maybe you could raise your income by ... percentage so that you could have that financial freedom that Larry it was just talking about and that's really\nKind of the key to all this and you know what you were touching on was was the freedom side and and really those conversations go go fairly deep with with individuals one on one where you say you know what are you looking to accomplish this I go I Want to make an extra thousand bucks a month and\nThat's a pretty quick conversation but then you say why ... why do you want to make an extra thousand bucks and now that financial freedom conversation starts where you know ... it's a it's a nice detailed process of well you know what my kids do this or I Want to do that and there's all these goals that they want to start accomplishing and\nPart of what you need usually to accomplish those is a little more time one of the ways that helps you have a little more time is to have income coming from somewhere else having that supplemental side of income you know where there's lots of different ways where we can build up the supplemental income it can be through a passive channel they could be through an active channel it can be through commodities it could be dropped as it could be their stocks but\nOne of the things about it is is we ... is one of these you always talk about I guess I should say there is is how multiple streams of income are are really kind of crucial throughout this whole process and you know the the average millionaire I think has has five or greater\nStreams of income and so when you think about it like that that is that those those pieces supplementing each other if one goes away it's really no big deal you just get strategic and you build out another one now it's also one of the reasons why the the word job Jay obese stands for just over broke because if we just have one stream of income\nAnd it goes away well we're we're in her city right we're in stress city we're we're we're scrambling hopefully we've got a little bit of savings to buy us a little time but it ended up being that kind of\nThat that that downward spiral or even just stuck in a rat race so to speak of well if we lose our job hopefully we have some savings we use our savings while we find another job and then we just getting another job and doesn't the cycle probably just continue\nWho are really out there trading they do have their retirement accounts and and when I talked to our students I'm hearing a lot of people say you know number one they either don't have enough money to retire on you know our number to those that do they're not quite sure really how to continue the growth\nAnd to protect the downside right and that's really that point you were getting at a before he took the break and so I'd love to give you kind of giving you the floor here to take that back over border some of the things you and your instructor team are doing with investors to help make sure they have income for retirement\nAnd the number one mistake that most people may cause they think they can do this on their own then they wind up coming back and realizing they need the education so we start talking to our students about is how they can start\nCreating a strategy for success when it comes to the retirement right now you know it's funny when the market started to go down this week a lot of my friends call me and they started going what does this mean they started getting all nervous not one student\nEmailed me and said Larry do you see this is a bad thing in fact\nMost people who know what they're doing they're elated that this is starting to happen most people waiting ten years\nFor another market correction why because statistically the markets always tend to correct about every ten years or so last major when we had was obviously in two thousand eight here we are in two thousand Eighteen\nSo what's now becoming more important than ever is it took people about six years to recover from the last correction\nPeople out there listening if you don't have six years right now well you're planning to retire\nYou don't have anything saved right now you need to figure out how to create a plan to help protect you and a lot of our students come in the door\nReally nervous about I don't have enough money to start well you know what they're doing right it's pretty fascinating they're starting to learn how to trade other asset types like futures in ... and they're saving that money from trading and they're starting to fund their retirement accounts\nSo again a lot of people first thing they always say is like the mortgage that got the kids' college up on\nTheir retirement always comes last\nSo we start to teach her students read out of the gate\nThat they can come up with a plan they understand most importantly\nWhat you need is because a lot of people the one size fits all does not work when it comes to retirement you can't just do this you first have to figure out what your needs are learn how to manage that need most importantly how to learn some really important risk management and how to protect that money\nAnd then at the end of the day you'll have enough to retire on based on what you need not someone else is telling you what you need\nYou when you're talking about the kind of the cycles that the markets go through the big us in the big dams and we do generally have a crash about every and we call them crashes but we do generally have a nice big drop in the markets about every ten years\nAnd one of the things about that is if you go back and look at um how often\nThey're forty fifty sixty percent drops and so kind of that average uh that we can expect is about a fifty percent if you go back into two thousand and eight new kind of measure that you've got about a fifty percent drum Becky fifty eight percent about fifty eight percent you go back into their early to thousands fifty say the same thing\nAnd so if we come to here and we say OK here's here that's kind of what we can expect again that's kind of the new normal\nThat the thing that I went through with my father about ah well yeah we had a conversation about this you know back in about two thousand and eight\nOr you know we're talking about drops in the market we're talking about drops in accounting and one of the things that we're we're kind of walking through was\nIf somebody had a fifty dollar if somebody had a hundred thousand dollar account\nAnd they lost fifty thousand and they lost fifty percent will they lost fifty thousand so now they're account value is that fifty thousand that happened in one year\nIt ... happened I think it was fourteen months total rights that happened in pretty much just a year it went down when they take the average rate of return on the way up and let's just be very very generous and let's say somebody is averaging ten percent on the Web\nThat's ten years just to get back to break even 'cause when you take a hundred and you turn it into fifty\nTo take fifty and turn it into a one hundred requires a one hundred percent return on our money and so one of the conversation we were talking about was how long does it take the average person to really even get back to break even after going through a big catastrophic drop like that so\nOne of the scariest things right now is that people just don't have a plan that don't know what to do they haven't been educated and so unless you're really sitting there thinking about this and say to yourself fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me and\nAlbert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes was the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again it's amazing how many people are not willing to spend a little bit of money to get themselves educated to invest in themselves\nInstead of taking this big roller coaster ride and think about it Ryan going back to two thousand and eight if you knew when to get out of the market and locked in profit\nAnd then in two thousand nine you were sitting in cash it could have been one of the greatest time of your life right now a flu shot at three hundred percent increase since two thousand nine yet most people had no money because they lost it all in the correction\nYep absolutely one of the things we can do to help a few people really start to identify where to get in and where to get out where to protect where to grow as you get 'em out to one of the half day classes you ready for a little give away let's do it right now we've got to have the class coming up in your area and a half the cost of ... exactly that how to generate more income how to keep that retirement account growing\nHow do you identify these turning points up down or sideways\nSo you'll know when to buy and you could know when to sell you could you could go back to the old know when to hold them know when to fold 'em type of the conversation on just a second you have a chance to win a set of passes or one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving\nRight now is a great time to pull over included with your passes is going to be our professional insiders kit that is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nThe professional insider kitten makes it so you get started right now\n... century twenty we need you to call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com\nAnd see if you can score some passes there\nNow Larry I always I always said everybody when and I tried to say it on the show as much as I can well you have two dollars or two million dollars adapted classes where you really get to see exactly what it takes to really get that money working for you and you were talking about it earlier as far as having our money working smarter for us and that's just doing the right things with our money\nYou know we've always also been talking about the market's being at all time highs and the risks that we have in there and then my dentist office I bring this up a lot on the show but it just it's so true inside of the financial markets\nThat might Dennis off as a kid shout out to Dr are buckle there's a plaque on the wall and every examination room where it says\nFor don't worry about your teeth and they'll go away you know being that same situation here that unfortunately has been proven true time after time and it's don't worry about your money don't worry about your retirement account and they'll go away\nYou know well let's just think about what people are doing right now in this moment we've been told that every two weeks it's supposed to be investing in an Ira or some type of retirement plan which is great and then nothing against that poor people are not paying attention to is where they're investing that money\nAnd for the last two years people investing all time highs\nAnd so think about it you're at an all time high\nWeek after week that's when you're investing your money and all of a sudden the market corrects well that correction is going to impact the first\nMoney or the last amount of money that you basically have invested into so now you've put majority or money in the market the last two or three years when it's been higher and higher and it takes a tremendous fall and this is why we said it earlier the market falls three times fast and then it goes up\nAnd as a result people see that fifty percent evaporation of wealth\nAnd that immediate sea of seeing that freaks out now let's take it a step further\nWhen the market goes down that dramatically like it did in two thousand eight what's next the loss of jobs for pictures and housing dividend cuts vivid and cut so all these things\nHave a greater impact than most people believe and yet there are people out there that continue every single day to roll the dice and take a chance and said this won't happen to me\nYeah there's a huge risk out there and that is a huge need for multiple streams of income and not just today but multiple streams of income throughout our life throughout every stage of our life\nTo create that stability and one of the things we can do to really help people get kind of jumped started into this multiple streams of income lifestyle is to get them out to one of the half the classes are we still got a few passes here we can give away let's do it right now we've got to have to class going up in your area they have their classes where you'll see exactly what it takes really keep that retirement account growing\nMake sure we have income for today income for tomorrow and really generating and focusing on building out those multiple streams of income when the second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes on these half their classes switch phones ready and if you are driving now is a good time to pull over\nIncluding with your passes is going to be a professional insiders kitten other kids packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhanced in your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation ... capital preservation crypto currency is much much more\nThe professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now ... century twenty we need you to call now and\nReserved those seats the number is eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up\nBeing colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com and see if you can score some passes there we've got to take a quick break we'll be right back Larry\nWhere they have a force next let's talk about the lifestyle of a trade or a lot of our students are so happy they can move out of where they were to where they are now let's talk about what they do my favorite part\nOf every movie it's got to see the editors cats that's what we're going to do when we come back from this break actually heard on the lifestyle of a traitor right\nAnd number two they never do go back to the education 'cause they blown up the money they had\nSo what do good students do I talk to them all the time number one\nThey realized in the twenty first century that they can take a laptop anywhere in this world right now it doesn't matter because as long as they have an Internet connection and their laptop\nThey can trade all over the world in fact we had a student named B or and he's in San Diego and a lot of times are students feel it's too hard they can't do it well not only has ... done this and his left his job which is exactly what everybody wants to do right we want to quit a job you don't love to do something we do love\nHe's become a excellent trader and he's also now started funding his wife's real estate business\nSo the two of them are doing something together\nSpending more time together spending more time on vacations in family but the important thing here Ryan is it they're loving what they're doing and there's so many people out there and if you're one of those people hopefully you can see how you can benefit from just learning a skill that can give you the freedom that you desire yeah absolutely and it's\nKind of interesting is we're as we're sitting here talking about the lifestyle of a traitor I'd just literally receive a text message from a dear friend of mine and it just popped up on my phone and he was actually somebody who got me started in trading he was one of the first people who said this is how you open an account these are the steps that you go through\nIt very very first conversations these just become a lifelong dear friend of mine and he's a huge ski bum he lives up in Salt lake you just ski travels around it as a great time\nHe just texted me with a picture of snow ski saying hey can you use these this season or should I take him to the ... because\nIf I go up to Salt Lake ... bum a pair of skis from him rather than a hall in mind around\nBut it it's just there's just so much freedom that can come with it and it and it really ends up just pulling down to a couple of basic steps a couple of basic as you were saying changes or actions that need to be taking because I think it's very critical it's very important it's it's very powerful once we do understand\nThat that that poor is just the state of mind right that passing over opportunities repeatedly and it's something that can be really easily changed just by stepping out of our comfort zone right just by stepping out of our comfort zone and doing something different we talk a lot about\nKind of cliche statements on the show here but it's because they're so true and they're so useful and it goes back to if we've always done if we always do what we've done will always get what we got in and if we're completely satisfied with where we are than than great let's continue to do what made us so happy in the first place\nBut if we want a little bit more for trying to cook it created a little more income if we're trying to create a little more freedom if we have a specific goal\nThat we're trying to accomplish that we haven't been able to get to we have to make the necessary changes and that's one of the life lessons that my grandfather share with me my whole life growing up he would hold up his five fingers and I would have to ... them the first one is no your business the second one is be converted\nAnd that converted one as a youngster I honestly didn't understand what it meant and as I got involved with trading and I really started to go kind of soul searching down is is this something that's gonna work for me am I going to be able to do this\nThat converted when I started to realize was\nMake the necessary changes the necessary metamorphosis do what's necessary\nAnd and and in the beginning and that was the one I always kind of didn't put as much emphasis on when I was like ten eleven twelve even Eighteen Nineteen twenty you know but then as I really started into my my grown up years I started realizing\nHow be converted that pointer finger of the five to me became the most valuable because if we don't make the necessary changes we're never going to accomplish that kind of outlier goal\nThat were after one of the things we can do to help a few people get started with this as we've still got a few tickets we can give away let's change some lives right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area\nThat they classes where you see exactly where it takes to really take control of the finances really taken truly a retirement account generate more income inside of the market's really lived that life that drafter and just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a good time to pulled over\nIncluding with your passes is going to be

eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up\nColors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com and\nIf you can score some passes there now Larry one of the things that I always like to say and I said earlier on the show is doesn't matter if you have two dollars or two million dollars it's all about getting that money working for you and really getting it to generate that income so you can live the lifestyle you can reach the financial freedom goal that you're after\nBut what are some of the things are what are some of the other kind of examples I Know you have your bags and bags low the view of these examples for our students that you've talked to that we're in one place that are now in another well the first thing we always understand here is that with\nTrading it's simply a transfer money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing\nAnd what's really sad as people will get themselves stuck think about just time right now people can sit in front of a television for hours versus going out there and learning a skill that can help them and every year and you know we're coming up to the holiday season again we started seeing all these Jim commercials again right\n'cause here comes resolution time and one of those things I hear a students say over and over again is beside wishing having had more time was\nThis was the year I Want to get out of debt and I want to turn my finances around and what's amazing is how many students\nCome in through the clashes that we're doing right now and simply imagine what their life would be like if they can learn a skill to help them generate more money\nAnd that's the key it's about doing something taking action and getting out there to change your current situation again if you're a coach shovel and something that you are really interested in learning how to do there is no limitations here in fact one of my students June\nShe actually came to my class and she said all she wanted to do is play golf in Costa Rica and so she started realizing that by learning how to trade gave her the time to do that I should it's great just sent me a postcard and she did and she said she was trading because that's a whole another piece of it\nPeople go on vacation Ryan right and they decorate the vacation they're making money to pay for it and so I asked you and your training before after golf she goes\nBefore of course and I love that of course\nYeah we're talking with a group of students just a little while ago did a big trip through Europe and I remember him saying\nYou know where we were trading out in Europe and we made as much money out on our trip was we actually spent on the trip so it's kinda fun to come back from a trip with a with a with a flat balance or even being up after having a great after having a great time\nAnd that's the thing is it doesn't matter where you are you just have to have an Internet connection doesn't matter where you are and it doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter what your background is it's all about just proactively identifying good opportunities and that's really what we introduce you to insure you exactly what it takes how to do that\nInside of the half the class and we are pretty much at the end of the show but before we end where you say we do another give away\nYour let's give at least ten more people the opportunity to get some tickets here\nOh right right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area and a half to classes ... exactly what it takes\nTo really reached that financial freedom generating more income in the markets like I always say if you're why is big enough you will find out how how is out at the half the class you know just a second you're going to have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these have to classes to get your bones writing if you're driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluding with your passages are professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like Hansen your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currencies and much much more\nThe professional insider kitten makes it so you get started right now ... when he did a call now and reserve those seats\nThe number is eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up being\nColors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ...

the logic behind what occurred and why it worked out for us\nHere Gary ... the regional banks are which we had invested in\nAre going to be negatively impacted as rates continue to move up\nAnd regional banks as a general categories not one particular regional bank in our ATF program in our mutual fund portfolios et cetera in our new ... no not in the ... but we did have regional banks is a sector and those are portfolio certainly did Gary sold them yup\nAnd as rates move up a those banks are particularly impacted in two ways by raising rates a number one the demand for mortgages as you might imagine is going to go down and already we've already seen that happening a new home starts a ... there was a report out today news to homeless ours are lower\nUm and as mortgage rates continue to go up and going to have a negative impact on the housing industry which impacts uh the business the walks in the door particularly for regional banks because they're very very important in the mortgage a ... arena\nAnd number two it's more expensive for them to borrow money uh from other banks from the fed if they need it\nNow somebody might say well is still buying cheap and and the lending it out at a very high rates of the big remains the same\nYeah well a spreads actually narrow is rates go up Gary I'm because they can't always pass that difference on to the consumer as quickly as they would like\nAnd then why did we buy oil we bought our oil Gary because I'm rising\nFirst of all rising rates indicate a concern about inflationary pressures from the fed a now there's there's one argument that says the inflation is not there yet and we're really not seeing it in the numbers um but\nDown the road and may become a significant factor I'm number number\nTwo oil companies are traditionally cash rich um and and they continue to be so they're very high dividends which are well supported not only by their cash flows Gary but by the cash reserves so we have continue to use oil in our dividend program\nAnd we have some oil stocks they're paying in the neighborhood of five percent we do and uh people enjoy the dividends and again getting back to what I was saying before what is it you care about you care about your income loss of principle\nOr market fluctuation of course oil stocks can fluctuate in price when you have an issue\nWhere Saudi Arabia acknowledges they killed somebody in the Turkish embassy and our presidents threatens them you think oil prices might fluctuate you bet they do perhaps that's an opportunity when they come down that's the way we look at it and we have regular meetings in our from\nWe have your your research department meets about three times a week we have an investment committee meeting every month and we make decisions for our clients where the opportunities where the risks\nAnd it's been working since Nineteen Seventy two it has um so if you want ladies and gentleman a a an opportunity to have your portfolio examines stressed tested\nThere's no obligation no cost you can get in touch with me I'll be happy to be with you I'll be happy to entertain any questions that you might have\nYou are often shocked when you get the return call for me personally don't be shocked I Do return my calls and by the way so it is Peter Peter returns is cause a and um You're welcome to pull either one of us\nOne eight hundred three seven seven fifty seven fifty seven Peter thank\nYou very much for your commentary it's always very very well thought oh my pleasure Gary\nFor a moment on fire a mandatory withdrawals I think they should change the rules how many have you have reached Seventy and a half and you're forced to take a mandatory withdrawal and pay the tax\nAnd you don't need the money what do you do with it or you put it back in the market or you go spend it somewhere but you only get maybe eighty or Seventy percent of what you pulled out because the government ends up grabbing their tax\nWhen that was originally set up the Seventy and a half your age people did not live as long as they live now\nI Am for anybody working for the IRS who's listening to this program tell your boss has changed the age to eighty nine seven eight and a half and at least get rid of the half that is so confusing we're living longer now this is not going to happen the fed is counting on the tax\nIt would imbalance our budgets but I Want to at least rattling the saber here because I hate having to take money out for our clients at Seventy and a half when they don't need it I also hate college loans that are charging seven and eight percent\nCan't stand them it's not fair kids come out of college and the burden for years and years and years with having to pay off college debt growing at seven and eight percent you know why they charge so much because they can\nColleges keep raising tuitions\nBecause they know they're being funded by college loans why don't we maximize the amount of college debt to thirty thousand I'm picking a number out of the year if you did not have the ability to borrow more than thirty thousand on college loans you think colleges would continue to inflate tuition by seven or eight percent a year\nI'm not running for office um venting\nI'm Gary Goldberg when we return I'm going to be joined by the former\nSecretary of HUD his name as wholly on Castro

on money matters please discuss a lot of issues that range from the economy to leadership and we have the opportunity to have leaders in various fields join our program a lot of them have come from a unique path\nTo success one of those individuals who's going to be joining me now is wholly on Castro the former secretary of HUD housing and urban development he is with me here on money matters he has a new book out\nOr I'd like to focus in a different place than we have a lately been lately we've been focused on benefitting a\nBig corporation says wealthier individuals which I don't begrudge people success\nBut I Do think that we'd better balanced about\nBut you know that higher interest rates affected adversely smaller companies more than larger ones so would you allow the Federal Reserve to continue to raise interest rates if you were guiding them\nWell I think we need to see how a our economy develops a you know I wouldn't make a pronounced than on that right now but uh it's clear that we're in a different faith now that it's taking deferred action at\nAre considering different action that ad in the past\nUm my hope is that we're going to have in the next two years steady leadership with regard to that because uh you know some of the leadership in Washington has been much for political or with regard to the fact that we're used to say\nWithout getting political on my part when our president says the fed has gone crazy and that's a quote the said operates as an independent entity\nFrom the executive branch and I think that's very important for people or recognize or they're not going to create a recession by raising interest rates if ah they are able to control raising rates and I think that whomever is going to be our president whether it is who he on Castro or President Trump or whomever will be\nA very aware of the impact that can have on the average person would I Want to do is really guide people to pick up your book is entitled an unlikely journey a and it is all about the American dream because you have lived in and will continue to live it Leon Castro thank you for your visit here on money matters\nThanks a lot for having to carry I appreciate it\nYou're very welcome best wishes to you\nI Hope you enjoyed that discussion I think what are the best questions I asked who young Castro whose contemplating running for president in twenty twenty\nIs why the heck with anybody in their right mind would be president I ran for president in my high school and I lost that at that time I Will never run for anything again it's just not worth it now I understand commitment I understand service\nBut you are really setting yourself up for a lot of\nHatred and uh I think services very important but it's a difficult difficult job and we see how that works\nI also want to re emphasize that the Federal Reserve has to be independent of the president so I don't want whomever the president is to criticize the Federal Reserve that's the point of checks and balances here and I don't think Jerome Powell will succumb to any of the verbiage that is coming out of our president\nWill be back and just a moment I'm Gary ... this is money
