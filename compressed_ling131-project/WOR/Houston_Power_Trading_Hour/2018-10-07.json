{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "Maybe they were trying to pull a short cut on you and they've they've tried to take shortcuts with your process and it's actually sometimes cost you a little time energy and money but you've been ... oh a a passionate about making sure that the process stays pure the product stays pure and that it does what you said an invasion from the beginning talk about that\nAnd and when I started talking 'cause I'm an invite likes to come on the microphone was her because there's some experiences that I Want him to to share with us on this [noise]\nIt's interesting as you can imagine through the years we have had company up on company come in and talk with us and I had a dear friend actually come with his dad early on and they saw the the possibilities here and [noise]\nAnd they came in and they they want it to invest into us and so then I sat down and they said so what's your exit strategy how we can make money on this and I said\nMy exit strategy is is the epitaph on my on my tombstone is says made a difference in this world and changed lives and quality that literally that is my answer to that sure we just couldn't ever get it together and there's and Lex got the experience of seeing many times for example I'm just going to put it out there but the\nPeople wanted us to go a multi level time after time and companies that wanted us to and then we would sit down because yeah I mean we needed to make money and we need to be right through the bad times\nAs as a business you started this as a way to help your patients so that business side of it was something you had to get a learning curve on and grow and kind of shepherd from day one\nThis is not something I never thought I'd be doing I Love practice I Love people\nAnd so so as we started doing this do people started you know coming out of the woodwork and it's interesting that people then we would say no there's some there's a ... a major\nThere's a major health food chain that wanted to do something with but when they\nThey wanted us to change it everyone every single time they want us to change it\nEvery single time they wanted us to to cheapen it because it had to be cheaper\nAnyway there was this one multi level that they were doing something and then in some third world countries and helping people and they said you know if they get to these it's better than having to to cap so this is better than nothing and they started to convince me just and things like that and so we started talking with them came down to the line\nWhen they were they had already a multi level business they were doing they just wanted to replace it with a slogan play yeah\nAnd so we found out they were paying how much how much like was it that they were paying per bottle for those vitamins a dime\nA dime and they were selling them for sixty dollars ... and and and so when and that was from the manufacture of manufacturing without making money too that's right that was their prize they weren't even making themselves\nAnd they were then they they just had a good story they were telling these people that they would become into financially independent and blah blah blah when it came down to it they found out that over half of our costs are actually in the product [laughter] they were like whoa whoa whoa we can't do that where you got to do this or that and that's when they came you know how about two and a captain\n... obviously we could never make it work\nOne of these guys that that was doing this one's fun they just wanted to make something work\nAnd we've and flew we had flown out with our attorney because we thought something was going to work with this and everything and\nAnd and it just and then it got down okay so how are we going to make it cheaper and I was like I won't change the product that won't change what we do\nWe won't do that these are the studies I have this is why it works is how it works I won't change it whereabouts changing lives\nAnd if if you could sit in fact I invite you Kevin come and sit in on one of our our staff meetings and just to hear it on the phone is one thing that you should come and sit and see the tears that are shared by some of our our health coaches when they tell the stories of who they've helped to this week\nThat's what our staff meetings are about ... they talk about their successes\nAnd we share them and we and that's what we are and so any ways that we actually produce our own product we've tried we have tried to to get it out because we we thought it'd be easier working with government entities and things that that it would be easier to do that way\nThere's quality could not pass our standard right we wouldn't send it out we literally would not send it out I said you know give me those bottles I'll take them home and eat them but I'm not going to send those out to\nThe the fact that there's such a high standard in the a product that's in your capsule and the\nContent of what's in every bottle or is really unparalleled and so it's one of those things friends where when you get in and Dr Howard says this and the commercials on a regular basis but when you when you when you pop open the plastic live the bottle\nAll the the sealed foil seal off [noise] if you don't get a whiff when you open the fruits of very strong fruit and it just it just walked right up to your nose and the same with the with the veggies or if you don't ... then you're not you're not taking balance of nature\nIf you don't get that smell if you don't think that there then take one of the capsule and open it up and taste it yeah I I challenged with anything else out there you won't get it we don't use and we don't fill it with things like like alfalfa\nWell and the thing is you've picked thirty one fruits and vegetables as the combination of this all base going back to our previous discussion on the chemistry of what those specific fruits and vegetables mind\nYou take the three and three and they work in combination how they work in combination and you take those three and three every day you're going to be taking the equivalent of ten servings of a salad made those thirty one fruits and vegetables\nNow I don't know how much salad you're currently are ingesting but if you're not eating ten plate fools of it with these thirty one specific fruits and vegetables in it you're gonna miss the nutrition that is in the compact form of these caps with nothing but whole food\nAnd when you say whole food it's skin it's\nIt's see it's it's all the stuff that that that's in that food when feasible yet writer example is the whole apple\nSold pineapple now we take the skin off of some things right 'cause that's not necessarily yeah double portion right [laughter] but yeah every edible part is there and it's very important and we're the only ones who do that we have to have that made special for\nA while and you have to do it under your control because again if you try to outsource that than even the producers will try to cheapen the process and you can't do you can't it just doesn't you can't run the\nRisk friends I Hope that this has been

a you will are you ... ... New York\nNew York this is talk station you'll see rated number one seven\nTen W O o voice of New York and\nIt's like driving a car if anyone said T well you can go anywhere you want to go in this world right now but the court can only go and drive you can never put it in reverse\nIt'd be pretty frustrating Dr number one you're educated enough to know that the car goes both directions well most people don't realize so did the markets you can trade when the market's going up you can trade when the market's going down and what most people have learned\nBy coming to the academy ... becoming educated and not trying to do it on their own is if there's a simple step by step process is system regardless of how old you are your background your education level if you're somebody who's ... somebody's committed you can make money trading the markets like the banks do\nYeah and when you look at how we learn how to do anything it's really how we learn how to trade and invest as well it doesn't change just because we're in the investing world and and the thing that the thing I was stressed inside of my classes is that we focus on the skill and that was one of the things that my\nMy mentors really pushed on me about Fifteen sixteen years ago was focused on the skill and the money will come the the the issue ends up being is it's a natural tendency for us to stare at the money right out of the gate and we want to make I got to me I Want to make a hundred dollars a day we got to do that starting right now right rather than building the skill if you have the skill you can generate the money but you have to have the skill first so many times\nWe tried to put the cart in front of the horse there and that's where the appropriate type of mentoring and teaching and different things like that can can can really help you know too many times we we approach the markets and and and when I talk to people it's very normally that did they say\nIf I say I I lost a question are you looking for a get rich quick program you know and and everyone always says oh no no no I'm I'm not looking at looking for that and I say well good 'cause that's not what the financial markets are this is where you really have to develop the skill to be able to go in and generate income but once you have the skill\nOh you can generate the income but the skill has to come first and\nIt's the the patience of developing the skill that really determines in my opinion whether or not somebody is successful or not it's just like I I compared to flying an airplane I mean how comfortable would you be if you sat down a inside of a seven forty seven and you're about to fly from LA to New York\nAnd over the intercom you heard the pilots say well good afternoon ladies and gentlemen I just finished my Youtube video on drag versus lift we are ready to take off\nRight and that that's not going to get you there you have plenty of knowledge on on how flight actually works the mechanics behind it but as far as the skill to fly and navigate that plane up across the country that's a\nThat's a whole different conversation and we would never get on that plane because that's a life or death situation but unfortunately we do that with our money all the time we did that with a lot of things all the time and and when we're dealing with our money is a financial life or death situation that we can be putting ourselves\nTo absolutely let's face it we've been doing this for over Twenty one years right now we've had over half a million students have come through the academy to learn how to trade the right way the way that the banks make money at the end of the day what you're really hoping to do is find freedom you want to be able to\nFind a way to generate income to ally spend more time at your family some people want to move on to do a different type of job maybe one of volunteer locally in your community the thing that we want to do most is get back the time that we don't want to lose and so\nA lot of our students have been very grateful to come in to spend a little time with us and learn how they not only can generate more income but also save themselves more time\nYeah absolutely we're coming up next to a break when you say we squeeze in another give away let's do it All right well we've got our half day class coming up and your investment in there

stellar\nCentury twenty when you get a call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at Sochi\nA Wall Street dot com and see if you can force a vast there we've got to take a quick break but Larry what are you have a force that let's say on this topic why we've been talking about income generation about how to make come without necessarily have to get a second job more income talk with Ryan and Larry we'll be right back\nIf you can invest just about three hours to open yourself to strategies that can make you financially secure for life would you do it\nFor over Twenty years on line waiting academy has transformed lives worldwide with their exceptional trading and investing education and they would like to invite you to a free half day investing class near you\nHere's one one racing graduate had to

dying and that they're happy\nAre you ready to start living the life you've dreamed of learn more visit us on line at O T a Wall Street dot com that's OT a Wall Street dot com\nBoom back you're just tuning in humans Larry Jacobs and director of instructor development and top instructor it online training and the brains of the operation here that's for sure he was sending some light\nOn how to make money as the markets are going up down or sideways how to generate more money how to generate more income and consistent income\nNo matter which way the market is going and whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time listening or maybe you've been with us for the whole show don't worry the best is yet to come and learn a lot of our listeners are looking to really replace their income with trading and investing in some of them are just looking to fulfill that New Year's resolution of upgrading their lifestyle with a little bit of it is of additional income\nUm you know some of them are looking just to kind of supplement things other people are really out in that situation where they want to fire their boss there's a whole a whole gamut of kind of ultimate goals that people have when it comes to generating more income but there is that one consistency between all of these groups it all boils down to another source of income we've talked a little bit about multiple streams of income passive income\nActive income and I want to use as you were saying the last in the last segment want to spend a little bit of time kind of diving a little bit deeper into these topics and and when you guys are working with people specifically looking to to branch out their streams of income what's what's that starting point and what does that pathway kind of look like well\nStarting off with your whole idea about resolutions I mean we're coming up at that time of year Ryan where we start getting a barrage of videos and and ... and all this stuff about why we have to go to the gym you start seeing TV commercials because one of the biggest resolution says what losing weight the second biggest is getting out of debt\nAnd this is something that a lot of students come in now the reason why most people are poor\nP. O. R. because they're passing over opportunities repeatedly we've been talking about this in the last segment you have to make a decision right now you have to shift\nFrom worrying about how you're going to make money to being able to think beyond just survival and a lot of our students come in\nThey don't realize is a simple step by step process of how to make money is like institutions do you've mentioned this many times we talk about J. P. Morgan Chase for example this bank has only had what was it nine losing days and five years\nCrazy well a lot of people are constantly going into the markets uneducated not really understanding how the markets work and then scratched their heads when they lose money the market was designed for people to make money if you understand the rules\nSo a lot of times like anything else with a job out there people start working they spent time at a job they get better and better at it before they know what they're getting promoted they're getting to do other type of things and get more and more responsibilities\nWhat I've talked to students about their biggest concern is right now is what if we have another major correction where they're going to be able to make up that income\nAnd you know it's not a question anymore if it's when we're already starting to see\nReminiscent of what happened in two thousand seven or the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates again we're starting to see housing prices going down again the construction industry is starting to to go down again so there are opportunities here for people to not have a situation happened to them again like it did before\nAnd I don't think anybody out there is on their deathbed going you know Ryan I Wish I could a worked another day\nYeah yeah that's not the that's not the norm when it comes to New Year's resolutions it's like you know we did a big New Year's resolutions ... back in January on the show and it'll be fun to do another one this next January but one of the things\nThat we we went through if you recall as we went through the top the top ten on New Year's resolutions and and one of them was like I Hope I work like you were saying I Hope I work till the\nFor the day I die and and and other ones where I Want a downgrade my lifestyle and and and and unfortunately those are those are reality is that that that a lot of people end up in but they don't need to right they don't need to end up in those situations and it really just takes a couple of small tweaks\nI I did a I did a lecture I don't even know it was it was probably eight years ago and I stumbled upon a recording of it a couple of days ago\nAnd the whole point of the lecture was about how little things become big things\nAnd so you can look at it you can look at things where you say okay well well what if I could generate a little more income and what if it was five dollars a day right now at five dollars they could turn into ten dollars a day could turn into twenty dollars in it started with that five dollars a day and next thing you know a few years from now or maybe five years from now it's five hundred dollars a day right but it had\nTo have a starting point it goes back to some of the phone calls you always throw in like the ... and stuff like that where I I and I might miss this up so if I Do correct me with it on it but it is\nYou don't have to be great to get started but you have to get started to be great right there's there's all sorts of fun things like that\nThat are out there that are that are will call cliche but they're also so true right there is so true and they're they're they're they're necessary for us to say they're necessary for us to hear but then there are also necessary for us to take action on if we want to generate that extra income because that's really\nThose monies were protected because it was coming out of their payroll are coming out of profits and it was put aside the separate account and it wasn't subjected to what was happening in the markets will everything in your four O. one K. is not protected in fact if you think about a congressional people and senators they don't have for one case they have\nPensions intentionally because they want to make sure that they have this money available through our taxes will right now you should be thinking about especially if you're putting money in every two weeks into your Ira we're four one K. you're investing at all time highs\nAs you might have mentioned I don't remember but let's just worth repeating that the market falls three times faster than it goes up so right now if you've been investing the majority of your money in the last couple of years at all time highs right now than it is a lot more room for this money to fall you should be concerned\nBecause we saw what happened back in two thousand eight it was a four O. one K. that became a two oh one K.\nAnd again it took about six years to recover well this is much higher than we've ever seen before in fact if I look at the Buffett index speaking of course of Warren Buffett right now it's higher and more extended than we ever see that index have been in the past\nAnd this simply means that if we have a correction and things continue what's to say this four one K. won't become a one oh one K. and do you have the time right now to be able to put off your retirement and still work when you thought you were going to be able to finally retirement and start living your life\nYeah and the the the the the way to make money in the market hasn't changed or a thousand years we're talking about it earlier when you brought up shorting and making money as the markets are going down\nIt's always been by low so high and it will always be by low so high most of what's the probability of buying an all time highs as being you buy low up or opportunity right can markets go higher than they absolutely can we're taking on a lot of risk in those situations\nThere's ... there's constant pull back there's constant wholesale offerings even as the markets are going higher and over paying for things is is really what limits are potential upside and ... opens up the downside for ah\nFor for risk you know we we talk a lot about the the bullish biased and how as consumers we just usually sit there and buy everything we Bye bye Bye bye bye And right now the markets are going higher and higher and every pay the average person buys more stocks they buy stocks through their mutual funds for their for one case\nAbout through their RSP through their IRAs doesn't matter what account type it is that ... that the general practice kind of around the world is on payday we just buy stocks\nWell it doesn't matter what the prices though just matters that it's payday and so we are going to invest into it now the markets are collapsing our financial advisors have a brilliant way of of of talking to us about why it's okay to continue to buy as the markets are going down\nRight a ... dollar cost averaging as the market's going down they say by more by more by more is it's going down and then when it comes back you're going to be rich and while\nThat math actually makes a whole lot of sense the problem ends up being is we don't stop buying when it's on its way up if all we did was by on its way down dollar cost averaging would be very powerful strategy but\nWhen you're averaging your price back up buying it these all time highs offsets all the money that was invested in that for a while and came back in two thousand nine and we're taking the\nAverage price up with us which which raises are risk exposure and lowers are profitability and in the end it's for one reason in my opinion my humble opinion and it's because Wall Street's businesses to sell us products and that's OK right we just have to know that\nA Wal Mart's businesses to sell us products too and that's how they make money and I don't think they're evil right and they'll think Wall Street's evil but as the customer not client noticed I use the word customer\nAs the customer we have to understand that what we're what we're doing when we're when we're engaging with somebody when I go to Walmart I realize that I'm not planning on making money I'm just buying something from them and if that's the same thing that that's happening with us with Wall Street we've got a kind of take that into consideration with the\nWith the kind of analysis that we're doing on the situation are we planning on making money on this transaction if the answer is yes\nHow do we plan on making money on this and usually the answer after that unfortunately is is I don't know but that's where getting a little bit of education on how the markets work can go a long way and I say a little bit can go a long way and it really can a little bit of education\nWill put you miles in front of the average investor one of the ways where we can help you do that as we got a few more tickets so we can do a little give away as long as there he says okay let's do it right now I've got to have their class coming up in your area that have to classes where you can see exactly what it takes to keep that retirement grown whether the market's going up down or sideways have more income for today and more income for tomorrow\nAnd just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluding with your passes is going to be a professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional insider kept makes it so you get started right now\n... century twenty we need you to call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com and see if you can scores and passes there\nYou know we've talked a lot about kind of the growing side of things with their retirement accounts really getting those retirement accounts to generate more incomes what about the protective side of things we've got we have a group of people out there who have made a bunch of money as the markets have been going higher than piling money into those accounts and what can they do to protect against the downside without limiting the upside\nWell most importantly you need to understand where your risk reward relies so many people imagine if I took it back to two thousand and seven what if you learn a skill that I told you to go to cash back in December of two thousand seven and then you would have had cash in your account\nBasement bargain prices buying stock back on the way up and that's really what banks were doing they had one of the best years of their lives in two thousand eight fact I speak to our students all the time they're waiting for the next correction Wall Street has been waiting for the next correction at some point they'll be another decade long windfall coming back\nAnd it's almost like you had the opportunity here to get a nice financial do over but most people again think they know best a lot of people I talk to you don't even know what they have in their retirement accounts how much they're paying fees I mean what if I told you\nThat about thirty percent of your say retirement money is going to go out the door in fees to your brokerage company that would probably infuriates you switch you have to start doing right now is thinking well if I hadn't been able to put aside money right now learning how to trade for income\nEnables you to start saving money what you can put toward retirement once you understand the right rate of return that you need to be able to compounded annually\nYou can start thinking about generating the money you need to retire the right way and again this comes down to getting yourselves edgy\nThey did what I said before earlier is that most people make the greatest mistake possible try to wing it on their own by reading books are watching Youtube videos and you'll see right right I I'm not going to go on line learn how to fly a plane from Youtube video and then go up to fly in school and go watch the Youtube video can I get in the cockpit right now and take off\nDoesn't make any sense well the same thing can be said about your money as as I Love from the movie the pursuit of happiness Chris gardener mother played portrayed by Will Smith once said the cavalry ain't come and you have to care more about your money than anybody else and that means protecting yourself by getting yourself educated as quickly as possible\nWhen whenever you whenever you bring up the pursuit of happiness and you say the covering coming it always reminds me of another quote a and I don't know where it originated from but our our our friend Keely would always say it over and over she'd always say this life is not a dress rehearsal\nOver and over I heard her say that a million times I don't remember where she got it from but we'll give credit for that one right now now one of the things about the fees that you were touching on that I just want to elaborate on before we jump into this break is as you were talking about thirty percent can end up going to fees and there was an article that I saw a little while ago that shows how the average person spends three years of their life\nPaying for the fees so if you make fifty thousand dollars a year you can expect to be about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in fees if you make a hundred thousand dollars a year you could expect to pay about three hundred thousand dollars\nIn fees one of the things you can do to avoid those fees is really take control of your of your money before you should do that you need to know how to do it\nWhat great place to start that just started that educational process is out of one of our half the class and we just happen to have a stack of tickets here Larry are you ready I'm ready All right well right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area and a half day class\nAs we can see exactly what it takes really take control those retirements generate that income for today and make sure that you have that income for tomorrow and it just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of past as one of these half day classes\nSo if you're driving now is a great time to pull over and get that phone ready now included with your passes it's going to be our professional insiders kit that is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors my favorite thing about the professional insiders ... is it makes it so you can get started right now ... century twenty when he did a call now and reserved those seats\nThe number is eight eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three\nIf you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com\nAnd see if you could force that we've got to take a quick break but Larry what should we talk about the lifestyle trader how your life changed once you're able\nGoing to pull back the curtain on a day in the life of a traitor stick with us right and there will be right back\nIf you can invest just about three hours to open yourself to strategies that can make you financially secure for life would you do it\nFor over Twenty years online training academy has transformed lives worldwide with their exceptional trading and investing education and they would like to invite you to a free half day investing class near you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Houston Power Trading Hour", "city": "New York", "day": "07"}
