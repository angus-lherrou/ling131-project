before nine eleven [noise]\nWe lost twenty four guys in a line of duty in my job and a twenty of them were good friends of mine and guys that I worked with and it was really getting to me and I didn't even realize it but once I started writing about it and put it on paper\nI they're out of my mind I didn't have to think about them anymore and I'll talk to people who've outer anytime they want but uh I don't have to think about it so that's why I started writing books and then a publisher told me I think you've got two more books and and he was right\n[laughter] and they're great\nThey really were on the thing is is it it really supports the whole aspect of of that try to help that spiritual mental emotional side is so important\nAnd and that's another part of it and put that with the chemistry and sure it's going to boost up fills physical side just just dip would boost up two sides of it it's going to boost up the third and I and that's just awesome and that and these\nAre the reasons your the reason fill that that I was inspired to do this product I didn't set out to make a product I Love being a doctor but when it when it hit me I thought I Need to do this about like you did you you need to write those books\nRight right and I had to put the first book [noise] the title of the first brokers laughter tears and muscle drums I had to put laughter in there because I had to put some funny stuff because there was just too many tears you know\nYes yeah but it was all\nBut I was having a depression and that was before nine eleven ... that was the ten years before nine eleven from made it a Ninety Nineteen Ninety One to two thousand and one then nine eleven hit\nAnd that was like a and I was supposed to work that day I work the day before and uh which was my birthday September tenth\nAnd that was relieved by two of my best friend's sadness cross who was a battalion chief in my division tank commander and he was acting deputy that night so I was relieved at six o'clock on Monday Night\nBy Dennis and to me ... Paul who is the captain and a ... road with him because there was no place for him to work every ... every\nEvery unit was covered so when that happens in a captain is assigned to work he rise with the deputy chief and that's what happened or that morning they wrote together and ah I never saw them again\nCan you just give us the name of the books really quickly and\nShowed her first book is a

a large airing of this program constitutes neither an endorsement of the products offered boy the ideas expressed Shelley you will are are you a few ape detail New York\nNew York's the most and this

allowed to continue following Saturdays deadly shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh\nGoldman Sachs may two hundred million dollars in one day by simply shortening the market now that imagine that we just have a little piece of it I'm not going to be greedy you know but if you start to learn how to treat like the banks do then it's amazing\nThat all of a sudden you can start learning a skill that can make money and not have to sit there and think about a second job or to get into a little bit later\nBut one of the ways I look at this and I get this analogy all the time when people are just simply trading one direction or they're waiting for the markets always go up it's like a car imagine that you were told you can get in a car tomorrow and you can drive somewhere but you can't put the car and reverse\nYou're going to go in a lot of circles eventually going to get there but you gotta wait till a lot of time energy and money getting to the same place if you simply had all the tools to get you there faster so a lot of what I'm seeing our students learning the first time is it they're becoming\nDirection ... they don't care if it goes up down or sideways as long as the markets are moving they can learn how to make money and what a lot of them are seeing right now is they could create more freedom for themselves because they're able to make money no matter where the markets go\nYeah absolutely and I love I Love the analogy of the car and there's so many so many other analogy that we could pull into this that in in I always say in real life you know outside of the are investing life in our normal everyday life we there's no way we buy a car that didn't go in reverse right but so many times we find ourselves in investments that only have one direction or one avenue where they can profit\nYou know it's it's the same thing you go back to our you know go back to high school education and where was your stock picking class where was\nPut a balance a checkbook class right the law to check it out right I just dated myself victory over there but it is it's true though I mean we we really didn't have\nThat stuff and so we're left to to rely on the quote unquote professionals really guide us through this process where unfortunately they make a commission off of these transactions and I say unfortunately kind of tongue in cheek there because that's okay with me that they make a commission that's\nThat's what they do for a living you know real estate brokers make a commission when they sell real estate so stockbrokers should naturally make a commission when they sell stocks\nBut when we buy a home it is up to it was up to the individual to make sure that they're buying the right home for them in the right market place in the right area that the right payment the right everything it's up to the person to do it\nThe broker just completes the transaction and unfortunately it's up to the person to also make sure that they're making the appropriate decision when it comes to their investing but when it really boils down to about Ninety nine percent of the world\nHasn't ... they they spend more time analyzing the menu when they go out to dinner than they do analyzing what investments to to select\nIt it just puts us behind the eight ball and it's something that I think if we did a quick give away with a few more of these passes we could probably make a dent in and help people start making better investment decision I think it's a great idea let's do it All right well right now I've got a half day class coming up in your area

Ga Wall Street dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nWe are up against it need to take a quick little break Larry what do you have a four seconds\nTalk about more about the income they were talking about here but I Want to focus on incomes are you having to get a second job for the call that passive or supplemental income and we'll talk about that right when we get back to Larry\nIf you can invest just about three hours to open yourself to strategies that can make you financially secure for life would you do it\nFor over Twenty years on line training academy has transformed lives

ready to start living the life you've dreamed of learned more visitors on line at O T a Wall Street dot com that's OT a Wall Street dot com\nWill come back and if you're just tuning you miss Larry Jacobs director of a structure development and top instructor it online training academy really shuts of life on consistent returns in the market\nSo one of my favorite topics though talking about consistency in the market\nSo many times I'll run into different traders different investors and they've had some success they've had some success in the market but they really had a hard time duplicating it and that ends up being the key\nReally in anything that we do is how can we make money consistently ugly make money over and over and the financial markets are no different it's all about that consistent approach\nBeing able to make money as the markets are going up being able to make money as the markets are going down and also being able to make money as the markets are going sideways we need to be generating income whether it's income for today or income for tomorrow in this segment we're going to spend a little bit more time talking about the income side of things but whether you're just tuning in\nMaybe your first time listener may have been with us for the whole show get excited the best is yet to come and learn a lot of our listeners like we're talking about are are are looking to replace their income with trading investing some are looking to upgrade their lifestyles with a little additional income\nAnd and you can even call it maybe that that supplemental side that you were talking about a few minutes ago and and some are looking for this to go kind of beyond that supplemental and be their primary source of income\nAnd I've even heard people say that they're number one goal is to be able to fire their boss now now whether they're going to or not you know being in that position where you can make that call you know that starts to be that primary source of income but what are some of the key things that you guys work with students on who are looking to supplement or they're looking to even build this was a primary source of income that's a great\nQuestion right you know what I find with a lot of our students they first come into the academy thinking they want to make a lot of money when reality what they're looking for is freedom we've been doing this for over Twenty years we have over ... fifty thousand students now in the academy and what we find over and over again especially coming to this class\nIs that they are really looking for freedom as I mentioned that could be they want to leave a job they don't like they want to spend more time with their families\nThey really are looking to take a vacation may people now are so nervous about going on vacation because they'd lose their jobs if they even took a day or two last we're living in this constant stream of stress right now and what I'm finding is a lot of our students who come in thinking they want to make a lot of money\nIt's really about that freedom and it's funny I got him Adam was one of my students\nAnd he actually did just what you said he wanted to come in here he was miserable at work and he finally got to a point we could trade and actually go into his boss and say I have enough\nAnd I had enough think about that to be comfortable enough so if all this did right now is bring you one really profitable trade when it'll be worth just coming in and exploring the opportunities here\nAbsolutely just kind of chicken things out and seeing what it can do for you and that whenever we talk about the happy classes whenever we talk about anything even at the half the class we always talk about risk versus reward\nAnd really specifically when you ... back to the half day class you know they have to classes or three hours long and see if you end up winning a a set of tickets to one of these you really investing three hours worth of your time and what if\nWhat if that three hours worth of your time was able to show you how you really could replace your income or how maybe you could raise your income by X percentage so that you could have that financial freedom but Larry it was just talking about and that's really\nKind of the key to all this and you know what you were touching on was was the freedom side and and really those conversations go go fairly deep with with individuals one on one where you say you know what are you looking to accomplish this I go I Want to make an extra thousand bucks a month and that's a pretty quick conversation but then you say why\n... why do you want to make an extra thousand bucks and now that financial freedom conversation starts where you know ... it's a it's a nice detailed process of well you know what my kids do this and I want to do that and there's all these goals that they want to start accomplishing\nAnd part of what you need usually to accomplish those is a little more time one of the ways that helps you have a little more time is to have income coming from somewhere else having that supplemental\nSide of income you know where there's lots of different ways where we can build out the supplemental income it can be through a passive channel it could be through an active channel it can be through commodities it could be dropped as it could be through stocks\nBut one of the things about it is is we ... is one of these you always talk about I guess I should say Larry is is how multiple streams of income are are really kind of crucial throughout this whole process and you know the the average millionaire I think has has five or greater\nStreams of income and so when you think about it like that that is that those those pieces supplementing each other if one goes away it's really no big deal you just get strategic and you build out another one now it's also one of the reasons why the the word job Jay obese stands for just over broke because if we just have one stream of income\nAnd it goes away well we're we're in her city right we're in stress city we're we're we're scrambling hopefully we've got a little bit of savings to buy us little time but it ended up being that kind of that that that downward spiral or even just stuck in that rat race so to speak of well\nIf we lose our job hopefully we have some savings we use our savings while we find another job and then we just getting another job and doesn't the cycle probably just continue your building out these multiple streams of income uh or something that seems to be\nWho are really out there trading they do have their retirement accounts and and when I talked to our students I'm hearing a lot of people say you know number one they either don't have enough money to retire on you know our number to those that do they're not quite sure really how to continue the growth\nAnd to protect the downside right and that's really that point you were getting at before he took a break and so I'd love to give you kind of giving you the floor here to take that back over border some of the things you and your instructor team are doing with investors to help make sure they have income for retirement\nAnd the number one mistake that most people may cause they think they can do this on their own then they wind up coming back and realizing they need the education so we start talking to our students about is how they can start creating a strategy for success when it comes to the retirement\nRight now you know it's funny when the market started to go down this week a lot of my friends call me and they started going what does this mean they started getting all nervous not one student emailed me and said Larry do you see this is a bad thing in fact\nMost people who know what they're doing they're elated that this is starting to happen most people waiting ten years\nFor another market correction why because statistically the markets always tend to correct about every ten years or so last major when we had was obviously in two thousand eight here we are in two thousand Eighteen\nSo what's now becoming more important than ever is it took people about six years to recover from the last correction\nPeople out there listening if you don't have six years right now or you're planning to retire\nYou don't have anything saved right now you need to figure out how to create a plan to help protect you and a lot of our students come in the door\nReally nervous about I don't have enough money to start well you know what they're doing right it's pretty fascinating they're starting to learn how to trade other asset types like futures in Iraq and they're saving that money from trading and they're starting to fund their retirement accounts\nSo again a lot of people first and they always say is like the mortgage I've got the kids' college up on\nTheir retirement always comes last\nSo we start to teach her students read out of the gate\nThat they can come up with a plan they understand most importantly\nWhat you need is because a lot of people the one size fits all does not work when it comes to retirement you can't just do this you first have to figure out what your needs are learn how to manage that need most importantly how to learn some really important risk management and how to protect that money\nAnd then at the end of the day you'll have enough to retire on based on what you need not someone else is telling you what you need\nYou when you're talking about the kind of the cycles that the markets go through the big us in the big dams and we do generally have a crash about every and we call them crashes but we do generally have a nice big drop in the markets about every ten years\nAnd one of the things about that is if you go back and look at um how often\nThey're forty fifty sixty percent drops and so kind of that average uh that we can expect is about a fifty percent if you go back into two thousand and eight new kind of measure that you've got about a fifty percent drum Becky fifty eight percent about fifty eight percent you go back into their early to thousands if the same the same thing\nAnd so if we come to here we say OK here's here that's kind of what we can expect again that's kind of the new normal\nBut the thing that I went through with my father about a year we had a conversation about this you know back in about two thousand and eight\nOr you know we're talking about drops in the market we're talking about drops and accounts and and one of the things that we're we're kind of walking through was\nIf somebody had a fifty dollar if somebody had a hundred thousand dollar account\nAnd they lost fifty thousand and they lost fifty percent will they lost fifty thousand so now they're account value is that fifty thousand that happened in one year\nAnd that drop happened I think it was fourteen months total right that happened in pretty much just a year it went down when they take that average rate of return on the way up and let's just be very very generous let's say somebody is averaging ten percent on the Web that's ten years just to get back to break even 'cause when you take a hundred and you turn it into fifty\nTo take fifty and turn it into a one hundred requires a one hundred percent return on our money and so one of the conversation we're talking about was how long does it take the average person to really even get back to break even after going through a big catastrophic drop like that\nSo one of the scariest things right now is that people just don't have a plan they don't know what to do they haven't been educated and so unless you're really sitting there thinking about this and say to yourself fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me and\nAlbert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes was the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again it's amazing how many people are not willing to spend a little bit of money to get themselves educated to invest in themselves\nInstead of taking this big roller coaster ride and think about it Ryan going back to two thousand and eight if you knew when to get out of the market and locked in profit\nAnd then in two thousand nine you were sitting in cash it could've been one of the greatest time of your life right now at at three hundred percent increase since two thousand nine yet most people had no money because they lost it all in the correction\nYep absolutely one of the things we can do to help a few people really start to identify where to get in and where to get out where to protect where to grow as you get them out to one of the half day classes you ready for a little give away let's do it right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area and a half the cost of ... going to see exactly that how to generate more income how to keep that retirement account growing\nHow do I identify these turning points up down or sideways\nSo you'll know when to buy and you could know when to sell you could you could go back to the old know when to hold them know when to fold 'em type of a conversation on just a second you can have a chance to win a set of passes or one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving\nRight now is a great time to pull over included with your passes is going to be our professional insiders kit that is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nProfessional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now ... we need you to call now and reserved those seats\nThe number is eight eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up\nBeing colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nNow Larry I always I always said everybody when and I tried to stay on the show as much as I can have two dollars or two million dollars adapted classes where you really get to see exactly what it takes to really get that money working for you and you're talking about it earlier as far as having our money working smarter for us and that's just doing the right things with our money\nYou know we've always also been talking about the market's being at all time highs and the risks that we have in there and then my dentist office I bring this up a lot on the show but it just it's so true inside of the financial markets\nThat my Dennis off as a kid shout out to Dr are buckle there's a plaque on the wall and every examination room where it says\nFor don't worry about your teeth and they'll go away you know being that same situation here that unfortunately has been proven true time after time it's don't worry about your money don't worry about your retirement account and they'll\nAway you know well let's just think about what people are doing right now in this moment we've been told that every two weeks is supposed to be investing in an Ira or some type of retirement plan which is great and nothing against that\nBut what people are not paying attention to is where they're investing that money and for the last two years people investing all time highs\nAnd so think about it you're in an all time high\nWeek after week that's when you're investing your money\nAnd all of a sudden the market corrects will that corruption is going to impact the first amount of money or the last amount of money that you basically have invested into\nSo now you've put majority or money in the market the last two or three years when it's been higher and higher and it takes a tremendous fall and this is why we said it earlier the market falls three times fast and then it goes up\nAnd as a result people see that fifty percent evaporation of wealth\nAnd that immediate sea of seeing that freaks out now let's take it a step further when the market goes down that dramatically like it didn't in two thousand eight what's next the loss of jobs for pictures and housing dividend cuts devastating cuts so all these things\nHave a greater impact than most people believe and yet there are people out there that continue every single day to roll the dice and take a chance and said this won't happen to me\nYeah there's a huge risk out there and that is a huge need for multiple streams of income and not just today but multiple streams of income throughout our life throughout every stage of our life\nTo create that stability and one of the things we can do to really help people get kind of jumped started\nEnded his multiple streams of income lifestyle is to get them out to one of the half day classes we still got a few passes here we can give away let's do it right now I've got to have to class caught up in your area they have their classes where you'll see exactly what it takes really keep that retirement account growing\nMake sure we have income for today income for tomorrow and really generating and focusing on building out those multiple streams of income when the second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes doing these half day classes switch phones ready and if you are driving now is a good time to pull over\nIncluding with your passes is going to be a professional insiders kitten other kids packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation ... capital preservation crypto currency is much much more\nThe professional insider kitten makes it so you get started right now ... century twenty when he did a call now and reserved\nThose seats the number is eight eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up\nBeing colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ...
