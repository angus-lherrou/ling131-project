{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "You're a doctor of Medicine Dr Howard and yet you really recognize that the spiritual\nThe emotional the mental um aspect of life plays a big role in someone's overall health\nWhat plays a role in his your quality of life and that's what we're losing in medicine is we're ... we're we're forgetting about quality of life we don't save lives if we don't have quality left in it\nAll of those aspects has to be\nWorked with and and your your good physician does work with that and and and you know if you've been to a physician and you walk out I don't care if they save your life to the surgery but they're rude and mean\nThen you don't really feel real great and you might go home still depressed or whatever it is by more depressed or more the more fearful that yeah that's frequent and more fear that drives me crazy when\nWhen we're taught and medicine to use fear to get people to do it we want no bounds of nature we use education jobs here means teacher so so that people can make that choice not fear I don't believe in fear factors\nAnd the house Chad is also just magical and ... ... one wonderful thing as a health costs when you're working with people\nAnd sometimes there's decided they helped try ad that people can't face you know they're just they been working on it long enough and they're done they're like I'm given up on the physical and I can't lose weight or I Can't do whatever I'm done I'm not going to work on that anymore and so\n... the health coaches that if you just work on two sides of the triangle the third one comes up naturally on its own so we just say okay let's set that aside for now and let's look at the other two\n... and ... it improves and then as things improve than they get more\nWilling to look at that site that so difficult for them\nSo you have a health coach that takes a customer or through the various ways in which the fruits and veggies interact perhaps with other medications or how much you should take what time you should take them what are some of the different roles that health coach fails when they start taking balance of nature\nWell the main goal of a health coach is\nBecause we are results based company is to make sure that our customers are getting results or well you know we all there's always results with balance of nature all you have to do is take it and and we teach our health coaches that because that is absolutely true we've done the research we know that we know the results that you're getting\nOn the human ... if you'd just to swallow them but you don't always feel it\nExactly whether you fill it or not the result is there and you know I I Hope this person doesn't mind that I use the example ... names anyways but just just yesterday I had a wonderful experience speaking with a man\nAnd um and in relation to what you're talking about what do we talk about with our health coaches his it's based upon the try out of help and that's what I built after five six years of practice and I started to realize and see this that\nEverybody's health is based on three factors and and a lot of people think oh I've heard this before but not this model of it\n'cause we're based upon a chemical aspect of health that's nutrition that the air we breathe the drugs everything in our body it's a chemical we are a chemical laboratory so everything is based upon the raw materials of ... of of chemistry\nAnd then then there's good and there's bad okay and then there's the physical side of help and that's an aspect we have to we have to address always and then there's the at the the mental spiritual emotional side of that is all one that's not three different things\nThat's one side of your health tryout and so we work on goals on all three of those sides to help people really see the greatest benefit and for example I was with somebody yesterday and ah\nAs I was talking with him is a good man and so one of his goals you know they'd written down be good to people do kind things for people and those are all important but I just looked at him finally I said\nYou do all those things you are that person you could just see it in him and fill it from him and finally I looked at my you know what you're what you're dealing with is fear\nBecause fear and face cannot coexist you can't have them in the same space one chases the other out and so\nWith tears he finally said you're right\nI don't trust I Need to change the trust in my life and he left with a new resolve to trust to trust in the process of his body to trust in the process of things to trust in people\nAnd he he will have a whole change in his life because now we're working all three sides we had some other goals of walking and being active and and and obviously was with nutrition we had several several goals but until we found that one he wasn't a change person\nHe will see results now\nWe're going to take a short break and we'll be right back with more from Dr Douglas Howard and Susan Howard don't go away\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule\nReally does work I've had a great expense and not not getting the little allergy calls and stuff in the spring and in the hall tribute it to that because I shut down\nUh I actually stopped my vitamins that I Would take you know sticking a regiment of vitamins and I think sickly stopped all of them and then went on this and this seems to be beneficial for me\nThat made me feel better I mean you know at my age if I can keep up with all the animals and they work\nIt just helped me feel that I think the products are wonderful and I take an every day at work\nFor a limited time used discount code wor and we'll take thirty five percent off your first preferred sets of fruits and veggies\nAnd have them shipped to you free call eight hundred two four six eight seven five one or go on line to balance of nature dot com and used discount code W O R\nWelcome back to the balance of nature show I'm your host Laura Smith and we are talking about why whole foods or the answer to many health problems versus taking supplements that have vitamins\nI'm the founder and formulate or a balance of nature Dr Douglas Howard and his wife Susan how hard\nDr Howard is a medical doctor had real practical Dr researcher and specialist in spite of nutrients Dr Howard what is new is that you can tell us with balance of nature and and truly what do I know you do research continually you're one of this perpetual scientists\nDon't know what you're learning ... even more and more as the results come into the company about what the wonderful people who are taking this product what it's doing for them\nYou know it was beautiful the balance of nature is it's not new is the oldest form of nutrition on the earth and that's exactly what it was made for us you know yes I'm always researching and finding and driving a towel on why does it work\nBut the beauty of it is we don't have to reinvent it every couple of years and make it special a new because the formula for balance of nature has been here for thousands of years on the earth it's one hundred percent pure fruits and vegetables [laughter]\nThere's nothing at it and nothing taken away from it except for the water it's pure produce\nIt took years of which fruit and which vegetable and and how they would interact with each other and studying that through and then doing studies with with the electron microscopy to different universities so they could study by electron microscopes\nHow it was affecting the DNA the very best and then some of the studies we were doing was how it would affect the immune system the most you remember the game pacman of course okay well you've got white blood cells in there that run around like pacman going you know to to eat up the bad things\nAnd that's what those white blood cells are out there to do so we tested how many of those white blood cells could be out there to eat up the things that shouldn't be in your blood\nAnd how quickly they could respond those immune studies\nThose DNA studies and studies about how the red blood cell could receive the nutrition and receive oxygen so get out to where I needed and also even studies about the ... the blood or in other words the thickness of the blood how it flows through the beans and can get to the smallest possible vessels\nAll of that put together then I studied which fruits and vegetables and combining those until we had sixteen different fruits and Fifteen different vegetables\nThat made the greatest impact on those things and in the DNA for example how could protected the most and how quickly the DNA could repair itself wind damage to those are all things that help prevent aging diseases\nIt's always such a great pleasure to speak with you Dr Howard and Susan Howard from balance of nature when I find remarkable is how easy balance of nature has made it for me to get more than\nTen real whole servings of fruits and vegetables every day it really is remarkable beautiful benefits at the ... the whole health system\nAnd just so much about what good nutrition means and what it can mean for everyone's life no matter what age it's a real pleasure thanks for being on today\nThank you it's great to be here thank you laugh\nThey're proceeding was paid programming W O ... airing of this program constitutes neither an endorsement of the products offered boy the ideas expressed\nShelley you will are are you a exhale ape detail in New York\nThis is talk rated number one seven ten W O R voice of New York I\nAnd we've been doing this for over Twenty years right now is that feeling of when you first start making more money than you do at work because then all of a sudden you're this frog again you can jump very very high and all of a sudden that kept\nThat you've been believing your whole life has gone away\nAnd that's the sad part right now 'cause most people out there are stressed out that they have to stand a job they have no other outcome or vehicle when reality you can go ahead and you can short the markets\nSo great analogy like when I use is each week and I like using it as well I've said this over and over again when you're learning how to short the market meaning you're able to trade when the market goes down\nVery legal coach ... and the great part about it as think of yourself in a car right now and you know you want to go somewhere but if the ... only one and drive and never went in reverse\nYou can eventually get there it's not going to be cost efficient for gas or time but you'll eventually get there where why would you want to do that people do that everyday Ryan what they're trading they're only looking in the markets to go higher\nAnd as you said when the markets go lower it could be an opportunity to buy at a discount it doesn't always mean there's a problem with the stock\nYeah absolutely right there there's opportunities all over the place and and I love what you're talking about what the frog because\n'cause it it you know I was teaching a class last night and I have another session with with the same group tonight and you know I was talking about how a lot of the the the obstacles that we have to overcome our mental right and and what you're talking about the frog hitting it's had on the box and you move the box and all of a sudden they can jump up\nIs that it it is that ceiling that we're putting on ourselves right and we we have the whole oh I Can't do that type of a conversation and I have a five year old son who who over and over the the words I Can't or or just not even really allowed in our\nI was because we do start to put those uh would you start to put those binders on us and make it so that we realize oh if I jump high it's gonna it's gonna hurt my head as we stop even trying\nYou know a while ago they are you know I'm ... years and years ago they they said it was physically impossible to run a four minute mile a vis the about a week ago there was the world championships for Iron Man and Kona\nAnd the the winter and about a six minute mile for twenty six miles after doing a hundred mile bike ride wow if you can't run a four minute mile you're you're not even on Olympic lipic track and field team anymore at least one for a minute mile not not to mention back to back to back right\nSo so so these these these these restraints that we put on ourselves we also put on our finances\nAnd we end up kind of painting that our own picture that we ended up residing in it and if you're if you're willing to kind of challenge the norm and you're willing to put in a little more effort\nOr a lot can be granted to you and it really just does come from getting started and putting a little bit more effort in but we could help a few more people get started we've got a stack of tickets here the show is just beginning what are you saying we do another give away let's

ready to start living the life you've dreamed of learned more visitors on line at O T a Wall Street dot com that's OT a Wall Street dot com [noise]\nWe'll come back if you're just tuning in human is Larry Jacobs and director of instructor development and half instructor it online training academy\nShed some light on consistency in the markets were talking about generating\nMore money we're talking about generating more income whether the market's going up down or sideways we're talking about how much the market dropped a little bit ago you know it's been about a week or so since we had the big drop in the markets but when you look at those opportunities they are they are that they are opportunities to generate into give generate more income and essentially give yourself a raise\nAnd it really is important to remember that\nThe more that money is made on the way down just like the money has made on the way up and so really we wiped out number one we wiped out three months worth of gains on this last market drop\nIf we didn't know how to make money as the markets were falling\nIf you do know how to make money as the marks were going down if you have that skill\nYou're able to generate as much money in a week as over the last three months combines so it ends up being these great opportunities as one of the reasons why whenever we have a market crashed there is a new wave of billionaires that come out of it yes billion with a B right billion with a B come out of it and a lot of times they're looked at as a\nA a not so there look that was not such a pleasant light we could say because when they made all that money a lot of people were losing money no a lot of people were losing money in there and those are individuals though who look at a down market as a bad thing\nNow these individuals that were turning themselves in for millionaires and billionaires they were looking at a down market as an opportunity they had the skill set they had that knowledge\nThey knew how to approach that down market\nSo to think about a job if you had a job where you got laid off one third of the time that wouldn't be a very consistent stream of income but a lot of times with the Bush biased with only making money is the markets are going up that's kind of the situation our income in our retirement accounts or in if we are reliant on just one simple direction the markets go up down or sideways\nAnd if we only make money when the market goes up well there's two thirds of the time two thirds of the direction where where especially laid off or we're not allowed to go to work and so that's one of the reasons why it's very difficult to follow kind of that classic just simple bullish biased\nHave consistent growth you look over the last nine ten years we've had this great bullish move but how much opportunity has been lost on those down opportunities how much opportunity was given back in two thousand eight when the market crashed and if we don't have that skill set going forward this could be the beginning of this next big downturn\nWhere we could give back fifty or sixty percent of our retirement account how 'bout instead of that\nInstead of going through that process again how about we understand how to make money at the market's going down we start doubling up on this stuff\nNo absolutely you know it's funny because one of the things that most people don't understand they start trading on their own and they make mistakes all the time and here's why the number one mistake most people making their lives when it comes to trading if they want to try it on their own first and then maybe get some educational a bit later on well here's the problem that most people don't understand\nFive percent of the wealth right now is being shared by Ninety five percent of the population when Ninety five percent of the wealth is shared by five percent of the people so that means there was five percent of us who have understood the right way to trade how to make money\nAnd what's really scary right now and I talked to a lot of students as I ask them a simple question\nDo you work for more money or just money work for you and most people are working for more money they always believe that they're going to get ahead if they're going to find their freedom and let's face it people start trading are people looking for multiple streams of income and most millionaires we discuss this right have a an average five income streams\nThey're doing so not because they're working harder they're working smarter they're figuring out how to work right and what that simply means is if there's a way to learn how to generate income without having to put more effort that's the best way to do it and most of the time\nPeople don't understand that trading us like a system what's the system\nIt stands for save yourself stress time energy and money love it if you learn how from professionals to do things the right way there's no reason why you can't be generating income as well most people either don't know how to do this or are afraid to do this and honestly\nThey keep going out there in thinking that they're going to attain freedom by working more and more well most people I talk to my students give you an example mc\n... used to work in the workplace he quit he want it to work for himself he wanted more time with his family well if you can learn a skill that will allow you to make money the same way the banks do and you've shared district me many times Ryan J. P. Morgan Chase had only nine losing days in the last five years\nI don't know about you guys but I Want to be on that team that keeps making that money and the only way you're going to do that is by investing in the education learning how to do that can you see how this could help lead you to spending more time with family or just leave a job you don't like anymore\nAnd so many times individuals get caught up in the rat race and you start hearing people use phrases like time is money right and that that's what you're talking about earlier as is exchanging just time and getting away ... getting paid for our time now that the thing that we always like to focus on his money is money Ryan how can we make money\nHow can we make money work for us rather than like what you're saying working for working for money and that's really what starts to to to separate the the the financially independent from the financially dependent out there\nA lot of our students come in they want to learn the right way to be able to preserve capital how to make sure they're in the right funds when they're putting on their traits to be able to maximize for their retirement and well a lot of things that we hear right now is can you see or do you see how this can really help you pretty much preserve capital over the long term\nIt's always buy low so high it has been for a thousand years it will be for another thousand years that that has never changed and that was one of the topics are ahead of my class last night is is the markets don't change the marsh don't change we look at it on a phone\nInstead of looking at it on a on a on a ticker tape but getting printed off right but the market still don't change it's all about by low and it's all about so high and somewhere along the lines we kinda got distracted from that and I think the average investors out they're investing their money on payday and\nThey plan to sell when they're sixty five and none of that has anything to do with price and so if we're not buying it a low price and we're not selling at a high price it's pretty much impossible for us to make any money now one of the fun things about the markets whether it's your retirement account or whether it's your income account it's it's the same right it's it's all about just identifying a low price and buying and identify a high price and selling\nNow we get kind of caught up in this whole\nEmotional back and forth of maybe stocks that we love her or or or things that we want to be invested in rather than being invested in the right things and and uh there's this guy Dan that ah when I first started trading I I I did a lot of work with Dan he was a a great friend ... you know acted as a mentor and many different kinds of aspects\nAnd then used to always say you can't live your stocks they're never going to have you back and he would talk about and he had a little story that help you remember it I won't share though there but it was just kind of funny ... you would say you can't live or stocks they're not going to have you back\nAnd think about it if you're invested into a company right now it doesn't matter what it is\nIf you called them up they wouldn't even know who you are right but for some reason we fall in love with potentially investigated this company who number one doesn't know who we are number two doesn't care about us they don't care about us at all and and honestly why would they write and Larry you're talking about you know taking care of our retirement accounts and how nobody's going to take better care of it than we are\nAnd and it's it is true and the reason\nThat I firmly believe that is because nobody has to live off of our accounts except for us right nobody has to live off of your account except for you\nNobody has to live off of my account except for me and so in the end as kind of courses that can sound\nNobody cares right there's there's not an institution out there that they that they stay up at night going men I Hope I Hope John and Mary have enough money in their retirement account\nYou know what they say that because they want to make sure they have enough fees being paid to them as long as their monies in retirement account but every day there's a new twenty two year old that opens a retirement account replaces somebody who is closing their retirement and they had this perpetual\nKind of ... income stream that comes from that anyway so at the same time though we stay up at night right the average person has many sleepless nights over money but how much time as the average person spent getting educated on how to make sure their money is growing\nRight I I find the financial markets very interesting because we go to a a car dealership and there's a car salesman there and we really don't take his advice on what we should buy but yet we go to a car dealership\nThat has the uh financial institutions name on the front of it where they're selling mutual funds and we take the cells persons advice to heart we go well he's the professional in the situation\nNow with a lack of education that's kind of where we end up ah falling behind the eight ball in the financial world one of the things that we can do is we can help a few more people out with that because we still got some tickets we can give away let's do it\nRight now we've got to have to class coming up in your area that have to cost ... exactly what it takes to really take control those retirement accounts and have them growing generating more income whether the markets are going up down or sideways\nNow included with your half the class including with your past is going to be professional insiders kit now this is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors the professional insiders kitten makes it so you can get started right now\nBecause ten through twenty when he did a call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nNow Larry still kind of on this retirement check I Know there are a lot of people concerned about growing their retirement how can somebody number one protect against this potential downside\nBut also inside of their retirement account is there a way for them to continue growth as the markets are going down\nAbsolutely a little out of our students have figured out they can use other type of leverage assets to actually start accumulating wealth well our stock market is in a downturn so this great ways that students can protect their wealth they can hedge against it they're learning about options\nAnd that's why they can do this three hour session to understand what's possible in the marketplace I can tell you firsthand talking to our students students like myself and you too we've been waiting ten years for this correction think about that\nMost people are dreading a correction we are\nFrantically waiting for it because it could be one of the best years of our lives a lot of people don't understand that again the markets go down there is an opportunity to make money just as the markets go up so imagine learning a skill right now to preserve your capital where you can lock in profits imagine you did that back in two thousand eight\nAnd you had money sitting in cash waiting to buy those bargain basement prices of stocks when they got back to two thousand nine well this is going to happen again it's been happening over and over again\nBut most people continue to do nothing and wait for something that happened like I said again the cavalry ain't come in and the reason why so many people are poor P. O. R.\nIt's just they're passing over opportunities repeatedly so for all this did right now by spending three hours of your time is help you learn how to preserve more capital so that you can retire and the lifestyle that you're interested would not be worth it\nYou know we always look at things in the investing world those risks are award how ... what do I have to risk and what's my potential reward\nWell your investment in this case is going to be about three hours worth of time or half day classes about three hours long so that's your investment that's your total investment is three hours worth of time so\nSo even if you were to say that's your total risk is three hours worth of time what what's the potential reward what if you ended up generating another source of income what if you ended up adding another couple of points of return to your to your portfolio every year 'cause really your risk is only time as far as you're investing three hours of your time to come out to this after class\nBut the rewards are potentially limitless that's a pretty good ratio\nAnd imagine that you learned for the first time that you've been in the wrong things in your mutual funds and your ... can you can learn how to reallocate to give you that rate of return that you that you really want that's what a lot of students are really excited about\nIt goes back to some of those are some of those fun quotes the way I always like to throw out in here as far as you don't have to be ... and I'm going to do this one wrong or you take it it's yours ... yeah I ... I used to always say you don't have to be great to start but you got to start to be great\nAnd unless you do oh you just want to Ryan's as you don't want to spend your golden years at the golden arch absolutely I Love that one\nYou know and and it's all the way over these fun cliches things that we love to throw around but they've been around forever 'cause they're true right and we've heard him so many times 'cause they're true no nobody ever says well no you you don't have to get started in order to be great you know you do you have to have to be great you have to get started but you don't have to\nBe great in order to get started right it's awesome and and I love doing uh I get involved with a lot of different races were actually doing a charity race in a in a couple of days are raising money for cancer and and I always compare it to just a race you have to cross the start line before you can cross the finish line it is necessary\nRight but it is a lot of fun and trading investing you can take this really whatever level you want but imagine ... imagine if\nI imagine if it just made that slightest impact in your life to the positive how worth it with a three hour investment be now before we can get people in the class they gotta have tickets we gotta do give away\nLet's do it All right we're right now we've got a ... class coming up in your area ... really where you'll be able to see exactly what it takes to keep their retirement account growing whether the markets are going up down or sideways you know including with your passes to half the class is going to be our professional insiders kit it's packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nNow the professional insiders kitten makes it so you can get started right now ... century twenty when you just call now and reserved those seats\nThe number is eight eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three\nIf you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com and see if you can score surpasses there we've got to take a quick break we're going to be right back Larry whatever force next\nYou know let's talk about the lifestyle of a trade or a lot of people now are sitting\nHere me interested realizing they want to make a change to make a change in our lives let's talk about what the effects are\nBack the curtain and show you what that looks like right around the brake ran and Larry we'll be right back [noise]\n\nIf you can invest just about three hours to open yourself to strategies that can make you financially secure for life would you do it\nFor over Twenty years on line waiting academy has transformed lives worldwide with their exceptional trading and investing education and they would like to invite you to a free half day investing class near you\nHere's one one racing graduate had to say\nWell my training academy has taught me as he got to have a plan and they gave me the food is maybe a better trader a better plan or I'm a better father\nLed online training academy help you pursue your financial goals so you could have more time to focus on what really matters\nThe kids are static because I'm I'm available now and we can eat together as a family um I get my trading dying and that they're happy", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Houston Power Trading Hour", "city": "New York", "day": "21"}
