{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "You're a doctor of Medicine Dr Howard and yet you really recognize that the spiritual the emotional the mental um aspect of life plays a big role in someone's overall health\nWhat plays a role in his your quality of life\nAnd that's what we're losing in medicine is we're ... for we're forgetting about quality of life we don't save lives if we don't have quality left in it all of those aspects have to be\nWorked with and and your your good physician does work with that and and and you know if you've been to a physician and you walk out I don't care if they save your life to the surgery but they're rude and mean then you don't really feel real great and you might go home still depressed or whatever it is more depressed or more the\nMore fearful to ya that's frequent and more fear that drives me crazy when when we're taught and medicine to use fear to get people to do it we want no bounds of nature we use education jobs here means teacher so so that people can make that choice not fear I don't believe in fear factor\nAnd the health triad is also just magical and ... ... one wonderful thing as a health coach when you're working with people\nAnd sometimes there's decided they helped ... ad that people can't face you know they're just they been working on it long enough and they're done they're like I'm given up on the physical and I can't lose weight or I can do whatever I'm done I'm not going to work on that anymore and so\n... the health coaches that if you just work on two sides of the triangle the third one comes up naturally on its own so we just say okay let's set that aside for now and let's look at the other two ... and ... it improves and then as things improve\nThan they get more willing to look at that site that so difficult for them\nSo you have a health coach that takes a customer or through the various ways in which the fruits and veggies interact perhaps with other medications or how much you should take what time you should take them what are some of the different roles that health coach fails when they start taking balance of nature\nWell the main role of a health coach is\nBecause we are results based company is to make sure that our customers are getting results or you know we oh there's always results with balance of nature all you have to do is take it and and we teach our health coaches that because that is absolutely true we've done the research we know that that we know the results that you're getting\nOn the human cell if you just to swallow them but you don't always feel it\nExactly whether you fill it or not the result is there and you know I I Hope this person doesn't mind that I use the example of not use names anyways but just just yesterday I had a wonderful experience speaking with a man and um and in\nRelation to what you're talking about what do we talk about with our health coaches his it's based upon the try out of help and that's what I built after five six years of practice and I started to realize and see this that\nEverybody's help is based on three factors and and a lot of people then go I've heard this before but not this model of it\n'cause we're based upon a chemical aspect of health that's nutrition that the air we breathe the drugs everything in our body it's a chemical we are a chemical laboratory so everything's based upon the raw materials of ... of of chemistry\nAnd then then there's good and there's bad okay and then there's the physical side of help and that's an aspect we have to we have to address always and then there's the at the mental spiritual emotional side of hope it's all one that's not three different things that's one side of your health try out\nAnd so we work on goals on all three of those sides to help people really see the greatest benefit and for example I was with somebody yesterday and ah\nAs I was talking with him he's a good man and so one of his goals you know they'd written down be good to people do kind things for people and those are all important but I just looked at in five minutes that\nYou do all those things you are that person you could just see it in him and fill it from him and finally I looked at my you know what you're what you're dealing with is fear\nBecause fear and face cannot coexist you can't have them in the same space one chases the other out and so\nWith tears he finally said you're right\nI don't trust I Need to change the trust in my life and he left with a new resolve to trust to trust in the process of his body to trust in the process of things to trust in people and he he will have a whole change in his life because now\nWe're working all three sides we had some other goals of walking and being active and and and obviously was with nutrition we had several several goals but until we found that one he wasn't a change person he will see results now\nWe're going to take a short break and we'll be right back with more from Dr Douglas Howard and Susan Howard don't go away\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule\nReally does work I've had a great dispatch and not not getting the little allergy calls and stuff in the spring and the whole tribute it to that because\nI shut down a ice actually stop my uh vitamins that I Would take a regiment of vitamins and I basically stopped all of them and then went on this and this seems to be beneficial for me\nThat made me feel better I mean you know at my age if I can keep up with all the animals that they work\nIt just kept me feel that I think a products are wonderful and I take them every day at work\nFor a limited time used discount code wor and we'll take thirty five percent off your first preferred sets of fruits and veggies and have them shipped to

R\nWelcome back to the balance of nature show I'm your host Laura Smith and we are talking about why whole foods or the answer to many health problems versus taking supplements that have vitamins\nI'm the founder and formulate or of balance of nature Dr Douglas Howard and his wife Susan how hard Dr Howard is a medical doctor I wrote practical Dr researcher and specialist in spite of nutrients\nDr Howard what is new that you can tell us with balance of nature and and truly what do I know you do research continually you're one of those perpetual scientists\nWhat's your learning ... even more and more as the results come into the company about what the wonderful people who are taking this product what it's doing for them\nYou know what is beautiful the balance of nature is it's not new is the oldest form of nutrition on the earth and it's exactly what it was made for us you know yes I'm always researching and finding and driving up how and why does it work\nBut the beauty of it is we don't have to reinvent at every couple of years and make a special a new\nBecause the formula for balance of nature has been here for thousands of years on the earth ditch one hundred percent pure fruits and vegetables [laughter]\nThere's nothing at it and nothing taken away from it except for the water it's pure produce\nIt took years of which fruit and which vegetable and and how they would interact with each other and studying that through and then doing studies with with the electron microscopy to different universities so they could study by electron microscopes\nHow it was affecting the DNA the very best and then some of the studies we were doing was how it would affect the immune system the most you remember the game pacman of course okay well you've got white blood cells in there that run around like pacman going you know to to eat up the bad things\nAnd that's what those white blood cells are out there to do so we tested how many of those white blood cells could be out there to eat up those things that shouldn't be in your blood\nAnd how quickly they could respond those immune studies\nThose DNA studies and studies about how the red blood cell could receive the nutrition and receive oxygen so get out to where it needed and also even studies about the ... the blood or in other words the thickness of the blood how flows through the veins and can get to the smallest possible vessels\nAll of that put together then I studied which fruits and vegetables and combining those until we had sixteen different fruits and Fifteen but different vegetables\nThat made the greatest impact on those things in in the DNA for example how could protected the most and how quickly the DNA could repair itself wind damage to those are all things that help prevent aging diseases\nIt's always such a great pleasure to speak with you Dr Howard and Susan Howard from balance of nature what I find remarkable is how easy balance of nature has made it for me to get more than ten real whole servings of fruits and vegetables every day it really is remarkable beautiful benefits of the fruits and veggies and fiber and spice the whole health system\nAnd just so much about what good nutrition means and what it can mean for everyone's life no matter what age it's a real pleasure thanks for being on today\nThank you it's great to be here thank you laugh\nProceeding was or paid programming W a large airing of this program constitutes neither an endorsement of the products offered boy the ideas expressed Kelly will are are you a exhale age detail in New York\n[noise] this is talk station rated number one seven ten W O R voice of New York and\nThat all of a sudden you can start learning a skill that can make your money and not have to sit there and think about a second job or to get into a little bit later\nBut one of the ways I look at this and I get this analogy all the time when people are just simply trading one direction or they're waiting for the markets always go up it's like a car imagine that you were told you can get in a car tomorrow and you can drive somewhere but you can't put the car and reverse\nYou had to go in a lot of circles eventually going to get there but you can always a lot of time energy and money getting to the same place if you simply had all the tools to get you there faster so a lot of what I'm seeing our students learning the first time is it they're becoming\nDirection ... they don't care if it goes up down or sideways as long as the markets are moving they can learn how to make money and what a lot of them are seeing right now is they could create more freedom for themselves because they're able to make money no matter what the markets go\nYeah absolutely and I love I Love the analogy of the car and there's so many so many other analogy that we could pull into this that in in I always say in real life you know outside of the are investing life\nIn our normal everyday life we there's no way we buy a car that didn't go on to reverse right but so many times we find ourselves in investments that only have one direction or one avenue where they can profit\nYou know this the same thing you go back to our you know go back to high school education and where was your stock picking class where it was how to balance a checkbook class right the law to check for it I just dated myself victory over there but it is it is true though I mean we we really didn't have\nThat stuff and so we're left to to rely on the quote unquote professionals really guide us through this process where unfortunately they make a commission\nOff of these transactions they say unfortunately kind of tongue in cheek there because that's okay with me that they make a commission that's that's what they do for a living you know real estate brokers make a commission when they sell real estate so stockbrokers should naturally make a commission when they sell stocks\nBut when we buy a home it is up to it was up to the individual to make sure that they're buying the right home for them in the right market place in the right area that the right payment the right everything it's up to the person to do it\nThe broker just completes the transaction and unfortunately it's up to the person to also make sure that they're making the appropriate decision when it comes to their investing but when it really boils down to about Ninety nine percent of the world hasn't ... they spend more time analyzing the menu when they go out to dinner than they do analyzing what investments to to select\nIt it just puts us behind the eight ball and it's something that I think if we did a quick give away with a few more of these passes we could probably make a dent in and help people start making better investment decision I think it's a great idea let's do it All right well right now I've got a half day class coming up in your area that have their classes where you'll see exactly what it takes to generate more consistent income in the

Ga Wall Street dot com and see if you can score some passes there we are up against it need to take a quick little break Larry what do you have for sex\nLet's talk about more about the income they were talking about here but I Want to focus on just require you having to get a second job for the call that passive or supplemental income and we'll talk about that right when we get back to Larry\nIf you can invest just about three hours to open yourself to strategies that can make you financially secure for life would you do it\nFor over Twenty years on line waiting academy has transformed lives worldwide with their exceptional trading and investing education and they would like to invite you to a free half day investing class near you\nHere's one one racing graduate had to say\nOnline training I had I mean has taught me as I got to have a plan and they gave me the food is maybe a better trader a better plan or I'm a better father\nLed online training academy help you pursue your financial goals so you could have more time to focus on what really matters\nThe kid there static because I'm I'm available now and working together as a family um I get my trading dying and that they're happy\nAre you ready to start living the life you've dreamed of learn more visit us on line at O. T. A. Wall Street dot com that's O T a Wall Street dot com\nWill come back and if you're just shooting in Missouri Jacobs director of instructor development and instructor at online trading him he really shut the life on consistent returns in the market\nIt's one of my favorite topics though talking about consistency in the market so many times I'll run into different traders different investors and they've had some success they've had some success in the market but they really had a hard time duplicating it and that ends up being the key really in anything that we do is how can we make money consistently ugly make money\nOver and over and the financial markets are no different it's all about that consistent approach\nBeing able to make money as the markets are going up being able to make money as the markets are going down and also being able to make money as the markets are going sideways we need to be generating income whether it's income for today or income for tomorrow and in this segment we're going to spend a little bit more time talking about the income side of things but whether you're just tuning in\nMaybe your first time listening or maybe you've been with us for the whole show get excited the best is yet to come and learn a lot of our listeners like we were talking about are are are looking to replace their income with trading investing some are looking to upgrade their lifestyles with a little additional income\nAnd and you could even call it maybe that that supplemental side that you were talking about a few minutes ago and and some are looking for this to go kind of beyond that supplemental and be their primary source of income\nAnd I've even heard people say that they're number one goal is to be able to fire their boss now now whether they're going to or not you know being in that position where you can make that call you know that starts to be that primary source of income but what are some of the key things that you guys worked with students who are looking to supplement or they're looking to even build this is a primary source of income that's a great\nQuestion Ryan you know what I find with a lot of our students they first come into the academy thinking they want to make a lot of money when reality what they're looking for is freedom we've been doing this for over Twenty years we have over forty and fifty thousand students now in the academy and what we find over and over again especially coming to this class\nIs that they are really looking for freedom as I mentioned that could be they want to leave a job they don't like they want to spend more time with their families\nThey really are looking to take a vacation make people now are so nervous about going on vacation because they'd lose their jobs if they even took a day or two officer we're living in this constant stream of stress right now and what I'm finding is a lot of our students who come in thinking they want to make a lot of money\nIt's really about that freedom and it's funny a guy named Adam was one of my students\nAnd he actually did just what you said he wanted to come in here he was miserable at work and he finally got to a point we could trade and actually go into his boss and say I have enough\nAnd I had enough think about that to be comfortable enough so if all this did right now is bring you one really profitable trade wouldn't it be worth just coming in and exploring the opportunities here\nYeah absolutely just kind of checking things out and seeing what it can do for you and that whenever we talk about the half day classes whenever we talk about anything you even have to have to class we always talk about risk versus reward\nAnd really specifically when you tie it back to the half the class you know they have to classes or three hours long and see if you end up winning a a set of tickets to one of these you really investing three hours worth of your time and what if\nWhat if that three hours worth of your time was able to show you how you really could replace your income or how maybe you could raise your income by ... percentage so that you could have that financial freedom that Larry it was just talking about and that's really\nKind of the key to all this and you know what you were touching on was was the freedom side and and really those conversations go go fairly deep with ... with individuals one on one where you say you know what are you looking to accomplish as I go I Want to make\nAn extra thousand bucks a month and that's a pretty quick conversation but then you say why ... why do you want to make an extra thousand bucks and now that financial freedom conversation starts where you know you it's a it's a nice detailed process of well you know what my kids do this or I Want to do that and there's all these goals that they want to start accomplishing\nAnd part of what you need usually to accomplish those is a little more time one of the ways that helps you have a little more time is to have income coming from somewhere else having that supplemental\nSide of income you know where there's lots of different ways where we can build up the supplemental income it can be through a passive channel it could be through an active channel it can be through commodities it could be dropped as it could be their stocks\nBut one of the things about it is is we ... is one of the things you always talk about I guess I should say there is is how multiple streams of income are are really kind of crucial throughout this whole process and you know the the average millionaire I think has has five or greater\nStreams of income and so when you think about like that that is that those those pieces supplementing each other if one goes away it's really no big deal you just get strategic and you build out another one now it's also one of the reasons why the the word job Jay obese stands for just over broke because if we just have one stream of income and it goes away well we're we're in her city\nRight we're in stress city we're we're we're scrambling hopefully we've got a little bit of savings to buy us a little time but it ended up being that kind of that that that downward spiral or even just stuck in a rat race so to speak of\nWho are really out there trading they do have their retirement accounts and and when I talk to our students I'm hearing a lot of people say you know number one they either don't have enough money to retire on you know our number to those that do they're not quite sure really how to continue the growth\nAnd to protect the downside right and that's really that point you were getting at a before he took the break and so I'd love to give you kind of giving you the floor here to take that back overboard or some of the things you and your instructor team are doing with investors to help make sure they have income for retirement\nAnd the number one mistake that most people may cause they think they can do this on their own then they wind up coming back and realizing they need the education\nSo we start talking to our students about is how they can start creating a strategy for success when it comes to the retirement right now you know it's funny when the market started to go down this week a lot of my friends call me and they started going what does this mean they started getting all nervous now one student\nEmailed me and said Larry do you see this is a bad thing in fact\nMost people who know what they're doing they're elated that this is starting to happen most people waiting ten years\nFor another market correction why because statistically the markets always tend to correct about every ten years or so last major when we had was obviously in two thousand eight here we are in two thousand Eighteen\nSo what's now becoming more important than ever is it took people about six years to recover from the last correction\nPeople out there listening if you don't have six years right now\nYou're planning to retire you don't have anything saved right now you need to figure out how to create a plan to help protect you in a lot of her students come in the door\nReally nervous about I don't have enough money to start well you know what they're doing right it's pretty fascinating they're starting to learn how to trade other asset types like futures in St Louis and they're saving that money from trading and they're starting to fund their retirement accounts\nSo again a lot of people first thing they always say is like the mortgage I've got the kids' college fund\nTheir retirement always comes last so we start to teachers students right out of the gate\nThat they can come up with a plan they understand most importantly what you need is because a lot of people the one size fits all does not work when it comes to retirement\nYou can't just do this you first have to figure out what your needs are learning how to manage that need most importantly how to learn some really important risk management and how to protect that money\nAnd then at the end of the day you'll have enough to retire on based on what you need not someone else just telling you what you need\nAnd you're talking about the kind of the cycles that the markets go through the big us in the big downs and we do generally have a crash about every and we call them crashes but we do generally have a nice big drop in the markets about every ten years\nAnd one of the things about that as you go back and look at him how often\nThey're forty fifty sixty percent drops and so\nKind of that average uh that we can expect is about a fifty percent if you go back into two thousand and eight and you kind of measure that you got about a fifty percent drum Becky fifty eight percent about fifty eight percent you go back into their early to thousands fifty say the same thing and so if we come to here and we say OK here's here that's kind of what we can expect again that's kind of the new normal\nBut the thing that I went through with my father about a year we had a conversation about this you know back in about two thousand and eight\nOr you know we're talking about drops in the market we're talking about drops in accounting and one of the things that we're we're kind of walking through was\nIf somebody had a fifty dollar if somebody had a hundred thousand dollar account\nAnd they lost fifty thousand they lost fifty percent will they lost fifty thousand so now they're account value as a fifty thousand that happened in one year\nAnd that drop happened I think it was fourteen months total rights that happened in pretty much just a year it went down when they take the average rate of return on the way up and let's just be very very generous and let's say somebody is averaging ten percent on the Web that's ten years just to get back to break even 'cause when you take a hundred and you turn it into fifty\nTo take fifty and turn it into a one hundred requires a one hundred percent return on our money and so one of the conversation we're talking about was how long does it take the average person surely even get back to break even after going through a big catastrophic drop like that\nSo one of the scariest things right now is that people just don't have a plan that don't know what to do they haven't been educated and so unless you're really sitting there thinking about this and saying yourself fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me and\nAlbert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes was the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again it's amazing how many people are not willing to spend a little bit of money to get themselves educated to invest in themselves\nInstead of taking his big roller coaster ride\nAnd think about it Ryan going back to two thousand and eight if you knew when to get out of the market and locked in profit and then in two thousand nine you were sitting in cash it could've been one of the greatest time of your life right now to leave it at three hundred percent increase since two thousand nine yeah most people had no money because they lost it all in the correction\nYep absolutely one of the things we can do to help a few people really start to identify where to get in and where to get out where to protect where to grow as you get 'em out to one of the half day classes you ready for a little give away let's do it right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area and a half the cost of ... going to see exactly that how to generate more income how to keep that retirement account growing\nHow to identify these turning points up down or sideways\nSo you'll know when to buy and you could know when to sell you could you could go back to the old know when to hold them know when to fold 'em type of a conversation on just a second you have a chance to win a set of past as one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving\nRight now is a great time to pull over included with your passes it's going to be our professional insiders kit that is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nThe professional insider kitten makes it so you get started right now ... we need you to call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three

Ga Wall Street dot com\nAnd see if you can score some passes there\nNow Larry I always I always said everybody when and I tried to say it on the show as much as I can have two dollars or two million dollars adapted classes where you really get to see exactly what it takes to really get that money working for you and you were talking about it earlier as far as having our money working smarter for us and that's just doing the right things with our money\nYou know we've always also been talking about the market's being an all time highs and the risks that we have in there and\nThen my dentist office I bring this up a lot on the show but it just it's so true inside of the financial markets that my Dennis off as a kid shout out to Dr are buckle there's a plaque on the wall and every examination room where it says\nFor don't worry about your teeth and they'll go away you know being that same situation here that unfortunately has been proven true time after time and it's don't worry about your money don't worry about your retirement account and they'll go away\nYou know well let's just think about what people are doing right now in this moment we've been told that every two weeks is supposed to be investing in an Ira or some type of retirement plan which is great and nothing against that\nBut what people are not paying attention to is where they're investing that money and for the last two years people investing all time highs and so think about it you're in an all time high\nWeek after week that's when you're investing your money and all of a sudden the market corrects well that correction is going to impact the first amount of money or the last amount of money that you basically have invested into so now you've put majority or money in the market the last two or three years when it's been higher and higher and it takes a tremendous fall\nAnd this is why we said it earlier the market falls three times faster than it goes up and as a result people see that fifty percent evaporation of wealth and that immediate sea of seeing that freaks out now let's take it a step further\nWhen the market goes down that dramatically like it did in two thousand eight what's next the loss of jobs the four pictures in housing dividend cuts vivid and cuts so all these things\nHave a greater impact than most people believe and yet there are people out there that continue every single day to roll the dice and take a chance and said this won't happen to me\nYeah there's a huge risk out there and that is a huge need for multiple streams of income and not just today but multiple streams of income throughout our life throughout every stage of our life\nTo create that stability and one of the things we can do to really help people get kind of jumped started ended his multiple streams of income lifestyle is to get them out to one of the half the class is we still got a few passes here we can give away let's do it right now I've got to have to class go up in your area they have their classes where you'll see exactly what it takes really keep that retirement account growing\nMake sure we have income for today income for tomorrow and really generating and focusing on building out those multiple streams of income when the second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of pastors doing these half day classes switch phones ready and if you are driving now is a good time to pull over\nIncluding with your passes is going to be a professional insiders kid now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation ... capital preservation crypto currency is much much more\nThe professional and Saturday it makes it so you get started right now\nThe ... century twenty we need you to call now and reserved those\nSeats the number is eight eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up\nBeing colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ...
