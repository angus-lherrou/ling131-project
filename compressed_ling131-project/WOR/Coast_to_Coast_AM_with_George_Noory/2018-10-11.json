to coast to coast limbic Tiger Woods Lin is one of the central voices in the new consciousness movement she's the author of several great books including the field and the intention experiment underway does the power of eight\nLynn is the editorial director of what doctors don't tell you and also the architect of the intention experiments and she has conducted many Lynn walking back to the program\nHey George it's great to be back you two are you still doing intentioned experiments\nI Am I mean we just had two amazing on last autumn and we just calculated the results a few months ago\nYou know I did an intention a bit when the several weeks ago Hurricane Florence was heading toward the Carolinas or they could see it as a category four or five and we did a little over let's bring it down in the ... a tropical storm really fast\nOr something happens it works and they\nDefinitely does work I mean I worked with a group in Florida to keep the uh the last hurricane not this latest one away from Tampa Bay and it just skirted around it\nSo there's something going on and I mean now\nWe've run about thick piece intention experiments trying to lower violence um last September we ran a six day experiment to lower violence in the violent place in America which is believe it or not a a a neighborhood in St Louis Missouri Jesse ...\nAnd we calculated the result Georgia and it was amazing um we looked and I had a professor at ... look at it from the University of California\nAnd she saw that\nCrime went up the St Louis has a home property crime went up in St Louis as a home property crime went up went\nUp in fairground the neighborhood we we concentrated on the violent crime the thing we were focusing on went down by forty three percent from before and it just completely bucked the trend from the time we did the intention so that's going on here\nAnd what do you think this is what are the people tapping into of course you touched on it a lot with the book the field but what's out there\nWhat what's out there we're in a collective consciousness and I like I called it the field it's a quantum energy field and what seems to be the case and we can\nShare what's going on with our thoughts I mean you know the bottom line is our phone everything is energy and our thoughts are another kind of energy when there\nAre worked together collectively we have an amazing power that can change things and now you know I'm thirty three of these experiments and we've done everything from trying to make page grow faster\nPurify water healing somebody of pie TST to lowering violence and you know of those thirty three twenty nine have shown measurable positive significant effects\nDesigner trend the odds\nWell yeah because you know there's no drug out there to\nBe honest George that that has that kind of track record you know pharmaceutical drug has his good or record is that in terms of studies so so as I say\nWhat really seems to be the case his thoughts are things that affect other things and when you get a group of people doing thoughts together there is a collective\nField that seems to be created that has great power\nTo change things no he'll thing\nThe experiments you been working on oh boy you are primarily piece intentioned experiments\nYeah we did that one we did that one in St Louis\nAnd then I tried something really amazing I had the chance to work in a studio in southern England that had where I live in the u._k. and we had nine different screens with the studio I can be beamed down to nine different locations so we had cameras and nine different locations\nAnd we had those cameras in eight Arab countries I was working with a guy who's like the Deepak of the middle east\nAnd also\nVery prominent Israeli\n... a documentary producer so we had eight in Arab countries you know Saudi Arabia Bahrain et cetera on Kuwait\nAnd then the ninth one was in an audience of Israeli Jews so these are guys who have been brought up to hate each other and I also beamed at this live over my YouTube channel to um my followers around the world so we all did intention to lower violence in\nJerusalem there was an area of the old city that was suffering a lot of violence\nAnd we chose it because it's you know is the seat of all the major religions and we thought everybody would come together\nAnd what was amazing is afterward I could call on the people in the different locations you know I'm just calling their screen and they can talk to everyone else\nAnd the Jews started saying to the Arabs we love you it's time to you know ... and all of this and the Arabs were saying your God is my God and everybody was crying and everybody was sending love and it was\nAmazing it made the papers all over the middle east it was historic and it was incredible to me to see what was going on with these peace experiments wasn't just the outcome it was the effect on the participants\nHow much does added to play ... in the if you're a beach in positive\nThat generally work better than someone who goes into these experiments as a doubting Thomas\n[noise] well I thought so but no I mean and and when I looked at when we've done intention for individuals for instance we didn't intention once for a kid call Luke who is Fifteen Years old who tried to commit suicide is through and so forth of forty foot\nStructure after is he broke up with this for a serious\nGirlfriend and he'd broken everything he had brain damage she had a you know he had nerve damage\nAnd so I got my my community just start sending intention to him for three weeks while his stepfather with keeping notes and careful you know tracking what was happening when we were sending intention\nLoop got better in record time the doctors didn't even think of is going to live but he got better he got out of the hospital a far quicker than anybody\nCould have estimated but here's the funny thing of it you know he's Fifteen Years old and like most teenagers he thought his parents belief and the power of intention was pretty stupid\nIt worked for him and he didn't believe a word of it\n... with these experiments how do you start conducting them how do you scientifically put it together\nI get a team of scientists George I now I work with a lot ... Gary Schwartz at the University of of Arizona noted psychologist\nAnd a Jessica too is a very well known professors statistics and has been doing working consciousness research\nI worked with the late ... rural I I worked with people from from U. Penn State university water expert um I worked with um people from uh uh I'm from Princeton University you know just really prestigious universities\nSo we'll get an all kick around ideas with them and see what's measurable and then the team will talk about well how are we going to measure this and how to set it up and with some of them you know we do it in a laboratory like with\nDr Schwartz we did some seat experiments where we had four sets the seeds and we sent intention to one set of seeds and then the scientists didn't know which ones were sending intention to so we had you know real scientific type of experiment and they planted the seeds and carefully measured them\nSo it's all done with the scientific protocol that they really helped me set up because they're the scientists and then I just invite my readers all over the globe and we've had people from a hundred and fifty countries participate\nOr I'm an audience if I'm speaking in front of a large group to to do the intention and I'll be made out of my uh Internet site or YouTube or on Web TV or radio you and I did one together\nAnd um and then we calculate that we wait a while and we calculate the results and the reason we wait a while is safe for the peace experiments if you just do it\nA week after well could you know violence could go down but if you look at what's going on for a couple of years before and then look for about six months afterwards if you have bucked the trend then it starts to get pretty interesting\nIndeed no bloom the title of your new book the power of each has to do with the number of people you put in the group for the test why ... why not three Fifteen\n[laughter] we'll talk of eight really came about when I tried to scale this down remember I was doing these big experiments I wanted to know what happens if we put people in groups of you know groups small groups in my workshop you know will will they heel\nHe's doing all kinds of stuff and he had completely given up and that is only one time from being a cinder\nUm and this is a story I hear over and over again where that active being part of this group of being kind of a higher consciousness is life transforming\nWindows to send or need to have any special abilities\n[noise] well here's the really interesting thing of it you know I again did not believe this I was looking at it from every angle um it took me ten years to even get the courage to write this book\nWorld we say you were the skeptic ... skeptics\nI was I was the ultimate doubting Thomas because as I said I I started the intention experiment because I wasn't I wasn't really sure about all of this\nManifestation law of attraction I didn't I wasn't sure I believed it and I wanted to find out how far can you take it you know are we talking about the shifting a corner particle are we talking about curing cancer here so um that's when I set up the intention experiments but I never\nI never thought these little groups would have the power but the thing that's so interesting is I had a life universities the largest chiropractic university I'm In the world and they offered to do studies of the power of eight to let their nerves science department look at this\nSo we set up eight groups of students and we put a eat Jake kept to measure the brain waves of each one person one sender in each of the groups\nAnd what we found was so amazing that within a few minutes they would have this completely different brainwave signature it would turn off all the parts of the ... group would have a quieting of all the parts of the brain that makes us feel separate\nAnd also the parts of the brain that make us\nHave worried doubt negativity so these are basically brainwave signatures of somebody who's feeling a sense of ecstatic one this and when we compared these signatures when the nearest scientists who work at the doctor said Stephanie Sullivan um we looked at\nOther things like uh the work of the University of Pennsylvania looking at FSU fee masters and and and Buddhist monks\nAny static prayer they had an identical brainwave signature but the only difference was\nI had you know it takes years to become a Buddhist monk or a sci fi master through my guys were total novices there were students who never even done meditation\nAnd all they had was uh twelve minute video for me\nTo do when we're going to court break we're going to come back and just a moment to talk more about your work\nThe power of each and some of the incredible things that can be done with the power of intention truly remarkable when Mick

you this one makes you feel like you're part of something much much bigger the power of eight you feel like you're part of you you kind of feel like you're part of the field that you're not this

University of California Berkeley\nWho did this big study of what goes on when you do something else rustic when you do something compassionate like our piece experiments and they found something incredible that goes on a with a thing called the Vegas nerve it's the longest serving the body and it winds its way from\nYour neck through all the major Oregon's\nAnd it has a big effect on\nUm things like releasing oxytocin which is that hormone that gets released the feel good hormone when we're when we're caring for babies and\nThen the result of this activating is that it has a really positive effect on the immune system so when we do good or feel compassionate or ... something like that we um you know we\nWe actually get healthier\nBut the other big piece of this which is why that

we're doing one this that this Sunday on doing a pilot experiment like that in ... county in Florida\nUm we're going to do something about lowering violence but we've got Republicans and Democrats as part of this experiment in the same room together to see what happens to them afterwards and we're planning to roll down in a big way next\nNext spring um we're we want people you know of the

because you know we weren't just seeing effects among the receivers that stuff and the receivers of the big intention experiments you know the outcome of\nThe biggest change all that was amazing to me with what happened\nTo the participants in these intention experiments\nSo when we started doing these these experiments I started surveying the people to find out you know what happened to them and were they able to get on the website and all that kind of stuff but more amazingly\nI asked them how it was for them and I'll be getting answers back like this [noise] um I felt like I was part of a higher network you know my body was shivering and I was you know shaking uncontrollably and crying I felt like I was in the tractor beaming Star Trek remember these are people who are participating\nIn their own home in front of their own computer by themselves but yet they were feeling this extraordinary energy and the extraordinary emotion but more interestingly is after they participated in a piece experiment their lives became more peaceful\nThey were making up with relatives that we're getting along better with their partners that we're getting along better with their bosses and they're co workers\nThey were ... and they were hugging strangers about half of them said I feel more love for everybody I come in contact with so that to me with the amazing thing about it the mirror effect and when we did healing experiments we had loads of healing\nWhen we had peace experiments we had loads of people finding their lives were more peaceful\nSo in a way that's probably the most the most powerful part of the intention experiment if not the outcome that's pretty interesting definitely but it's more the active participation in what happens to those people need changes
