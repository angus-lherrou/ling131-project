{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "Start your day with Len Burman and Michael ... in the morning six until ten tomorrow morning I'm sue guardsmen on seven ten W all our and NBC News radio station\nHere enjoying this room lines of today's Len Burman and Michael real in the morning we'll be back with a new show tomorrow from six to ... than a sevens and the wor [noise]\nBad every Wednesday morning if you are just joining us the big three headlines\nThis morning well a Trump and Stormy Daniels are going at it uh she calls him tiny and er he calls her horse basin high horse because he thinks it's on becoming an occupant of the oval office to call a woman a horse face even though in her case if the bit fits\nI Am a I Do want to hear my horse and now I'm sitting on [laughter] very Iowa where settlers would throw you also in the big three more violent\nDetails are coming out of Saudi Arabia now apparently land is a tape\nAccording to the Turks a tape of the torture Andy dismembered man no audio audio really valuable audiotape turkey claims as an audiotape out seven minutes you can hear this guy being tortured and being dismembered alive\nHow's that sound oh those are don't want that on my iPod what do we can do about Saudi Arabia are going to talk to Peter King and just a couple of minutes we're running out the big three wow how much money is out\nThere eight hundred and sixty eight million dollars for the mega millions jackpot largest of all time there was no winter on Tuesday friday could be the day when you could become richer than Gibraltar or whatever\nCountry you were done uh let's see yeah richer than the did I say oh I Know what the answer ... ... definitely richer than ... did I say Gibraltar was more or less ... less oh let's see so you can be richer than several country gesture broker was if you win\nAll right joining us on the line is Long Island Congressman Peter king good morning to you congressman congressman\nWilliam Michael and I are\nAll right so what are we going to do about the Saudis I mean they are they're our allies but we can't let this go unpunished\nSo they are an ally ... and I I don't trust\nSaddam ... that it served a purpose is this for the last several years it was very helpful against are\nVery also get a size is very helpful again so ... they didn't know you just to be that way but they have been for the last several years that's important on the other hand\nWe're the twenty first century you cannot have a nation state carrying out this type of execution on their own ... or is this violates every human rights to ended a ... uh it has to reach and then we have to decide the\nType of retaliation or some type of economic retaliation at least\nA we have to make it clear to them this is wrong condemned them like a universal condemnation and uh\nNow here's the other side of that that was ... conservation they have to be condemned if we're going to oppose oil sanctions on Iran that's where a\nSaudi Arabia could disrupt up I saw your own oil boycott and that would just drop the the world economy how we showed that\nWe cannot allow them to intimidate us they need us a lot more than we need them that's why this is going to require a very strong Charles hard nosed diplomacy behind the scenes and again there has to be sanctions imposed ... type or we've got up to the ... what do we have to take action against the bill got about a\nCongressman you go as far as Senator Lindsey Graham who says that the crown prince if he is responsible for the murder of this journalists should be pushed aside\nAs it turns out that he is now there's no doubt the Saudi Government is responsible\nAny which is typically order the or whether or not it was a unit within the government the factors that are responsible\nThey have to show the responsibility for whether or not was the Trump French yeah we have more information about what she has been calling the shots in Saudi Arabia there will be very unusual for him not to know about it if you did not know about it that shows these aren't qualified to be the leader\nSo yes I Would say right now it's going to be very difficult for us to go forward\nSlowly she remains a leader and ironically he was the one who was a liberalizing Saudi Arabia at least to some extent as far as women's rights et cetera but this on does all of that\nWe're around with Long Island Congressman Peter king of the times this morning has the story\nThat connect the dots between some of these assassins directly with the crown prince with Congress I Want to ask you when you're talking about a some kind of economic sanctions against Saudi Arabia I mean they are so rich one what could possibly hurt their pocketbooks\nAgain even if it comes to oil or a arms sales\nNow we don't want them to be going to Russia too so they were um shows but I don't believe they could anyway because so much that they have this depends on our technology that their system as a uh definitely I I virtually identical to ours they would not be able to do that compatible with ours so central bringing in Russian weapons right now it'd be difficult\nI Would say probably the best leverage we have is on um ... arms deals right now\n... do you buy into the um suggestion on the part of some other radio stations that the reason Trump is going soft with the Saudis is because he's got a lot of business dealings with them\n[noise] no I don't I mean I I think any time you get into that no the answer is no that I think that and I'm going to say go soft I mean some of the biggest arms deals we had with Saudi Arabia\nDon't under President Obama and I supported them so let's be clear at this should not be a partisan issue or it's a difficult issue but it's one where we have to take a firm stand their stores it's difficult doesn't mean we don't take itself sense\nHow soon do you find it concerning that the president will say things like well a lot of them are putting told me he didn't interfere and then uh the king of Saudi Arabia told me he wasn't involved I mean I Am a little queasy about those statements\nYeah I was very critical the pros and we said that about voting a fact is I don't believe anything ... would say the only uh\nExcuse if you want the only thing I Would say right now is the president may want to keep his options open until we get the final results to show that he had to rush to judgment others did give the Saudis credit for this out and now all the evidence is in we have to condemn them but other than that uh to me it would matter to me what Saturday it sets\nA again this is a moral country they have so many of their citizens involved in nine eleven acting against just yeah I was the one in Congress who sponsored the bill to allow Americans to sue the Saudis because of nine eleven so I Know a little bit off the Saudis\nRight now a useful ally in certain instances where we can't allow that to overcome the human rights violations\nCongressman how are the midterms looking to you is the Republican base or more energized now after the cabin on a hearing\nIt you know certainly appears to be but again it's three weeks to election I Would say what the uh the increase in the Republican base after Kavanaugh what's that ... that was back at the base mobilized\nBut south Republicans to keep it mobilized that is not enough to sustain itself you know the next three weeks we have to make sure that we do all weekend\nTo keep that base mobilized and it's going to involve other issues such as the economy such as terrorism and they were Long Island certainly have us Thirteen\nSo confident how has your race going you're up against a young woman named ... Gretchen surely as a piece of Newsday today talking about all the money that she has raised there are you you can have a fight on your hands this time it'll be a cakewalk as usual for a\nWhile I was in I I say every race seriously I think one thing it should be clear in that story is that as we call went to the final three weeks I have ten times more money than she does she raised so I came out of state and then approach you spent a lot coming into the final three weeks I have the money I think I'm\nRunning out of twenty times more TV ads to her as far as time I\nGuess more like Fifteen times already read whatever it is it's considerably more as far as television media social media but they're also more than I\nGuess money can only go so far I've been outspent intellectual and I want a is that I troops on the ground I Will volunteers I've ever had before or a lawn signs want people making phone calls won't people going door to door\nSo in any event I have a really excellent shape but again it's three weeks or what should I say look you could ratchet I'll be working until nine pm on November ...\nHey congressman the Democrats are uh camping down talk of impeachment should they get control of the house but do you think if they do get control the house impeachment will be on the agenda\n[noise] I think there's no doubt there'll be a lot of Democrats who want to move toward a peach or whether it's the president or\nA justice Kavanaugh but holy will show and that's why you find democratic leaders back in the way that American people don't want that American people don't want a government disrupted they look upon that as interfering with the uh a process of election we should fight or bottles out during the campaign on election day and then what happens after that you wait till the next election\nCongressman Peter king here's my question for you I Know your lovely light a ... a lovely wife Rosemary I'm Wondering what she thought when she read that the president United States cold day woman a horse face\nIt was absolutely because she thought it was wrong I thought it was wrong it a a person's story Daniels is not the idea of woman the fact is the president I said you shouldn't be even saying anything about her that never mind insulting her that way it was foolish was wrong and I I'm saying it it was it was actually no excuse for it and she was a\nVery ... were bipartisan paid it that's why like Peter Kenyon tells you like it is he he's not phony like real and Joe Bartlett who say oh it's a it's fine and dandy no it's not and the congressman called 'em out good for you congressman you ever I give Trump this advice congressmen when this was doing you are meeting\nYeah you said that he just said okay you know who to vote for us but again\n[laughter] I mean that's the question right guys what kind of interrogation\nEnds up like that and what kind of methods were being used and is all this report about the friends except the expert and the phone thought actually real I think regardless of what the actual grisly details are\nIs that either had it not going to have a hard time saying anything with it it's good for the last few weeks they've been telling us that the guy walked out the ... on his own but they weren't knowingly lying but the last few weeks\nNow just say oh no no wait we actually we didn't know this guy came in this is what happens if the ... I mean why do we trust the new report if it's the same party official you told us that he walked out\n... can we trust the Turkish sources 'cause we know turkey and Saudi Arabia do not get along\nWell we can't and that's why this is such a frustrating story gentleman to be on the ground reporting luck I think that at this point it looks like the ... do you have evidence but until we see it until we see some audio and video sorry you're some audio\nGets an actual forensic evidence we have law enforcement or is it your part of the investigation team that that we can't confirm that there's evidence yet that the the investigation's ongoing I so I really caution kind of all of these reports\nAnd reading into all of them until we have something solid until we've seen something that ... one of them up\n... alright ABC News correspondent Molly hunter in Istanbul Thanks Molly\nThanks ... I you\nKnow that there's so many bits and pieces here you know the the president came out the other day and said he has no business interests in Saudi Arabia ... well now all the stories are coming out of business dealings he's he's dealt with the Saudis but outside of Saudi they weren't in Saudi Arabia so it's like we ... he sold ... to one of I don't know what\nI mean you even Fox News put out all these facts I wasn't like the left was putting this out it's just he has had business dealings with Saudis but he his statement was not in Saudi Arabia and I and again when he said yesterday well it's a he hawked actually ... it was the capital of the fence\nInnocent until proven guilty and I think most of the world is already convicted the Saudis\nAnd Molly hunter just said that we have not seen any of the these reports have come out they've been leaked anonymously by Turkish officials but she says we've got no evidence for anything that anyone insane at this point\nFrankly I have no idea what Tom has doing over there seems to be smiling and shaking hands with everybody well he's got got some criticism for shaking hands with the premise you should look a little more serious if he supposedly investigating what's happening\nYou know the New York times and their story this morning in that mode Molly hunter of ABC News said that the uh the Turks are leaking it out to the Washington Post the New York times the times story this morning says there's direct linkage between the assassins like Dr dot as as employees of the the crown prince\nI thought it was interesting we spoke to representative a Congressman Peter king earlier and he actually was with US Senator Lindsey Graham and saying the crown prince if he is directly involved in this should be muscle aside by the Saturday family in a new head of state should be installed in Saudi Arabia\nWow because you know whenever the Saudis come up with whatever report they're going to come up with which is going to be difficult to say and interrogations gone wrong if there was actual audio and video the bones saw been employed that's not in ... tactic we know about\nI Wonder why the audio and video has not been leaked out yet if you would think if you're the Turks and you want it out there you don't just leak we have it you would show a reporter from the times of the Washington Post you would show the video you would show the audio to prove that you had it\nBut you know the crown prince and the ... going to say oh those were robes that's you know that's where Trump got that phrase that might have been some rogue actors because he got that from the king\nAnd then that's going to be their shoes you know oh ... says interrogation got bad but the these rogue people recognize are owned by the way your reference Congressman Peter King I just want to let the audience know if they if they don't know you can listen to our podcast and you'll hear the interview we did with Peter King which was terrific about forty minutes ago\nBut every every day we put out the pod cast of our show and you can listen to them and uh and we make it easier for you because we take out the ah\nThe news and the traffic ... commercials so it was\nPeople ... people go to the pod cast for Bernie biter seven seven ten W. R. dot com slash Lenin Michael and there's always a bonus segment there\nOh yeah we only have the ... we had a great one yesterday about that this Holocaust contest\nNo seriously when you say missed Holocaust contest that sounds terrible but it's actually kind of a\nKind of a sweetheart but that was the one where he was the actual and they've all been this Holocaust survivor kind a right so yeah All right when we come back to the phones are open one eight hundred three two one zero seven ten one eight hundred three two one zero seven ten we want to know what do you think was it\nWrong and inappropriate in correct or not but coming of the president calls Stormy Daniels horse face\nOne eight hundred three two one zero seven ...\nThis is a really wanting to today's Len Burman and Michael read all in the morning and get them live tomorrow from six built in on seven ten W O R\nHere's your chance you know we open the phone lines and yes we're equal opportunity a phone takers that eight hundred three two one\nZero seven ten but I notice a lot of men are calling him and I have a hunch that the ... the majority will agree with the president is just fine and dandy uh from the oval office on your official Twitter account to call a woman horse race I I happen to disagree with that notion\nUm I'd love to hear what some women have to think so women feel free to give us a call and let us know your thoughts anyway we're going to take your calls now and let's start with Joe on Staten Island hey Joel welcome to the show\nLaw that guy though and I want to do it I I Believe that President Trump is language is already a except it and the reason why is because of his accomplishment the American people understand\nThat his language can be you know all that time people more aware of what really matters never forget that and the Democrats at the MIT ... they're all going to have ... faces when they lose\n[laughter] well I don't have Democrats [laughter] they're going to get the you know what kicked out of that right Joe ... show got it All right hey let's go to a Peter and Cranford good morning\nPeter ... Peter you with us Peter Peter are you on your tin can or a walkie talkie what he on Peter ... Peter ... there is a A R Peter Peter with us up\nOkay yeah I just don't make a comment um I Would think it's inappropriate or Peter King that I was upset that Obama or a blue blazer I mean ah when it when it's Obama or the color of a a jacket and the president can cope people names like a fifth grader but that's okay\nWell I think I don't know if it was Peter King there's some ... I Know at the time something with the base sued Obama was getting some ... I don't know what that was all about yeah So Peter you agree with me that's just not I\nMean I think it should be beneath\nFrankly you know what bothers me more about the president than a his use of language is his ties to long\n[noise] that that always now we're talking about the real to me the wrong Peter ...\nHow about a Laura ... hey Laura what's up the morning or\nWell morning I um I just

as fast as I said no but I but I [laughter] I just think people\nPeople take shots of the president I think the president should hold his fire back that's all upset that they had a little bit he

the call on Jose oh too bad that got a ... what what did you what did I see a you know I saw a fan interference of how does a couple of times or we have as a\nTeam and they deemed the fan reached over into the field of play interfered with the best and I was eight page the biggest price because the trajectory of the ball looked like he was going to leave the ballpark\nBut we assume and and you can assume a lot with Mickey because he's an incredible athlete we assume he's going to make this spectacular catch jumping as high as you can into the into the crowd [noise]\nUm I asked for a review\nAnd obviously they're going to give it to us and they reviewed it and came back with the same outcome so wants to fan reaches in in a past that line of the fence there I mean we're going to penalize hitters\nEverytime and so\nUm [noise] you know change that holding an innate you guys lose eight to six ... and that's that doesn't mean that that that I mean it it's convenient to think about it that way but there's a lot of game left there was a lot of action in that game there was a no no I'm not going to go there but I\nUm it would have been nice to talk of the game at that point but that's not that's not the difference just not how the game plays\nThe G ... do you have some video proof that offended actually reach over or you're saying what they\nSay I'm telling you what they say we don't know\nAnd and ... we have this we have a replay system and we have the video but it doesn't matter what we think anybody's home I mean is that they're going to tell us what they want to rule\nI I guess my question is that as you ever get the satisfaction that from Joel West I clearly source somebody reach over like frozen for\nYour call Joe like it would have gone whatever ... they'll call it that way so called it that way from the\nGet go and um\nAnd again this point there's so many places that I don't want to spend more time on display but they're just all the play as interference she called that on the field when they went to a replay um they confirmed it so\n[laughter] I mean there's nothing more I'm getting checked in the first ending which is which is ridiculous and a playoff game but I ah there was no mechanism for me to to to to change their mind changed your interpretation change the fact that I thought the ball was it was a road to in the end of the fans of doesn't matter what I think I'm not in New York and I'm not on par\nWith Dr ... his name he's hurting me he's hurting\nThem and watch them I'm watching them do his best in these tough kid and he's he's given us everything he's got but it is hurting\nYou guys have historically been pitching to see what's been your impression of why they've had some success there are\nRelentless line of 'em are relentless the line of history I mean this game was incredibly good on both started graded batch great plays obviously we were inches away from the ball go into the wall we probably win\nAnd and it's a completely different press conference but that's not the way the game plays out but they're they're often says relentless has been relentless since March um when we first saw him in spring training so I'm getting through I'm getting through the bat you watch them hang in there the drawl walks when you when you\nWhen you shy away from the zone they get too out is that there there there there are

all about\nThe kind of left Alex given a ... struggles in the postseason even tonight what gave you faith that he was gonna be able to get that lots of I mean he was our guy and uh it was kind of a line of work into that one of the whole season how people were really really anxious\nOr a hundred and sixty two games and the first serious but we know all on the something like this was going to come up and we're going to a which was our guy you know I'm a little well I Know that it looked pretty but\nWe've got twenty seven outs and now we move on you you have priced warmed up to look like was there a point you what about him and he was going to come in if the eighth was uh\n[noise] it was a worse than what it was whenever there was going to a he was going to come in if we want to score to in the ninth because of the long in England and then it had been in a more he'll start on the right\nAlex uh can you take us through the specifics of the death catch what you saw in the dugout when you were told and also the color of was like in the dugout between\nHim and he won't have to go and Joe ... down right away I sold ... and\nI Know the boundaries that knows for sure that it was going to be called out you know even reach them in the defense he was actually Marilyn window with also doesn't rule and we got the\nGuy was on the way they call them right away so you know we we're pretty sure that he was the call was going to\nOr on the right now it's just going to be motions through the ... at the end and what you saw from your your where you\nWeren't I mean we we've been talking islands and um you know to the edges of strikes on\nSome good things on it he's in Beijing and you know in his own and now he's in Maryland and rage on the way they're getting goes going gosh me to play in right field\nThis is our nation's future at stake here this is educating our people you know this is not a for profit enterprise so we believe strongly that that interests um should be brought down to a you know there's no interest or a minimum very low interest like ... maybe one and a half percent or so\nJust enough to cover the costs of administering the program\nWhere does the lending money come from Alan Paulos before these loans\nWell the money used to come from essentially Wall Street because the ... it was private banks that were making these loans\nUh today this money comes from the federal treasury because as I said Obama um federalized all any program [noise] ah so the federal tax payer puts the money out a and the federal taxpayer 'em\nAnd let's be clear we're not really talking about the taxpayers we're really talking about the department of education [noise] uh and it sort of crony contractors that's where the money is going and they can they keep that essentially away from the taxpayer and they keep it for themselves [laughter]\nAh but um so yeah this was a federal program money it ultimately comes from the taxpayer who\nAt this point as I said as making something like Seventy five billion dollars a year in profit\nOr and even making a profit on ... I should add so that's a ... something that makes this\nA predatory lending system by definition\nAre their predatory lending laws in the various states\nThere are there are state use three laws in every state in the union and federal student loans are exempted from all of them [laughter] there are also fair debt collection practice\nLaws federal a fruit than lending laws uh and these again are restricted or completely remove a for the case of federal student loans\nWho came up with this scam\n[noise] who else the genesis of this the genesis of this really comes back to sort of a swamp the beltway cabal of bankers ah which included a it started with a company called Sallie Mae which was a government sponsored entity back in the seventies [noise]\nAh and by the way one of your other guests who appears on your program frequently Catherine Austin fits yes\nServed on the board of Sallie Mae back when it was actually controlled by the government and she was there right at the nexus of when this company went from being a publicly sponsored enterprise\nTo a holy private for profit enterprise and she can tell you many of the stories about people like Albert lowered\nA bill defender for in other executives at Sallie Mae who had no interest in serving the public and at every interest in making money off of this system\nSo you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise] ah like many of the state run Gehring tours in the country um like USA Funds\nThese people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity to make money and they did everything they could to make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living a under the the fruits of their labor\nWhat do you recommend for a parent who use child is ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can give at this point George is do not borrow and if you have to borrow\nDo not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private student loans from a bank you know that they were they were technically it is called a student loan\nBecause as soon as you call it a student loan federal or private you lose bankruptcy rights are and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collection practices truth than lending a state you three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections that I mentioned [noise]\nUm so I really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you actually have to borrow go to a private bank guinea private line of credit [noise] uh and do it that way because at least then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type\nOf loan whatever happened in the days of scholarship so they still being awarded to people\nWell you know Georgia of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices are so astonishingly much that you know no amount of ground serves even state funding cetera can keep up with their budgets um you know I was just in Syracuse\nRecently in the price to go to Syracuse University is now\nSeventy thousand dollars a year well I can guarantee you now you're per year that's tuition room board books um for for your course for a four year college and by the way it no longer takes for years to graduate George the average time to graduate from undergrad\nIs now six point two year what happened\nWell again the colleges are sitting in the cat per seat vacant because there's this lending program standing behind the whole thing and the federal government and the other lenders are willing to pile as much dead on the back to the students as possible the colleges have carte blanche to not only raise their prices\nBut also really stream the students out and keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it [noise] so it's it's the time is getting longer the per year cost is just exploding and that's why we're seeing these just insane stories\nWhere people are graduating with you know a million dollars in debt ... there was a story just recently we're\nLosing a guy walked out of dental school with yeah a million dollars in student loans\nNo wonder dental a belt bills are so high\n[laughter] that's right you know and and this really hurts the broader economy when you have one point six trillion dollars in debt you know strapped on too\nAnd download the ... and I do go to you and ... now for universal access across all ... us ... all access trusted for over Twenty years\n[noise]\n\n\nWelcome back to close to ... with us we're going to take your calls as we talk about the student loans game what was it Allen that made you get involved in this\n[noise] oh well I had a um I had student loans I've three reason engineering and um I graduated and found myself unemployed underemployed for short amount of time [noise] uh\nAnd I tried everything I could to keep my loans in good stead through to ferment forbearance cetera uh but what I fell into and what a probably forty percent of everybody out there were student loans is falling into\nA is a lineage system that actually want you to default and so they will lose your paperwork they will give you bad information they'll baffle em bamboozled you and compel your loans to default which is what happened to me and my loans very quickly doubled or tripled with penalties an interest and [noise]\nAnd so I started doing research and what I found was just astonishing uh I took my my ... my findings to first Fortune Magazine ah and then I wound up top story on sixty minutes\nA and this was a peace with the Leslie stall yeah a a piece for which Sallie Mae and the federal government refused to be interviewed I might\nAdd [laughter] uh and so it's sort of snowball from there I unfortunately I thought this was going to be maybe a two or three year project to get you know justice on this matter a but here we are low and behold Thirteen Years later and Congress has not moved one inch\nAnd I'm hopeful that'll change very near future because the numbers have become just so astonishing uh but you know we're going to need a lot of help from the people out there whose lives this is affecting\nWhy isn't Allen that people who have a rough credits or have a a very difficult time to make payments seemed to be the ones that kept the short end of the stick\nAnd by that I mean a you've got these payday loans that are outrageous and predatory are that are geared more for people who need some money and you know they're having a tough time you've got these student loans situations and one of the worst icy are these um\nSecondary car market a lenders who will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll finance them with just what you said they want the default so what they'll do is they'll say All right I Want five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car\nAnd so the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars\nKeeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed and they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... the ... if not more\nAnd with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that that's a great analogy George and you know I I make a similar analogy off and I have no student loans\nIt's like buying a car where you pick it out you buy it online and say you know look it's got great reviews you go and so you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car and you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no brakes any wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership here at like hey guys you know the car has no brakes what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you you should read the manual because this car comes with no breaks\nYou know uh and this\nIn fact is really what's going on with student loans and particularly is used as you rightly say for lower income people um you know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so\nIs these sort of fly by night an expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to um you know disadvantaged uh\nUnder privileged people\nUnder yeah under privileged people people who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education is just a joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this is rex their life um\nI mean they should be getting more interest rates better financing deals but because their credit shot and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the ... and that's very wrong\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and and just in general you know there are a means test for student loans and the first place so the only people the people that get student loans\nAnd it's about I mean let's be honest about Seventy percent of everybody who goes to college winds up with student loans but still this is a a um a an economically needy group of people\nWho you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and\nHow cruelly ironic is that is these very people that the landing system was supposed to help\nUh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent\nAs crazy crazy once once the tuition like can't Harvard or Yale\nA it's a it's on a par with the the number I mentioned for Syracuse earliest probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year\nAnd there are even more classes schools by the way um but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running you know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within I'd say a couple three four\nYears I should have pushed my kids into sports when they were younger so they get scholarships to go to university smart\nYeah that's right well you know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and\nYou know the scholarships really have an increased uh on that scale and and so it's you know unless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories from people go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand\nDollars apiece crazy so this has just\nUnreal um this is not this is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition\nBy working a summer job or maybe a summer job in a part time job during college well you know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen\nWith the amount that they charge a and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just stupid fine\nJust go to Joe truck driving in Indiana that get us started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge tile and good thank you\n[noise] I got good news for you too man a throw rally over there and a lot of the other day yeah there was a big signs they throw support the seal day and he looked right at the whole ... oh\n[laughter] I Love it\nBut uh anyway I I I wanted to drive a little bit of a trade school to a ... a former company I used to work where I got on equality\nAnd when a totally went under the owners of the night and a private plane crashed on a mission to several years ago probably about seven years now you know\nAnd it was a sad time but uh we pretty much going on during the late everybody off\nAnd I was one of those people do so I didn't know her job over here and I found one but they wouldn't even let alone is with us or if I was I didn't have that little piece of paper saying to them they would all too\nWell and I think well over ... years you know and\nAnd you probably in more and more experience than most people\nAnd I looked at the local school there and they were voting for thousands of dollars just to go it for oh I think it was a horse there's no well you know it's like they're away\nSo I ended up going ... miles in dollars on the grades loaf are learning to drive semi trucks and then I felt like I got shafted on that I found out that it's not a surprise\nUh let's get your reaction to the cell and where do you think a trade schools well\nYou know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jacked through the roof or as well you know when you have this landing system stand behind these schools\nKnow they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket\nYou know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that uh and it's just a travesty it's\nIt's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke Texan other trade schools are as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program in the first place\nIn sorry to hear the Gordon and Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call 'em I Want to publicly think Alan he's the one that pointed out to me\nThat the lack of bankruptcy protections encourages predatory lending um and of course a tuition and inflation I I already knew that the more you subsidize the loans especially the taxpayer on going to crash the dollar by the way because almost ten percent of total debt is college dead\nIs that all of these programs are failing the vast majority of people who try out for them so we now know that the success rate for the public service loan forgiveness program where\nYou worked for a you know if you work in a college or a hospital or the nonprofit get your loans forgiven only about point three percent of the people trying for that forgiveness are actually getting it so the rest are being just qualified and they're being left owing far far more so mark mentioned he was making zero dollar payments\nWell interest continues to accrue on that loan show\nSo that loan is getting bigger and bigger and statistically speaking there's only about a ten percent chance that mark will make it through to the end of that I be our program and actually get the loan for given a and I might add that any amount forgiving under the I'd be our program is taxable income so\nTwenty five years\nYou get a nice little thing that sent to the IRS that says this is income for this year\nThat's right so at the end of the twenty five years you get a tax bill which probably equals or probably even exceeds the amount that you were originally borrowed [noise]\nDo the federal government is not some benign altruistic entity that is you know she can to help its citizens get educated the federal government particularly the department of education they are out to make a buck and they are making a\nIt was gonna say they are obviously know how to make money don't think\nThat's right you know it was ironically was bakers that set up the office of federal student aid for and and currently run\nThe federal student loan program these are people these are executives from Sallie Mae and many other student loan companies that that are running the place now so\nThey have no public a benefit the inspiration they jettison all pretense of actually looking out for the students are many many years ago\nEllen we're gonna come back and take final culture with you in just a

and it created and big ladders final noted never heard from the company but if current unified documented there is\nA say in the unit around consolidation ... read the action program\nAnd how can I can turn on right now I'm On a ... fan base repayment program\nAnd I have no idea what there is that I was going to ask if you heard of this company or and\n... again to me Allen doesn't it do you have student loans out there gene\nI Do I Do I got my first time you know trying to work on my bachelors\n... well what ... what these companies do these companies somehow have the ability whether they buy the lists or not but they find your name and they know you have a student loan and in many cases Allen aren't the scammers\nYes there are a lot of scammers out there and I haven't heard of this year's company but there are a million of them and the sounds exactly like just another one where they're looking for two things they're looking for people who are in the fall that they can assure through\nThis loan rehabilitation a scam that I described earlier where they\nMake you sign for a much larger loan and then get a commission off the top of that uh or they're just trying to get you to read your your loans and ... surgery or consolidate your loans or otherwise refinance your loans into a new again larger alone a and make a commission off of that\nSo I Would I Would rip that thing up because it sounds like it's not worth the paper it's written on\nJames truck driving in Texas first time caller Hi James go ahead sir\nHi George it's pleasure to speak with you on your way I loved your reading of upgrade Allan Poe's tell tell\nThat job thank you\nAnd I hope we hear more of it before Halloween that\nThough I'm a very interesting I've I've just had a my loans and the fall for a little over a decade maybe Fifteen Years\nAnd they fell off on my credit report and lo and behold the same way this is just last week I got a letter from a company called central research L L C\nAnd hope you don't mind me mentioning mentioning them in particular a but their information is a hundred percent correct the principal was sixty four hundred and some change\nAnd there's you know there was a breakdown of all of the er er costs that are being hurt\nAnd I was wondering what advice you can get leaked or try to negotiate directly with the deal he tried to go shoot with these people every there's something like four thousand dollars in interest there also are the\nCells like another scam Ellen what do you think\nRight now and first of all I Would I Would\nNever deal with a third party collection company known for I don't have any great advice for defaulted borrowers because they're truly is known to give other than\nHelping us fight for age are twenty three sixty six and getting out of bankruptcy writes back so that they can't steal from is legally a but certainly don't deal with their third party collection companies I'm the owner of your loan is probably either a a guarantor or the department of education\nAt this late date I suspect it's probably the department of education\nI mean if you can make an offer to them of a hundred and twenty percent of the day I get a loan to take it all to you know it should be you can do but certainly dealing with a question of like like what you describe how did they get\nThe information out one lucky said they had everything down to the penny how did they find this republic clearing house that has all these things out there\nNo more than likely they are sub contractors to either a guarantor or maybe directly to the federal government show show the information they have is good\nUm but I can tell you that dealing with them is only going to add\nTo whatever price ... are you wind up paying so I definitely recommend I'm getting to the bottom of or if you if you want to negotiate wind the owner of the note rather than these third party collection companies because they're only going to cost onto the process\nBut my friend that had along with a company that went bankrupt you\nNever heard from them again when\nForty percent off designer handbags Harry in our prices in the sand and dying I'm now ...\nLittle things mean everything ... family I couldn't apply\n[noise]\n\n\n\nLet me tell you a little bit about Nick Pope those of you or do the show Nick worked for the United kingdom ministry of defense the best to get in your photos and other mysteries\nHe's been called the real ... has been working as a consultant or spokesperson numerous alien the movies TV shows video games as well and tonight we're going to be talking about aliens at the Pentagon and Nick welcome back it's always great to have\nYou great to be back on the shirt I don't know how you doing these days yeah good thing [noise]\nWhere do we last see each other contacted the desert we were there ...\nAnd I'm now what's that before to your life event in full Lake City which we did\nThat was right around that same period yeah yeah that was fun you did a great job there thank you great job indeed\nAliens at the Pentagon I Love this title tell me more\nOkay it's essentially it is my new documentary that I put out to tell the story all off and leave and taking\nYour credit cram a cat but it can take your life that story and and really to\nTry in one document tree to tell as as fast as I can meet entire story of the U.S government don't want any relationship with this phenomenon or watch seven decades now\nLots of people have been talking about the Pentagon the CIA what's been going on there these new revelations that keep coming out Nick what do you think of them\nThey are absolutely staggering this town that has been the biggest single revelation now in the UFO community I think decade I the only story that I think comes\nAnd I would say this wouldn't I is that the vacation and release of the British Government files but the the revelation\nThat off to decades have to know and the U.S government did have a new effort program off to roll and it was run by the ... super secretive\nDefense intelligence agency I'm I'm an Asian feel but the day and and you're like hey for years they said no no since project to close down we haven't been doing this with no in traffic or no investigations and of course\nThey were and that's what I really focused on in in the new film aliens at the end again to try to train on tango the numerous threats to the story and there are numerous threats I mean we've we've seen the videos we've seen the talk\nOf mistreatment both they're all the different players involved and maybe we'll get into some of this Robert Bigelow a Senator Harry Reid come along and you couldn't make this stuff up\nNo you you can't make it up and how do you track all this stuff neck it 'cause it's coming from all different directions these days\nI think the answer that one is it's very cautiously and very carefully and and absolutely in meticulous detail\nBecause I think the problem with the story in one sense\nFor years people have said the problem is that particularly with the gal them we have two little information about what's going on with the eight story with with these revelations we must have too much information and I think the public\nI mean it's it's just about okay for the deep specialists or is it difficult for them but for the public eye I think it's just the confusing mass if you think back to when the New York times\nWhen the landmark story on this on the sixteenth last year and then the the three videos came out to for their benefit one\nBut now the public have been absent people out there thinking yeah well there's the video and then if they walk by and then this is a millionaire businessman\nAnd and struggling to see how it all fits together so that that's what I've tried to do to take a step back and give people in a few of my incite a perspective of having run a similar program in the u._k.\nTold me a little bit more about the film we're getting a lot into it of course tonight it leans at the Pentagon but tell us specifically\nWell\nI took a long on on on this one and it was quite a diverge and for me usually I I just sit in the interview seats and then you've done this of course civilian time yourself you know you sit in the hot seat\nA direct to kind of\nTalks to you and you spend a couple of hours and and also the question is this when you see the final product sometimes you think wow well you know I've got edited down to a few soundbites and I wish they'd\nPut that back then and I wish they'd take it out and gosh I'm not sure I Would have told the story like that\nSo alien to the Pentagon and what I did this I teamed up with Warren ... from reality films and we essentially I had the the idea that I Would ... the thing so scripted the entire movie I did the I ... a million and a half thousand would I think he was\nScript for this and ... in that way I have absolute control of this and then literally I went into a a recording studio you know padded walls and headphones on and I knew right to it the whole thing\nAnd and then I sat down in front of a camera and did did parts of it too to Cameron in that way\nIn that way although there is a director who's done a brilliant job of putting it all together I'm Mike along I but I was very much in the driving seat having done the script and and in that sense\nWhen we look at the final pro dog no one can well I Can't say gosh this this\nSomehow didn't turn out the way I wanted it because I had my fingerprints on it from from start to finish and that's a departure from a dates a completely new role to me I mean there are people of course who are used\nTo this sort of thing or people like Jeremy coal bellicose just made a a a great movie but um\nYou know I I it was a departure from me so to me to some interesting new territory\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish with the\nFirst lady I as I say really to try to go through some of the the confusion about what's been going on and just tell the complete story\nFrom from start to finish but another thing that I've I've tried to do this I think we've probably discussed this before but one of the big problems I think that that this field\nHas is it we know young people are interested in in the subject but they don't go to many conferences and ... and it is difficult to engage with them\nSo by putting this out as video on demand\nWe go on to the platforms that the young people need to watch these things on when they stream as many people do these days so it's on Amazon and iTunes and Google Play and food do and video and all those\nSorts of things so the the aim was to take this subject not not just to the conventional UFO conference crowd\nBut but too young to get people and and another thing is you know it's been a year since domed along ... had his press conference\nWhere he got together with the to the stars of\nPeople um and it's been nearly a year of course since the New York times when the story I I Do ... ah you know in some ways the story I think has poked down a little bit so we'd aliens at the Pentagon don't want to reignite the S. and put it back where it absolutely belongs\nCenter stage and under the spotlight\nAnd how is this organization do nowadays like you like you said I I'm beginning to feel as if the momentum is waning what do you think\nThat when when you say the organization I'm E. E. T. I.\nRight yes um well that's very interesting question and the answer is no one knows because in in all of this\nThe U.S government has had all the way says in the ...\nSituations only as little as possible\nAnd we we really have very few pieces of the puzzle\nFrom the government itself which is is\nPretty much profit because we don't frankly we don't even know whether a tip is still an ongoing project I I think people like Lou Elizondo ran it of course say yes it is it still has its mission it still continues he of course all though he's resigned from the Pentagon and\nStill has has a a lot of contacts and friends that he he says it's still going\nWell what do we do we have anything to do with oh well\nI mean it it was started eat whatever the it was but I I as I say that there were people\nIn the panther can probably still all who who's deeply conservative religious beliefs\nLead them to think that that they are dealing with that they don't make a demonic phenomenon here might come ... come up again there's a couple of times in in the u._k. as well at the ministry of defense in fact one of one of my bosses was\nUm uh she you know they're pretty extreme with the S.\nAnd in the the the individual who wrote that the classified\nIntelligence assessment on on UFOs in the ministry of defense carried name project ... he would not want to go too far down that road he had some play the old beliefs as well and there's a passage in the Bible\nIn the book if ... if I think it is where it refers to say as being the print some power of the air and I think he's where a lot of these conservative religious\nPeople dead the idea that you might be demonic\nYes and there were a lot of religious folks Nick that believe that\n[noise] yeah and and it it it's frustrating in a sense because and and it's almost call me play ironic in another way\nThat you know you have a bunch of people in in the Rio de da da and in the u._k. and the ministry of defense you got a bunch of people who thought yeah this we're dealing with a real phenomenon\nAnd we should be investigating it research he ... her scientific manner and we come up again to system and you might think well that's fine that's that's what you'd expect\nUm but that skepticism is to sort of [noise] Nicole or intellectual a human nature skepticism but I think most people\nI associate with that concept it's actually it it's a beep probably trying to build leak driven skepticism itself I mean it to to have effectively the so called UFO skeptics in the end picking\n'em say that they don't they don't believe in extraterrestrials but they believe these things that demonic quote let's just in one sense it's swapping one on your plate fringe belief for another so\nWe'll at least by these people when skeptics told they will believe those but they would you believe us in some some great Warren having with angels and demons Nick\nWe're going to take a break we'll come back and chat more right here on coast to coast or you\nKnow you can get you updates and do it with other ... would you do in the ...
