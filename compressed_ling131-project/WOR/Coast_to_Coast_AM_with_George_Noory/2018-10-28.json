{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "The people tend to do better in life do so by taking action when opportunities arise they're not in their comfort zone they're not fearing all the time what they're doing is they're learning a skill that will allow them not only to help themselves maybe their kids their grandkids and again\nWhat I find with our students Ryan is they are not from a certain way or education or background there simply people that are ... and they're passionate about learning something new again I mentioned this earlier\nThe number one mistake that most people make with their money if they think they can do this on their own and then they'll go to the education later well that's the wrong thing to do one creates bad habits and number two they never do go back to do the education 'cause they blown up the money they had\nSo what does good students do I talk to them all the time number one\nThey ... and the twenty first century that they can take a laptop anywhere in this world right now it doesn't matter because as long as they have an Internet connection and their laptop\nThey can trade all over the world in fact we had a student named B or and he's in San Diego and a lot of times are students feel it's too hard they can't do it well not only is beyond done this and has left his job which is exactly what everybody wants to do right we want to quit a job and I love to do something we do love\nHe's become a excellent trader and he's also now started funding his wife's real estate business\nSo the two of them are doing something together\nSpending more time together spending more time on vacations and family but the important thing here Ryan is it they're loving what they're doing and there's so many people out there and if you're one of those people hopefully you can see how you can benefit from just learning a skill that can give me the freedom that you desire\nYeah absolutely and it's it's kind of interesting as we're as we're sitting here talking about how the lifestyle of a traitor I'd just literally receive a text message from a dear friend of mine and it just popped up on my phone and he was actually somebody who got me started in trading he was one of the first people who said this is how you open an account these are the steps that you go through\nIt very very first conversation these just become a lifelong dear friend of mine\nAnd he's a huge ski bum he lives up in Salt lake you just ... he travels around it as a great time\nHe just texted me with a picture of snow skis saying hey can you use these this season or should I take him to the ... because\nIf I go to Salt Lake users bum a pair of skis from and rather than a hall in mind around\nBut it it's just there's just so much freedom that can come with it and it and it really ends up just pulling down to a couple of basic steps a couple of basic as you were saying changes or actions that need to be taking because I think it's very critical it's very important it's it's very powerful once we do understand\nThat that the poor is just the state of mind right that passing over opportunities repeatedly and it's something that can be really easily changed just by stepping out of our comfort zone right just by stepping out of our comfort zone and doing something different we talk a lot about kind of cliche statements on the show here\nBut it's because they're so true and they're so useful and it goes back to if we've always done if we always do what we've done will always get what we got and if we are completely satisfied with where we are then then great let's continue to do what made us so happy in the first place but if we want a little bit more for trying to create a little more income if we're trying to create a little more freedoms we have a specific goal\nThat we're trying to accomplish that we haven't been able to get to\nWe have to make the necessary changes and that's one of the life lessons that my grandfather shared with me my whole life growing up he would hold up his five fingers I Would have to ... them the first one is no your business the second one is be converted\nAnd that converted one as a youngster I honestly didn't understand what it meant and as I got involved with trading and I really started to go kind of soul searching down is is this something that's gonna work for me am I going to be able to do this\nThat converted when I started to realize was\nMake the necessary changes the necessary metamorphosis do what's necessary\nAnd and and in the beginning and that was the one I was kind of didn't put as much emphasis on when I was like ten eleven twelve even Eighteen Nineteen twenty you know but then as I really started into my my grown up years I started realizing\nHow be converted that pointer finger of the five to ... became the most valuable because if we don't make the necessary changes we're never going to accomplish that kind of outlier goal that were after that one of the things we can do to help a few people get started with this as we still got a few tickets we can give away let's change some lives right now I've got a half the class coming up in your

it a big place they gave him hormone therapy they gave him pain medicines but they forgot to treat the cause of the pain that's the cancer successfully\nAnd left him in pain and that's why you came

had a CAT scan\nAlmost two years ago it was positive she went to one of the big hospital shed a biopsy was added no car some of the pancreas yet some nodes she had cancer markers so we talk about cancer markers a lot wide to educate use you know that many cancers have markers\nAnd you can actually determine if it can't just getting better or worse just by\nCommonly not always in medicine

she's tiny abdominal symptoms that was only symptom I examined her abdomen\nAnd there was nothing probably could not feel this cancer so the other side where the doctors exam doctor could say oh everything's say OK but in fact there's a pancreas cancer growing well as the pancreas cancer growing and she\nChose to come to us\nAnd then she went elsewhere she went elsewhere and got chemotherapy they did a radical surgery they did a whip whole procedure on her that came to me I told her we should've Ninety percent success rate with non invasive treatment\nAnd then they went to one of the super duper big hospitals got bamboozled got to whip up procedure cetera back months with a whip up a procedure that caught her spleen and the pancreas and adjacent to issues it's a big radical surgery\nAnd then they gave her chemo and came on chemo and why she's seeing me a year and a half later\nBecause all the chemo for pancreas cancer didn't work\nAll their whip up procedure for pancreas cancer didn't work in fact it probably even spread it because right now the cancer came back right in the same area where the surgeon should have remove the cancer so here's a case where there are thoughts are being ...\nBy saying no to the doctor Lederman and yes to the big boys and they spent hundreds of thousands of dollars and months in the hospital and grandma's never going to be the

mastectomy in two thousand twelve\nShe uh had the mistake to me I think that she could have saved her breasts but unfortunately she went through all of the big hospitals where they seem to favor mastectomies so shouldn't mastectomy and shit chemo and she had reconstruction and shit extensively emphatic invasion of for a\nPress but they never gave her chemotherapy which is a big issue\nThen over I'm a recent holidays she went to the shopping center blacked out she went to a hospital\nThey took her by ambulance to a hospital and whether the hospital\nThat a scan of her head and told her\nYou got a brain tumor and luckily she got out of the hospital she came to me and we talked about all the options I told her all the options she was doing well we talked about fraction rid of surgery versus other methods of treatment and then she went back to see our other doctors they said oh you've got a treatment today you got a terrible brain tumor\nAs soon as she told them she saw Dr Lederman they've pushed her to have a treatment it's called gamma knife with screws and the head it was painful for was unpleasant for her and also the gamma night because it's one treatment it's less safe than our treatment studies have shown for a hundred years that if you give\nA small amount of fracture nation or separation of the dogs can avoid those painful screws we do not have those painful screws we stopped that twenty four years ago which tells you how long I've been involved in the field of radio surgery now for Thirty years first of New York with radio certainly for brain\nFirst in America for radio search or the body the longest track record here unfortunately she went to the other place and they screwed on the frame and told her the treatment immediately and it was painful and unsatisfying for the woman she came back to me to see what I thought of it I said I think it's really sad\nThat the doctors pushed her for that treatment that didn't need to push her British surgery is good but our radio surgeries patterns not invasive there's no coddling though bleeding I'll screws and the head so it was big differences in treatment\nEven though she went to us I don't push anybody to do anything I Believe that every patient is the president of United States of his or her body and that the other place she told him she went to a doctor Lederman they brought out the screws and the\nRule drivers to screw ahead frame intern treated the same day so do I think it's fair no\nThat's what we're fighting against every day here and in person and that's why we're on the radio

western hemisphere body waiting surgery you can also call Dr lead a minute to ensure killington for free informative booklet and DVD pay Dr Lederman went back\nTo have a man who was sixty eight years old is it accounts and he runs the counting business he's married with one child he's been working with the counting business all his life he was diagnosed with colon cancer ten years ago he had surgery one of the big hospitals in neighboring state had surgery\nAdds a therapy than two years ago\nHis backside started having terrible pain and he was found metastases to the sacred had added al ... of the sacred the tail bone and he went to one of the big hospitals in the neighboring state\nAnd how they gave him radiation is how most places give radiation which is large areas large number of treatments large areas and they included as bladder even though it was the tale about the sacred the cancer and that\nAnd number one the treatment isn't work their cancer grew back and number two the standard radiation hurt his bladder so he lost control of his bladder and he's angry about that he's angry that they didn't do pinpoint treatment like us he's angry that he wasn't told that they lose control bladder\nAnd he's angry at his wedding his pants\nAnd the treatments at work and the pain is terrible and then he came here and we offered them treatment even though he had treatment in the same area so big teaching point people ask that all the time Dr Lederman\nCan you treat me if I have already been treated and the answer is most likely yes we need to see each person but most likely yes and we were able to treat the mass and the sacred we were able to treat it with no side effects he was so leery about getting treatment because of this big super duper place they treated them\nWith lots of treatment weeks and weeks of treatments that doesn't work and caused him harm\nWhereas with us it was just a few treatments that were pinpoint to the cancer and this pain in his cancer went away what a difference and you can just see from this case exactly why we brought body radio surgery to America because large fields large numbers of treatments weeks and weeks\nJust didn't help him cause harm to him and he's angry about the results of elsewhere he's happy about our results and that's why we're talking about today is\nTo give me an example of our work versus one of the super duper big hospitals and lots of people falsely believe that all the treatments that same it is not the same there's huge differences between our work and the work of others that's why we brought body radio surgery to America that's why\nOur name as radio ushered in New York so you can understand the difference that's why we're on the radio every day\nTo explain the difference to educate she'll get caught up in the weeks and weeks of useless treatment that was toxic to him like that three minutes at that big hospital was to him\nTrading his tail bought most of us never think about our sacred we don't think about the sacred and we don't think about the Sacramento something bad happens and for him hit a cancer travel too sacred to be a standard\nThat just didn't work and caused him harm exactly the opposite of ours ours work with no harm that's the difference that's why we're here Dr lead over thirty for Broadway Broadway at thirtieth street in the heart of New York city [laughter] and I was\nThinking about a woman who Seventy nine years old she was fine until five years ago ... just found the cervix cancer stage four she had back pain she had cancer and those in the neck in the pelvis in the abdomen and she started chemotherapy\nInches on chemotherapy for four years plus immunotherapy I Know I mean the therapy so popular\nShe was on ... therapy it didn't work for years of came out of work shows in the hospital for toxicity shed platelet counts ... two hundred thousand or political was two thousand down by Ninety nine percent of the cats are kept traveling she had cancer and the powers lymph nodes well\nShe finally came to us after four years of chemo therapy she told me yesterday she came in the office yesterday she told me that she was spending\nA million dollars a year her bill was a million dollars a year and just say oh yeah I was the insurance but who's paying insurance you and me are paying the insurance and that's why the rates are so high so I don't think that no one pays someone pays including you and me and everyone else\nAnd finally she came to us and we treated her for that mass in the pelvis for the massive lymph nodes and finally she is out of pain and suffering finally\nAfter four years of chemo for years or even a therapy\nThat doesn't work she came here with good results this is the work that we do every day so when people say oh came out in a work it's time to go home to die or a hospice or something\nTo hold onto your horses there's other choices you don't have to have for years that came out of no it doesn't work at the chemo doesn't work in the short period of time\nMost likely would never work and most people for most people not talking about everybody but for most people came only works temporarily at fast and there's lots of side effects for many people the exact opposite of our work I work is directed at the cancer\nWithout chemicals throughout the body so there's lots of lots of reasons to come to Thirteen any for Broadway Broadway and thirty eight street lots of reasons and I were talking about sixty five year old woman she's married with two kids you had a stroke and high blood pressure diabetes\nJohn dialysis and she had a stroke because at one of the big hospitals and while she was at the hospital with the stroke they've had the breast cancer\nThat is a biopsy they've found breast cancer the cancer was very regular throughout the brass yet probable lymph nodes and her armpit for weight went up twenty pounds from one minute it was Seventy she's five foot one\nI examined her she had a centimeter mass the upper portion of the breast that's the size of my fist huge mess with a three Senate leader mass the armpit they put a port in her chest while they're ready to give her chemotherapy even though she had a stroke\nTwo weeks before just high blood pressure and kidney failure and this mass\nAnd they were going to give her chemotherapy what we know came only works temporarily she came to us and why did she come to us because she was our treatment and she understands with our treatment of beneficial effects most likely or durable with chemotherapy the beneficial effects are likely if they happen temporary\nAnd then four months later he went to see his primary doctor and he went to an ENT was found to have decreased hearing [noise]\nAnd he also remembered what he watched movies or something at home if is one ear was covered by a pillow and he only had the bad ear up he had decreased hearing a decreased hearing on the telephone [noise]\nAnd they finally got an MRI which showed a three point seven centimeter right side of the ... the tumor the hearing there he's an artist you offer goes to parties and draws pictures of people at the parties [noise] uh\nHe has his acoustic ... examined him when examined his balances balance was off we talked about all the options he's been seen by surgeons surgeons\nAnd he went to two big hospitals a certain swagger caught on him but I can say for us three point seven Senate or close to ignore them if they caught on him he will be death for that a year that's guaranteed there'll be deaf in that a year\nThere's about thirty five percent chance of bleeding in the brain spinal fluid league or infection and\nLikely or damage to his face to face it will be paralyzed so and he smiles one side was smiled the other side of his face with his fall down when he closes I when I won't close when he tries to move his face one side will move on one side won't move\nWell it's going to be hard for him to continue as work as a graphic artist goes to parties and things can imagine if he has no hearing and facial paralysis how he's going to function\nAnd insurgents and then he went to see radiation doctors elsewhere and they want them to do surgery also they have no experience where is the largest experience a fraction of radio surgery for a ... in the world it's here with Dr Lederman Thirteen for Broadway\nAnd he came here we spoke to him I spoke very candidly if he has that surgery most likely he'll be death most likely a facial damage there's even a chance he'll die during that surgery there is a death right when they open up that with us we have the largest experience it's just a few treatments treatments or ten minutes\nWe have a high success writer's success rate is Ninety seven percent so very high success rate treating acoustic neural most other tumors in the head\nTreatment in ... pituitary tumors which are all benign tumors but they can cause\nTerrible terrible complications because they put pressure on the brain and the surgery to remove them can be terrible is well\nThis is why we do the work that we do all non invasive work here at Thirteen Eddie for Broadway Broadway and thirty eight street we have a huge experience of a team of experts so here if he comes here he could have non invasive treatment\nMost likely keep his face keep his hearing keep his quality of life\nIf he goes elsewhere to the big hospitals that want to cut on him most likely he'll be death\nMost likely his face will be damaged and most likely his way of life will never be the same for the rest of his life and he's only forty four he's got two little kids at a wife\nAnd I spoke to about all the options and he understands all the options I told him that he has his choice he didn't have a choice of having a ... he has a choice about the treatment this is why\nI brought brain radio sorted to New York I saw so many people getting\nBrain surgery and damage to their brain and even dying from that surgery strokes\nCalamities this is why brought brain radio surrender to New York when every hospital every doctor every facility thought standard treatment was okay standard treatment is not OK and that's
