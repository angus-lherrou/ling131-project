staging we put it in a little needle into the mass and sure enough the cancer has grow and\nWhere it was it before which means that the surgery wasn't successful in fact maybe even the surgery spread

populous places\nThe flu and needs the right atmospheric conditions to spread more effectively let's chalk and check in with Dr Gary right now we're hearing what about the flu season this year what do you think\nThe flu season is your new in Ireland and discussing the flu for six years now and it gets even more confusing or the big flu virus now is called age three and two and the ... is the big hitter especially on the the elderly but George the numbers fly all over the place so the CDC\nIs scaring us that a hundred and Seventy five children died last year\nBut fifty percent of those had preexisting conditions\nYou look on the flip side twelve thousand children died in accidents like cars fires and so forth the confusion gets even worse when um\nThe vaccine last year was only thirty four percent effective and now they've come out with a loving flu vaccines on the market and the CDC has picked up the shop gun and fired away when\nToo many hey use any one of these vaccines\nI don't like that do you\nOh no not at all because your drugstore may be offering a vaccine would should be the cheapest one they can get a hold of that\nIs true there is no ... no one vaccine for everybody

with us for his reaction on the Brett Kavanaugh's appointments go ahead John\n... you know you know the most interesting thing about this is how the Democrats pushed and pushed and finally plate

I mean you know but again he's he's\nHe's preaching to the choir in Iowa you know as a potential uh twenty twenty presidential candidate but I think one of the things that they tried to turn this into\nWas that we want to really investigate his drinking behavior in high school and in college and this is where they think that they have an an impeachable offense where nobody is interested\nIn his drinking behavior they were making an allegation of sexual assault if there was no corroborating evidence even among the witnesses she named\nBen this is over and Susan Collins gauge bury a it was at the end comprehensive\nExplanation of why she voted for him because if the presumptive the presumption of innocence in our constitution gr innocent until proven guilty they have no proof\nWill this pass John\n[noise] no it won't ... this particular issue will house\nBut the bitterness and the rancor between the two party system will not pass you know looking at\nA government that is at

and you will you stumbled into a time warp for several months ago did you\n[noise] I did in fact I broke this story on\nCoast to coast am yes shoot them before I even\nDid it [laughter] and I know that that that\nSounds a bit suspicious but no honestly what I was doing as I said I have this new piece of technology are going to take it to a certain place I don't think I said we're of course that place turned out to be Harriet fifty one\nFrom Las Vegas outside of Las Vegas Nevada and um\nI I I sort of gave everybody a heads up and then when I found something that surprised me um it went viral I mean I I made the international news with this discovery it with the Newsweek inside edition and ABC NBC CBS Fox News\nMedia in Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space time anomaly between Las Vegas and area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert\nThey acknowledge it finally I mean look how many decades that the area fifty one was not even acknowledge as being a real military installation and and now it is but even now they are very particular about how they described it\nAnd so it seems to me that there has been a space for us all ready for a long time and that space force serve the dual purpose I mean it can make a the defense of earth against other earthlings I'm much stronger\nBut at the same time you're defending perhaps all earthlings from some kind of outside potential for invasion\nAnd I think that even if you are listening to this show tonight and you believe that there are aliens or ... or however you want to describe them\nThat are coming here and you think they must be good because if they weren't good they would've destroyed is already if you're in charge of the military\nIf your job is to be suspicious if your job is to protect the people of your country\nThen why would you take a chance and say okay well maybe these beings are benevolent but still why don't we do what ever we can to have whatever we can muster together in place just in case\nJudge you need to send ourselves because they have a change of heart or they've been deceiving\nUs better to be safe than sorry right\nWhy sure you know and and we it might be Utah file I mean you would think that it would be that if the if there are being out there that are coming here that are are so advanced\nThat they um they they ... you know would otherwise destroy is ah if you know if if that was their plan but\nYou know here's this is getting dark this this is very dark but I honestly this is a logical point of view what if George ... if they were going to come back here these beings that ancient alien\nA theorist talk about talk about this kind of thing many times on the History Channel\n[noise] um if they they come back and they want to enslave us again\nBecause a lot of people believe especially if you look at like Zacharias ... work and all that that they came here and modified our our genetics in our DNA to in slave us and treat us as minors for gold or whatever if their goal is to come back here in ...\nIt might be a better fate for us to commit to global suicide in other words and again I told you this is going to be dark what if a lot of these governments actually have some kind of plan in place where they say rather than have these beings come back\nAnd put you know callers on us and and work us like animals we hit these buttons and we just annihilate ourselves spooky but what if that's the case\nSo do stay button basically\nAnd an end to the idea is that we're not necessarily as concerned about each other as we are\nAbout the force from outside and you're going back to Ronald Reagan I'm I'm sure you recall that kind of eerie comment that he made a one of his speeches I Believe it might have been before the un\nYou know that what if there was an alien threat [laughter] what\nDid he really mean by that you know he was he was just being facetious to try to talk to people about banning together or does he really knows something at the time\nWhen you look back at all of these people who have made deathbed confessions who are related to raw as well and um you know the whole suspicion that surrounds researchers to this day who goes snooping a little too much and digging a little too deep [noise] I mean\nThere is something to this idea that we may be up against potentially a some visitors here if you want to call them visitors they call them are just as easily invaders but there may be some some ah beings\nThat we have got to do our best to defend against and they're using space time manipulating technology in order to completely I'm Out maneuver anything that we can do\nAnd so once we see it possible examples like I'm perhaps present thing that maybe now we humans are experimenting with some stuff\nSadly enough weaponry which also may have a space time manipulating affect\nAh this could be a particularly worrisome for those beings if they say okay we made a little trade off we gave them if you little nuggets of wisdom but boy the the the earthlings have run with it and so we need to put them back in their place\nJosh tell us about your event coming up in

Nineteen years Middle East\nUh I had an uncle had passed away and they were having a little selfish pointed at church and I wasn't that close to him but I just said you know anyway I I went I was late getting and so I had to sit in the back or this treacherous\nAnd services going on and all of a sudden I felt some somebody standing behind me behind one of the push you a check and I looked up and it was my uncle\nThey just passed away and and he\nTold me he said John ... your car and I wish I was shot at it and what to do and then again he said John don't value car when\nI was so scared I had to get out of there so I get up\nLate and what he was gone\nBut still I was a ...\nAnd so I got her at home with a friend of mine and next morning I called my cousin which was the man it passed away\nAnd asking ... bringing my car to get him right back home he shouldn't matter though so he and his go and get my car and took over the cage full net anyway he um he looked at my home and they pull that that ... ... and they were hit\nBy a truck and they they weren't killed but they were extremely you know injured a threat I mean they had ... votes in that too\nBut I never told me like this and that was really like to see anything that when I did tell two of my close friends and I'm like wait and not with the show they have the I guess you know up until now I haven't told\nMe in the in the morning was just not to be in that car as opposed to you driving the\nCar you know what I didn't want to go out and he told me down and\nSaid you didn't think it would carry on to them no no no they didn't have any idea\nThey engage in my car but they were ... they weren't killed but that was a time I had to think like a safe stage ghost you get all the same thing actually seen him\nJosh why does spirits come across like that in warn you\nYeah well you know John ... thank you for that that's a great call and it I Believe represents one of the most interesting aspects of the spiritual realm [noise]\nYou know scientist who are the smartest folks who among us right now who are at you know the astrophysicist a cosmologist a quantum physicist they're telling us\nThat we have the mathematical

that we humans are\nSpirits and the material world it's like the song by the police\nAnd so when you are spirit trapped here in this material body you're only able to process what's happening on the timeline little by little a minute by minute hour by hour a day by day week by week and so on\nBut once you are no longer in this body it seems like you're able to have an awareness of things that extend far beyond what we physical\nOr physically incarnate as humans call the presents\nAnd so it would make perfect sense that if you have a loved one\nEspecially one who has recently passed into the spiritual realm\nThat person may be astounded by the fact that he or she can now see\nThe future to a degree that you cannot or it might almost be like comparing the perspective of enhanced to the ... to the perspective of an eagle ah they're both physical beings but they just have a different point of view and then when the eagles way up high he can see the storms\nThat are coming that the aunt can't see that the answer's more sensitive to what's happening on on a lower level\nSo anyway all that said your relatives or friends or loved ones who Passover my definitely be able to see beyond the scope of the temporary situation\nAnd see somewhat into the future and that would certainly be great motivation for them to come and give you a warning and in this case John and it seems like that's the most likely thing that happened to you\nAny updates with Robert de haunted dull Josh\n[noise] you know Robert at this point lives like a king and ... and this is very funny because he still does ...\nYeah yeah I mean I I haven't seen him in a while now but Robert I think really became famous or some would say infamous as Robert\nBecause that a lot of people were sort of a chiding him and uh I don't want to use the word abusing him but basically there\nThey were taking him out and cathartic Lee releasing their pent up frustrations on him and it was when the shock wave of curses and bad luck started hitting all those people\nThat suddenly word began to spread like okay this dog here and you know\nRomney was fighting back\nYeah and it's because of that that um he I Believe now is so famous because the word has now spread for so long that if you go to see how you have to be respectful people now take it seriously and I don't think that there are nearly as many people\nBut what I can tell you is that there are places on earth\nThat produced an incredible amount of natural energy\nAnd that that energy have as a byproduct a bunch of paranormal activity that spins off so you get more ... and counter is people seeing you out of time flips scripted all that kind of stuff but and it's raw form\nIt's almost like Meridian Z on planet earth that acupuncture is Mike compare to the Meridian of energy the flow on a human body\nThese are places that conduct electricity and when that electricity manifest and interact in certain angles at certain cliff it can create what similar to to ball whitening\nAnd so you have so much of that which is creepy around western North Carolina but at the same time it almost seems to sometimes have a consciousness and so we're still uncertain as to whether or not these ball the white\nAre just merely and simply a raw natural phenomenon like ball lightning or if they might also have some sense of intelligence and ah this is what makes this such a great mystery\nJoshua ...

I perfectly\nAnd he's looking at me and I start mouth and they continue mop like okay this kind of eerie any pushing pretty hard and so I was wondering it seems like since I've been working there for about a month like he think it's maybe around October is that we're\nIn the spirit to really show theirselves or and he\nWasn't supposed to be there or was he\nI don't think so I talked to see in a in a couple of the nurses and they told me\nThat they everyone who goes in there by their cell or maybe two or three people that they feel like someone to watching them and I was just wondering might huh Josh or what do you guys think 'cause like it seems to me is October 'cause it's not a full moon because of the full moon I can tell you what it gets really crazy around the hospital for whatever reason\nHuh do you know the little boy died there\nYou know I asked them and they sent from what we understand no owned died there but they said we don't know a full history\nOf Illinois in hospital where do you think Josh\n[noise] well ... thank you for that call and yes I think that this time of year has more prominent paranormal activity for at least three reasons\nReason number one goes back to what I was saying earlier in the show about the earth tilting away from the sun and subtle energy fields being magnified or at least being more perceptive ... so that's that's number one number two is that\nHere again in our part of the world in the northern hemisphere\nMost places have a colder\nDrier environment and I know that's certainly the case in Utah\nSo that means there is a larger build up of electro static charges so when you lay down at night and you pull your sheets up you might see those little blue sparks flying around the similar to when you're drag your socks on the carpet and touch the door knob\nAnd there is a definite relationship between enhanced electro static charge and the ability for paranormal phenomenon to materialize and interact\nOr in my laboratory over the years I've been able to reproduce many of the things\nThat people talk about when they encounter the paranormal using electromagnetic charges such as creating Loomis life forms making objects move without any visible source or creating the sensation of a cold spot or a cold wind where they call an eye on when\nI'm making your hair stand on end these are all things that you can do artificially with electro steady charge and yet\nWhen you go to these places where people are often experiencing extreme paranormal phenomena you find that there are these very strong electro static anomalies in the area so there's some connection there\nRegarding how that the non physical realm of the spiritual might be able to temporarily interact with the physical realm\nAnd that reminds me of how something like a magnet has this invisible filled around that that creates a physical effect but then the third and final point of course is that this time of year we're talking about it more I mean you go to the store\nYou see all of these things that reminds you of the paranormal spooky the afterlife\nYou see it all on TV you see the movies coming out and so you combine those three things together and certainly it means that again at least here in the United states\nThis is the time of year when we have the highest likelihood of experiencing something go sleep spooky ... or at very least metaphysical\nInsurance don't you get energized during this time of the year for some reason\n[noise] well I Do and I think you know part of that goes back to the fact that you know I was born this month and so you know that's always been a time a celebration my mom and dad have always been fantastic people who've always been a really cool arranging nice things for me and growing up in western North Carolina\nUh especially in Asheville when when the leaves are splashed with color and everybody is becoming very festive um it's a great reflection of that original celebrate tore mood\nFrom the old world in fact so many people of Scots Irish descent came into the mountains of western North Carolina because\nFound them familiar that ah every single genealogist ever talked to says there are more people for example Scottish dissent in North Carolina then there are in Scotland\nAnd uh we should remember that the very first attempt\nAt an English Settlement was in North Carolina on the coast at a place called Roanoke Island\nAnd they all manner so we now know that today is one of the history of the greatest mystery the ah last calling me and so I was born in the area that had um an enormous amount of influence\nFrom the early you know Scots Irish originated these ideas about celebrating fell on Halloween and so that combined with my birthday makes me very excited and I'm sure contributed to the fact that the I Love this time of year\nThirty seconds or give us your ability to get more and more time\nOr I go to Joshua pie Warren dot com has no period after the beep Joshua will be Warren dot com this Saturday October Thirteen in Hollywood two to four pm\nIt is my final wishing machine extravaganza everybody gets a free gift I'm not going to disappoint you

stories all about the supernatural he was with us a couple of months ago with Richard Sayre and talking about some haunted rock and roll that was a classic mad welcome back to the program\nThank you very much thanks for having me on\nVery background hot as a journalist get involved in the unusual in the paranormal\nWell the simple answer was I was born that way\nOn Halloween or yeah yeah oh happy birthday coming up yeah\nThank you very much so that really kind of started my interest in it I don't ever remember a time where I wasn't interested in ghost stories horror movies and the like so I just learned uh I I never really wrote about it until I started to work as a reporter\nAnd uh every Halloween I Would try to write a a a feature story a Halloween feature story\nAnd so I started to write a story about um local ghosts legends around the area where I was born and ah the reaction to that story was so overwhelming that I thought well there's really something here\nAnd so since then I've I've combined my interest in history and folklore and go stories and just kind of combined them altogether\nDid your birthday cut into Halloween or did Halloween cut into your birthday when you're ... you\nKnow it it sort of a made my birthday ex financial I refer to it as the season of Matt now\n[laughter] I Love it is kicking off the year I Love this quarter October November December it's it is the best absolutely in how did you get your interest in World War two\nWell after I wrote you know I wrote three books about a music in the supernatural and at a certain point I wanted to uh find another project to place with my publisher and initially I thought I I I'm you know to be completely transparent I consider myself more of a civil war geek [laughter]\nUm but I started to look around at writing a civil war book but what I found is that there's just so many so much good stuff out there already\nAre and that people have compiled a numerous books so I didn't think I could really add anything to that area of ah of ghost stories and a supernatural\nSo I just started I turn towards a World War two uh and started to research whether there were any ghost stories and and sure enough there were there were plenty of good stories that I could compile in a way that I I like to do it I like to do I like to couple ghost stories with\nYou know tales of secret in cities and and forty entails so a haunted World War two it turned into beaches to really a deep area for me to explore and that's that's kind of what I like to do\nAny harm to the world war two where these goals stories and events from World war one that overlapped in World War two or with these things happening during the second war\nSo most of the stories that I I compile our stories from World war two not between the wars\nAnd and they occur they continue to occur believe it or not\nWhat creates the difference between these kinds of ghost stories I Would call the military on teens as opposed to regular kind\n[noise] that that's a that's a great question because um [noise] you know most\nOf the stories that I wrote about before a university goes stories haunted rock and roll go stories of country music\nThere was there sort of a light hearted aspect of those stories compared to what I found myself into when I started to research the world war two go slower um and I think when you're dealing with war and warriors and victims of of\nAtrocities and World War two probably set a new standard and violence and atrocities so there is a deep seriousness about the material and I really want to honor the sacrifices especially from the soldiers and sailors Marines\nUh you know when you're dealing with this these acts of Vail valor on on Normandy and\nYou know all of those stories you want to make sure that your your ah honoring a what they they brought or the other thing that I found a little different when I started to research haunted World War two was that\nUm [noise]\nKnow you want to make sure that you get the history right\nI'm history serves as a backdrop for a lot of these stories and I think go stories are are one way that people help preserve the past\nBut sometimes they're not perfect in the history so what I found myself doing is a lot of times is is uh finding these go stories and then trying to confirm to make sure that history was correct a you know I've been\nI've never looked for whether a a ... or was available to German troops in ... during the Normandy invasion but you know I found myself looking looking at those types of details so I think those are two reasons why the these stories are a lot different from the stories that I worked on before\nWhat isn't Matthew about the battlefield that seems to enhance the stories\nIn and they could be anywhere they could be I had um a friend who just went to the little big corn oh we're accustomed to less than was and you know he's convinced that's haunted to Gettysburg Reno was haunted right I'm sure there are other battlefields that are but what is it about war\nThat creates these hunting does it because sadly enough these Soldiers Die so suddenly and they just still hang around what what's going on there\n... there there are a lot of theories about\nWhy battlefield seemed to attract these ... more so than than other places um [noise] in their ... essentially is two camps on this so you have on one hand you have the paranormal theorists\nAnd they said that this in in one case a they say that this violence and trauma\nOf war ah causes these um almost in the event almost in beds itself in time and space it gets repeated over and over so that kind of explains what they would consider residual ...\nNow on the other hand there there are some of the arrests that also say that\nYou know the shock of war happens so quick that maybe people have a hard time transitioning maybe their spirits have a hard time transitioning from one playing to the next that's that's the other theory now there's a whole skeptical side of this too and what\nThe skeptics would suggest is that because these areas are profoundly moving emotionally when you talk about the sacrifice when you talk about\nThe death and the tragedy that it raises your consciousness that maybe you mistake normal uh activity normal phenomena for paranormal phenomena so those seem to be the main theories behind why these battlefields are so haunted\nIs there a specific battlefield that you would say is the most talented a bowl\n[noise] I think the consensus wise I Would say a Normandy is extremely haunted um there's just\nDoesn't stories are especially\nAnd it might be because there are a lot of tourists are that are visiting that area and so a lot of this tourist there documenting what happens but the bunkers the fortifications are seem to be haunted one of the stories that I found a particularly interesting was that a\nA father and daughter visited the battlefield\nAnd that's part of France for people who don't know where it is\nRight yeah Normandy, France uh and uh the the father and the daughter visited the Normandy beaches and we're exploring some of the fortifications and went into a bunker and when\nThe daughter and and father said that when they came out of the bunkers they they didn't really talk too much about it but then later the daughter said that when she was in there she saw these figures are these people actually in the bunker somewhere laying down somewhere looking out the window and then she started to describe\nTheir uniforms and the father who was a World War two buff uh immediately ... ah recognize these uniforms is German uniforms\nAnd later he decided he wouldn't press the issue on a writer right away but then later he talks to her and he brought out a book of weaponry and and uniforms in and asked her to look through it and identify what she saw\nAnd he claims that she had no access to any World War two history books she truck he tried to keep that away from her because she was so young but then she began to describe the guns that were there the uniforms that were there\nAnd they all matched or what could have been in that bunker at that time so you do have stories like that from a pretty credible sources that they've had these experiences in Normandy and that certainly wasn't the only one that happened in those bunkers\nAbout for prop ... engine it look like a World War two bomber\nSo of course skeptics believe that it was probably you know a either a current military plane or possibly a um maybe a a bomb or going to an air show or something\nLike that was what they do what they thought yeah you're right\nBut to counter that a lot of these people that solve this first of all\nThere didn't seem to be a pattern a flight with with this there didn't seem to be a straight line as you might see with a a a a regular conventional non spooky aircraft disappeared in different areas throughout that region\nAnd a couple of the people that spotted this one in particular worked uh\nFor a an airfield during World War two was ... I Believe I'm a somewhat flight mechanics for the for the R. E. F. so definitely would have known the difference between let's say a modern\nI get from Hercules aircraft and something like a beat twenty four or Lancaster Bomber and and this person described it either as a Lancaster or is it be twenty four bomber\nTo a pretty peculiar and and there have been other what they call goes plane flaps a throughout history and I think there was even one as I was writing this book so two thousand Seventeen um pretty interesting\nMathieu did they describe called the planes would disappear how would how how they would leave\nIf the one couple of just said that it flew overhead and they thought it was going to crash and I believe they pulled over to see you know see if it did crash or at least to hear it and it just it just kind of disappeared\nJust to like that yeah yeah like they want to do a different time war or something right\nIn the reason I looked into the these are a ghost plane stories is when I was young my parents woke up early one morning it was a sort of a misty foggy morning and um they went for their morning walk and my parents came back in\nAnd said that as they were starting their walk they saw an absolutely huge aircraft coming down just a few hundred feet off the ground and it was very foggy a ... you make it sound went overhead and then just kind of disappeared into the mess that would be Yuri\nThat watch it with my mom was still telling that story over and over and that's what made me think well\nEngland was just a huge aircraft carrier back in World War two I wondered whether they had any any stories similar and sure enough it's a it's not that it happens all the time but it it's certainly a rather common occurrence for these goes planes to be seen\nI bet they handles hundreds on we're going to come back and talk more about how to World War two next hour you'll share your questions and stories where this\nGoes website is no conveniently optimized for mobile devices if you're a ... students ... you can listen to live in his shoes right on your phone just goes to goes to um dot com on your iPhone or Android Browser\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh\n\nThis is coast to coast with George Nouri\nGot some free videos for your coast to coast am dot com you can see are beyond belief shows bill ... takes us on a guide to a journey through space and time doing\nExplore ancient mystical rooms go take a look at it in our highlights reel the coast to coast am dot com you just click it and take it away and have some fun looking for ways to preserve views here symmetrical way\nThere are things about the states that so many adults complain about the age namely bags under the ice cores crows feet fine lines and wrinkle finally there's an immediate fear it's called instantly ate and ate defined Michael cream that accent less than two minutes no needles no pain you're happier\nYounger looking you it simple to you take a small drop lightly applied to target areas lead them until dry then apply cosmetic it necessary it's great for men and women people are amazed at how fast at work here some reaction with actual instantly age ... he is or\nHow they know that in the ... year that my I gained a lot of fine lines ... may have gotten cheaper wow something for five years but I think that they can you go back into\nThe ...

ghosts of country music more hunt and rock and roll we'll talk a little bit about that tonight\nPilots were trained bomber pilots fighter pilots a fighter pilots for a night I'm fighting a squadron were documented some of some of the most startling run ins with these UFOs\nThere's a story of alone be Seventeen crew that wants to UFO track them for miles I think almost a about an hour\nAnd then of course a lot of people consider what's known as the battle of Los Angeles\nWas a great story of those\nYeah that's an amazing story and a and usually I think the was the story was the moving Nineteen forty one with John Belushi they made it seem like it was just based on what the war department called war nerves in other words this was\nA shortly after World War two I think er I'm Sorry after the bombing of Pearl Harbor I Believe it was in February of Nineteen forty two\n[noise] and aircraft gunners anti aircraft guns started firing in the air there was all kinds of pandemonium a and the war department just said the the people were nervous but I found it very uh an account from a very uh good witness\nWho are actually it was ... a professor\nAt occidental college um\nLater he was just a kid at the time and he said that ah what he witnessed was a huge object that was pretty much just standing\nAt it sitting still in the middle of the ... right above the ocean that these guns were trained right on it and it didn't seem to have any effect and then it drifted it almost sounded like it drifted right over his head so it was\nTo me that was more of a story about something weird happening in the sky let alone a war nerves\nIll and and they shot against the math you people could hear ... sounds\nYeah and we're hitting something\nRight this this person actually said uh some of the shells were landing a few feet away from them and they had a the spotlight trained on it I think there's a a pretty dramatic picture that shows that\nIt is dramatic Matthew swing with us his latest book haunted World War two where do you get the book math you\nYou can get it at Amazon dot com Barnes and noble dot com go to your um a local bookstore and see if they have it in if they don't shake 'em down and try to get it in for me I'd appreciate it\nWhat about haunted ship from World war two\nWell I didn't want to just I didn't want to leave our our sailors out\nNo nine years maybe for me so let's not leave aside\nWell yeah I'm I'm going to make sure I have those in there so\nThe interesting thing about a ... after World War two was you had these battleships\nYou had ... ah aircraft carriers and they were engaged in so many activities so much a honor that uh the sailor served in that it was a shame to just scatter all them or to reduce them to scrap but luckily for us a lot of\nPeople got into preserving those um ships those aircraft carriers and his battleships as living museums and they brought him back to different ports and and also when they brought him back to these ports\nThey brought a lot of a ghost stories with them and and some of the ones that I collected the USS Yorktown which is now in Charleston Harbor\nUm there's a lot of activity or a witness their shadow figure is probably one of the ones they call them shadow ed and Ed's stands for enemy designated which was a World War two term for\nWhen you come in contact with the enemy [noise] uh there's some pretty dramatic stories of ghost hunters chasing this shadow creature around the the carrier USS Hornet I think is probably one of the most documented\nA ship based uh audited sites uh there there is a story about a man dressed in a white naval uniform\nWho uh wanders around the deck some of the battle ships the USS North Carolina I worked with um a a few a paranormal investigator from Port city paranormal and they basically told me they they have a career documenting the ... on there\nUm and of course we mentioned USS Arizona all of those uh and there there are a lot more I was finding them even as a I was starting to publish this book\nSo yeah they're the a lot of World War two ships are on it and I'm just glad that they preserved them and have him back here goes and all\nJust an amazing series of events that have been happening that seem to all of a similarity in that has to do with tragedy ... for some reason tragedy makes these ghosts or whatever we want to call them hang around don't you think\n[noise] yeah I mean absolutely that seems to be the one common element\nOf uh you know I'll say not just the ghosts of World War two but when you talk about haunted rock and roll which I investigated and even some of the ghost stories of\nOf country these tragedies just seemed to linger it's like either the spirit doesn't want to let go uh somehow this is a a\nInteraction between consciousness of reality or maybe they were just so primed um to to when we hear these tragedies to maybe hope that that uh the spirits go on or the spirits linger there's probably a lot of different reasons for that those are just some of the ones that I've come across\nOur special guest of course is Matthew ... we're going to take calls next hour with him stories and questions of course and uh let's get into when we come back also after the break Matthew a little bit of your haunted rock and roll stories those are those are fantastic too\nI Love them that's one of my favorites\nThey just keep coming more and more and more they just never stop like you know people like Michael Jackson who passed on now when prince and folks like that have they come back you up to a ... as a ghost\nWell there are definitely go stories about Michael Jackson uh there were a few video anomalies\nWhen I'm when I Believe his brother and believe it might have been germane was being interviewed people said they saw Michael Jackson walk behind him there are stories from a neighbor's of a former home owned by Michael Jackson claimed hear music coming out of it at odd

welcome\nBack to coast to coast Matthew swing with us Matthew I'm Adolf Hitler as sick as he was was also interested in the cult did you come across anything that the dealt with that\n[noise] you know I did and I came away with a little bit of a different perspective about Hitler in the cold\nOr you know initially I thought that Hitler was a a cult practitioner throughout his life but what I found through my research and this is pretty controversial and I'm sure there will people have have different ideas and I'd be glad to entertain those thoughts too\nBut it sounds like Hitler's\nEarly a philosophy was are influenced by a cult groups like the full society in the real society very prevalent\nIn a pre World War two Germany in that area but what I think happened was that Hitler was of all things\nAre not an occult theorists but more of an incredible\nSociopathic nurse assistant I don't think he could think\nThat there was any type of power a worthy of him I think he thought he was the ultimate power and that the state was the ultimate power and so what you see later is that a Hitler begins to purge a lot of it is a cold groups he starts to go after fortune tellers\nAnd astrologers so I came away with a little bit\nOf a different opinion on the cold in in Nazi Germany uh likewise I was sort of fascinated that the coal played a much bigger role in my opinion among uh\nThe side of the allied side so there were the wiccan in England who uh\nTry to get together to uh spiritually or go after the Nazi regime they held\nMeetings and the ... got together with the express purpose of trying to to stop 'em Germany from invading England and likewise uh and I really picked us up from a frequent guest on coast to coast Mitch or with\nUh the allied a new thought ...\nA movement those are a lot of the practitioners for that group were very involved into trying to use\nSpiritual techniques a cult techniques to stop Hitler from uh from succeeding so those were a different ways that are ... you know when I tried to write a book I'm I'm really I Know a lot of people write books because they know a lot I like to learn a lot\nSo I go into a some of these stories with really preconceived notions and then as I delve into it I find twists and turns that that I I Try to bring out uh in in the book\nNow in your stories on haunted rock and roll told me the theme about those\nWere the theme about haunted rock and roll is\nThat I really when I started writing hard rock and roll and again another I listen to our Gary Patterson on your show many times uh and uh
