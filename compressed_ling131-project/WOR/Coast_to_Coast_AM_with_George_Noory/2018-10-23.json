about Fifteen sixteen\nAnd again she went to the emergency room and the end they did an ultrasound they saw a mess and well\nShe ended up in the emergency room admit the doctors look I've been talking about Paul auer to go the emergency room they call the kidney surgeon urologist and he says oh you got a mass under kidney you need to cut out your kidney\nAnd she's in the hospital in a room with an IV feel like she's got to do that right that she's got to do that and they told her well it's just an the kidney they need to cut out the kid they and then she'll be okay that's what they tell her and so she agreed\nAnd she cut out the kidney and before the kidney was removed her kidney function was pretty good she was doing pretty good or ... which is a measurement of the kidney function was\nTwo and then the surge into the super duper big hospital cut out or kidney yeah they cut out or kidney and they didn't tower when they cut out the kidney her can't sir of the kidney\nThat the correct name and the kidney function will fall into it near dialysis range so they cut out or kidney her crediting went from to up to six point three\nThat she can barely survive without dialysis that she said back pain and only after they cut out the kidney to go into kidney failure and the power\nThat the cancer had traveled uh traveled to the lymph nodes and they knew that before they knew that before the kidney was removed that the cancer traveled to the lymph nodes to paralytic lymph nodes\nTo retro parents Neal lymph nodes possibly even to the liver and still they cut out her kidney why why would they cut out her kidneys stage for cancer knowing that when they called the kidney she's going to go into kidney failure probably dialysis now she's shopping around town\nChemotherapy doctors don't want to give her chemo because she's ready to go on dialysis had chemo doesn't work very well for kidney cancer and so she's stuck\nShe's stuck because they cut out a functioning kidney when they could have told her hey you can see Dr Lederman Dr Lederman country a kidney cancer or kidney cancer was about two centimeters we\nCould have treated the cancer the kidney non invasive Lee and kept her kidney their kidney functioning so for her sad to say she lost her kidney she lost her kidney function probably will be on dialysis but we're going to be here for\nHer if she wants us to

more mass poverty over there you're\nGoing to get even going more immigrants\nComing to the United states but the fact is that we need these people essentially to do the unskilled labor that nobody is

O. two [noise]\nAnd if we produce them on Mars and they called a a floor carp and cash is we sometimes manufacture them on earth for use in refrigerators and air conditioners um the the uh but we didn't put them in such machines and said we just released them to the atmosphere\nAnd we were producing with the same rate we're producing them on earth right now in fifty years we'd warm bars by ten centigrade bats ally okay that's an awful lot that's ten times as much as anybody is talking about global warming happening on earth and the the uh\nAnd if you warmed Mars that much\nThat warming itself would force carbon dioxide to come out of the uh the soil because it's been sponge to and it would out gas and ... with thick in the atmosphere a lot with C. O. two which is a greenhouse gas\nAnd that would warm the planet even more so much so that the frozen water those those glaciers that we're talking about they start to melt they start to flow and this was much ... fresh water in most places there is a north of\nMel oceans fall I bet\nWell planet why there is in those particular glaciers probably as much as to the American Great Lakes [noise] um and the the um but yes\nThe waters on Mars it's frozen at all kinds of places would start to melt the dry rivers on Mars would start to flow the lakes and seas would start to fill up and they would also be rain\nAnd once you have that kind of planet with a thick sealed to atmosphere liquid water rain man you can start spreading plants around\nNow if we were using that kind of plants we have on earth now which are only about one percent efficient in in capturing sunlight and I'm doing photosynthesis or it would take a thousand years for them to make enough oxygen for Mars to be breed the all\nBut if we're talking a hundred years from now it's really not too far out to assume that we can do genetic engineering of plants to make them instead of one percent deficient five percent efficient\nAnd in which case this thing could happen much much faster and um so I think Mars is going to be tariffs formed within two hundred years\nAnd my guess is it'll probably be done by ways that are more efficient than what I just described to you because they're going to be doing this with technologies we don't know about\nAnd who's going to do with the Robert what country but\nThe Martians\nOr they're going to do with themselves\nNo when we talk about competition I don't see Russia as really pushing it space program which I mean they want you as soon as I ss and they bring us back\nA rumble set a tragedy a few weeks ago with a couple of their cosmonauts an astronaut that had to abort but I see China and India is coming along strong how about you\n[noise] well ah here's the thing I'm the revolution\nIn space flight is really going to put the question to these people I'm a I think India's gonna rise to the challenge but now China and Russia are going to both face it a real question [noise]\nWhich is are they going to allow private space launch companies\nMy guess the Chinese will because they've seen the benefit of a of of privatization in terms of their very rapid progress since they moved away from command economy um but Russia [noise]\nThe the issue there is not allowing a a private space launch companies but allowing space launch companies to believe that if they got started they wouldn't get stolen by the government [noise]\nUm and uh because you know the Russian government is is basically a organized crime I mean you know Russia is not a country with an organized crime problem it's an organized crime family with a country\n[noise] and uh the the uh and so if if if they are going to have their own space sexes and they're going to need to have them if they're going to be competitive that's the thing um\nHold on Broadway and we're at the top of the hour we'll come back we'll talk more about this and will open up the phone lines with Robert Zubrin next on coast to coast they sign up no\nGo zone or read email newsletter today it goes to goes to um done um\n\n\nYour books you read is number one seven\nSale shall I put out compromise in your

go back to coast to coast rubber ... with us we'll get your calls in the seconds rubber we're talking about the other countries that are out there blind to do things in space a far advanced is China right now\nWhat I say China right now I'm is about where the U.S was around Nineteen sixty seven [noise] um I mean in terms of manned space flight you know they've been to earth orbit\nI mean there are a bit beyond that I mean they haven't gone to the moon of course on the other hand they could launch a small space station\nWhich we did not have them and do they have the rockets and the capability to do that\n[noise] to go to the moon ... um\nThey can have it pretty soon a I mean but the thing is this okay it's once again um\nThere's a new paradigm now and ... these are entrepreneurial space companies which have shown they can do things\nThat a state run space companies can't too and they can do the things that those companies can do in one third the time at one tenth the cost and if uh other countries took on it uh keep up with the United states right now they're going to have to have their own space access\nNational space programs are not going to be able to match them\nAnd um and that means that for example Russia is going to have to come to terms\nWith understanding that they're going to need to have rule of law there that they cannot have a government that simply steals\nWhole industries for people because I'm no one's going to make it if someone else can take it\nAnd uh so potent once Russia to remain a ... I'm a strong in space which by the way is a military necessity or if you're going to be a first class power\nBut it's right or you have to be first class in space um Russia's gonna have to change and it's interesting I mean you know a a a reason is a ...\nIn a certain I mean ... ... the reason why the um the Russian government or promoted mass literacy west and the twentieth century you illiterate armies could no longer cut it well\nThey're also going to have to go beyond that they're going to have to enter the modern world and other ways\nAnd um so that's another good thing that that Iran must has done for the world\nThat's pretty dramatic I think the fact that the privatization as doing what it's doing do you ever see the day Robert The privatization could backfire and all of a sudden some of these companies could go rogue doing all kinds of things\nGo rogue I don't know about it in a like a James Bond movie where all of a sudden they tried to launch a weapon or something like that\nWell I'm a I I Know I I\nI don't think they're going to launch weapons or the um [noise] you know I'm\nAll us where you hire them to do that\nWell yeah well it's it's states that one weapons okay I mean 'cause what after all is a state but it is a a military force that exists\nWell ah the presumably to protect its people but also it controls its people by having a monopoly or a near\nMonopoly on force and um the you know um but no I I don't think that means ... a different objection people sometimes have is that uh\nYou know if if space becomes totally privatized then gee it'll just be a the rich that get to go to Mars well [noise]\nUm [noise] it's frankly easier to get rich than to become an astronaut or right and um and also I think that um you know if they open the path to the moon and Mars it will get cheaper it will become something that I'm\nIncreasingly not just the super rich but then the rich and the middle class and ultimately the working ... to go [noise]\nAnd um you know once upon a time you really had to to to be in the high income level in order to fly on airplanes you know to [noise] uh and now everybody doesn't\nWhat about propulsion we're ever going to do better than the kind of proportion rocketry propulsion we have today\nWell sure well I'm now ... there's two different issues here one is earth orbit and the other is in space propulsion\nNow earth orbit is is a pretty hard thing to do right now the only thing we know how to do is with rockets\nBut um if we could create air breathing propulsion that can operate at those beams or they were the launch vehicles could become much more efficient because most of the propellant you know in the rocket is the oxygen and it's not feel [noise]\nIf you could get the oxygen from the air the way a jet does it become much cheaper to fly to orbit [noise]\nUm that's going to require some um technological advances but you know who knows uh\nThe you know the next new kid on the block who may ah ah you know knock you out in Moscow office a perch by saying well I'm going to do something that you've never done I'm going to create air breathing propulsion to orbit [noise]\nUm so take that Mr mosque um and ah because you know there's always something new and then in terms of space travel [noise] um [noise]\nWell um\nWe could I mean the the ultimate would be in my view fusion rockets I'm finished using fusion power to create very high temperature very high velocity exhausts a would allow us to travel around the solar system at much higher speeds and even attempt

office after I listen\nTo your show legs\nAnyhow hey I'm I'm enjoying the show the ... and the idea of the question though in a moral issue as far as Mars I'm willing to get there if we find someone and tell us your life do we really have the right to invade like the American like uh Europe did on the American Indian or\n\nOK still there oh yeah yeah a lot I can hear you sir go ahead I'm okay All right well here's the thing um [noise]\nThere there isn't intelligent life on Mars now okay there may be microbial life and for people to say a for us to land on a planet and take it over when there is already microbial life there is really a going off the deep end okay because [noise]\nUh what we did to the American Indians was wrong because they were people right and you can even make an argument that what we did to the American to nature wild nature on America was wrong because you have these magnificent herds of buffalo in redwood forest and all this\nAnd and and we destroyed most of that in order to create what we have here now now I actually believe that while we did destroy some things that were worthwhile we created much more and I would not\nUndo the settlement of America but on Mars there are new Indians there are no buys in hurts there are no\nRedwoods there's just a desert with maybe some microbes in it and and I submit to you that if there have been nothing here when Christopher Columbus landed but a desert with some microbes under the rocks um nobody be picketing Columbus Day parades today\nRobert de ... we were talking about of course things that could happen you know how far out in the future ten years going to Mars can we get the ...\n[noise] yeah I I I Do I I think that at the rate that space sex is currently proceeding or having the first people on Mars before the end of the twenty twenties is a very realistic prospect\nWhat do you think of these Japanese plans to mine asteroids I don't know how they're going to do that\n[noise] well um I I think that's a little um futuristic at this point uh I think though that if we have laws that allow people\nState mining claims on asteroids say in return for surveying them to a certain degree of of detail [noise] uh that we could get privately funding asteroid prospecting missions uh being launched a ... in the ...\nIn the future of that is because a mining claim even if you can't mine it today if if you think you're going to be able to mine it Thirty years from now or fifty years from now\nIs that are in shadow even in earth orbit can get cold so you kinda have to watch that\nUh but space itself doesn't really have a temperature but certainly the the power of the sun is much more when you're close to it you get hotter much faster I'm now second question\nProfiles of people well\nOkay

Braun and some of those incredible mine's\nWell they had some pretty good wants to uh they had Cora live a who was a great rocket engineer\nSo as Germans technology that help the Soviets to\nWell they they captured some vie to split a as did we but I I got to tell you well I mean you know I mean there's no question that von Braun and his team were top notch and and we\nActually got the real rocket engineers Soviets captured a lot of the two rockets but they they mostly got the second tier kind of people we we got\nWe got the cream of the crop as they say\nYeah we did um but um you know by the sixties we had developed our own rocket engineers although the German team continued to play a role through about the early seventies um I met a few of them\nWas amazing to see people who are born in the eighties for example Robert or even the nineties\nNever had a chance to experience what a lot of us went through a lot of people who are listening to the program right now during those critical time periods I mean the moon landings but Nick all that stuff was just so historical ah we really lived and we have lived through some incredible time several we\nYes but I I like to see America once again to become a country whose Creigh Deeds are\nTo be found in newspapers and not in museums just a you know and so you know like the Apollo Thirteen movie or just now the moody last man effort not last man first\nHampers you well maybe they'll ask them no one\nHere [laughter] yeah well I think is a pretty good movie by the way I just saw it um\nWhat'd you think about the lack of the American flag being in the movie\nYou know they do show the American flag on more on the moon they just don't show them planting it\nOh okay okay\nThat this movie some people found it a bit slow because it was a lot in there about you know good Neil Armstrong's relationship with his kids and his wife and so forth but I thought it was pretty strong especially you know the scenes with the ex Fifteen and the Gemini and Gino flight\nAnd uh the actual moon landing itself\nI thought were absolutely riveting and they really gave you a sense of of the risks that were taken the courage that was needed\nAnd just the and this particular nature of of of this thing and this this this and that daring of America at that time and\nUm but anyway I mean that's that's that's who we are that's who we have to be we can't be these people who you know say well we don't know how to go to the moon I'm you know I mean that'd be like them in the sixties saying we don't know how to fly airplanes so\nLet's go to David the Salem mass say David go ahead sir\nI didn't mean to you both and thanks for taking my call George sure thing\nUm okay so it's interesting to me how you know what you're talking about a few minutes ago it was really played into my question we you know we've talked about you know how life could be sustained and things on Mars and already might sustain life what do we have any plans are there any theories on\nPossibly can relate in an atmosphere where stimulating are life sustaining environment um I mean drilling holes that were released trapped gases are eating the atmosphere with anything we have or is there any series her plans for that\nWhat we discuss that earlier in the show but yes terra forming Mars the idea would be if you warm the planet with greenhouse gases she could form a lot of the costs a lot of atmosphere to help us out of the soil\nI've got a book called the case for Mars which um you can get on Amazon and it talks about how we can send people to Mars how we can settle Mars and how we can terra forming Mars that is transform it in the way that you are a suggesting because Mars was once a warming planet which means by the way it had a thick atmosphere [noise] and um\nIt could be made so again\nAnd you believe we must go to Mars torture\n[noise] well [laughter] I must I um I I Believe we should uh I Believe that\nIt's going to be much better future if we do I believe that if we do we don't just get another planet we proved to ourselves that we don't need to be fighting over this one because there's an infinite number of world out there for us if we work together\nThey point Arnie in Roseville, California go ahead Arnie\nYeah Hi I'm ... I'm ... and ah I just have a question I thought it'd be leaning towards privatization\nBut are you in Anchorage privatization I'm calling ... of the Mars or the planet I mean are you going to just be a free for all whoever land grabs whatever they can ah are you are you with the government should be some more involved in\nThe dating how a possession of real poverty as it was would be a Mars if we ever got a point where travel was easy\nRight go ahead Robert minute left so\nOkay well I'd like to see a lot of new governments on Mars I'd like to see people go to Mars and set up city states on Mars with lots of different forms of corporate and so we could see which kind of government works the best because that's how we make progress\nOn earth you know America was a noble experiment we prove the value of democracy and human rights and\nPeople all over the world came here because this was better and other countries around the world eventually copied us because it was better well if if it if you have people go to Mars and they're not forced to be under the U.S government to the Russian government or the Chinese um they formed their own governments\nThey'll go there with their own ideas of how government should be in some will be good ideas and some would be bad ideas and the ones with\nBad ideas that are not workable those counties will fail but the ones with good ideas immigrants will flock there those places will grow and they'll become an example to the rest of humanity\nThank you again my front always great talking to you Robert ... Mars Society dot org up next\nThe ghost study [noise] get ready\nDon't forget to watch our TV beyond belief with George Norris just log onto beyond belief dot com [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nWelcome back to coast to coast George know where he went through and are just Brandon ... with us Brandon is a clinical therapist author purist psychologist residing in the northeastern section of Ohio\nHe has a graduate degree in political constantly from the University of Toledo\nPsychological research methods from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland is research at the University of Pittsburgh centered on\nEMS environmental sensitivity in ghost Leon donors Brandon has been fascinated by the paranormal for years and here he is with his work called the ghost studies Brandon I'm looking forward to this welcome to the show\nIt's great to be here George I'm excited to\nMy guy shot in a clinical therapist get involved in those studies\n[laughter] um well actually I was interested in a ghost ... psychology before I was actually a clinical therapist ah yeah so it it actually\nI actually got a day job and then I study the Paris psychology and goes part of thing\nWell that something then you went to the University of Toledo which is not too far from my hometown of Detroit\nOh okay yeah yeah I spent a lot of time at the casino in Detroit but we won't get into that [laughter] how'd you do by the way not very well [laughter]\nThat's good what did you see the they didn't have casinos there when I left I left in Seventy eight when the apple is free urine or at that time it was just a booming city but what we do have is the Detroit Lions and that's the great thing there\nYeah yeah good good teams up their sports wise\nShe'll tell us a little bit about your work and then we're going to digest ourselves into the Gulf studies book but to give us an overview of what you've been doing Brandon\n[noise] well um\nYou know I uh I have a degree in Paris psychology or when I was at University of Edinburgh I studied uh I'm basically at the environmental sensitivity and go counter um and then when I got back here to the states I got back into the critical part a thing\nAnd then that's what kinda got me going and and I'm interested in and writing a book and that's when I came out with a ghost studies\nAnd you know I'm sure the listeners to your show no it's um no mystery that science is sort of dropped the ball when it comes to explaining goes my encounters\nA oftentimes mainstream macadamia will explain these things away as aloof nation interpretations are overactive imaginations which you know it's not really true in my eyes\nSo individuals who have these terrifying encounters kind of struggled to find the answers and they're kind of left with reality television shows to provide insight into these life altering experience is\nSo you know there's millions of people out there including myself who are looking for things are books with more than just ghost stories\nTales of locations are outdated views um and that's when I wrote the book and I just thought you know I combine real life goes counters what the satisfaction of some new perspective and insights in the cause of these throwing encounters\nUm it the book comes up with concise and competing theories and what's great about it is it's based on data rather than faith or belief or even experience and you know and you know these goats I been taking our interests for millions of years\nAnd if and I think we're at the point where there is becoming new perspective on these things and that's what the book really goes over you know there are several firsthand accounts of ghostly encounters\nUm you know I spent years just getting first hand account of going to anyone he would talk to me about goes yeah an oval conventions everywhere and then I started noticing similarities and that's what I came up with some of these maybe theories are and that's where I came out with a book so you know I really combined a little bit of my\nI took elements from psychological research clinical interviews I witnessed the cow and I sort of piece them together and come up with this uh these new theories of five and I also review the right the the greatest or the latest research in a ghost encounters above well\nThen you bring a dose of real science to the picture your brand and then I think that's important\nYeah yeah and I think so too I mean the great thing is it's out there you just got to look a little bit harder\nUm the journal articles a pair of psychological journal articles and even some great you know I'm narrow psychology a fitness a physics they're starting to kind of go into that realm of consciousness and I'm\nEntanglement and non locality\nOut or electricity affects us and I'm a ... and what it does outside the body so there's a lot of that research out there it's just\nYou know I think a lot of people maybe don't know how to find it or when they do find in a hurry to research article it kind of like oh this is boring and I don't know what's going on but I'm a lot of great research is out there are just a matter of finding it\nWould have you concluded today branded about what the ... experience might be for someone real big into their imagination what do you think's happening\nI actually think a majority of that goes they encountered that that are out there I Believe are there are some paranormal phenomenon happening\nI'm you know I think that when it comes to counter it's such a complex process and there's so many variables going on\nUm you know there's environmental stuff there's um a internal ... electrical stuff going on um but you know for the most part these these experiences are genuine\nAnd um you know obviously there's some fraud and there's some misinterpreting stimuli or whatever but I think the majority of these experiences are actually like I said genuine experiences\nAnd what do you think causes them read\nWhat did they help\nThink there is I'm In my in my view I take the more by ... view on goes\nSo that I'm In size basic wave 'em all up at the extra sensory perceptions those types of things\nI I really think that a lot of goes lane counters that happen out there um the base of it has to do with um ... the or I'm sort of 'em\nAre coming and being real sensitive to the environment and picking up something that's in the environment and other people on my main theories in the book over um what I call a uh Calif addict distress signals and sort of how they\nA role and goes encounters [noise] ah so I really think that um people's ... the ah is a real or it was a real important part of it goes way encounter\nHow important than the person as opposed to the vet or something like this\n[noise] um I I think that it's um it's\nKind of a fifty fifty thing and I know that's kind of a weird answer to say there but uh I think there's so many people out there I think there's a lot of people out there there are more prone to go slowly encounters\nBut I also think that the event is sort of a catalyst to everything that's happening so when I say that you know I I think\nIf we look at a lot of the ghosts link counters that are out there the catalyst is usually a crisis of some kind right I'm\nA death or life threatening\nEvents or some sort of trauma or something like that is the catalyst to these ghostly encounters or so the event is an important part of it it's what happens after that event um and I think when you have the events when you have this trauma I think it it it sort of\nThere's a lot of things that happen after that and one of those things is um\nYou know emotional distress so you have an event you have an emotional distress from a life threatening or going to have all these emotions that are associated with it\nAnd then that leads to sort of these bio energetic shift that happen inside us I mean we're all electricity and when that happens I think that it actually triggers sort of our innate ability to send a distress signal to somebody else\nAnd and a great classic example of this is like the crisis aberration All right so we probably heard of these this is when I'm sitting in my room on a random Tuesday night and I look to the left and there's a an aberration of\nMy aunt and she says you know um I Love you goodbye and then I get a call the next day saying you\nKnow my aunt passed away right on time that I had that\nAnd I and I and I think that that you can sort of see\nThere was a trauma life threatening event with that my aunt she was dying I somehow she sent 'em a Taliban ethic distressing they'll thing to me and I picked up on it and they showed up as an aberration of some kind\nOf as you say some people do get these experiences why not\nWell I think it actually comes down to something I'm pretty mundane [laughter] I there's a lot of research out there in something called environmental sensitivity All right and um what environmental\nSensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and um you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's where the environmental sensitivity is\nI'm so those who are are environmentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans man you we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways\nAnd this configuration is that you know what I'm saying you have to figure out the right combination of things that happen for um the TV to show up in a clear picture and the same with ghost encounters you have to figure out the right sort of ingredients\nAre variable that line up the habit goes way counter location is one person has to 'em and then there's there's probably other ones that I don't you know we haven't really identified at this point but the person not only their sensitivity but their internal ... electric\nOr consciousness about all this stuff really plays into it and it's really fascinating to me it\nReally is I remember when my dad brought home a better TV him to\nDo was the kind that didn't just move with the rabbit ears but it had like a little uh knob on it that you clicked in a broad into signals better that way too and I taught for use this technology amazing time should change Brenda\n[laughter] I remember that [laughter]\nDo you do or have you come across demonic spirits in your work\nUh no I haven't and I get that question over a lot though the the theme of question seems to be getting more and more prevalent in the last five years or so\nI think you know when you have a ghostly counter or you have some sort of phenomenon happened to you it's amazing it's great uh and then you want to start maybe putting labels on it you know this experience what the\nGood with a bad with a positive with that this was at that and I think when you start putting negative to it then you start feeling like it's demonic ... demonic team\nIs more of a religious perspective than it is sort of um you know like a scientific perspective\nSo usually whoever classified this is a demon or um you know regular goes\nI think there's more of a religious pills to it\nUm that's where I usually when I meet David knowledge is they're they're very religious as well um\nI think there's a little little that labeling going on to me it's an experience um and some people perceive it as good or bad I might perceive one experience being really positive you might have the same experience can be terrified and believe with negative and then kind of you go towards the more demonic part of thing\nSo I I really just enjoyed not enjoy but I have the experience I research experience and I don't try to put the female label on anything\nWell with Brenda ...

happening in that location and maybe the child and the mom saw this woman dressed than futuristic ... futuristic clothing and got terrified and ran away so it's almost like a glimpse into something else\nAnd a lot of times these are perceived as ghostly encounters\nDo you ever when you're doing these ah these studies have you ever encountered something where you'd even scared to death\nI'm personally no I haven't been scared that budget I had an experience I'm\nA I live in sort of the country a rural area of Ohio and um [noise] oh one morning a\nYou know my wife was out of town and I'm One morning I had I kept getting these overwhelming feeling like something's wrong like fear like adrenaline and that was sort of drawn to the outside\nUh we have a four acres and upon and I said why is that why do I feel this way and my dog was feeling the same way to normal she's pretty calm in the morning but she was like scratch and they get outside so I'm like yeah well you know my scientific brains going just take a shower and go to work and don't worry about it you know\nAnd I'm like you know what I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to follow through with this\nSo I open the door the dog and me went outside in the backyard and she's sniffing around and I'm like I still got this feeling and then I looked over at the pond and I saw something like in the pond floating\nAnd I started walking and then I started running and it was a neighborhood cat had gotten into the pond and somehow um you know drowned in there by\nYou know I dove into the ... you know all that stuff [laughter] but I think to myself this is it's not so much scary looking back on and it's a little scary but\nSomething drew me out there you know I I go to work every day you know it's the same thing and I never got that feeling or that desire to go outside\nBut something happened and I kept asking myself what what happened what made that day different\nAnd was there some sort of like distress signal sense to me with the cat and distress and they've kind of linked with me and the dog and then I you know so that's it's not scary in a sense but looking back on it it's kinda like this so many cool things happen there it's really an amazing experience\nHow many people are normal experiences occur Brendan because the person who died comes back never had someone tune as business had they had to tell somebody wanted to get something done\nI you know I don't know percentage on that um I I Would say that you know a lot of the a lot of the cases out there of ghostly encounters have to do with easing are coping with a psychological injury like the staff of a father or something\nRight you know I'm\n... you know you're sort of struggling with the death ah there's all these emotions happening um so
