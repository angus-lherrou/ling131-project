of cases like that where um you know something pops up and people who like want to know was that\nAnd then he's never seen again but um this particular case\nIs an interesting one um it'll cutting I pull Nineteen sixty four in ... Washington and I'm actually quite close to my ... on the witness in mind I'm young man named Brian Khan failed um he saw these strange creatures while he was driving along the road and it was sort

the the the Harry body and the wings kind of people said oh it's not you know it's not sasquatch because he's got wings but he kind of looks a bit like\n... ... and I'm I'm for a while in Nineteen Ninety four and it was actually quite big using that area and then like a lot of other these you know there's other cases he just sort of became part of the local legend them you know the areas folklore and so\nYou've got a lot of men in black stories women in black story you and I've talked about that before a that might be a ... year then the men in black and and then some of those cases you know they seem otherworldly just out of place\nUh you you know we we've been accustomed because of the movies or do you think that maybe there are some secret government agents but have you ever had any indications that maybe some of them are\nSort of very human government type operatives who are operating under the umbrella of something like a men in black trying to emulate the the real mistreating and figuring they can get away with it that no one will believe the witnesses who see them\nWell I've got to be honest with you in Georgia I'm doing five books now I'm On this phenomena foreign demanding black and one of the women in black\nAnd I have to say that the vast majority of all the reports I get don't send anything like you know they stepped out of the Pentagon the CIA all the FBI and I say I'm a you know nothing like the the ...\nFrom ... in the movies they typically are described as looking\n... you know go on and skaters why why why\nI'm I'm able to talk about I actually didn't have the ability to control the personal hypnotized them\nEven talk about when they're in close proximity to them by full and shake afterwards almost like a like a soup and actually infection or something along those lines\nAnd um there are cases when men in black and the women and black of turned up in homes right after paper in using wager boats which puts another angle to it\nUm but there's no doubt in my mind again um you know they should have real phenomena but it's not like it's portrayed in the movies it's more sort of like a\nYou know like a gothic horror story mixed in with the X files you know you put those two issues together that's that's how I Would sort of describe fish but many black mistreat each Bobby on you know just guys in black suits walk\nAnd I guess I'm you know\nI'm asking it into contact sort of like with cattle mutilation is I think you know there's there's a lot of evidence that the these animal relations are carried out by something other than just um um humans and helicopters are that some of them are truly inexplicable and then you have a whole other wave of them that\nSurely seemed like they are humans that are carrying out the same kind of thing for whatever reasons um this is sort of leading us to where we're going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction files but we're in human agencies and that doesn't mean government agencies but humans\nOr pretend to be something paranormal get away with something that's really weird and they they do it in a way that so that there isn't a lot of serious scrutiny by people like you are people like me or or other investigators\nWell yeah I mean I think you know when you talk about the Academy of tuitions you know you've got a really weird one actually a couple of them some which are apps to explain\nThere is a parallel with demanding black where there's no doubt but in some cases I think the government agencies are responsible for the paper I think it's a very small catch a great\nShe's the January unexplained ones and the way it was\nWhat I think it happened on a few occasions and there is some evidence to support this\nIs the over the years agencies may actually unemployed that elections are demanding black I was amazed to cover their tracks in other words\nThey maybe have within government you know many black to radio but I don't know what they are but it doesn't prevent them from using the legend than most have\nTo inquire April who who may not want to have him talking about cases so the government may actually not know who the men in black really are and I don't like to fully\nBut that sort of lead us into where we're heading in the next hour we're going to talk about top secret alien abduction files where the

George found hassle\nTrue and bathroom ...\nAll of them had FBI falls out putting on the one of the mind raise in Spain was because they claimed when I'm ... by the FBI that yes they ... they are and sees Williams but they told the FBI that they they and had\nA government or government is very different two hours and bordering on communism\nAnd I'm so that really opened the eyes\nOf the FBI to the extent that for example George fans hassles FBI file um he's extremely expensive it's like about an inch thick um Georgia ... is about a hundred and fifty pages [noise] um ... she was about ... and so on\nSo you know we have a precedent for the abduction phenomenon with the contact tape April now\nIn the fifties excuse me in the early sixties things really kicked off I'm with the Iranian abduction phenomenon in September sixty one\nI'm with the ... case which is I guess is the defining moments you follow gee when\nIt wasn't the first abduction case on record but he was certainly the one that really opened people's eyes when\nJohn full of wrote his book on the case they interrupted journey\nNow in the story of basketball and hail that coming back from a a vacation in Canada they say the strange lights in the sky and then things kind of get weighed a they don't fail rights they you know everything seems a bit surreal and strange\nAnd I get back home and then they start having these weighed dreams that night as being taken on board\nThe strange craft would they be strange creatures and being subjected to a stranger and intrusive\nExperiments now what's particularly in training is that I found a file in the British national archive on it revolved around among Ronald wild man who was a delivering a vehicle in the south of England and it was like the early hours of the moaning about to I Am\nAn essay was driving the vehicle to the location\nThey the lights on the call when I was on the cars started in time to a halt\nAnd they should they should become known as they the vaguely interference phenomenon with a new holiday\nWhat's intriguing is that they\nThey uh British police force actually handed over the investigation because they report to the to the police found it over to a group within the British royal Airforce cause pulled a a promise to security services are sort of like the\nThe James Bond they feel like of the of the royal Airforce they sort of get involved and espionage and counter intelligence things like that what's interesting is that in the file it talks about how the they the they profit from the security services aimed severe Rona wild man by the same time to\nWith a with a ... to a halt and the UFOs in front of him\nAnd the most telling an intriguing aspect is that he told the police so they said the direct quotes that he was modeled by the time\nWhich is an interesting thing because that's sort of sounds just like you know the whole missing time on goal of abduction low in today's world but Ronald while in the fall actually refers to he was saying that yes he sold his UFO calmed down lights went out of his vehicle\nAnd then he kind of fell to ... strange checked his watch\nAnd there was something about states it's actually you know portrayed completely and the file but he says he was much older by the time which I think you know you put all those aspects together that has the potential for being a significant abduction case\nI think about the contact D's and I remember reading about them when I first got into this subject and thinking sort of with bemused meant well there were there were a interesting colorful harmless sort of weirdos um but the more you read it\nAbout um the more interesting they become a course people like a dam ski\nThen you realize that these guys showing these crazy stories some some of them would say you know they they met these women and went to Venus and things like that and you you you you have a hard time taking the literally but when you realized that the government is really does followed them around and takes it seriously for whatever reason\nI ... it makes me think of like the Roberts and men or that the CIA scientist studied UFO topic and they include\nThe UFOs themselves are not a threat to national security but reporting UFOs might be because maybe the Russians could somehow manipulate a public opinion is that a justification for going around people like a dam ski bathroom those folks\nOh yeah because I mean George ... ah first book flying saucers a blended published in the early fifties\nThat that sold in huge Vegas gigantic

research on the top of several books written on the subject there's no soda one hundred percent consensus on on what actually happened which he remains you know a mainstream but there are a lot of\nWeight aspects to this story which I guess I'm fortunate enough that will never really know the answer I think it can remain a mystery unfortunately\nNick I don't know how when you sleep but you

and science spirituality and on church religion new religious movements electronic media in popular culture and is currently a professor of religion at Vassar College his new book other world\nSpirituality and the search for it and visible dimensions is a spectacular and mind bending Christopher welcome to the program\nMorning George thanks for having me on the show\nThanks for staying up so late or ... I was wondering the first thing I was wondering when I finished this book was how do you get away with this you are a seemingly respectable guy teaching at a grade school and I wonder if you're if you're going to catch Greece for doing it\n[laughter] it gives me um [noise] no it's um yeah how do I get away get away with it it's um you know a lot of people and cultural studies or people who are interested in studying religion or\nYou know we do we do get a pass to study really cool fantastic things right um people's um unusual experiences and unusual states have consciousness religious experiences\nPeak experiences what whatever you want to call them so\nYeah it is kind of a privileged to be to be a professor and and get a chance to just kind of follow my interests and that's really what how this book came along um\nIt came out of an earlier book I was working on that looked at sort of the science of religious experience and spirituality um but as you know this one movement in New directions by thinking about science and physics and cosmology and how it's sort of fantastic scientific ideas have led to\nUm have led to at least a new vocabulary that people are using now to talk about your death experiences and and the Syrian says and and even after life experiences and so on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning uh and of course as a as somebody who studies religious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world in popular culture\nYou mentioned in the beginning how a believer in church or a formal religion organized religion is sort of ... around the western world but interest in spiritual and spirituality topics or has has remains strong or even increased\nThat that's a that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your line of work to figure out why that's happening\nYeah I think it is I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you say that was really how I began the book with this puzzle you know the problem which is\nYou know people still in America seem to have a lot of I guess we'll be called spiritual beliefs they ... him pretty high numbers in America\nUm believe in and goes for believing spirits or believe in God I'm and yet on the other hand as you say a participation in traditional religious congregations are affiliation in traditional really with traditional religious congregations those things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about this how can we talk about those you know how how is it the case that people seem to have a very real sense of belief and other world um and spirituality and the abdomen a really in the absence of\nParticipation and traditional congregation so that's what I tried to think about and trying to think well where where people getting that these ideas you know where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm real you know I'm kind of like a science nerd and in a sense and interested in pop science pop science book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and I think uh you know concepts like\nDark matter or dark energy or even thinking about infinity a or thinking about the the multi so thinking about higher dimension I think all of these fantastic scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves embrace with ... with a sense of a mystery in and wonder\nI think about those concepts are sort of uh the the bed for for a new spiritual infections and I and that's and that's what I Try to look out of the book\nWell you know we we I don't imagine you listen to the program all that often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists would die hard time to normally George it's\nToo late [laughter] yeah I was pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally have a tough time getting their head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other realities um you know time slips things of that sort\nOf that you you'd sort of reached out to look for a way to maybe\nMake a bridge between science and those kinds of subjects with this understanding of\nParallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talk about that those kind of concepts on the program all the time and as if it's a given day or a given but we don't really I don't think many of us know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and\nUm it it it hurts even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of why those kinds of concepts are so commonly held so um that one that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these crazy things but also to science right\nYeah I think so yeah I think so I mean one thing I Try to do in the book is um I Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about other dimensions and the and the first couple of chapters the book I I you know I asked the question of well what what is an extra dimension\nUm and I talk a bit about uh I talk a bit about that and maybe I can just say worried about that for them for the listeners tonight yes yeah I'm going to\nAnother to ... the idea of another dimension is not that I'm not that ... after all I mean we have we know we have we have three directions or dimension three spatial dimensions that we live in and that's linked with and height\nAnd those are are are three directions or or dimensions there's there's an additional dimension that we sometimes talk about is the fourth dimension\nI'm sin Feinstein in that time so we live in a a four dimensional space time a world and I find I spoke about this but\nSome of the people I talk about in my book talks about an additional spatial dimensions ah a direction and space or a dimension in space but different from the other three so you know we could think of like we could we could draw a line on a piece of paper or a line of one dimensional objects that has length\nIf you venture off last where on that same piece of paper and has two directions or dimensions that has links and with\nAnd then you could you could draw cube I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube in your hand and that would be a three dimensional object has three spatial dimensions are linked with and height and then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction um or a fourth dimension\nAnd this would be you know this would be an object that has links with height and something else and the the phone thing else as the tricky part something else is the\nIs the direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimension to reality it's it's evidently not something that we can we can see 'em or perceive [laughter]\nUm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and actually others some philosophers I'm In the\nGoing back to the Eighteenth century but really the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility raised seems like kind of a strange thing to think about what ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that it works um they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions\nA fourth visual dimension that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look that are on the equations cleaner they seem simpler and more elegant\nChange you know\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it's your cancer with no cutting no bleeding Lederman has decreases experience was primary and minister large or small

modern perception of other worlds and how it developed a through by personalizing it you tell the story of people who've struggled with getting their own heads around the world Charles hitting as one of those who\nI I guess a brilliant mathematician who went into a deep depression when his scientific use came into conflict with his religious and spiritual views tell his story\n[noise] yeah yeah yeah and his wife says it's quite a story um but you're right they're they're ... and there's many others in the book sort of struggle with the [noise]\nUm you know sort of like out of it being raised religious and find the time and feeling that they can no longer an or maybe not sure that they can any longer embrace the religion of their childhood and still feeling spiritual for sure and and having a spiritual and tuition and [noise] his mayhem\nAnd wanting to find wanting to seek out other ways of of being religious and many of them turned to the you know fantastic scientific concepts like higher to mention it has a new as a new more scientific way of thinking about\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual low level or worlds to reality hit an incumbent interesting story as you say he he grows up egos Oxford he\nFalls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he [noise]\nHe makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make [laughter] All right and the situation is he he ... map addict and geometry as a kind of a\nOf the people I Can't turn and people who are talking about the possibility that there's higher dimensions and he's reading Einstein all he's reading about Einstein he's reading for popular science and he he ended up developing a theory that the dream in itself can somehow lift itself\nUp off of our normal world um and peek into\nOther parts I'm In the timeline or other areas on the timeline so the dreaming self dreaming consciousness has a kind of a freedom\nThat uh that our our regular everyday consciousness doesn't have any and he uses a lot of scientific ideas that we can talk about if you want to how he does it but he has a has a set of scientific ideas that he that he uses to think about how this might be possible how could the dreaming self be able to have these powers and be able to lift itself off of our timeline and see\nSee I'm into the future and he writes these ideas up in a book called an experiment with time\nThe book is from Nineteen twenty seven it becomes a kind of a best seller and a lot of people\nA lot of people in Europe and America read the book and get interested in thinking about their dreams as somehow predicting the future and you know I sometimes give talks about this in different places and I always have audience members come up to me I always have people emailing me saying oh I'd had dreams like that [noise]\nUm so you know it seems to be a fairly common experience actually that people in dreams seem to get glimpses of things that then happened or didn't happen in real life\nAnd then you have experiences where people are not sleeping there not dreaming and they happened in a while they're awake at time slips or day job where they seem to be in some other reality and then they come back on this one of the audio ... what's the how do you how does that fit into the framework that you explore in this book\nYeah yeah exactly I talk about some of the experiences as well so in that chapter sex um and then a little bit in the chapter on C. S. Lewis I'm as well and then I have a chapter on Madeleine L'Engle right who's a famous writer of wrinkle in time just recently a movie made a fact\nOf that book but she talks about time slip some and and time travel um and so on and some of her books [noise]\nSo yeah how do they make sense of that um\nWhat time is not linear right my like my presence could be somebody else's future\nYeah well for sure I mean I think one thing that one thing that done picks up on his as you say that Einstein has a new way of talking about what time is which is really\nCounter intuitive and weird right I mean before Einstein people thought about time as just linear as something that just flowed out of uniform rate right we we had a sense of prime flowing we have this kind of intuitive sense at time flows forward\nUm in fact though you know I find had a number of counter intuitive things to say but one of them was that\nOf the ways that we experience time is probably just an illusion and the product of the limitations of her own consciousness that Einstein's equations for for the universe really lay out something that looks a little bit different but they really lay out a universe that\nCould be called a block universe universe that already exist\nSo um you know all locations in the universe and all times and the universe\nI'm already exist and they're all laid out in this big block we are we are kind of a passing through [laughter] passing through that that block prior we occupy little portion of that block but every moment in our past and in our in our president and in our future and in the earth's future and in our son's future [noise]\nAnd and all of our defending future's all those moments are already laid out in the block at least according to the\nThe laws of physics [noise] um and and this is actually discussions with got defending wants to look at it it's disgusting my book but you can also look at Brian Greene's books he's a professor of physics at Columbia He wrote a new book called the fabric of the cosmos where he talks about this kind of block universe so I'm\nDone and I was only laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and yeah that sort of questions that you as a professor religious studies back all the time\nYeah you're right you're right it pays it lays out these big philosophical issues right like um fate and destiny and human free will and how free or are we to make choices on and so on [noise]\nUm so and we can definitely talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did um and some of the other people in my book did as they thought through these problems was they said you know I I think what ... what's happening is that\nYou know the fact that these future moments are already laid out somehow in the block universe makes it more plausible or makes it more possible that you know maybe the dreaming self could somehow lift itself up above our\nThree dimensional world or I should say are four dimensional world right because we have three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension\nThe dream itself you said and lift up out of that block universe and peek into future moments and done believed that I'm using a bit of Einstein here and a bit of you know him thin and higher space philosophers there I'm that's what he believed was happening some other dreaming consciousness had an additional\nA degree of freedom an additional direction that it could move in\n'em and and if we could talk about that as a as additional spatial dimension or we could talk about that is now maybe consciousness somehow can move with an additional degree of freedom but that's what he thought and have you thought everybody\nEverybody's sleeping self had this degree of freedom and he he also believe that every one if they haven't kept a journal by their bed or their dreams when when they fall he had a couple of recommendations for how to how to do a dream journal\nHe believes that if everyone did they would be able to see that all of the all of our dreams contain bits and pieces of future events and past events I'm sort of mixed up together [noise]\nWell I get on the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there people there and can they interact with us or is it us that's over there we're going to get into that ah those topics as well as near death experiences or to talk about to say on a showman remote viewers\nHow some of those ideas that we are discussed on this program before might fit into our discussion of other world so the book spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions by Christopher white or we're going to take a break and be back in a moment David Gray sail away like listen to the break [noise]\nNo you can get show up dates with other ... fans would you joined the ... Facebook page just go to Facebook to accomplish goes to go see him including the like button [noise]\nNa\n\nMe\nHe\n\n\nMan\nAny\nNew York new sausages you read is number one seven in ...

story has a happy ending mess girl [noise]\n\n\nA crisp white so tell me this in the example of flat land where there's a some higher dimension being reaches down and grabbed somebody from to de world pulled them up\nUm could someone from sixty or Seventy or Seventy reached out and grab us and pull it up so we can understand the true nature of reality what do you think\nOh sure I mean I think that you know it depends on how you think about those dimensions and what's in them but I mean you certainly have had\nYou know religious and spiritual people over the last hundred years say things just like that right I mean in fact you've had\nPeople um even even cs Lewis talk about you know God in Christ as higher dimensional um and as beans that calmed down and insert themselves into our lower dimensional world just like the sphere did that and and the un Abbott's book a flat land so\nYes people have definitely thought about um\nWhat we say thought about visitors from from higher realms or ... or spiritual beings are angels or whatever I'm as higher dimensional um and as I was kind of the higher dimensional objects that than ... entire world\nThat sounds perilously close to saying that science and religion could coexist that uh you\nKnow that the paranormal bleeps good coexist with a scientific ... is scientifically acceptable version of reality\nYeah yeah I think so I mean in my book I Try to put you know a number of different people\nIn the story so I have you know people who have let's say these kinds of moments of inspiration or who experience like a near death experience um and then I have them talking about their experience and then I also have scientists in the book as well and some skeptics so I have different voices in the book um\nYou know talking about what the meaning of these events\nAre ... and you know there's not just one story in the book there's a lot of different voices they're trying to interpret\nWhat's happening but you definitely have you know the the through line in the book is is are these people who have these kinds of uncanny experiences are remarkable experiences moments of insider and tuition or near death experiences are out of body experiences um and so on\nAnd and that they are ... than using scientific concept to to understand what what could be happening and I think that you know figures in my book like like the all of us today I mean I think that\nWe all want to use science you know I think we I think science is for the authoritative\nI'm set of this courses that we used to talk about talk about reality so I think I think that's what they're doing I think you know just like jaded up you've done right who have these dreams that seem to predict the future where did he go you know he didn't\nHe didn't actually go to the Bible at that point to figure it out he went to Einstein and he went to he went to sort of popular science book um and I think that you know that's one point I Try to make in the book that I think a lot of us are sort of inspired by a man interested and fantastic scientific concept um\nUh well I mean humans humans have been trying to reach a other higher dimensions rather realities for a long time prayer would be an example are reaching out to some invisible world there I'm\nAbsolutely yeah I Know a remote viewing\nYeah yeah yeah there's there's all kinds of things that would fit into that you're right and people have been trying to to reach the transcendent uh ever since there have been humans on earth right I'm reaching for something else reaching beyond our own subjectivity um and we talked about dreams earlier I think a through dreams and\nYou know in the sixties and at other times you know\nAmericans use psychedelic drugs to open up a what they believe it was like a doorway of consciousness into another realm and in other cultures you might use other plants or substances or who's going to gyms to to reach a transcendent but prayer meditation absolutely they're all different\nAll different different methods\nAre so I'm Wondering if the example of remote viewing where people project your consciousness over space and time seemingly independent of space and time to access information that they shouldn't be able to get that that doesn't that make sense because of the idea of other worlds higher dimensions\nWell um let's see I think I think people have certainly talked about remote viewing and other a parent I came on\n... ... has higher dimensional because uh you know maybe we can go back to Abbott's book flat land for a minute because you know flat line what happens is\nYou know you can imagine a two dimensional world of characters of very flat right sliding around the surface of your desk they don't they know a length and wet but they don't know that third direction or dimension which is\nWhich is um up or down so when you're if you're a figure in and flat land let's say you're just a flat square and you're sliding around on the surface of your flat world and let's say you look out um you know you look around and and what do you see well\nIf you're a flat where sliding around on a flat world you you actually\nDon't see her whole world you just see a line right let's say a friend comes toward you and he's a triangle on he's fighting towards your what do you see what you just see a line um every everyone and flat land can just see a one dimensional line but what happens when the flat square gets pulled off of the two dimensional world\nUp into a higher space a three dimensional space in the story is suddenly he can see the full dimension analogy of his flat world so he looks\nHe looks and he sees flat land before him all laid out and he can suddenly a he suddenly has powers of vision that he never had right he can look down at flat line he can see for the first time not just lines but he can see\nA People's homes he can see into their homes right because he's looking down on the whole flat world so you can see\nHe can see all of his friends whether they're triangles or squares or lines he can see all of their dimensions he can see even inside right say let's say he has a friend who's a triangle 'em all he saw before was their line coming towards them but now he can see the whole triangle he can even see inside the try like in the inside homes\nSo I raise this as an example because\nSome people have used to say a ha you know um well if we were raised somehow in consciousness up into a higher spatial dimensions maybe we could look back on our three dimensional world and have amazing power the vision so um\nYou know maybe we are just like the square right when raised to hire dimension we look back on our world and what we see\nWe would see all sides of everything at once you could look down on your home for instance and see all the rooms laid out you know you can see the insides of everyone's bodies you could see the outside that are on the body you can see the top of the house and the bottom of the house um so you would have a kind of a higher dimensional vision\nUm and so people do indeed use these ideas to talk about things like remote viewing right um or or they use these ideas actually to talk about near death experiences because sometimes people have near death experiences they talk about having this kind of um having this kind of special vision where they can see things I never saw before [noise]\nSo so yeah and so maybe remote viewing is a a you know is higher dimensional phenomena I I don't know you know I'm certainly\nPeople have talked about it I'm that way and I in my
