O. R. [noise]\nI get more and everybody just got some good news for us yeah breaking news yeah let's get to this uh this is a coming\nTo us from a ... a channel for the police department investigating another suspicious package this at the intersection of a postal facility on west fifty second street between eighth and ninth avenue that area has now been shut down of course meant that suspicious package at the time Warner center last\nNight it turned out to be just some Christmas toys with Christmas rap not quite sure about the significance of this but uh it's under investigation and adding to this where a working to put this one together too that there may be an eleventh package now that\nWas a in the mail to senator Cory Booker of New Jersey bill well we're looking at that one of the latest details coming up at night\nLike Governor Cuomo has really got to feel left\nOut [laughter] you know a buddy of mine who got America ... [laughter] All right\nHey let's check in now with W. O. R. movie minute man Joe new Meyer good morning to you Joe alright so uh we got a we've got like a hunt for Red October movie here another a submarine thriller hunt your emailer\nAdult stations battle station that's actually a really fun movie all I'd like submarine movies I actually you know when I was a kid I grew up watching you know just the bottom of the the hunt for Red October is to me one of the great action movies of the of the eighties early nineties this one's really fought now do for those of us who didn't go to the you know the\nNaval Academy in Annapolis a hunter killer it's a kind of attack submarine that's designed to specifically attack and think oh their submarines\nAnd there's a a U.S submarine that goes down under rushing waters and drug butler play the the salty old dog who had it has to go aboard a hunter killer and figure out what happened and it turns out that there's there's a a I'm not getting anything away with the Russian President and his team I had been taken captive\nIn their in their homeland by a rogue agent age and another you know a a bad Russian essentially\nDid they ask him if he is very narrow election\nDid that you're sitting at the computer him in a four hundred pound guy we're sitting in a wreck\nAnd so you know it almost reminds me of in some ways of like an early eighties bond film you know uh like octopus they've got some really great action sequences I'm getting at three stars a lot of fun and I think that you know some Rene movies themselves I think are kind of cool because there's just like the the claustrophobic atmosphere and the you know the guys at the controls and things like well\nThe best the best one of all time was ... to remember that when John boots yeah the government felt exactly automatically talking about the claustrophobia and that one that's\nCrazy too into it and then it was like you five seven water them Crimson Tide actually with Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington that's a great what this what what this suffers from a little bit is it's got\nIt's got a little bit of a bargain basement cast Gary Oldman is obviously great and just won an Oscar in ... and there was the secretary of defense but you know draw butler is the is the you know the main submarine captain and then there was living in a cart lenient comment like there's sort of it they could have spent a little bit more money out of cash but what they didn't spend on the cat\nThey spent on the effects of it looks really cool and then there's like a Navy SEAL team that kind of goes in and kind of has to attack from from on the land\nUnless like wait a second badly said this sounds really cool I suppose it is\nGoing to be made and devices [noise]\nYou're going [noise]\nSounds interesting I mean what the hell's going on there\nRight [laughter] I think a lot of a lot of action going out a lot of shooting going on a good I think\nYou know for for a time like this when you sort of need a little bit of escape this movie really it's it's a surprise it really does it really well it's not you know it's not anything it's not like a a you know I've really intellectually taxing movie will treat you want to go for some fun accident and some cool submarine stuff hunter killer I mean who would've guessed it really kind of kind of you know it's a nice fun weekend at the movies I think\nJoe is the submarine yellow\nThey're blooming and have a good try and get them back to pepper land that's where I so not a yellow so by\nThe way I think that may be the last summer remove it really is is there a good deal and in this movie\nGet all those are the Russian villain the Russian turn coat in there who's got a you know a great sort of ... presence is terrific so he sort of the big villain in there but there's also like you know it back at the Pentagon you know they've got barking you know did Gary Oldman is barking orders and things like that the only way like there's a lot of villains going all around the real villain I think in some ways this or just the the\nCode of the Russian turned on the Russia or anything else going on this weekend or is this the big release\nThis is the big release ... there's a there's a remake of a horror film culture spirit that that was sort of an art film a kind of horror film that's really law gets okay it's not graves with Tilda Swinton and Dakota Johnson enough I Would skip that don't go straight to hunter killer that set your your scope right out hunter killer and go for that one\nAll right so now you know so a star is born it's been around for a few weeks now so what's the what's the overall ... the what I've heard and I ... I still haven't gotten to see people say it starts out great new kind of levels off of what what's the overall ... now after ... weeks\nThat's what I that's that's the overall buses that the first hours for a strong than the last hour kind of you know falls apart a little bit and that they're both okay Lady Gaga as are the big revelation at least she wants to me I I was surprised at how especially that first hour what a good performance she gives the interesting thing is some people are talking about it\nAs sort of the perfect Oscar movie for this moment because it's got sort of an indie credit to it as sort of feels like kind of a rough edged will be but it's also mainstream enough\nFor old Hollywood and so you might be able to get old Hollywood a new Hollywood combining to make this a big Oscar front runner I don't know if that's true uh it'll certainly be ... I think they'll both be nominated Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga and the film will be nominated it may not win anything it may win a couple of songs awards or something but it's an interesting thesis to think about\nThat this might be a movie that you know it's kind of the young Hollywood edgy stuff and the old classic Hollywood that love the story that's been told four or five times before\nSo the key will be speaking are classics Joe so last night I flipped on uh the of I flipped on AMC and there was the original Halloween still gripping as ever\nYep still as great as it as ever even the look of it you know there's that moment when a towards the beginning where Jamie Lee Curtis was driving with their pal and they're ... they're they're playing the blue oyster cult song ... and it feels creepy it's still for my money one of the best movie to watch around this time of year on Halloween because it really kind of captures exactly what was so great about those horror films the seventies\nAnd eighties out All right Joe new mired W. O. R. movie minute man thanks a lot Joe makes you guys All right so are you going to go see the submarine moving on probably not going to see Halloween to remake\n... probably not hey I'm just fascinated by the breaking news now so they have confirmed eleventh package heading for Cory Booker that one's in Florida are going to CNN but we do have this suspicious package on the west side in the fifties male facility they're checking out so this thing isn't over yet\nMy day with us this morning we'll bring you all the news it's breaking around the pipe I'm All right when we come back Megan Kelly is at an NBC W ours Alan Stockton ... is that Rockefeller Center with the reaction\nGlad you're spending your evening with our replay of yesterday morning show Castro store brand new Len Burman and my career in the morning Monday from six to ban on seven ten wor\nIt'd be joining us for the first time a day before the breaking news another suspicious packages just one of the postal facility in the fifties on the west side in white ... all over it\nAnd an eleven package has been found in Florida that was intended for Cory Booker so we're on top of that story or we like to know the coming up after the nine o'clock news gathering McLeod who is the captain love Bo was also\n\nBegan to major series will join us after nine o'clock News Let's go right to thirty rock Alice doctored Rovenia looks like during the shooting was making Kelly she is out of NBC and a Alice so what are the people saying they're\nMostly you know I didn't like her poor said she had to go if I just say that shall I kind of getting the same kind of answer I thought why am I gonna find Megan Kelly and so I went outside the box this guy said she was short and I still look at and shared his own blackface story\nYou know I Know it's politically correct\nA white person can have on black\nIf he's saying playing a role where something I I don't see anything wrong with it and\nGrew up in a long time ago but when we we used to have a play every year and\nFor six guys or girls dressed in blackface and\nThey tell jokes and it was perfectly acceptable back then and I grew up in West Virginia and\nI don't I don't think it's a a a racist state but\nThe gist of what I thought she was defending\nBlack face for Halloween it wasn't that just [noise]\n... yeah I think that's particularly offensive\nNo no I mean it's what the person's eyes you know you can have a white face and if you do sound like racist or bad that's that's not right\n... ... okay they find says political correctness has gone too far\nI just think Megan ought to be able to say when she wants to free speech in America and I think that we're getting too wrapped up in all of this [noise]\nYou think she should have been fired now\nFor that comment now I mean think of the things that [noise]\nDifferent people say I just think it depends on which sounded aisle you're on depending on how you treat it\nSounds like she should have been\nPretty neutral she's not in one sounded all of the other day if the guests are pulling out of the show and advertisers are pulling out and you don't have the ratings you got a big problem their\nBetween eighth and ninth avenues the whole area's cordoned off it's a it's a it's a isolated zone now two packages were found there and they say if it's the same kind of model of what the other packages were so\nI'm just wondering if these were all male the same time or if this uh this wacko is done it on a couple of a couple of days or three or you know whatever\nThat was interesting we had a Robert Boyce on former chief of detectives here in New York and he said he thought that they were getting near to 'em or Raleigh aspect\nI thought they had him and he was the one who first tip to soften said the rumor was Cory Booker and well he's plugged in he really is it turned out to be a so\nYou know what's interesting about how this investigation's going is similar to the bombings at the Boston Marathon\nSo what they do is we deliver put these bombs together has to go buy all the materials yeah so they find the materials they examined the where are they sold them to go to that location look at the camera for videos you don't see any won't all different devices and everywhere you go look for the video\nAnd that's how they found the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing and they suspect they'll be able to do it with this one is well well\nAs a Robert Boyce pointed out if if one guy brought this to the postal facilities in in ... he had to be carrying a lot of them you know there should be video of him they're carrying a box of all these packages so\nWell that clearly leads our big three are the focus is twofold is on that male facility in ... but it's also now on the west side of Manhattan\nTo the second street uh um you know the devices were probably sent from Florida but now there's another one heading for Cory Booker and and two of them in this facility in his Joe mentioned a moment ago one for James Clapper the former director of national security and the second one for Cory Booker\nAlso I'm critics yep all Trump why does Cory Booker get to see special he Spartacus will also a wasn't a Maxine Waters got we got to to okay well you know OK home and Andrew Cuomo didn't get a single one you said you know a lot of it All right we should make life but one of my\nYou know I think one of the things with this coming out of this this is more of a political statement then you know an attempt to\nBlow up people yeah\nClearly if there's a you know if these are not real bombs right you know\nAlso when the big three guys here comes the cavalry the president wants to send the eight hundred troops to the southern border region already has many of the national guard there and rounding out the big three\nMaking Kelly is out at NBC's Today show and now they're negotiating her exit package that should be a fascinating negotiation ... billion dollars what was the original contract for a total of sixty nine to nine\nMillion wow and I wonder if there's something in your contract that says ah she doesn't get as much as she wants if she says something offensive on the air I don't know if that standard procedure for big\nPool I'm just wondering sometimes that's the story came out that Ronan Farrow who broke the story on Harvey Weinstein and the ... originally had offered destroyed NBC and they passed the the story is that a meeting Kelly wants Ronan Farrow there for the ... because it sounds like she's trading off some information\nCouldn't the interest to help her own costs ... ... the last take me to going on over there\nBut again my feeling is if ah if ah the ratings were strong on her show uh she's still be there this is basically was the last straw\n... they didn't they didn't care for all right it's time for a hour a superstar gas\n\nI have um a cloud two major major TV shows how are you sir\nI'm just fabulous thank you are kept denying well our captain\nIs alive and well well the reason why you guys are together you your with your other cast members of the love boat reunion you guys are part\nOf a of a show at Schiller fast

so it's a special time for us we just finished the today show and ah it's so nice to see people's reaction after all these years\nBut I grew up watching the love boat every Saturday Night with my family and I read somewhere that when you first got the the script captain ... was a a little more ah a frightening and more authoritarian then he wound up being played is that true\nAbsolutely when they wrote him that way and the pilots I mean he was a\nIt was a a but it's basically ... remain and uh we realized if you don't have a serious go a week after week people want to see\nLike a couple of people they don't want to see that kind of a guy putting down people ... wasn't it didn't have a heart attack and so we go out to end too big a more paternal carrying fake you're very authoritative and that's what works for all those years\nAnd then when she came on you know you realize that he was the father and he had a great feeling and allow\nIt's beautiful daughter who is absolutely gorgeous stops trap ... shake that was looking for a kid we had dinner last night she got on the wrong thing I don't know what vegetable that was that she gets caught I lost a to\nA show about getting

Mary Tyler Moore group you know it's slowly\nDwindling because he was married about a year and a half ago that nobody is almost a hundred to add a couple of years older than I Am a seven though it's

in the morning you guys live Monday from six built in on seven ten wor Downey okay over there and find a\nWay I got a tweet from a listener is saying ... around the band he's gone hysterical and he doesn't want to listen to me more you've driven off one listener listen you're the what is driven me round the bend well that is we deserve to be I mean real\nGreat call for unity let's everyone gets together but why we're doing unity let's dump out in the media it's all the media's fault but that unity we're going to have unity here\nGreat can't go into this again with you until a two way to say when I get back on both sides about this fine of a newspaper or I Know you're a newspaper guy why it was just such a big deal they found this old newspaper in New\nJersey I'm a newspaper guy and I'm also a history buff and um somebody dropped off this framed old newspaper at a goodwill in New Jersey and the a guy at goodwill it's taught this looks interesting did a little investigation it's actually an authentic\nSeventeen Seventy four edition of the Pennsylvania journal and the weekly advertiser and it's all about I'm\nCalling for revolution breaking away from England is the fame to unite or die snake on it it's got articles in it that was signed by John Hancock\nHuh or Gina rebellion against the British could they printed this and of course they would that be but they were putting all these kind of papers back then they weren't greatest didn't go after them bought up they did go out and they had this thing called the American revolution none of them did\nGo to the British go after the newspapers this dive yes we know what to say what I'm saying they were battling\nThem John Hancock was considered a traitor but they were brave and they put out there which was to break free of England anyway this little newspaper that was just framed turned over\nA it will that out yet auction up to sixteen thousand dollars there were only three others in existence how many are all in university libraries\nThree or four pages that has actual ads in it it's got adds a rewards looking for a lost horse and another ad that I had another ad and other at his from the guy who says he will no longer pay his misbehaving wife's\nDad time fast by that I think actually I brought in a scrapbook that had been right in my family Broadway yes well those great play bills right right but the early Nineteen hundreds of late Nineteen hundreds and I always thought the ads are fascinating to write five cents for a wig\nOut here that I'm like what would an ad costs than this publication and Seventy Seventy four twelve cents I probably don't even think laugh laugh really I mean it was the circulation of this revolutionary paper\nIt's unbelievable I don't know yeah I don't know but it's a listen it's a newspaper that's worth sixteen thousand dollars I'm going to save this copy of today's post maybe one day or two with well on that it will be worth I think I think that the dollar is\nThe best part about Seventeen Seventy four paper was the horoscope is that the two years you guys will have your own country [laughter]\nOh\nGod I don't have any comment here's ray stage there from the weather channel so what's the what's that there has what's the actual definition of why this was a nor'easter what it is a certain ... position or what\nIt's about the when the wind direction has to be coming out of the northeast so you know the common misconception that\nIt is something during the ... that's why they sent a great heads listen\nYou're monitoring meteorologist but we actually have things sometimes that makes sense ... eastern northeast when okay but I\nMean they have to be a certain ... I mean you could talk about fifty mile an hour gusts you right so what did you have to be to be considered a ne\nNe wind was and I saw the northeast when you just blow it and then throwing when traditionally though it is a stronger when so I'll say you know there's I mean there are a logical term yeah a little bit stronger and just try to go very well you know me I'm All right well she\nGoes back to the uh tonight tomorrow or worst of it probably between\nA early morning hours oriental about noon that's where the study's heaviest rain the strongest winds are probably gonna start picking up around midday outright at high tide so between twelve and three there is a coastal flood warning along the coast of um you know Long Island especially down toward the Jersey shore\nUm that's when the heaviest rain starts to taper off too so I think the first half to maybe\nThree quarters of tomorrow is going to be pretty bad so rain and winds cussing forty maybe fifty miles per hour there's a wind advisory that cover that the winds will be out of the east north east\nGet it yeah oh God in Iraq right just piling attention in the rain or if you wanted to wait just so that could be some localized flooding because there are no flood watches 'em stronger wins out on eastern Long Island fifty maybe sixty plus miles per hour they do have high wind warnings eastern Long Island eastern New England\nAnd then later tomorrow afternoon as the logos through may actually see some unstable air so that could be a few thunderstorms around even though the ring and won't be as widespread will be more scattered within that rain coming through tomorrow afternoon and evening there maybe some scattered thunderstorms around also\nSo tomorrow is just kind of one of those ... days indoor indoor days as a meteorologist or even by temperature jumping right cool I mean not cold but cool here\nI'm probably not getting out of the fifties low fifties\nThey'll certainly no hoarding anything frozen Adirondacks white green mountains northern New England there may be a little snow around so when's the first snow or what your production for our first snow no first accumulating snow yeah come on we'll put joy is ever probably not too early to early December\nAccumulating still we're talking tracer more yeah I I don't see a woman over Central Park just want to make sure okay I Know you guys are writing this down we are\nWe're going to have had on early when it happened trace Central Park and just to sum mumbo jumbo that's ... that's ... but All right so this is that what this up we're going to see this going to be serious random impacts\nOf serious of serious for some if you if you do when he was president power outages and places ... fine debris garbage cans all that oh boy hunker down All right Frank\n... because the weather channel talk to you later re yup yeah I Will be will come on yet wins on Long Island boom hours out of there was a time you blow your nose on Long Island power to go out\nOf this is a rewind to friday's Len Burman and Michael read all in the morning them live Monday from six built in seven ten W all our\nMoney everybody on this Friday or this story is really sad Len yesterday we're talking about the two women\nFound in the Hudson River duct taped together and uh we immediately thought it was some sort of a murder\nOut I mean what I said so many like well you know ended up who they wouldn't duct tape themselves and then you guys kind of drop and said yeah you know I'm really Colombo over here while you're Seventy ... homicide would ya\nRight well you know it turns out when it's not it may not be a homicide hum here's it may have been a suicide pack these two women you don't know who they are of course they duct tape\nThemselves belly to belly\nAnd washed up on the Upper West side around sixty eight street it appears that they may have gone into the river around the George Washington bridge loaded down to six or west sixty eighth street they may have been romantically involved since they were duct tape facing each other and now they're ages or from sixteen to Eighteen\nWe've been around and spend a hundred times how about Sarah Huckabee Sanders was left to defend the president yesterday because he's being attacked by the ... well you guys called the mainstream media they say he should in some way be held partially responsible for all the rhetoric\nThat's going around the these days with these so called bombings anyway eras Sarah Huckabee Sanders yesterday\nWe're gonna continue to do everything we can to provide the resources they need to investigate and hold the person or persons responsible for that\nFully accountable okay so then of course you went out to say one person who's not responsible in any way or boy\nThere's a a big difference between I comments made an actions taken the president is certainly not responsible for sending suspicious packages to someone no more than Bernie Sanders was responsible for a supporter of his shooting up or Republican baseball field practice last year\nThe idea that this is at the hands of the president is absolutely\nThat's rather media was an angry mob there Germany and they told her to do the very end of that had their push for it I thought I ... and uh obviously\nShe went out to talk about how negative the media is towards Donald Trump in some quarters\nNinety percent of the media attention around this president is negative despite historic a job creation despite the fact that our economy is booming despite the fact that trade deals that everybody said couldn't be made have been made despite the fact that the president is trying to solve law and order at our border\nAnd we get Sarah how can we do like PR worked for this show I mean really she we could do the rug via wonderful show us the best show ever she is very skilled at what she does I have to say a very good at what you do that otherwise Sean spicy spicy boy\nYeah the president is going to continue to lay out the case and the differences between Democrats and Republicans Americans have a choice to make and he's gonna lay that out and you're going to see him do that\nYeah he used by the ... you know some presidents kind of lay back in the midterms and he's boys right out their noses all on him in in some way this is a rallying them on him galvanizing the base we\nShall see I guess the Democrats still our favorite to take the house but it's going to be quite a night well you know you see\nAll kinds of polls some are even summer up some are down looked like they can't take the Senate anyway it's going to be crazy it's coming up soon everyone hey uh coming up how the mighty and rich have fall and the Megan Kelly saga we shall discuss\nHealthier and

Brett Kavanaugh was involved in gang rapes\nWell I said no she said that I think she said he was around the saw some I don't think she said he participate in any way we can agree on as a politician\nJon case I Do like case in Ohio governor I used a river yeah uh so uh you know people think he's going to run for president he he keeps dodging the question but he he certainly doesn't hold back\nI was concerned that was hopeful that perhaps he could get to the point\nWhere he could unite the country talking about Donald Trump them five now become convinced apps and Damascus road experience\nI've become convinced that he's not capable of this he is not capable of being a unifier in fact I I've become convinced that he doesn't know how to accept personal responsibility and always find somebody else to blame\nI don't want this to be I don't want this to be construed as a personal attack it's an observation that I may\nHave actually made on CNN of all places I Would tell I Would tell a case that if he's going to try to run against Trump his clock is going to be clean now it will be but I I like the guy we had him on our show during the campaign good guy I Know I like to I'd like him too but he now if he runs who's going\nTo slash spending or even with our replay of yesterday morning show Castro's for a brand new Len Burman and Michael real in the morning Monday from six to ten on seven\n\n... am on a friday on seventh and ... am it's always great to have John Carl the final ABC News White House correspondent John good morning to you sir\nGood morning so here's the deal\nAh the president is obviously a fighting back from anybody who claims that he should take any responsibility for his actions\nAnd his words and deeds when it comes to this whole up of the mailing of these uh uh uh incendiary\nDevices which may or may not have been armed and um what's the latest was up at the three in the morning tweeting again about it he said he would have unity and wanted unity but then he's going after the media can\nWilliston exaggerate here at the tweet was not at three and those are two forty five [laughter] sorry the president was asleep at three AM or you know if this were ... they got set a record for the latest uh the latest\nTweet earlier maybe he woke up this week job that\nThat's a very good point that's a very good point but the uh this was a tweet we specifically went after CNN which also broke court had lasted for about forty two hours the the notion that he he went\nOff without criticizing even mentioning by name any of those who were targeted by these pipe bombs he did the rally out of Wisconsin where he called for peace and harmony and and civility and you know ... ... talked about how well he was behaving and didn't mention I mean it was the first Trump rally I Believe that we have seen\nThat didn't mention either Hillary Clinton Brock Obama are Maxine Waters or CNN [noise] um so that\nEnded at ... at two forty five this morning he's back to you know where he was in ... and what you what my sense is here talking to uh the people close to the president\nIs they are angry he is angry at any suggestion that these pipe bombs or have anything to do with him and we don't know if it's got anything if they I mean we ... we know that they've targeted\nPeople that the president's targeted with his rhetoric but we have no idea who did this we have no idea if it's a you know a Trump supporter or if it's a you know somebody on the left trying to\nLook like they're a Trump supporter or if it's somebody who is just a crazy person out there are so so it it it is wrong to\nTo say that the president or as as a responsibility for this when you don't have any idea or the president's rhetoric has any kind of responsibility for this but it's just interesting that the defensive\nCrouch here is so intense there so a defensive on this stuff we're in the middle of what looks like a national emergency you would think that the focus would be on let's find out who the hell did this and catch them before they actually do something that goes off\nBy John is there a a political calculation here I mean Trump knows that ah this stuff is going to rev up his base by attacking the media and saying that they're you know exaggerating the threat of the bombs by comparing them to September eleventh is it going to work\n[noise] well you know the the the thing is we are eleven days out there's no way that you could expect the president to be Mr tone down and behaving himself or whatever he wants to call it in the presidential for for eleven days before the election elections are about\nContrast and differences and and he's he's going to be attacking Democrats that's another and believe me the Democrats are attacking him um\nAnd and you know the way he is operated since he came down the escalator and two thousand Fifteen is a he attacks the media to um he uses the media he actually loves the media but he attacks the media that's that's you know [noise] so uh for golf course there's a\nPolitical calculation it really just it's it's politics as usual for for him\nOr Amazon Carl NBC News the White House correspondent is it's so much to ask or expect that a president would call his predecessor to express any kind of concern or or tell them he's thinking about them because some devices were sent to them is that too much to expect them to call bill\nOr or Iraq or anyone\nI asked that very question no a variation of it of of Sarah Sanders so what you know for what has he reached out to reach out to a bomb went to reach out to build that he reached out to you know Biden has been focused [noise] um and the answer I got back was that avant garde talked Chelsea\nLego um friends or they were friendly one more thing\nThey were they were there were they were friends absolutely\nUm but I you know I it it is you know the\nPresident Trump is\nUnique in American history is unique in American politics uh he's got a he's got obvious strengths he's got an ability to command attention that is beyond anybody that I've ever\nCovered but the the ... the reaching out expressing a hopes of unity\nA reconciliation a compassion does or doesn't [laughter]\nNobody's ever accused of being is a sense of his strengths\nThat what do you make about ... report that was in the times that the

the dream of becoming a scientist since the second grade really\nAnd that dream took me to UCLA then on to Cornell where I got my PHD in physics and astronomy and then as I said on the Harvard where I taught physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years at Cornell when I started at myself how did this universe that I've been studying come to be an\nExport into the
