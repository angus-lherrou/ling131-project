Rick from California to Texas in southeast Arizona\nSuddenly the daughter explained why she was driving the father was in a bunk getting some rest she explained very loudly for her father to get up

grain I have no idea what paradise is but it's somewhere between yellow and green descend vertically\nAnd here we're here's where it gets really exciting George\nBut daughter according to the father's

race fail it was a possibility that that could happen it's a very serious issue\nWe have the ability to be able to protect ourselves it's actually a something that just about anybody can do but we're not trying to do it in in the schools were not taught to do it in churches were not taught to do it anywhere we\nWell how many do you think Jeffrey believe how many people believe that demons exists if you went out and pulled people\nNot I think would be Fifteen twenty percent would be my guess George but important thing to remember is that there are there and they certainly believe that we exist\nAnd so the the old game is is that they don't want us to know that there were there they want us to think that this is our own feelings\nAre only five and some of it is all of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits\nAre but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back everybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nThey work on them for on people for a while you really these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed people who move into a home a and there's a lot of\nNegative emotional energy drugs or something\nI practice something called modern actresses and and that that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that ... homes because people have lived in there that generate both positive and negative emotional energy is which are unseen but we feel them\nAnd they accumulate in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and soda negative spirits\nAnd so they are uh attack people and homes we don't take care of our homes we clean them wash windows when you move into a new place the carpets paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies\nAnd so demonic spirit's just play on that\nAnd they come into the our environments\nAnd generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy at thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nThose kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air\nIs thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment or whatever and doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern exercises and deals with the idea of that first the negative emotional energy has to be removed by\nSomebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit\nOr that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises in different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first sometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest does that affect what you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent priest is Sean and freeze exercises\nI don't belong to any particular religion because I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who\nAre agnostic atheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about um I wasn't touching anything anyways doing personal clarion I wasn't touching anybody anyway is really it's not necessary\nThere's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level it doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is the complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it\nAnd it it's it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates\nAnd spirits need to be\nDealt with you know sometimes there are already in the home sometimes they come into the home the sense of\nFamily that's having a problem because of emotional energy in her living environment and they're ripe for attack and so it's it's best to call maybe a professional to have it where it all at once and I then I teach people how to maintain the clarity of their bodies\nAre energy fields or and also how to maintain the clarity of their living environment's so it's kind of like having a carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply cleaner own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent in something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion and not the only one\nOr that are qualified extra assistant just about every religion\nBut they but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that\nPeople call up and say well I I called you know local parish even though I'm not you know I don't belong that religion not Catholic\nAnd they won't come over and help me I Hope everybody so I that's why I don't belong to any religion but I remember doing this kind of working past lives um I have deep contacts with higher spirits\nAre also this universe is filled with stars and around those stars are planets and there are\nThis universe I said before on on one of my appearances but the universe is teeming with life you asked me that question you have\nTo know do you go into these exercises with a crucifix at all no you don't do that\nNo but when I'm working a with Christians which calling me all the time I'm even evangelical Christians have you know it ... they need help to everybody\nKnew everybody needs help hold on for the rest of the ah we're coming up to the top of the hour we're going to come back we'll talk more Jeffries website starkly or dot coms book is

as well as we talk about demons\nMonica possessions what has been for you Jeffrey the scariest or even maybe the most dangerous situation you've been in with this\nOr both or just a few years ago um I Do the three nights a\nStand essentially a legitimate haunted mansions and it's very famous I won't mention the name but um it's something I was\nAgainst for years and years and years for fused all invitations I finally they talked me into innocent fine actually stayed over in one of the rooms just beautiful you know and uh so\nUh it was essentially set up for ... to go in and uh with real quick and then in and take a look around and everybody everybody found something people who didn't believe in ghost had you know\nOne couple said their hair dryer when flying across one of the rooms and I was staying in most haunted room of all they gave me it was actually the nicest room too but\nUh the first thing that happened was I went up there one night to get some business cards from people on it and uh I was in there you know by myself and there was very heavy gold sheet over the bottom of the bed I forgot what that's called and wrote bachelor but very heavy gold she it was called the gold room\nAnd it went up to get my business cards and this she started moving up and down maybe a foot really fast\nRight in front of me just would not stop I just said you know oh I just you know forget it I went to get my cards and paid no attention and I said you know\nThis place is really haunted and the third night I was there um I was sleeping and uh I'd given speeches every night or to the coast hunters warning meant to be very careful about saying don't pinch me don't bite\nMedia people home negative spirit's just they will get\nJanelle to get your later so it was sleeping I woke up about five o'clock in the morning and uh oh four feet above me was the misshapen spirit just terrible looking now\nI'm used to know spirits can assume any shape they want so I don't react to the ... you know the say the ugliness or the appearance of something like that deliberately\n... what this thing was doing was it was singing\nAnd ... song that I'd never heard\nReally is I Can't it's grain possible to describe it was not any kind of it sounded like some kind of evil lullaby\nAnd it was right above me and the spirit was essentially you know head to head I was laying in my in the bed woke up and the spirit was was singing ... and I could hear it loud and clear this horrific\nSong slowly and I just I you know ... shot up\nImmediately got up out of my bed at ... kind of went right back into the wall immediately 'cause I was going to attack right away first thing I knew what it was\nI did I have no idea how long it had been there a you know essentially putting some kind of\nIncantation are spelled immediately on me you know I wanted to change me a from being very happy and sleeping very well to suddenly being very um self conscious and and frightened I actually felt really sick\nI sat up immediately went to the chair sat in my room and said I Am not going back to sleep in this house I was not working at this time\nI was just you know sleeping after hard night of giving speeches and talking about all these things and I said I'm not going to sleep again in this mansion and actually went down into the basement which used to be a speak easy and sat down and they're not out of fear I just wanted to get out of the room\nYou know you you just learn\nAn extra sisters not safe I don't go into homes and uh in in to entertain people or just to give speeches if they're negative spirits in somebody's home or negative energy I get rid of it\nHow do you know you've gotten rid of\nPeople say so I I go completely on the client I give a report on what I see and what I did and suggestions I have but I go completely under clients\nWhen did they get back to Egypt for you I mean how many days after you were there do they call you back and say I think you got rid of this thing\nOh it's usually right away or you know sometimes you know a week or so later but on the calls come pretty quickly you know in\nTimes immediately you know it's like you know we feel better right away especially when I Do a personal clearly not do these things by Skype I work with people all around the world I don't have to travel everywhere sky telephone\nOr you know whatever and so people say hey I feel better right away because I work on a lot of individuals are just working negative environments and they need a clearing\nAnd and I teach people how to protect themselves and and so I Do a lot of this and so they feel better right away I get that right away and they call up and say hey our family is no longer fighting I feel better at work and better able I go into business meetings and I'm no longer coming out feeling dreamed\nBecause I'm not getting hit with negative energy from my co workers we all generate negative energy\nAnd we don't always noted subconscious\nAnd so people don't know that are getting hit they don't know they're sending out negative energy they don't know something like a demonic spirit is around them run negative spirit and so you know people call me family is calling me and sometimes it takes a while and sometimes it's the media but I always get\nA caller and email thanks a lot Jeffrey really really helped\nYou know very very seldom out of the thousands of clients that I've helped or the last almost three decades now\nHave not said that you know it's it's not a matter of ego or bragging it's just what happens you know I'm very good at what I Do and I make sure that the client isn't the best shape possible so personal clearing might be forty five minutes I Do thirty five different things and forty five\nMinute already five different things so remarkable it's almost like a checklist\nEvery clearing has different George depending on what is going on with the client it may just be negative energy a nurse or works in a hospital or psychiatric ward or around six people that is coming in from the six month clearing they're calling me up\nYou know buy Skype or something or is most common uh you know and I don't have to\nLook at them for forty five minutes how I was I always work with my eyes closed unless I'm walking around really do in business or a house\nAnd so you know or they feel better you know and and you know the fight stop because\nThe idea of a negative spirit or even just negative emotional energy that's accumulated over a period of time in a home has no effect upon the family more arguments and they can turn violent this attracts negative spirits this attracts demonic spirits\nAnd so negative emotional energy attracts negative spirits and demonic spirit is also happens in the workplace far more than people think\nAnd are these are the complaints that I get and so my job is to remove the negative emotional energy from a person's energy field both deep meaning that the from the very first day that were born we generate emotional energy\nAnd also things we pick up today yesterday last week as well and also the homes we move into apartments were lived in by maybe a hundred different people generating emotional energy schools\nPeople go to school I went to this this is the same school both elementary and high school that my parents went to its old very beautiful\nBut I mean think of the moon Leonard and she doesn't have any laid it and so people will be calling uncomfortable they don't know why and the body picks\nUp emotional energy we generated we don't know how to release it I teach people how to do that you know and and so\nSometimes it's a teaching session and sometimes it's a clearing session and all depends I Do both and you know a clearing session a forty five minutes first standard adult you know maybe you know thirty minutes for\nA child and maybe Fifteen twenty minutes for pets not so good at all costs just for you\nYou know Marshall energy

defend themselves\nWhich unfortunately is a great portion of the population and so they will attack people who have mental issues physical brain problems a depression anger issues unhappiness\nOr overconfidence all sorts of things that are going on and so it does happen\nAnd and we have to watch out for that and and so ah demonic spirits\nAre experts at reaching across that dividing line and being able to reach into the physical around and affect people when the wind is right usually meaning that there is emotional energy in the atmosphere or a person is feeling weak they're not protecting themselves properly\nAnd they can reach across and damage a person physically and they can cause even something like that usually what happens is is not so much of an immediate death but actually been working on them for a long time\nAnd they can cause physical injuries to even happen to me once you know I I woke up\nOne morning I was getting dressed in my office my girlfriend was asleep at the time\nAnd I was getting up and ready to work out doing what I Do here and all of a sudden\nDemonic spirit appeared behind me I knew I could feel its power suddenly a light shot out from it hit me right in the back and it caused me to have a centrally a pulled muscle\nI actually had to go you know get in my car and tried to the hospital and you know I haven't looked at in a you know get some light medication for it because it ... the demonic spirit had pulled the muscle\nSo it can happen to me and I'm good at protecting myself so all the people out there who are not protecting themselves which is the\nYou know most of the population of our planet are very susceptible to attack and it can be physical because demonic spirits study how to do these things\nThe non physical universe having the other side whatever you want to call it which is a wonderful place but they also have dark realm listener negative\nVery negative what we might call help and and especially that is very connected to the physical realm of the physical realm as something like the crust of the bread and heaven and the other side to being the inside the bread itself which is much larger\nLet's go next to the gym in Portland, Oregon while we have some time here Jim go ahead\n... on my question is is it possible for one of these evil spirits to quit being evil or you know the trip pan turtle like I go to the other side gets off drugs\nSo many psychics back in the Nineteen nineties asked me and said hey Jeffrey as long as you're doing extra citizens and teaching people how to protect themselves why don't you help the spirits and I said what I say now I Am not a spirit psychologist\nUh it's kind of like if somebody calls and your window and wants to steer steal your stereo or worse you don't sit them down on the couch and say look we need to talk about why you steal things it's not my job you don't have time for spirits\nOut there that actually are very good at trying to help negative spirits demonic spirits are homeless but the idea of negative spirit's just negative people who are dead and doing negative things\nAnd trying to get them to look at themselves and see what they're doing but it's not my job and people who hire me I work for them my job is to get those things out of their home get negative energy out of their home out of their bodies energy fields\nI don't have time to do it and if they're not going to listen to me anyway\nThey're they don't have to there's going to go someplace else they're just not going to do that anymore the physical criminals going to sit there on the couch is that he or she is going to get up and walk out the door back out the window I I just don't have the time\nI have to immediately focus on getting rid of the emotional energy in the person who's energy field of the average person\nNot everybody's everybody's possessed or anything we just have negative energy issues and also getting if there's some kind of negative spirit attack but not necessarily living in the house they could just be going from house to house every night or apartment to apartment or condo condo or ... whatever and getting them out of their fast\nAnd making it work so the family or the individual is safe this is my main concern not dealing with a negative spirit's there are\nMillions and millions of spirits out there you don't just sit on clouds or walk the streets of gold actually do things in one of the things they do is work for higher spirits and help other spirits look at themselves and stop doing what they're doing if they don't there are other measures that we can take\nYour every are you glad you have this ability disability to see demons to maybe even get removed them\nGeorge I am I was\nBorn with it and at first it was really scary because when I reported it the teachers you know I'm seeing these spirits and you know I'm a mom so that could you know you know tell her when my grandmother my grandmother was going to call and you know two days and all those kinds of stuff at first it was real scary\nBut actually I I started as I went along in my life I started and and I'm fifty nine now I started to remember doing these kinds of things in past lives helping people\nThat to me is the greatest gift um I could ever be giving is the ability to help people it's dangerous work but the idea is is that once I teach people how to protect themselves they can go off and and not be so susceptible they can go to work and not come home so dream\nAnd I bet they really appreciate you while they love it\nYou know and it it's just great to hear them say hey thanks Jeffrey but you know the real the real reward is them feeling better that's what it's all about me\nSure is Jeffrey ... would you please\n... you can

I didn't I didn't know when I was dream that it was a dream and once in a looser tree but\nAfterwards I woke up right after and so sure enough that was only a dream but what I'm curious about is somebody like Dr Ford in the area of psychology and whatnot I Would would not\nBe surprised at all that she has been consuming these drugs\nWe don't we don't know that\nI don't know but but what I'm saying is that\nIt could very well be that she instead of what this young man had with a with a ... dream\nSoon she hers was more like Roseanne Barr that you can read on 'em\nNo you're you're absolutely right but that's that's something that nobody asked either one of them\nIf they were on the mood altering drugs I don't believe everything I ... I've seen in the in that case\nThat never came up but ah I'm sure that's a possibility or even though we don't know for sure what it probably happened Keith thank you for that we've done open line calls let's go next to Jason in Bowling Green Kentucky west of the Rockies Hi Jason\nYou don't you're okay where are you\nAh I'm In ... um I had a a thing and I couldn't believe that I saw before I had a I had done a little ... ... and I had gotten\nTo read the Bible a little bit you know\nAnd um and I was at a bone in my life where I didn't really know if God was real or if the devil real all this you know and I started reading the Bible and everything and then I'm\nBack to the point when I was out of jail when I Lived in a a a God and I was like well you know your real angel on everything Israel you know show me because I Would like to know I Would like late at night so uh\nIt's probably ... ... at first nothing really happened except until about a week\nLater than what happened when I started seeing\nLittle things like with people like a Beagle like these little ...\nAnd stuff and I'm a well I I think this one guy had three of them\nRight ... it seemed like everybody and when he had freeing the everything he did he touch was known I mean if everyone like ... ... you know what I'm saying in and then I think it's one kid he didn't have none okay now these kids that you know\nOh it's a glass of water without knocking over something breaking it up and told me that he was going to get an angel [laughter] but he just didn't have one at that time\nAnd um I Believe it was kind of be just to show me\nThat you know how it works warning or no and then I bought a church in a ...\nA chemical about it and he told me oh you don't want to go to church you know and I'm so we'd go to church well why would they church I won't eat them and I started the ... will will be angels like\nIn the early on to church all over the place\nAll of them around it you know a new like they are
