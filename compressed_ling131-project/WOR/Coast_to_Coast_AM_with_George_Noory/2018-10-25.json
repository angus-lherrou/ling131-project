York ...\nYeah exactly right we've got a conspiracy then at that point whether or not it is a you know a a a something that is coordinated or something that is organic but I can tell you this I Want to get to the bottom of it so I Want to hear what the authorities\nHave to say about this and I don't want to jump to conclusions because it could be a left wing conspirator doing is to try to make Republicans good look bad but on the surface it looks like and I know everybody's saying you know Trump and his rhetoric has made\nYou know thing he's created an environment for somebody would be induced to do this you don't know that you don't know that we need to wait\nAnd get the official verdict from our authorities any and intelligence communities in the United states and then the American people can chew on it but bottom line you and me both know that the rhetoric in this country\nI'm Talking about it a grass roots level I'm not talking about leadership because these guys have always been you know at one another stroke\nBut we have to understand that at the grassroots level\nAmerica is best when we can debate ideas are vigorously these ideas and then you know come up with a viable solution to whatever problem that we're facing and try to assassinate former presidents\nAnd leaders and government is not the way to solve this problem and whoever whoever it they're not\nPutting this country they're hurting the United states of America and George I'm so glad you guys let me way on it what you had on this because I Love my country all over with all my heart I told you once on there that would get my life for the United states of America and I and I will but George this right here\nGot to come to win and hopefully this is a wake up call for all of us for all of us to realize that if you're a Republican don't look at a Democrat is your enemy if you're a Democrat don't look at the Republican as your enemy as an opponent yes but not an enemy\nWe're all on the same team and the media\nNot not coast to coast\nBut the media has definitely because George you giving everybody a platform you giving everybody a platform and you've been reasonable you bid on it I've heard your commercials saying listen you know just because I let a person say what he wants to say don't think that I'm On one side or the other and that's the proper and healthy way to look at it but George\nThe media has exacerbated this problem I Do believe that the media bears as you know a little culpability in this we've got to stop demonizing\nAnd looking at one another as we are enemies were all on the same team the only people that are clapping and I are our adversaries overseas\nAnd those on and the individual or the group that sent these packages exactly George\nTed Kaczynski the Unabomber killed three people injured twenty three others he was caught because his manifesto was publicly let go and his brother recognized it as Ted Kaczynski he's turned him into the FBI\nAre we going to happen hopefully some kind of a person because I'm convinced Andre that one person always tells another person somebody knows something about who sent these packages out maybe they'll go to the public or you know if\nThis is a conspiracy I don't think that this conspiracy will hold wax too much longer you cannot have a conspiracy like this and everybody keep their ... their mouth shut I think that if this is a conspiracy we will get a resolution to this we'll find out the truth a whole lot faster\nThan if this is one lone but I Am convinced and law enforcement uh individuals\nAnd are individuals and institutions in in the intelligence community entire US intelligence apparatus they will get to the bottom of this and who ever did this\nWith somebody on the left or to somebody on the right because I Will say again I Will say again 'cause I Know you've got people on the right thing this could be a false flag it'd\nBe somebody on the left that did this and you got most of the media thing that President Trump still this weight\nShut out wait let the intelligence officials do their job then wants their job is completed and they've determined who'd done this then we can begin as a nation to try to put the pieces back together\nAnd come together as one\nCountry we are the United states of America you know every group has you know had their time to be stepped on that just the way empires are established and America is an empire and people are going to get stepped on but\nYou have to wait and do things proper in order I'm thinking about the Tuskegee Airman right now who President Roosevelt said go out they can't fly on a piece for the one less thing but they flew it and they flew it most six more successfully and they protected more bombers than anybody in front\nOf they sure did in ... in when they landed white pilots went up to them and hugged them\nExactly George exactly you know we all want to contribute to the greatness of America and we're on a good path right now let this path continue LS stop this rhetoric\nThat drives us apart and and I'm not talking about Trump I'm Talking about individuals the guy at a gas station your best friend the guy who you talk to on the phone you know stop it realize we're all in the same boat together we're all Americans\nAll right bye for I'm willing to change\nOr we will talk this week and see

technical comment on the fence today\nUm I Would I Would estimate that the probability of this being tracked down to either the perpetrator or perpetrators of a very short period of time as as being very very high I'm ... I mean these are all unexploded devices that mean\nOh kind of trace evidence is available from them and they're all they've all gone are all going to the FBI the U.S at some of them were sent through the regular mail for us here\nAnd then I just wanted to know if they're from one city one location or a number of different cities they\nProbably have that all figured out already the entire ah UFP of network is highly computerized they have photos of the packages as they cross through the ... got\nPictures of the person if he delivered it to the post office camera\nAt the post offices ... I mean this is the kind of thing where where if you want it to have the best possible evidence it's almost as if someone wants to be caught so I I think probably within a day or two days are certainly a short period of time we're going to find out who is behind this and then some of these questions are are going to start to uh [noise] that would be possible\nAnd she'll say that again about a minute left the optics story really like\nI I mean this is mostly a a you know it kind of future kind of issue with it more it it's more involving a inter ISP communications rather than individuals I think the question it always comes up when you when we talk about higher speed Internet\nIs are we going to be able to afford it or the eye of the day is going to raise the band with caps enough so that we won't use up our whole allocation for the month and in two minutes\nAnd where it's going to go because right now the ISPs have tended to put the high speed a new advanced system in the ah high rent

and clarify suing them edition and it can actually send you an earth bounce spirit and what they do is they will go and I'm looking for spirit at the cemetery\nWho have not crossed over and they will um make the calls to spirits who are very disgruntled you know they either killed someone or they raped someone or and then they're willing to do their bidding and so they can send a spirit to you and

she\nThe doors senior producer Tom Dan highs or has been picking some guess how do you select who I'm going to try to guess who they might be tonight Tom\nUh I picked people that the audience will know in that you will know because the whole idea of the show is to have fun is in this particular door show is to have fun and people know who they are but the best part is when they tried to tricky aren't really creative fire remember\nWhen the late Roger leader came on and uh I could not gas him at all he had you and I think in honey and was going to in he when he was very good too so I'm

ten years I have no engagements and the ... January November and December\nI Can't believe it two months without going anywhere a fence my nature [laughter]\nWell I tell you we\nLove your stand that I'm going to tell everybody who might be brand new to the program when I was a Twenty one year old reporter in Detroit Michigan my very first interview was with a fellow named Stanton Friedman I saw a little clip being in the Detroit News that he was going to be speaking before a group\nOr an uncle in university and I told my news director I Want to go out there and interviewed this guy who's you know nuclear physicist expert in UFOs and my news director said I'm not paying for this this is not going to be an overtime for this\nYou want to go out there and interview this guy you do it on your own time so I took my tape recorder out I went and interviewed stance and Friedman had a great interview\nAnd I've known him ever since then when I eventually\nMatured and did my night talk show in St Louis who's the gas and then when I replaced art on coast to coast stance was a staple of the program anyways and we continued and he's been at some live events with me I think I'm going to be with you at alien fest the end of January

view ... these days I mean you you were out there way in the beginning telling people about you ... talking about the Benny and Barney he'll case you've got books out\nWhat's the latest based on your work your research\n[noise] well I think there's been a much wider except I think the biggest thing that's happened as we've come to realize that our vision of the world was not quite right\nWhen Frank Drake talked about there might be aliens out there if there might be eight thousand places in the galaxy or are they going to be sending a signal\nWell the latest word against it looks like there was about one point six climates per star that bring galaxy star\nAnd our galaxy the Milky Way has had a hundred billion stars\nAll that means one hundred and sixty million on it so they're all over the\nPlace and you know that changes our picture we used to think we're pretty special you know there's only a few civilization ... around and we're at the top of the heap well\nRoll over the place and that changed our perception of how important we are of course we're not the most important things around because we haven't been around very long and leave plenty of room in other words\nFor others and we've come to realize that you know get to hear from mayor is not quite the big deal we used to think it was\nA hell of a virus comes from doing things differently [noise]\nSo the notion that the you know it's going to take a very long time many years to get between stars in that I Can't be much crepes and back and forth ... nuclear fusion for example ... you can get\n... or we also\nRealize that the country a sixteen fifty I guess a bishop ... their world was created in four thousand ... see\nThat's right it can be filling beings\nAround you know well he was on for a little bit four billion be\nJust a little little\nUh our ... natural we were not as important I I hate to say this to people but we're not as important as we might think we are in the larger scheme of things [laughter]\nThe ultimate you know her for me [noise] um [noise] we're beginning to realize the busy place out there\nAnd there should be no surprise that the people see others coming here because apparently they seem to be all over the place out whether this is a result of\nSpontaneous generation of life everywhere or migration colonization maybe people are being exiled and all you do you find out is saying with the mirror throws a climate that they put in incarcerated people you know\nLike yeah like a ... boy guy's been brought on earth\nThere you never know the way they've been treating people ... it's it's you're\nSaying to you or one of the first if not the first to break the Roswell New Mexico story nationwide but in ... have you changed your thoughts in views at all about that case over the years or you pretty steadfast that what we've been talking about would you especially is still what it was\nI think it's early and visitors and as a matter of how we bring expanded the notion of wired tried to tell you a first time I was on that what we think there's one point six planets for stars so lead to a huge number of planets [laughter]\nYou know they're probably come in here uh I I'd have been left that only a few thousand pirates you know if there are life out there and we see it mhm you know they would make contact and land on the White House lawn and all kinds of crazy so\nNow I think it's more like realizing but at North America has more than a few people money coast jammed full of people all over the place and Wade that makes us less important than we'd like to think we are [laughter]\nAnd there's still people playing in the world is only a few thousand years old so what's the big\nOr or still slapped [laughter] him\nAnd so a motion was learned that it's a mark\nI'm clerks place than we thought it was and we hate to admit it but you know what we're not the most advanced\nAs much shouldn't be surprising again because we know now we measured the age of climate the stars and things like that and uh hey we're not number all or no you\nKnow and so\nWhat we and you can tell from another thing or the military budget on a blind eye it's about a trillion dollars this year so we haven't changed much have we\nKnow that at all these\nPeople don't get the goodies of our from their work [noise] uh we take for leaving because we're stocking up on on ways to kill people\nAnd it seems I I don't want to say that's human nature a lot it appears to be close to what it is [laughter] I'm not going to try to explain why or how but we know enough to say that a\nIs an awful lot of energy available to men in the universe [laughter] you know I've gone to the sequence of I you know ... how long does it take to get someplace else ... personal almost kind of stuff in\nIt's good to have to work at it or they're bad things in the world of course I'm sure we can do something [laughter] and so why shouldn't I be in the um [noise] and\nLike I say restraint seems to be the word the uppermost than many leaders mine marking it shouldn't have argued that don't get good at why\nWhy don't we hear too much about ... abduction cases anymore gosh you know in the seventies and sixties that's all we heard\nUs right now we I think we take for granted but they're aliens or maybe we are here to talk\nTo any leader or maybe they ...\nYeah maybe they got all and me a raccoon enough is enough and that might not be surprising and I I have a great deal and ... gets pushed a little ...\nAnd ...

Conley was sitting in front of the president\nSo he got he but but what I don't know is whether he was in a bench before him how that seating arrangement was I I I think he was sitting in a bench in front of the president uh the way I like to run I think he was in the front\nAt so they so a governor currently and his wife or in front of President Kennedy and his wife\nSo there were three people in the front seat\nNo they weren't another so it would have been a another a row of sitting there and and the\nDriver or a or the other Secret Service agent who was on the passenger side so you would have had six people\nIn that car would have been six strange run and Tom is looking at it and what do you do to ... to can you turn Tom's might come for just one second Denny put your speaker downtime and tell me what you're saying\nWell I just I just pulled up disapproved of film and I'm watching them come over in what you're describing him back with his wife right and a book and you can hear me 'cause I'm I'm looking at the film are now I hear you [noise] and uh and then a ...

Secret Service agents at the front seat\nAnd then a second row with Governor crime and his wife and his wife was to here's laugh and the president and Jackie were in the back and Jackie was to his left\nThe teacher and I mean I definitely know the secret service agent was in the front driving because everybody accused him of turning around shooting the president uh yeah and I don't believe that happened\nBut no I you know again I think about this and I studied that as well because William Cooper is one that was saying that I write you know I thought about it I thought okay well the driver would have had Ruben left handed if that's the case and also [noise]\nJeeze driving so that means they'd have to take his eyes off the road to turn and then make the perfect shot you know with his left hand\nAnd everybody wants to see that\nYeah so I you know I don't buy that\nInterview with Bill thanks for being behind the secret door you've given us a lot to think about when the new book

you believe or your perceptions of the world and so I didn't want to believe and that they're earning power that they're just the pond to their world\nAnd when my work really is about beyond the board it really is about teaching people to find their empowerment their core strength in and that is found by remembering recalling who they are the divine bean and that they are an extension of sorts incarnate when you come from a place of that kind of be on\nThat kind of belief system those kinds of intentions then you get what you desire you get you get a whole different\nWay of communicating
