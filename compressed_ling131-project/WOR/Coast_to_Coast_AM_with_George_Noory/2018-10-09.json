solved walking fast launches cinder says you're not going to have a ten foot sasquatch leaving a quarter inch footprint that you know\nSeven eight hundred pounds it just doesn't work maybe they take ballet I'll let you never know but anyway I say that it is there's different kinds of proof is different kinds of evidence and everyone thinks something that might not be you have to be this is again it goes back to using scientific method\nAnd looking at all aspects of the playoffs are on\nThe ground and then it ... the weather's been attacked or were you did that every time we take a track\nWe know exactly where it was almost to the court I mean you could you yeah I mean do we measure we measure lane measure with that and then we always try to show you how deep it is\nAnd I think when you do something like that it's a little more scientific and just having a cat that something that you can print but when you start looking at it in the scientific method it just doesn't pan out because it's probably put some of the slips and then it along gated and that's why it's only a quarter of an inch deep insult around\nThree talented people put on the fringe investigations pod cast the first is the cryptic guy Christian McLeod Christian how how long have you ah folks been doing this\nWell George we've been doing the pot cats for about three months I'm tired and I've been together working

about it pointed traded for pennies in fact there's an incredible story about how one guy by two pizzas with ten thousand bitcoins\nThat worth about twenty dollars at the time but here's the shocker

phone calls next ours we talk about the high technology artificial intelligence survivor and Reese with us as books the fourth age if I were on the lawn mosques delete Stephen Hawking they were petrified warning us about the dangers of artificial intelligence is it that bad\nA well I I Would say that I don't think so but I'll say this what what they're worried about was what we mentioned earlier which is kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that's\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on a simple a\nSupposition and that is that people are machines if if you are a machine and your brain as a machine in your mind as a machine\nExactly but even that's the same thing it's just that is just the machine and and we would have never said well what if you're a slide rule turns on you what if your calculator decides to turn on you then what if your smartphone does so the question\nOr will the machine turn on you know we see that in movies a lot right oh yeah and we ... we knew something called reasoning from fictional evidence which says will be seen so many times in movies maybe it would really happen\nBut\nWe know these technologies can do an enormous amount of good they can they can feed the hungry and diagnosed so innocent do all of these things and I'm not sure that introducing an element of like it may turn on us a\nBit that may be more ... than they do is a lot more harm than than than good if it's ... it's very little suggest the machine would do that now through through accidents are absolutely you know you had a rocket blow up because\nThe single one was a transposed with a ... opens transposed with a zero so a lot of our systems are quite brittle and that is very true you know if you had a um you could have an airline pilot had a heart attack and that's bad for one air air airplane for people\nThank thank God you got the co pilot right\nThere you go but if you have a um if you have a computer flying a network computer flying all the airplanes in it quote has a heart attack look that\nYeah that may that may propagate through our systems maybe much ... much more brittle much one that had been made breaking big ways now that being said they haven't done that yet and and\nAnd we come you know we're better now I think uh at writing good software that we were a few years back\n[noise] what is fueling the gross in the ... and just really the incredible growth of this kind of technology\n... ... is it the human being\nThe main thing that fuels that technology is it's actually finally working\nA hey I even the term was calling to Nineteen fifty six by a man named McCarthy McCarthy and uh he got together with a few of the computer scientist to make sure you know we work really hard we can solve artificial intelligence and one summer [noise] ah they thought that very interesting reason which was\nNew and you know three laws of planetary motion laws magnetism laws of physics laws of electricity very few simple laws that explain everything and they hope to find that with intelligence we did\nThat being said people get excited about a a bunch of money came in everybody was disappointed funding dried up all the people you know took a nap for ten years then there was a breakthrough more funding everybody\nNeither a winter it kept going well now for the first time\nIn space up his face up to space up his face up to space it's delivering the goods it it can it if you out of business you can make probably any department in your business ten ... ten percent better ten percent more profitable\nOr it can it can do all of these things you couldn't do before and so we're never going to have another one of those yeah winters we now have the technology that we know how to do some cool things if there were no more advanced ... and I ah we probably have twenty five years worth of stuff just to apply what we know today\nTo the world but of course we're going to have you know more dense is a ... they come to light speed almost\nJust amazing now we ever have a series of artificial intelligence soldiers by the millions sending them into warfare in battle\nThat's a fantastic question um\nArtificial intelligence the simplest definition is it's a system that response to its environment so land mine is kind of artificial intelligence if it were a program that is if something weighs more than fifty pounds explode that's a very rudimentary\nVery rudimentary a A R if somebody came out with a landmine just hypothetically that said ah there's a camera and it can make sure it's somebody wearing a petite ... or carrying a gun mhm\nAnd then it blows up you would say well that's that's that's better isn't it and then if you say well it can also sniff for gun powder and you know it can do for other things to make sure it's blowing up the right person you say well that's better I guess that's better right\nAnd you you eventually get your way all the way up to um if you could have ... to to an artificial intelligence that fights wars and instead of people um\nThere there is a quote debate about whether we're gonna make autonomy Skilling systems I think it's disingenuous the debate is I personally think it's disingenuous I think you've got twelve or Thirteen countries that are ... that have significant military budget sitter spending money on these systems and no one of them can say\nYou know I let the other guys all habit but I'm not going to do it I just don't think that's going to happen or the south Koreans came out with the forty million dollar automatic Gunter it that\nCould could shoot people at a distance automatically and it it's required by law to say you know leave before I shoot\n'em and it now requires a person to approve it's tiring but originally it didn't uh\nThey only put that in because people requested it and show or it could easily be turned off so even if you make decisions that require people to make decisions\nYou can always disabled them so I think it's inevitable that we're going to for better or worse whatever you think there were going to build a a weapon systems it's good to have it\nWell for for three very easy reasons you could argue that ah\nThey're they're better they're more effective it their mission and there'll be less collateral damage and wherever they are you then argue that you will be saving lives of soldiers ... or ... and ... and whatever country you are\nAnd and and third you know they will they will work and be effective and probably cost effective will enable unfortunate elite alone were the political cost of going to war which uh is is not not necessarily a good thing\nWell it may not be a good thing but in the long run if we don't do it some other country will\nUh absolutely absolutely I'm just saying that\nIt isn't necessarily good for all nations to feel like oh well it's just these weapons systems fighting each other it doesn't really matter and and that you know ... has no cost a then perhaps it's entered into more rationally\nI mean I Do you see the day though by run that you know we're coming up to the top of the hour or so we'll we'll finish up when we come back next hour but you know we've got drones delivering packages were talking about artificial cars with driverless cars do you see the day that you know all the entire\nPost office system will be done because they'll deliver and with\nArtificial male people for example\nThink about that will be back\nTo find out where George ... speaking go to the ... school down to the bottom and click your calendar\nIf you're sick and tired of being sick and tired please check out the free health audio those videos and articles at critical Health News dot com\nOr call one eight five five nine for nine radio that's one eight five five nine for nine seven two three four\n[noise]\n\n\nWelcome back by Ron reached with a survivor and do you think technology will ever replace postal people who deliver the mail to our houses\n[noise] you know um I I had a feeling that any job at a machine can do we really walk but she used to do it I mean 'cause the machine can do a job\nMake a human do that job there's a word for that that's called the humanizing mhm because if\nIf you just use a person for his stand in\nFor a machine than you are saying nothing about you that makes us human are we interested in really need you to be a machine that we invented\nA is delivering the mail or or delivering packages something like that I could imagine a machine that did it I could imagine a machine that washes windows I can imagine young machine that automatically most my yard and so I think by definition we kind of want to get machines to do those things that\nYou know but but if you take a step back these technologies\nThis country for two hundred and fifty years has ... has had unemployment between five and ten percent all the time except the depression which wasn't caused by technology five to ten percent but but I think the half life of the job is fifty years I think every fifty years half of the jobs vanished\nAnd so you have to say how have we had full employment\nNew technology ... years right and we had rising wages and because so why are\nWe able to do it it's we're able to do it because a new piece of technology comes out and everybody sees as it and says I'm going to use this to increase my own productivity so whatever if you can self driving cars you're going to have people who offered to ride around in the car and give you a tour of their city if you are I mean like\nIt's hard it's hard necessarily for us to see all the things that are going to happen anymore than if it went back twenty five years and said somebody hey in the future\nYou know there's gonna be the sweat thing and billions of people are gonna use it what do you think there's going to do the jobs you could've seen all the jobs that were gonna vanish she would say well that's going to be hard on the travel agents and the stockbrokers on the yellow pages of newspapers [noise]\nUm but you wouldn't have seen any of the things that got created you wouldn't have seen ... you wouldn't have seen at sea air B. and B. Hooper\nA Google Amazon you wouldn't have seen any of the million companies that were made so that these technologies are the same way you it's easy to say that jobs going to go away it's hard to see the better job that's created and what happens is\nEverybody every time technology makes a great new job and destroys bad job everybody kind of ships up one level\nIf you had a robot that was a waiter and delivered food to you you get a tip that I'm not\nI don't I hear the waiter wonder why I don't I don't think a robot can do a what a waiter can do you know they use bill a drink you know the robot can't a clean it up that would take you know tons of programming\nDo you have a special order you want you want to send your food back there was something you didn't like about it you have a question about where the radishes were I mean there are so many things it's funny we we we have every human on this planet has ten thousand skills then thousand things you can do\nAnd then we have this vision that if you can do those ten thousand things and you can do estate planning than your high skilled otherwise you're low skilled but in reality every human being is incredibly high skilled we don't have robots they can\nThey can do what a two year old can do let alone and an adult yeah so\nWell the correct correct but it's proved very difficult like right now I heard somebody say if there was ever a robot uprising just wait Fifteen minutes all their batteries there'll be dead 'cause we can't even you know make batteries that the power these things for very long so right now heads down and and I think for for decades to come\nA people aren't going to you're not going to make machines that had the same range of movement generally going to have a robot electrician who comes in and look at your house over and figure out where to punch your wall out to run the wires it's just way beyond\nYou know when I called my airline of choice and it tells me you know say your number I Am happy when it gets started right when it doesn't get a an agent ate all mixed up so that's kind of wherever that I'm not like you said that oh you know yet um\nAnd that's and that's a big yet because one day at the progression we're going we're going to get there\nWell with physical robots maybe that's true it's an open question on intelligence it's an open question whether a computer can be creative with a computer and\nIt may be that that you have to experience the world in order to do a lot of the things we have and it's it's unclear that computers will be able to do it I ... let me let me say a real quick thing about our brains you know we have these brains that we don't really understand and then we had these mines which is kind of all the things the brain does that we\nCan't really explain like I have a sense of humor you know your liver doesn't have a sense of humor but some of your brain does\nAnd then we have consciousness and people think we don't understand the brain because there's just so stinking so many neurons but people have spent Twenty years working on something called the open worm project\nTo try to take this little worm he's got three hundred and two neurons in his brain they spent Twenty years trying to modeled out of the computer just take a worm that lives in the computer with a brain that three hundred new neurons and even among the people have been working on it they're not even sure it's possible\nSo there are so many we we're so spectacularly\nAmazing uh beings that that\nTo duplicate what we do with the machine is you know ... one leading a researcher said worrying about those kinds of things it's like worrying about overpopulation on Mars yeah maybe some day we'll have to worry about overpopulation of Mars but it's like that far out\nSo you call your book the fourth age because you believe we've had three ages week already going way back but tell me about this\nSo we learned this trick humans did which is technology which is multiplying what we were able to do and and we've used it to overcome scarcity\nBecause for all of human history there's just never been enough of the good stuff never enough food and medicine never enough of any of the good stuff but we learned this trick technology and sometimes we learned something so\nBig and knew that it just changed their productivity of humanity forever and the first of these was a hundred thousand years ago I think it was language that's this thing we do where we coordinate action about what it means is it you know twelve humans working together you know man of was a match for us anymore 'cause\n'cause we could all communicate and the man it's couldn't um then the second one I think is when we got agriculture and that actually wasn't the big deal because agriculture give us the city and the density gave us a division of labor\nAnd the division of labor says you know you specialize I specialize and we're all better off because of it so agriculture indirectly gave us prosperity and that changed everything we have prosperity\nAnd then the third time things changed I think was five thousand years ago when we got two technologies coincidentally at the same moment\nWe got the wheel and we got writing\nAnd when those two things happened are you in the end of the nation state and that's why I dozen years ago you can kind of set your clock by it all over the world\nA giants civilizations emerge ... Mesopotamia missile America and just go all over the world and so I Do think\nThat um that\nArtificial intelligence and robots are another thing of that magnitude\nIf you if you actually can take human thought and put it in a machine and human action and put it in a machine and and and multiply us both you know we're number one on this planet because we are the smartest thing on it imagine if you can just make us a whole lot smarter huh I don't I Can't predict what that's going to what's that's going to do but it's going to be a big one\nWell we know for example that machines called 'em robots or revolutionize the automobile industry with mass production I mean they they did things faster than humans can I'm coming from St Louis I've been in in in ...\nWell she factory and I see how they bottle beer or by the thousands in the bottles humans can't do it that fast or\nYou're ... you're right that is one of the fish will intelligent hid it is to be frightening if if you saw if you were a skilled crafts person and you saw unskilled people making more stuff better and cheaper than you like how purifying once that and yet we don't look back and said that was a bad thing do we\nKnow not at all not at all and has displaced workers probably you can't have a million workers are filling up bottles by hand\nThey did catch on right blockbuster on another one\nExactly what you're drunk I agree with you we're we're going to have to work that out and and you know where where in search early days but uh but yeah there's going to obviously have to be some kind of like customs is gonna be laws is going to have to be all kinds of stuff we don't up because uh that's a very real\nWalking on a boat\nYou know I I kind of\nHope so I I don't know that I Would say a blanket thing for for every single person on the planet like 'cause you can just ...\nCareers that you you can't like the electrician or a ballet dancer or anything that requires a psychiatrist or anything that requires a good teacher requires you to be president in any in any way but for people who are the permission industry then yeah it was just\nThere was a series of commercials on I don't know if you remember the nineties that someday you will you know should the box from the beach someday you will and all of the things in those commercials\nKind of thing the only thing that really stay with us by run your just come back and take some calls in a final trap next on coast to coast am\nThe coast website is no streamline for mobile devices Greek news if your ... soup we want to enjoy our website on your boom visit coast to coast am dot com on your iPhone or Android ...

GDP did kill off a default would just like he thought so why are we still working all these hours and what it turns out is that if you want to live the way somebody lived in Nineteen thirty\nNo air conditioning six hundred square feet no medical insurance no higher education vacation grow your own food make your own clothes you worked Fifteen hours a week and live\nLike you did in Nineteen thirty or ... people decided they wanted more and so there is no limit to human ... turns out so even in the future of people are going to say I'm going to stay late at the fusion reactor 'cause I Want you know the the same flying cars that the neighbor has a so\nWe're not completely materialistic interestingly ... the time we save at home but not hauling water up from the well and not run washing her clothes at the river we turn that into hobbies but it turns out we've always worked forty hours\nA week if if if our productivity goes up we just work more to get more and we always talk at the time we save at home I'm with labor saving devices\nWhere do you see this fifty years from now by this technology\nUm\nI I think that question I ask earlier which is you know if you can imagine a machine doing a job I think we will have machines doing the kinds of jobs you can imagine a machine doing you just start looking around you and say you know who to machine\nA fix my road probably go to machine teach kindergarten probably not a ... would we wanted to and so I think machines will be doing almost anything that you can imagine a machine doing that doesn't require unique human ability\nBarber in Los Angeles ... go ahead\n... faith than than being a wife hand now you can pay for and and ... ... ... ... ... cat and ...\nAnd ... than fat and women and ... and ... it gets half

done that since landmines wheat crop would drop dumb bombs uh I mean the nature of warfare is we build machines that they kill\nA so I didn't mean to say\nThat uh that we that we don't do that\nWe've always done that we build machines that\nThat we push a button and we don't know who's going to die or the debate that is allegedly going on is whether are we going to make more advanced systems that operate completely economists say that you can just\nRelease in an area and they will go and decide that's a non combat vets combative I'll kill them and so forth a it's a subtle distinctions but bart I agree with you\nBefore the age smart robots conscious computers in the future of humanity where do you get the book Myron\nWherever find books\nAre sold I think is the expression Amazon dot com Barnes and noble or is it by ... dot com and there'll be a lot of links\nTo what do you see is the most dramatic change coming for us through artificial intelligence what's going out\nTo their e simple things one uh individual worldwide average income per capita\nFor the last two thousand years or if you look at it for Seventeen hundred and fifty years from say the birth of Christ Seventeen fifty nothing happened flat if you look studying seventeenth fifty is shot up like a rocket um\nWhy because we learned how to system because the acquisition of knowledge we made the scientific method and there's no limit to where that line is going to go so vast amounts of wealth created a eliminating poverty and then the second thing I think will happen is all purely technical problems like disease and hunger you\nWill live to see the end up I Know that sounds like a I'm dreaming all kinds of people said it would be possible but um you know this country the United states already Throws Away enough food to feed all the hungry people\nIn the world no of course you know that the world strains to feed them or we just need to get a little better at it\nWell and I hope we do solve all these kinds of illnesses and diseases that wouldn't be dramatic more to come on coast to coast as we talk about the ghost photographer next you\nKnow you can get updates and connect with other coast

photographer Julie we're going to have some fun with this one tonight\nOh we are George we are\nAnd welcome to the show and I hit the James Cameron on a year and a half ago talking about some of his work and do you want a genius that guy is\nAnd you know I Will tell you a gym is a good man to me is a good man I I have\nSome great stories about him where he is just allowed me into um like the the theater where they record all the music and he said Julie stand here this is where the director stands in may you know it's the best place to here to get every beat and I'm like oh I Love this guy\nYou couldn't agree background by the way\nI have an end or are you talking about my hillbilly roots in Oklahoma\nTalking about my day job your day job we haven't gotten the Oklahoma new Bill Bill we do [laughter]\nI Do I have a fabulous job\nI knew how did you end up in Los Angeles sounded the truck work for you\nUm you know I think it was a slow escape from Oklahoma and I made it to Texas first and then made my way to San Francisco and then maybe the way down to Los Angeles\nAnd here you are and here I Am talking to you\nWriting stories about ghosts and interesting things\nRight isn't that the craziest title who calls their book that goes for target for\nWhat some of your peers said about the fact that I mean here you are you were corporate executives doing some ... work and now you're writing a story about to ... talk for\n[noise] you do this it's it's a ... is a great question I I think because what I Do day in day out is rooted and data\nAnd and I'm and I'm now ... you know within the organization is being in a very direct honest kind of person that when I started telling these stories\nAnd they couldn't help but believe even if they were kind of on the fence because they're like way you would make this up you know you're the you're the nerd we wouldn't be stuff and you know and I would say Ninety nine point nine percent of the people um have kind of gone with me on the journey\nUm I I think that's a very small you know\nPoint zero one percent\nUm you know they they just they can't make their way over right to our mind that's right um\nBut I'll tell you at least half if not more than half the people that when I started telling them one of my stories they could they interrupt me fast enough to tell me there's [noise]\nAnd I realized you know during this time that I was kind of thinking about you know put it writing it all down like oh my gosh people don't want to come out about this like there in the closet they're afraid to tell these stories because they're afraid that they're going to sound like they're crazy\nWhich is one of the reasons I actually wanted to write the book was so you know people could feel liberated to just to tell their they'll talk about their experiences 'cause\nThere's so many people have had him and I also wanted them to you know I wanted to write it so people also will believe in themselves and believe that it's actually happened and not you know their their brain playing tricks on them or something\nWell what's so amazing to is that the people are all into this and like you said not a lot of um admit it but once they feel comfortable with you or somebody who is going through the same thing they open up\nOh my gosh they talk your ear off and you know just just for your listeners then because I Am a nerd you mind if I roll through just a couple of stats for them yeah go ahead\nBecause I you know when this started happening to me um I didn't know a lot about it you know I didn't understand\nUm a lot about what really anything about goes photography a little bit of that medium ship just you know some of the things in a little bit about but I started um I started researching and there is a Harris Poll um that says that between forty and forty five percent of Americans believe and go so we're almost the majority\nAttorneys were barely a minority and that's grown I bet and\nAnd you know what I think it was done maybe three years ago four years ago something like that\nWould be over fifty percent\nI I Would think so and the second is that um I worked with my friends I'm at Google um to get this\nAnd every two seconds to say it again for everybody every two seconds someone in North America is Googling the word ghost that are saying yes every two seconds so\nNone of us are alone I think everybody knows they're not alone because of you who is his listening um but they can also now use them statistics that tell their friends hey either way I barely a minority and I'm probably a majority now\nYou have nothing to hide\nAnd you have nothing to hide\n... started for you because of a personal situation\nYes totally did did you know just\nThis started from me I'm I'm I mean the book really is a journey and develop transformational Journey Through grief [noise]\nUm I lost my mother to all timers are and you know I I you you're not only deal with the the eight to ten years prior to it because it's a very it's a painful disease for everyone um and when she passed I was devastated I was broken she I was her person in this world\nAnd not long after she passed I started seeing ghosts and photograph\nAnd at first it scared the heck out of me um I actually want to I'd open a like a ghost portal because you know I Do live in the world of movies so everything in my life I think about tends to get exaggerated when it's like oh my gosh it goes world holder guys what am I done\n'em and and then I started the aging you know the house the perimeter everything um and kept taking photographs and I now have a crazy collection of nine thousand photographs of\nDo you have been doing sham me things what kind of camera [laughter]\nAnd I found\nA used and what a great ad by the way right shouldn't apple say have an ad that says shot on an iPhone and have scroll through a bunch of pictures of ghost [noise]\nUm it was an iPhone I I ... at one point and and the journey I bought a real cameras like Sam son Kamron outta found but like a regular camera\nAnd it was interesting because all I captured on that um we're ... not that ... you know aren't important in special in our ecosystem but I wasn't getting everything else it's interesting\nYou know when this was going on for the entire journey looks looks good into your mother's situation and the old timers but how did that really gets you going\n[noise] how did you I'm Sorry so you mean get me going through this year I mean how did I start to heal from that you\nStarted investigating these strange things\nYeah I Am you know I I was I'm very lucky I um have found some phenomenal\nAh women actually in this world that are incredible psychics and they were like my psychic sherpas through this and you know how how make me understand that I was an absolutely crazy and then I wasn't running up and down the streets the Sherman Oaks screaming\nAnd you know hide your kids had your wife got ghost in the neighborhood and um so\nSo I had some guides I ... you know that that we're helping me understand it and an album investigated and um\nI I started you know the ... after I saw the first coast and a photograph I um you know I kind of panic was intrigued because I I got to be honest with you George I was a little bit of a skeptic before a skeptic as in it's not true\nA skeptic that you want to know\nRight right I it it was a navy this can't possibly be true kind of person but you know I was like really\nReally take pictures of goes um so I you know I I read a lot I investigated I talked I I I mean I I think I did what any but he would do is just trying to understand what was happening and you know I I think\nLooking at the underlying aspect of it is I I I think when people are in grief and people are experiencing grief\nI'm wearing chaos and when you're in\nChaos um you're able to open up and shed would ever rigidity or get over yourself or get over it

I'm going to but I Am on a benefit around\nYou sure and the big lesson gift\nIs about paying attention people say what's your book about and I feel I can tell you a lot of things that the number of them and to tell you the pay attention\nAnd trust yourself when you take your picture ... mhm are you aiming at something or does it just tapping\nIt's so I learned early when I started staging everything one day I set the stage pot down and I started taking pictures of the snow because it was an ad and all burned out yet\nAnd um what I learned was that smoke has like a canvas forgot\nI was able to see them clearly and the smoke and they would like kind of pull the smoke around them like the the shape or form\nAnd without the smoke they were not there you could not see them\nAnd without the smoke I could still see goes but not as clearly and easily and as reliable as what the fuck\nWith amazing gift you have still with us Julie we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and

know if you subscribe to the idea that we're spirit having a human experience\nThat when we sleep it's our physical body that needs to sleep not our spirit spirit goes off and parties in the actual space on so many people have talked about the actual planes\nAnd you know when our spirit is getting ready to land back into our body I think what happens is that it doesn't fully land and there's like this little space and I think it's a little space before it lands properly and you are a line\nOn is when this can happen again it's just a theory\nIt's a pretty good it's not terrible so I

anybody tries to if if there's any darkness\nThat is trying to scare you they're gonna find that thing that triggers you right there and find that deep dark thing they're going to find who is the antagonism this person's life and mine is my accept that and and he brought that up and Alex didn't didn't even know about my accepted didn't even know his name\nWhen all this was happening [laughter]
