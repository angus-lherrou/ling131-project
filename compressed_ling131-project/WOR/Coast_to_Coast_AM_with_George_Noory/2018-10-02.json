on love relationship creative artistry social activities money money management and things like that\nMark why does it feel like this year has gone by so darn sure that\nIt does feel that way um well you know part of it\nMight be as well as one of the things\nThat is happening this is definitely you know how the media is always there they're they're amazed because of what's happening with with the president with the tweeting and all the information and so from the political realm it when people like yourself or myself people who are you know tuning into news reports and need to do it for work\nOne of the things that's so weird there's so many events are happening much more so that they're being reported like Lincoln these split hour after hour and I think that you know people are tired of it and they're exhausted and then we've had like this whole thing about\nSocial networking we're you know millions of people like their their passwords here and there and so it's kind of like a revolution every single day somewhere\nAnd I think that that's making the time go a little faster or maybe we want to make make it go faster to get away from some of the ... the weird problem\nCan you chart out asking logically I Know you were with me I'm back in July and you're always popping in on New Year's day with us right can you check out you know charge the rush to the year for someone in the beginning of the year\n[noise] [noise] yeah well it's an interesting thing New Years in particular is very powerful I mean you could even do today it's October one\nAnd you could in general I mean these things are not usually done you can take a look at the whole month of November by looking at the same midnight in in the nation's capital here or wherever the capital is of a particular country and do a truck for that moment no the big one is New Year's at midnight all around the world because\nSo everybody well yeah and what's interesting is at midnight everywhere around the world\nLever is always a rising and the son of a Capricorn at the bottom of the chart because it's midnight and so there you have to feed and all the other planets like for instance midnight\nNew Year's coming up on two thousand Nineteen the sun and Saturn are coming into a conjunction and Mars is going to enter its home sign of areas which doesn't actually look all that wonderful for the planet\nBecause Mars the traditional positive war will go into its own fine actually laid on December thirty one\nAnd then the son of Saturn are together now there can be positive things like maybe for sports with with Mars and um exercise and engineering and different kinds of projects that are more martial but somewhat Saturn at the beginning of year is often you know too many frustrations law to block coming in\nBut I guess it's going to be a testing year two thousand Nineteen for the world\nWhy does it work mark why does astrology war okay\nBecause here's what's happening it isn't that the planets were throwing down raise this was what the old idea\nExactly what and why scientists would say you believe in that foolishness of pseudo science mumbo jumbo\nIt inside of us okay so in other words\nIf everything depends on something being born at a moment of time like with the person the baby it's when you take your first breath it's not coming out of the womb\nIf the look of course still tight it's when that's why you know we've got to make the baby cry to make sure we know that it's free they taking in the first spread like the declaration of independence is usually used to leave America's Choice because it was our first\nBreath where we're seeing it gets wedding when we're independent of you were being born okay this is our beginning now not every astrologer works with that choice but most of them do [noise]\nSo the reason it works is that wherever the sun is the moon and the various planet it's not that they're making things happen from outer space it's that whatever is born a person\nA president take an oath of office you buy a new car you get a new job you do if you have the time\nUh that that happens you put everything into the horoscope and then you can attempt to interpret what is that saying about the potential of my work at this job being the president of the United states or baby being born\nOr with mark Lerner the astrologers ... the new one great bear enterprises dot com we've got linked up for U.S Coast to coast am dot com when we come back in the moment we will take your phone calls and he'll do some personal astrological readings for you what do you need from people mark when they call you\nWill fundamentally month day in your birth if they know the time we can try and put that in and or wherever they were born\nDoes the time they get more accurate yeah are you\nWell look I could if somebody said to me I Know when I'm bored ... you know what I don't have the time I Know the town or city actually month thing here I could do anything for that person not as exactly moving\nDo it because timing allows us all kinds of things the sunrise birth is is it near noon is a ton said is it\nA midnight we're or the planets falling at that point because in twenty four hours most of the pilots are gonna be in the ... they're going to be in the same science but the moon can change a lot and twenty four hours it can go half of the time\nAnd so the moon has a lot to do with our instincts are moods even reincarnation and looking back who may have been the qualities were bringing in this lifetime moon has a lot to do with

radio surgery might be better than do forming surgery or endless chemo that's the motivation for me educating and fighting for the patient in need radio surgery proven over decades for you Dr Lederman for new or a current cancers most anywhere in the body\nCalled Dr Lederman two and two choices at thirty minutes before Broadway at thirty eight accepting most insurances Medicare and Medicaid for new or a current cancer treatment\nCalled Dr Lederman two and two choices two and two choices\n[noise] New York's most losses sauce they rated number\nDot com or download free [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd Jordan already back could you hear more Lerner the astrologer with us mark how long would it take so much to study astrology if they wanted to become an astrologer\nWill I okay it took me one year it was kind of like my graduate school where I was twenty two I was studying metaphysics people like Rudolph Steiner\nGeorge grungy of a a spent ski ... the Alice Bailey teachings and so on\n'em and I found my mentor Dane where you are who was one of the great astrologers of twenty century and he had studied not just the strategy but philosophy psychology and metaphysics of sauce so I read all of his books and kind of memorized everything and the reason which if their students out there\nUh the planet mercury which rules mind thinking communication at the time of his birth and Pisces was exactly at the same spot where mine was and I knew what his chart was and when I started reading this book that you asked me about psychic was as if I could hear his voice\nIn my head because we were born at the time with with the planet mercury which is very powerful and often underrated was on the same spot but any rate I took it for a whole year and then I started doing some consultation work in New York City\nAnd but the point is people need quite a number of years to get really good and they've really got to study much more than just an astrology charts they ... they have to learn what's called transits of regressions with a plan to keep moving on different levels and be able to do that for their clients\nSince you since you've been doing this and what was it that got you interested in it and then something happened\nUm I started going medical uh to Columbia University my dad had been doctor he got sick at one point I didn't know what it was going to do I could have\nStudied medicine in college at Michigan State I didn't do it I was into ah all kinds of things like social science and he got ill and I thought well maybe I'll take chemistry physics I'll take all the prerequisites I went to Columbia University [noise]\nUh this is part of the psychic weird thing that you asked me about so it's the first date or the first day of chemistry class I'm living in the borough of queens where Donald Trump was born I go home and just before getting home ice stopping a bookstore and I find my first astrology book which I mentioned to before astrology the space age science\nAnd it's all about people like Isaac Newton Galileo ... all of these great physicist and all these people that studied\nA more of astronomy telescopes ballet or and so on they were all ... but when the biographers would write about the is fantastic people they'd say oh by the way they had one fault they were all went to the\nPhony thing of astrology because the the biographers just thought it was foolish and wasteful and they couldn't understand you know why why was the greatest scientists before noon sir Isaac Newton studying astrology\nYou know how could that possibly be what what's wrong with a guy\nWell what they didn't realize is who is a science was taught in the University of Europe a thousand years ago and it goes way back to all these great ... nations Persia Egypt Rome ... you know all over the world the ancient world and it was even taught in the universe is if you're up\nI'm going to make your work this hour mark so let's go to the calls we will pick it up by going to Bob in New Jersey hears Bob's birth the December\nTwenty nine Nineteen fifty seven twelve twenty nine Nineteen fifty seven okay born out one forty two in the afternoon now in\nJersey City now do you when you you want to know the city they were born in or do you want to know exactly the place they were born\nWell that helps I mean just what you just said you know what I'm doing is just for people out there are not putting on my head I'm actually type it into a computer [noise] and believe it or not I'm able to sort of\nGet that information pretty quick in\nAnd you want them to ask you a question\nUm if they want I mean ah if they can say to you and say I'm interested in this era of my life and then I'll just see what I can\nTell them we're going to Bob in New Jersey Hi, Bob\nYou're\nGood welcome to the program turn your radio down a little bit okay yeah I did that you okay great you're you're on with mark learner I've given mark your birth date your time go ahead mark\nOkay well if he's if he's not asking a particular question what I can say\nUh of course this individual is born with a Capricorn son and an areas moon\nAnd tourists rising and he's born very close to a first quarter moon I'm a ... as I said earlier on the other side of the hour people don't often study their moon enough because the moon has a lot to do with who we are instinctively so with an areas moon\nComing from other lives and like instinctual early\nThis individual had a lot of assertiveness and forceful illness and kind of an aggressive personality and that's important for him to sort of live his life on a on a deep level where he he has leadership qualities developed and other allies particularly in the last life\nAnd now with the sun and Capricorn that's kind of to refine that not to be brash but the sort of\nDo things more um grounded more practically in order to sort of rise of the heights and the planet Saturn which rules Capricorn\nIs in the process of Criss crossing over this individual son so it's an extra kind of a this year and the and coming into the fall of discipline responsibility being focused and\nHe should be make sure he's strengthens his immune system and stays healthy\nThat um he doesn't become\nPessimistic about things um but he's also heading for um if he wants to develop this an another career cycle of the next several years as long as he stays healthy and focused and [noise] uh has a good attitude about things\n... do you have a question to\nUh yeah what what if I'm not healthy now [laughter] well if you're not held on now again you want to kind of like um well my feeling is that people should\nStudy things like use your intuition if need be go to a used bookstore you're you're on the show tonight there's a reason why you got on and other people didn't good on um go to our website see some of the you know read about my life the books the philosophies and so on and get into something like that philosophy metaphysics\nAstrology the power of numbers in neurology is connected to astrology as well and find something that you can kind of a steep yourself in for a while and that can make you accept inwardly excited and then maybe your health we'll get better\nThanks Bob good luck to you and everything you do would you believe in reincarnation mark\nAbsolutely and I study that longer than this and that's part of the whole psychic thing\nWe're all psychic world intuitive and we all live many lives now people are different levels so to speak I guess how it would work out of why we would see like an Einstein or gundy are different people in mother Theresa [noise]\nYou know how many times people have been around and when you study spiritual things and there was a whole field of esoteric astrology there's a whole other kind of idea like in the Casey Casey predictions I Know you've got a lot of people on we'll talk about the no ... trains and Edgar Casey\nThere's a whole sort of spiritual science about humanity being part of the solar system like we're not just on earth I mean we live in the solar system we live in the galaxy we just don't live there physically but spiritually when we're asleep\nPsychic lead people who ... who can meditate and sort of leave their bodies you know Asheville traveling that kind of thing looser dreaming where are we were somewhere else\nSo that's all part of things and definitely that there are multiple lifetimes than I Do believe very strongly that we're all spirits and souls and our incarnations like in the chart we're looking at\nLike I said the spiritual kind of genetic code of what our game plan of higher destiny is as a spirit or sold to accomplish something with the sun moon and the planets and the configuration that we have\n... reincarnation astrological you speaking you were the born the let's let's say the reincarnated person and the person before that well were they born during the same time period\nOh no no no ... ... ... there's a whole question about that kind of thing you know people might\nIn the old days I mean a lot of people thought\nPeople would reincarnate slowly like maybe once every century or once every couple of centuries or whatever it is according to the spiritual material I ever had my life [noise]\nCertain souls or spirits who are doing work like the work that you do okay light worker kind of work at this stage in twenty first century\nMike ... will come back more quickly now everything depends on getting a body from from a man and a woman being able to come into the world of north ... time to take advantage of astrological vibrations they're to me absolutely in other words the soul and spirit comes in\nAnd chooses parents and family based on family karma Dharma that kind of a thing and then you're actually choosing went to be born because there are spiritual forces angels teachers masters whoever you want to call it\nI Know you have a lot of people talk about that stuff hoard guiding and bringing in that entity and then you have your own guardian angel with you throughout your whole life I'm a firm believer and all of those things\nAre

yeah\nYeah yeah have you ever seen a human who\nGordon three of them tell me about some okay well the\nThe first um was in the summer in Nineteen fifty five now I Lived on the Chesapeake Bay the little town of Solomon's Marilyn\nAnd uh I was when I walked out into the there was a long half mile here oh a ... a bomb to the Chesapeake biological laboratory where the production early meets the Chesapeake Bay\nAnd I was sitting there late at night when I saw a larger delight heading toward me\nThere was coming from the mouth of the Chesapeake then I noticed the outline of a large ditched shaped object which suddenly dove into the water than rows back into the sky and headed straight for me\nAs it flew over me I saw bottom panel open and the UFO spray me with what I called in the book but tux and shower\nMany rows straight up and disappeared and frankly the things scare the hell out of me and then the second citing occurred on April second Nineteen fifty eight I was returning home from Baltimore because I was a student at the Peabody Conservatory of music\nWhen I saw a large white light hovering over a barn\nAnd a few minutes later began blinking on and off and following my car for most of the remaining miles Solomon's oh and then it stopped and whole Harvard over another barn than a minute or so later started to perform some fantastic maneuvers\nIn an instant it appeared in one end of the sky than a split second later it would appear at the other hand\nIt does it did this for about half a dozen or so times\nThen stop and then suddenly I saw a brilliant large red light that came out of the sky and merged with the larger light at this point in my car radio admitted allowed screeching Sam as I approached the protection wherever the light cross the river headed headed south and disappeared and then\nUh that same that same year on November twenty Nineteen fifty eight I was standing outside my father's oyster house that faced\nA river at about five o'clock when I saw a a a rich history of light hanging over the river\nAnd there were about Fifteen other coworkers with a name we pray slender shake are shaped objects that we're moving slowly over the river to St Mary's county on the opposite side that are for much larger object to coach it came to come out of nowhere and it dwarfs the other three UFOs\nAs we watched the large out began expanding from both ends at once\nAnd it quickly rose up into the sky at an estimated what I estimate of about a twenty thousand feet outlet to then they changed to a silver a desk and disappeared a tremendous speed and the other obvious solitude and I had all these reports and they're not cap and\nShe saw like now that they're a very unfair\nNineteen fifty eight we didn't have any aircraft that could do that that's
