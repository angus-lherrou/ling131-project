and I almost exactly three nights ago George a gentleman who describes himself as a professional a truck driver and Christian minister both\nWas driving a about eleven thirty five pm he's driving north and his home town of West ranch went to his great amazement he saw a huge fireball come straight down out of the northern sky\nDescending vertically estimates that it was about the size of a full moon and the night sky pretty sizable\nAnd the interesting thing about this there's several things about it it had no tail and no ... no fragments from it\nAnd it had a bluish green glow coming from the bottom of it a very interesting report just a few minutes ago I checked the American media society to see if they had recorded a meteor site in there and\nI cannot find one for the same time and date location so this must have been a very interesting site in those mice as my suspicion [noise]\nThree and a half hours later in Winston Salem North Carolina gentleman walked out on a balcony to have a smoke\nAnd he became aware of the fact that something was directly above his head he looked up and he estimates not more than fifty or a hundred feet above him\nThere was a triangular crowd with orange and red lights on the trail a an edge of it and they flashing he could see you later on in the site in a flashing bright red light\nOn the a dorsal surface of the object\nVery interesting sighting after the first object he saw moved to the east towards Winston Salem reports\nHe realized that there was a second one above it headed a different direction added to the north instead of east\nAnd the second or two later you realize there was a third similar looking object in the night sky or make that the morning sky this was six o five am on Tuesday of this week the twenty third of October\nVery interesting report and he's provided for a very nice illustrations that are posted to our website\nThe third report comes from Rockford, Illinois a woman reports that\nYesterday morning at six thirty seven AM she was driving to work she says she was going north on Ninety I think she was going west because the moon was in front of her she reports\nShe saw a rectangular object allegedly pass across the face of the moon very interesting she her citing lasted only five or ten seconds but I gave her enough time she says to get a good look at the object\nFinal report I'd like to share George comes from coated in Nebraska\nIs on the interstate eighty used to have a north Platte\nNebraska a gentleman was a report that he was standing out side looking at a clear night sky look into the northeast like the first report a ball of white light came down out of the north the sky it apparently surprised him considerably\nIts streak toward Jim is made he estimates a Ninety degree turn to the west ... street to the west he estimates a thousand miles an hour although it's very difficult death and made the actual speed of an object in the night sky\nAnd it suddenly turned down and disappeared from his site behind a building so a lot going on and all that the last report I've shared here are posted to our website\nTalk to you next week Peter have agreed Halloween my

June ... good way out there but they had ... narrow down the focus so\nHe deliberately going on November first to start another surge because the new calculations predict that planet nine is close to a constellation that can only be seen by American eyes in the winter here now from the California\nInstitute of technology's planetary sciences department in Pasadena, California is astronomy\nProfessor Michael Brown\nOr predictions are that the planet is in the region of the sky\nClose to the constellation Orion which is one that everybody knows the constellation of Orion is a winter constellation that's when it's up in the sky that's when you can observe it most to we have to wait until the constellations up until the winter before we can start looking to where we think it is\nAnd in November what date will you start to remember first\nThat's not very far away what frequencies will you be looking in\nThe best way to search for this is actually just a visible wavelengths just like your eyes because so far as the brightest part do we think it's going to have is just the sunlight reflected off of its upper atmosphere and so we're just going to look right what you would see just taking pictures with ... what about him for rent\nAnd fruit is actually is not going to be a very good one for searching simply because\nWe don't have any telescopes which really massive infrared detectors that can look at big areas of the sky at once once we find planet no and looking at it in the in for a study of will be very important but it's not probably the best way to look for\nYou isn't it amazing that all of this impact on the solar system perturbations and even tilting the playing of the solar system six degrees to the sun that he would be caused by an object out in the ... cloud that we can't even yet\nI think it's pretty fun to think about it we just don't know where to look yet it'll be easy to see once we know exactly where it looks I suspect and then once we see it then we will study it in detail was probably you know every large telescope on the earth will suddenly ... direction so it will be quite exciting when it's finally found\nThis new planet nine is hypothesized to be five thousand times more massive than Pluto that you've got knocked down to a dwarf planet\nYeah so it's a good reminder of the difference between things that are not real planets like ... and real planets\nSometimes people say oh this new planet nine it's just a little bit bigger than Pluto right like ... it's five thousand times more massive [noise] this is what we mean when we say planted in the other part of the solutions can\nWhen we last talked I think you had two categories where my does have come from why use this massive object all the way out to the edge of the time\nRebel going into the or cloud and you talked about possibly being captured rogue planet\nOr any ... inside of our solar system where Neptune and your interests are but then he got knocked out my Saturn or Jupiter what do you think today\nI still favor the explanation that it came from inside our solar system and got knocked out by Jupiter Saturn but in ... when we find it and know exactly what its orbit isn't exactly what its composition of all of this is just speculation\nYou can probably come up with many different ideas to explain how I got there but\nOnce you find it I Hope will really start to learn why it's there and what it's made out of\nYou been living with just now for three years do you have any organ intuitive sense of what you could look like\nMy best guess is that it will look sort of like Neptune\nWe think it's a Neptune like planets just a little bit less massive than Neptune and so it will be a gaseous atmosphere it probably won't have ... it's\nProbably too cold to have any clouds up in the atmosphere so in fact it might be quite bland\nA mostly just kind of grayish white atmosphere with no features in it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be things about it that we never even thought about that are completely surprising\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think it's about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it at something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good ways out there\nAnd he is that a quarter of a light year oh no it's not even close to a quarter lightly it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light days from earth is that the border between the ... rebels and the or clout\nMy partner and all this is always much more pessimistic and so you know what you should take my optimism with a grain of salt and then take his pessimist than with a grain of salt he thinks it will take us another ten years I think it will take us one year so maybe that means still another three years but I'm Still very optimistic\nThat there you have it during an right from the man is covered in terms of those ... and a half a dozen bodies that are all kinds of gathered together at where the guy prevailed in\nA cloud in that area and I think one of the most important part of doing the research project with the scientists that I\nHad no confusion about the fact that if there was something massive that we're\nTrying to move into our solar system what it's called the inner solar system from a mercury\nAside and mercury out to wear a now and then you're on a star because uh been dumbed down to a dwarf planet out in the hype about\nThat there's nothing that could be out coming this way and Matt that wouldn't be picked up by everyone everywhere because gravity that that's the thing about gravity in math and it\nIt would have impact on every single thing and\nThat's the way I would've loved those ... been alive to talk with the professor I Wonder if he would have been able to convince him about that the bureau\nWell I don't know how much time we have left but I can start my own work that I had a discussion\nThat faith I I Would say is that right yeah and maybe what I'll do that for conversations that lend it because it's really quite a story\nOkay we can do that too but it's a great story and it's really exciting\nThat even if\nShe doesn't agree in some of the theories that are out there the fact that there's this extra planted out there does echo what some of these people have said long before anybody even knew about this stuff\nWell the idea that that could be a massive plan it but when you read like say about the ... through scholar I mean the translation that were carved in\nTime and you look at the carving from one thing that just

events can become as often as every other year and so there's really extreme floods extreme heat they become much more common in the future and\nCan have devastating consequences\nRight now what are computer models showing to do is have you worked on the eye BCC report\nAbout what we can expect say in North America in just the next decade because we've already reached another half degree warmer and it's projected that we may go up to do\nIt could be substantially worse than even those the stuffed with\nWhat the politics of the planet don't seem to be supporting dramatic reduction in the greenhouse gases in fact\nIt seems that some of the larger nations the United states included my adding poll now to an industry that we thought had ended\nThat we are going to be contributing ourselves to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases and accelerating the amount of warming so that we would be ourselves pushing the needle on the computer models in which there is even more rapid warming\nUnfortunately you put your finger on it my guess is that the politicians assumed that the problems will only become more severe once they're out of office\nAnd so if they are thinking of the next two to four to six years which just or most of the political offices\nThan they are assuming that they can cope with that shorter period of time and it will be somebody else's problem I ... or two decades from now\nMeanwhile we're facing the fact that there will probably be a lot of people who are going to be forced out of homes in houses and what is the United states in the world going to do with what has to be future migrations away from coastline\nCertainly there will be in fact already are places that are having to be abandoned both on the east coast right on the Alaska due to rising sea levels and that will only continue to get worse we will have an increasing number of domestic migrants\nBut it's really the developing countries where their farm or people susceptible where there are likely to be enormous numbers affected by the level rise and forced to migrate as their cities become habitable\nAnd that's really one of the things that the report highlights where you go ... of such migrants at one point five degrees\nBut you had many tens of additional climate refugees as you grow up to two degrees\nAnd that will be a problem for all the wealthy countries because naturally you want to go somewhere where there are better prospects and so I think we can expect North America and Europe and parts of Asia to see lots of migrants coming from low latitudes\nAnd in fact I think we've already been seeing in Europe that's part of the reasons for the Syrian civil war and intense drought all of the migrants that were coming up to Europe after that which led to a lot of the crises fair\nSo doesn't that mean that there could be a tremendous amount of civil strife and wars over at the migration of people away from coast\nBut this has been something that has been identified by law of American officials in the defense department and in the Central Intelligence agency\nDuring the Obama administration's climate change was considered a major threat multiplier and driver of probable future conflicts and again there's kind of a head in the same mentality has taken root now in Washington\nWhich seems to pretend that this doesn't exist but this was widely acknowledged in the defense community as we show it was ... years ago\nSo global climate change and increasing more definitely bring more wars\nYes you go ... well it it's a terrible future if we can get this under control and one of the big headline the summer of twenty Eighteen\nMillion for at home may see sea level rise flooding\nOver the next to the rest of the century and in fact it is so bad that um the forty eight continental US state for it and now has the most property at risk\nA study finds that three hundred and fifty one billion dollars worth of homes will be risking persistent title flooding the researchers say if that global warming and sea level rise does continue\nThat in more than one million properties in Florida well have chronic flooding\nAnd that when you look at the map as it is extended by computers over the rest of the\nCentury that sea level rise which is already\nOne of the big secret uh kept in Miami by the political institution there is it they get flooding constantly on full mind constantly\nFlooding on high tides they get constantly flooding all over the time and everybody who live there now is it and that political governments and Mary saying we're not going to let anybody know that we have\nFlooding in the streets of Miami nonsense\nIt got to take the bull by the horn and\nAnd as you work at the map knowing that the Arctic melt it three times faster than the computer projection well George when you look at the map of what is expected to happen\nOr the Next Fifty years and now that what happened with the Arctic was it three times faster to\nAdd water flooding let's say three times faster than the current computer that projection man that most of the southern tip of Florida will be uninhabitable and that we eat back what professor drew and saying\nThank you George [noise] you know a year ago on November aide twenty seven teen I did my first earth files YouTube channel broadcasts and since then on most Wednesday evening beginning at seven thirty PM mountain\nAnd another time zones around the country in the world I've been in my office where I'm Talking to you tonight in front of his computer to share news with\nThe general audience that is growing around the world from my work and they like uh my YouTube channel well just a three weeks ago in October third I was doing updates on three categories the first had to do with\nThe very distressing subject of have cats beheaded cats around the world bloodless weird\nAnd Scotland Yard trying to get away with announcing that it was closing down its investigations after three years because they were trying to\nForce people to believe that it was Fox is in a car road kill and that wasn't going over well with the u._k. population at all and then I was also doing an update about the sunspots solar observatory shut down I had a received a whistle blower email saying that are actually\nUh the child pornography was just funny deflection that he actually involved the Chinese infiltrate or who had hacked into the observatories computers in order to spy on the sensitive white sands missile range and all I'm an air force base\nA that's down below the solar observatories nine thousand two hundred foot peak and then the third update had evolved from my asking my earth files YouTube channel audience on September twelfth if anyone had young childhood memories of floating out of body\nSpecifically I was asking for ages four to six approximately and I had received a huge number of emails and a lot of people were saying they never told anyone this before and this is what I was\nTalking about when the next\nMorning on October fourth Laurie Moriarty who manages my are filed social media\nEmailed me that a fan saw something weird happened in the video of the a stream the live stream so I saw a video that Laurie sent me that was slowed down it was weird\nOr I sent the puzzle to a photo shop and video and also I've worked with for years\nAt first I thought maybe it was an insect was over on a ... like something coming through the window up to the top of a book show\nAnd he did a video loop that you can see right now all of this at\nA my earth files report what are the smoky fog sometimes linked to afterlife returns you can see the whole story and you can see the loop videos which are really strange and the reply that I got back from the photo shop analyst was\nThat he thinks this is truly anonymous\nAnd uh then I asked a that second week I asked my earth files YouTube channel audience if anyone had ever seen smoky fog like what was in my office and believe it or not\nA second I'm One of these whatever they are\nCame between my hands and up to my right shoulder on October seventeenth adding to the mystery of what is coming in and out of my office and uh people began writing me emails about their own experiences with the smoky\nFog is it like act applies than\nI Do not know this is the extremely a translucent and uh when I started reading the letters\nI began to see how heart felt that there were people who were telling me they had never mentioned any of this parrot to loved ones to children to parent none they but but I started receiving these emails and one\nCame from a a he had been a retired airline ticket agent and his name he gave me permission to use is Charles hazard\nAnd he uh let me say he said you can use my name and that I'm now from Sun City center Florida\nBut what you're going to hear took place in Arkansas in two thousand and eight thinking about all of this is provoked\nBy two episodes of a strange smoky fog in my office when I was working in live stream and that's what provoked him and hear now\nIs Charles hazard or talking about what happened to him in two thousand and eight from his now Sun City center Florida home\nMissed was in the spring of two thousand in age and I was preparing that morning for a group to come in the next day I was mowing the lawn care to camp area on a riding mower\nCleaning up the facility things of that nature so at the end of the day after dinner I was ready to go to bed as soon as the sun went down I was very tired\nSo after shower and I got into bed it was dark by that time I Can't remember about what time it was maybe eight thirty in the evening [noise]\nI got into bed with the poverty level my show and just lay there and looked outside the leaves on the trees were not fully out yet so I had a very good view of the night sky with stars that I can see and then suddenly I just\nI was getting ready to close my eyes and ears open them again and through the window I can see this misty ...\nBob drifting in through the window and I was just mesmerized but the thing about it was that in this dark bedroom it was luminous\nAnd I could see the light within it and it was three dimensional was swirling and slowly kept coming towards me it looked like it was coming right for my head\nAnd I was just frozen fascination of I didn't know what to think and then as it reached my forehead I could see in my mind by three dimensional lighted hire a glass passing by my field of vision\nI was mesmerized by these hiring lives and the feeling that I was getting was a feeling of euphoria and one is with this living thing that was surrounding made and then at the same moment everything was happening at the same time at the same time\nI was getting all this information that was almost like answers to questions that haven't been asked out millennia\nAnd they were all be answered at the same time like all of these answers becoming I wasn't asking the questions they were just coming to me and be answered simultaneously and I don't know why this was happening I was just going with it\nI don't even know how long this lasted it could have been just a moment but it seemed to go on forever and I didn't want it to end because of the feeling was so loving\nCan you describe the shape of the ... that you remember vividly and tried to give us an impression of what kind of information was coming to you and was it like a word voice in your head tell a possibly\nKnow there were no words there was no sound the hiring glitz we're almost like God was looking straight ahead and they were coming towards me and then going past the side of my head\nAnd I can see ... these hiring glass but they had the same texture of the fog good would shadow in life\nBut they were living minutes at the same time and they would just blow by me but kind of ...\nAt the same time like they were walking back and forth as they were passing by my head and as far as the information I was getting it was just almost like a download information that was so quick that I was not able to grasp anything\nThat was being given to me it was just a feeling that I was getting\nIt was almost like I knew every answer to every question like I was this super human genius or something that had all the answers to everything in the universe was indescribable it's really difficult to explain\nIt felt like to me it wasn't for now at that moment it was for something that was being given to me\nBut I wouldn't remember any of it afterwards but it was for some time in the future that I was supposed to recall this information because it was like it was being given to me but I couldn't decipher it\nDid you have do any sub text in your mind or your soul about who we'd be doing this and why for the future\nNo the only thing I couldn't think of was that it may because in my past experience with ever since I was a child I've had psychic dreams\nDreams of having relationships with an entity that was giving instructions I can describe the entity to as a very thin\nYes now um last night ... well it is and things keep being given they started with the\nIssue of uh I was asking people if they had had any kind of childhood out of body and the ages four to six a which is amazing to me how many people have been provoked by that\nThat seemed to overlay the appearance of whatever the white uh we'll call it foggy smokers smoky fog than his period in my office twice\nThat led to my asking for a whether people had had these kinds of foggy white stuff\nAnd that led to Charles hazard and other even mailers who are saying that they're not the only person last night\nOn my YouTube channel I had a dialogue with my audience\nAbout has anybody whether they're in a duck tape and experience or meditate or out they had any insight about water a lot of water affecting the planet between now and twenty twenty six [noise]\nAnd that was a year that had been presented to me by a real whistle blower science with that that uh he had worked on a project having to do with this exact time period between twenty Eighteen and twenty twenty six\nIn which there could be some either a natural cycle or something that is going to\nNow it's like what Charles hazard when he was saying I feel like it has to do with the rotation of the earth that there's going to be like a shift or a joke on that it would cause soon armies in tremendous amounts of flooding\nAnd I have had now several emails I'm going to be doing stories on them\nAbout exactly this kind of thing and raising the question could there be a natural strange cycle interacting with planets in our solar system that could relate to know is flood that is written about in genesis and that is how woven\nAnd a complex all seem to be going that every single question is leading to answer that people are raising more issues and scientists are all for coming forward and saying that they have information about this\nAnd so tonight if there's anybody listening on coast\nIf you are in the military government whistle blower category or human abducted category and you have any information\nAbout a huge water\nThat could end up affecting our planet\nWhere they ... up and call us with conversations with Linda which is coming up later but we've got
