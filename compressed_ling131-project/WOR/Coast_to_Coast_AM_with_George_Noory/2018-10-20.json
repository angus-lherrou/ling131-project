the bone marrow had my little dysplasia where his\nBone marrow is stopping to produce\nBlood cells well most of us don't think too much about our bone marrow because it's just there to work and for most of us so they can read cells to breathe oxygen that can white cells different factions wicked playlists to stop bleeding as working tick tock tick tock like your heart's working you don't think very much about it well you don't think very much about it until\nIt stopped working and this man it stopped working and so it's operating on less than half speed normal hemoglobin this about Fifteen sixteen and a man has him a globe and ran down to about\nEight or there was not very good treatment and sometimes these conditions even get worse well his got worse is a different kind of way a few weeks ago he started having black ... stools is\n... movements look like road tar and it said the other teaching point\nBlack ... stools usually are blood it's adjusted blood\nAnd this man Scott weak and seek a week you started having this road tires tools and he went to the doctor and he got word and he was from have a pancreas cancer\nCancer's spread to the liver and dispense cures cancer was growing up through the water which is part of the intestine just next door bleeding he was bleeding losing out\nFrom this pancreas cancer losing out from the ... with cancer spread is normal him a gold member minor normal person is about Fifteen sixteen the globe and his was down to eight because of the problem with the bone marrow and now is ... is he the globe and went down to\nFive points to him a globe and with this mess eating through the door and he's got low platelets ... low white count low have a globe and he cannot have surgery even though the cancers eating through would probably never survive because number one is in terrible condition is no reserve is no bone marrow reserve\nMost likely surgeons would cut and start bleeding and they'd start bleeding wherever they caught or touch and probably would bleed to death and for pancreas cancer is well came of chemo by itself number one came all usually causes more damage to the bone marrow and we know the chemo doesn't cure anybody with pancreas cancer\nAnd he was basically sent home for one of the super duper hospitals to diet an added no carcinoma ... pancreas getting through the door and then he came\nTo me we came to me and while we stage them up to get a PET scan of him immediately to see how extensive the cancer was and we found that it has extensive cancer\nIn different parts of the body could the worse was his cancer eating through the pancreas and the one we spoke about all the options and he asked\nMe if he could be treated immediately\nAnd we of course said yes\nAnd within a short period of time really hours he got mapped out like you're from the other patient we made a mold of his body would computerized everything in the body we map the thousands of beams to attack the cancer that the war on cancer that was eating through the test and caused him to bleed out and treated him\nAnd we treated him within hours of I'm coming to us and we did it why to help them help stop the bleeding try to

mystery of the end times finally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me this evening\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of the items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing that\nUs national security adviser John Bolton is reportedly up pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the INS for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nWell of course the Russians are suspected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven ins treaty because they have\nNot only build practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to ... fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that wave tractor cruise missile we called nine and seven to nine\nOr that has um you know not met the criteria is violated the criteria of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nThe possible renewal of twenty ten new start and you know President Trump said um you know weeks ago that perhaps we are going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow because it it should concern to solve it\nYou know that has cut back dramatically a nuclear weapons are and\nTo Fifteen hundred and fifty a deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has really cross the line to a new Cold War because the old Cold War is all about nuclear\nHolocaust and the threat posed by the Soviets in the U.S\nWe're entering a new era right now\nI Want it also dial back to September when Russia began its largest ever military exercises with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers\nOr this was a a a drill with China as a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok twenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states well it\nDoes and in fact a really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met\nAnd they're getting ready to jointly head a commission on military technology that is of course being shared a significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying\nA fighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred a surface to air missile system\nAnd the Vostok Eighteen exercises to indicate that had three hundred thousand\nA soldier's thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off the east coast of Russia\nStraight at the United states you know practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against show me a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have\nThe mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the\nNorth Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War\nWhen\nPresident Reagan had essentially vanquished\nOr when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated some might suggest that the United states was poking the bear\nAnd given their their passion\nFor for for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation\nUm coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who would suggest as perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since Peter the great\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that ... that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been allies but now here we are what are your thoughts\nKnow I think you're correct Richard we did poke 'em and of course we've continued to do that they considered\nA Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I call in the eastern part of the country and that's after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia\nAnd they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland Hungary Romania that'd be entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nAh that's something that I Know and Mr Yeltsin uh the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David\nWe had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fuel the rise of Vladimir putting\nAnd you know ... of course have captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result has really fueled\nYou should have been meeting here recently and their parents ministers

and that's why I think there are a lot of people are concerned you know the Chinese establish this year the strategic support force which she got her attention because\nIt's centralized is within the People's Liberation army the space cyber and electronic warfare capabilities\nAnd you know these are ... an organization that is run at the very highest level and basically for Strategic purposes and we're concerned that it will ah manipulate\nThe information at a strategic level that will harm our interests are not only you know interference of elections\nUm but uh certainly and jeopardize our dominance in space or satellites of course the Chinese have an anti satellite capability they're\nShooting literally for the moon and they're building a capability to put a space station up very shortly\nNow they're doing the types of things that maybe twenty Thirty years ago we as the United states we're we're talking about I'm beginning to do while they're rapidly catching up and you know this is caught our attention that's why\nYou know the president and the Pentagon\nAnd wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as\nA true competitors are near peer competitors across the board and it's not not just the military it's economic it's diplomatic\nAh it's all these other areas that show national capability and national power and we're finding that our adversaries are doing quite well thank you\nHow concerned should we be with the fact that Google arguably one of the most powerful companies in the world I knew a monopoly on the distribution of dissemination of information\nOr appears to be in bed with the government of the People's Republic of China and it's helping them\nCensor information in that country\nAnd they're manipulating algorithms so that they can monitor your own population and of course they won't negotiate any longer with the Pentagon on\nYou know those types of things um uses the cloud et cetera\nUm that that's disturbing um you know they are a U.S company and you would think that they would have some allegiance to this country and and not become a part in the hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're\nDoing I suppose to a certain degree because they see a rising Chinese economic power and they want to be part of the success of that a country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates or be the world's\nLeading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five you know somewhere around there um and\nUnless something dramatically happens in a very different way they're going to achieve that they're going to have\nThe leverage using what I outlined earlier the belt and road initiative which is pouring hundreds and billions of you know maybe a trillion and a half\nAcross the world and arguably at least sixty eight countries where they're buying infrastructure and thereby markets and they're controlling information flow you know you I either the Internet and what can be used and what can be so they're strategically doing some very bright very smart things\nUh but when you look at their autocratic regimes yeah and their president for life under President Xi and the amendment of their constitution and you're seeing something similar\nUnder putting with the possibility of ruling for a long period of time and the collaboration across all these fronts\nSharing of technologies and kind of they kind of have to love one another because uh the rest of the world doesn't seem to like them except they're holding to them because they're being bought up to a certain degree by the Chinese\nI Want to ask you\nAbout Saudi Arabia and how important it is the United states uh to maintain this alliance with a bad actor in a bad neighborhood or given of course the show he um the brutal slaying of of a ...\nUm and how that might mean there is there are dominoes at play here obviously I'm Wondering ... with what your thoughts are on how we should proceed or how the United states where the Trump Administration should proceed\nAh with with Saudi Arabia and how that plays into all of this a sort of his little Cold War scenario\nYou know it's never simple as that and the cars so sugary situation is is tragic\nYeah but if you've been watching my mom had been so solemn and you know the crown prince uh you know he's probably been cut down a few notches here recently especially with\nThe so called Davos and the the desert which he was expecting all these\nUh donors in investors to come over and pat him on the back and giving more money so we can develop a a true economy that's not based solely upon petroleum\nUm we have a lot invested in the ... the Saudis we have a lot of Americans over there are a lot of technology you they're totally dependent upon our arms that of course\nThey could go to the Chinese are Russians but they don't want to because ours typically are much better I think the big question and that part of the world one is oil\nA and and how are they going to use dollars in the future but also Iran Iran is not to be a ... with then of course their their their major adversary against the Saudis\nAnd the Russians and Chinese are all lined up with Iran and were lined up with a Riyadh a regime\nUm there were ... they they've got um you know a way of doing things uh that uh certainly in the west we're not all excited about uh but the reality is that um [noise]\nYou know a friend of my ... you know my friend you know what the expression Richard a friend of my enemy is in you know my friend or something like\nThat that the idea being that we we have to have partners in that part of the world it's a dangerous\nA game that the airplane we see that evolved over the years in Iraq we see it in Syria you know even you know vitamin ... and I would just welcome a president Sisi of Egypt up into Moscow for his fourth visit in the last couple of years and\nYou know they made big arms deals and they're talking nuclear power plant in ... ah so these sorts of issues are on the forefront if we abandon the Saudis now\nUm you know they will run into the arms of putting putting understands that uh or into the arms of cheese in\nTo a certain degree that's happening I'm you know we have to recognize and the dark side of the world\nVery bad things happen uh our our own government has been involved over the decades in very bad things we don't publicize\nA Bob sorry to interrupt and again cutting he'll pick us up on the other side Bob McGinnis alliance of evil here's\nDesmond decker\nTaking is

Decatur a destroyer\nA in the grave and reefs and the south China Sea the Chinese warship came only a few meters away from it and just in the last day we've had a couple of B. fifty twos set it flew over um you know the\nContested area and the south China Sea people need to understand that um these islets uh thirty four hundred acres that the Chinese have militarized with cruise missiles and defense weapons and [noise]\nYou know created not only harbors for their warships but also for their jet fighters and their bombers that they practice from\nThat these are claimed by the Vietnamese a Taiwanese as well as the Filipinos and there are six hundred and sixty miles or in that range south of China so this is not just\nYou know next door to them it's really in the middle of that to see but these confrontations are on the increase uh we've had a lot in the south China Sea East China sea\nThe Russians are being very provocative at sea and in the air as I indicated and of course they have their neighbors to the west are terrified to the point that the\nUh polish a prime minister is called for a given to us two billion dollars to forward station armored brigades so that they can be prepared and case uh the Russians do what they did\nA in Ukraine or Crimea or the republic of Georgia which is a concern and you mentioned the mercenaries yes\nBack in February of this year we killed a couple of hundred and it's interesting we have a a hotline with the Russian military in Syria and we called him and said are these your troops and they said no and so we've\nKilled them um and that's the nature of mercenaries but they were there to represent a the Assad regime [noise] uh and of course uh the Russians wife their hands without even though we know where they came from and what they did\nWell Syria uh obviously that looms large in any in times scenario or is it is that the most likely flash point as far as you're concerned\nAt this point it certainly is a flash point I Would argue that ah you know if you've got into phase ... thirty eight that we're really talking\nUh the the Gaga mad dog a and that mad dog could be the country of say turkey I Know it's interesting a friend of mine spoke with a\nA general now president el Sisi of Egypt who told him less than a year ago that he thought that air to one who is the current president of turkey is really a seeks to be the collie and\nTo establish a gala fat and his statements have been very very um conducive to that interpretation not only within the region but you know the release of the American pastor Brunson here recently\nAh was after great pressure we put on him a air do on a to cooperate with us but yet we find that he's traveling all over the world he was just two weeks ago in of all places Kern cologne Germany what was he doing there\nYeah he was doing a state visit but he was also dedicating a mosque\nNow that's not very typical of presidents of countries going across the world doing that sort of thing but this guy has\nA any consistently has had over the years a very ambitious\nThoughts about uh the re emergence of the Ottoman Empire he is a new Ottoman and I don't think anyone that follows him closely would dispute that so\nThese are issues Syria is\nYou know clearly something that everyone is watching have collaborating with Russians who are of course uh even though there are some friction there they are working together and of course they're working against the likes of Riyadh but they're collaborating as well with Iran who has a\nLot of forces especially crude forces there near Damascus and operating even drones threatening northern Israel so when you kind of put the picture together\nYou see the Iranians are certainly the Turks are sort of our allies\nThe Russians and the Chinese and the Chinese Yasser ... beginning to show up and even Syria\nHoping to kind of look their chops and and put together that country wants a declaration of peace can be found and they can find a political solution so a lot of players here are confused battlefield uh but I clearly see Syria as part of this\nA long term agenda\nEven care to one and and I wanted to ask you about turkey did they belong in NATO even at this point\nYou know it's a fair question I don't think so my concern would be one you know if you go back to O. three we tried to put our fourth division through turkey into northern Iraq through ... to attack\nSaddam you know a good ally would've allowed that to happen of course had her ... her to one didn't want that to happen they blocked us and we ended up having to take all those troops to who was up to the Gulf into Kuwait\nUm air to one is not being are cooperating of course they're purchased the F for hundreds a surface to air missiles from the Russians\nAre they're being pretty cozy with the Russians of late a they even purchased a long term nuclear power plant on the ...\nFrom the Russians and of course as we've seen elsewhere as soon as you have a operational power plant much like they have a in downtown to run a and on the coastline there then you can begin to make\nA plutonium and that puts you on a glide path to having a nuclear capability and I think that's what everyone wants to Austin\n... it's just too rich so the the the turkey is buying um air defense system that would be at least under the umbrella of NATO sensibly used to protect NATO from Russian missile yes\nAnd that you know because we will not connect our patriots and other fad to a Russian S. four hundred a that's why yeah there's a it's a non ... we just won't do it\nUh and that is a major um bone of contention and of course that there are others even though we've tried to maintain good relations with the Turks\nThey're not involved with Assad ah they're less involved with Russia accept because of economic interests and perhaps even to a certain degree with China um\n[noise] and it's the problem is the age old tension between the Sunni and Shia Riyad in Iran it's going to continue um but it ... if you're not involved in you know in fueling terrorism switches his ... in\nSouthern Lebanon and you know encouraging Hamas and\nYou know Palestine and so forth and\nIt will have an easier way in that part of the world we can we can work with them a heavy rains are wonderful people are very bright capable Persian people and they have a long history I Would hope that they will replace their autocrats with people that are\nHave a more a better sense of history and were were they ought to be going\nBut we're not going to eliminate all the tension unfortunately\nWell another fallout from that or a positive aspect of that might be a liberalizing Saudi Arabia because before the Iranian Revolution I think Saudi Arabia was far more liberal but the the habits were sort of seen as a counter measure to the she influenced so maybe we'll see\nSome positive effects and in Saudi Arabia is well here's ... van Morrison taking is into the

C. P. international limited\nIn Alexandria, Virginia based company\nWhere his primary duties include working on multinational programs for the department of army and since October of two thousand and two colonel McGinnis has been a member of security Donald Rumsfeld military analysts group and his brand new book is called ...\nAnd the alliance of evil Russia China the United states and a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times\nFinally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me to feeding\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing that\nUs national security adviser John Bolton is reportedly are pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the eye and ask for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nWell of course the Russians are suspected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven I in a treaty because they have\nNot only build but practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that a wave tractor cruise missile we called nine and seven to nine\nThat has um you know not met the criteria is violated the criteria are of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nThe powerful renewal of twenty ten new start and you know President Trump said um you know weeks ago that perhaps we aren't going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow ... concern to solve it\nYou know that is cutting back dramatically a nuclear weapons and\nTo Fifteen hundred and fifty are deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has\nReally cross the line to a new Cold War because the Cold War is all about nuclear Holocaust and the threat posed by the Soviets in the U.S\nWe're entering a new era right now\nI Want it also dial back to September when Russia began his largest ever military exercise with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers\nOr this was a a a drill with China as a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok twenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states well\nIt does and in fact a really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China\nMet and they're getting ready to uh jointly head a commission on military technology um that is of course being shared\nA significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying a fighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred a\nSurface to air missile system and the Vostok Eighteen exercises you indicate and I had three hundred thousand\nA soldier's thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off the east coast of Russia\nStraight at the United states you know practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against Jimmy a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have\nThe mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the\nNorth Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War when President Reagan had essentially vanquished\nOr when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter\nTowards Moscow and of course that was violated some might suggest that the United states was poking the bear and given their\nTheir passion for for for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation\nUm coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who would suggest as perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since the great\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been our lives but now here we are what are your thoughts\nYou know I think you're correct Richard huh we did poke 'em and of course we've continued to do that they considered a Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I call in the eastern part of the country and that's a after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia and they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland\nHungary Romania that'd be entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nAh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David [noise]\nWe had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have\nBrought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fuel the rise of Vladimir putting and you know ... of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result\nAnd it's a you call it an alliance of evil yeah between the Russians and the Chinese and perhaps there are other uh components to this Islamic terrorism perhaps but in terms of the Russians and the Chinese becoming\nA bed may is is driven by ideology in any way are are there still vestiges of a communist ideology here or is this simply about hedging many [noise]\nWell it's a combination of things I I don't if not as simple as communism versus liberal democracy if it was I Would argue during the Cold War\nI'm voting for his own ideology is about order and bringing jobs back to Russia bringing confidence in where the nation is as opposed to what they would call and a moral west\nAnd the things that they represent they paint or the west is what Hollywood is spewing all of the world and they said you don't want that in fact you know putting as is famous for embracing Christianity and family values and\nAnd the things that you know I used to resonate in the United states in the fifties so he\nWas you know even though he's a former Terry and he still is perceived widely as a leader of the common man in the in Russia and as a result there's a lot of confidence in him you know they have adversaries but\nYou know it was just this week\nYou had you know a a gentleman by the name of Valerie ... who is the chairman for Russia's constitutional court who even started to you know hit\nAt perhaps we ought to amend our constitution much like the Chinese did this past year and allow potent in this case to serve beyond twenty twenty four because he was just elected of course uh\nYeah this past march they're beginning to see that we need longevity and we need to have the capability to\nAh keep the momentum going in and they feel confident that who is doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident and president Xi is well\n[noise] you're not exactly painting potent as an evil adversary and yet the ... the title of the book is alliances evil so why why should we aside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal\nWhy should we be fearing prudent and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponize eat everything against us you know if you look at political corporation a predatory economics strategic extortion information warfare um covert action you know I\nI could go through every one of those Richard and there's a long history and in fact an alliance of evil I go through sixteen indicators and which do things just come out alive and they they like blinking red lights and they suggest very strongly that yes they're representing their interests\nAnd in fact Russia and China are collaborating just like the Russian prime ministers have been a Russian Chinese prime leaders have been meeting here recently and their parents ministers just met you for taking time over the top\nSide for the interruption I got to jump in here will pick us up on the other side of the lives of evil lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis here is Timmy Hendricks taking us into the
