{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "Pancreas cancer that was locally advanced so yes there's many reasons to come and many doctors come to us as patients many doctors said their patients that of course many people come in all part of the show is to educate each one of you so that you get the best chance to get the best treatment\nFor yourself or your loved ones 'cause it's really hard when you go to a hospital or a doctor you're dealing with health care professionals\nWho are out of every day doing their thing and this hour together allows you to learn about the health care system and uh learn about choices that they are often choices available to you and your loved ones but I'm such a Lederman you give us a call if you want to get a book with DVD or phone numbers two on\nTwo choices to one to two four six four to three seven we'll be right back\nFor cancer treatment it's Dr Lederman first in America with radio surgery for newer recurrent primary or met a steady cancer even if prior chemo surgery or radiation didn't work or isn't tolerated innovative none invasive cancer treatment with no cutting no bleeding\nI'm Dr Lederman decades of experience thirty eight and Broadway in Manhattan for brain body and prostate cancers called two one two choices most insurance Medicare Medicaid accepted called Dr Lederman\nDoing two choices two one two choices to hit the cancer\nWill come back to the radio surgery our doctor Gilead I'm In the leading cancer prostate cancer ... in New York for ... brain rainiest entering first in America\nAnd in the western hemisphere finding waiting a surgery you can also call Dr lead a minute to ensure killington for free and form in Brooklyn and DVD hey Dr Lederman whereby\nWe are back and we're with you and you can call her office if he wanted a book that DVD or an appointment the office numbers to win two choices are one of the radio every day to learn so there's plenty of things to learn and every show is different because there's\nSo much to talk about what about a man is fifty seven years old he's a truck driver he has three kids and he had blood and the rectum and nothing was done for a year and nothing was done he has a CAT scan for the call that I'll skip eating a mass\nRectal sick more area hit a PET scan and well a I had this blood and the blood precipitous the colonoscopy as we often talk about blood is a warning sign and he had cancer and the ... more there and it was ... and\nHe was refusing chemotherapy had no complications from the surgery or covered while he drops him away from two Seventy down to two hundred and fifty five pounds and nine of Nineteen positive notes\nHe was not told by the surgeon up the extent of the cancer it was not told that the cancer went through the wall of test and he was not told lied of Ninety lymph nodes were positive off\nHow can a patient make a decision about their life in their house\nIf the doctor is not going to tell the patient the truth about the stage doctors need to take time like we do here at thirty for Broadway take time like my grandfather fifty five years ago in Waterloo, Iowa I remember my grandfather would go to the doctor's office and I said what do you do there\nAnd I was a ten year old kid this is fifty five years ago and he said I Would go to the doctor and I tell the doctor to close the door sit down and stay a while so good magic a doctor\nNeeded to be told that in Waterloo, Iowa fifty five years ago it seems like the same is true today in New York for this man who has nine of Nineteen cause ... knows cancer growing through the bottle so yeah this cancer surgery and then he came to me for a second opinion and we've got um staged up\nI told him the stage of the cancer and the extent of the cancer and he was shocked and we arranged for him to the most effective treatment which would have been chemo radiation usually for rectal segment we didn't give the chemo radiation first to shrink down the cancer first but this surge and it was so hot to take him to the operating room without telling them all\nThe options another case with a certain was washing surgery without telling them what the options would be so he went to surgery the cancer was extensive growing through the wall while the multiple lymph nodes and then the patient went back to the chemo doctor and became a doctor told him he only needs\nChemotherapy not radiation and I\nWas asked to call the chemo doctor in front of the patient\nI asked that came out Dr ... where do you think that cancer started because each site in the body has a different\nTreatment the rectum is different from the state government the seed comes different from the ... well the doctor who just saw him and was frozen treatment for him couldn't say where the cancer started it was pretty sad it's sad for the patient said for the doctor the doctor does not know where the cancer\nStarted the doctor was trying to treat them as if it was in a different part of the intestine\nI was trying to get the best possible treatment for the patient the patient said he did a little like the chemo doctor anyway that the doctor talked down\nTo him didn't educate him he didn't spend time with him and so I went to another came a doctor who agree to a hundred percent that they needed to combine modality therapy and then the next day that first came out doctor who was shouting and screaming at me saying he doesn't need radiation called the patient back and said he was sorry but he wants to give him chemo and radiation now\nSo it's tough to be a patient this man lucky for him I arrange that he got the chemo I got injured he got the radiation you've got the fanciest radiation in town and the stereotype to crime here at thirty for a Broadway where we accept both insurances and I see this man every day and he's happy came here and he's happy\nHe got a new doctor and he's happy is getting cut by modality therapy and he's happy that he understands\nThat there are differences and the doctors and each doctor has their own ideas and that's why it's so fruitful for so many people to come to Thirteen eighty four Broadway Broadway and thirtieth street here in New York City to get the best\nPossible treatment and to learn about their cancer and to learn where the cancer is what kind of cancer is where the cancer is on the stage of the cancer that's what we provide to every patient so give us a call if you want information about brain tumors or prostate cancers or body cancers or DVD give\nUs a call or two and two choices two and two choices that's two and two two four six four to three seven to one to two four six four to three\nSeven I won't talk about a man who well he is sixty six years old and he's an artist she lives in New York and well he had a\nMelanoma in the past and now he has a sarcoma on his\nFlank actually others just those right just and it was seen by one of the big surgeons and talented three surgeons\nAnd three surgeries for this sarcoma on his chest tacoma's or cancers of the connective tissue in retreat so many people with stark homeless because the usual treatment just does not work and for this man we treated him\nAnd even though the surgeon operated on three times the margins were very close one millimeter and then he was at the ribs they couldn't cut more and we offered treatment we treated this man and one more thing I should tell you\nThat we treated him two and a half years ago and he's cancer free he's doing well he's cancer free just got staged by examined him he's cancer free after having a large sarcoma and really inadequate surgery that we were able to make up with\nMore sophisticated focused being invisible beams of radio surgery this is the work\nWe do this is why so many people cause are so many people come in why so many of our radio listeners send their friends and neighbors for fresh\nSecond opinion our listeners save lives listeners save lives even our website as listeners save lives dot\nCom talking about a man who is Seventy two he is a colon cancer he said he motors section or sexual liver and now he has a lung a jaw cancer in the lung cancer and the spleen and he wants our treatment he's been at one of the most super duper hospitals and all they do is caught the color of this call them\nThat cut on this liver twice to cut to open up and put up pumping his liver\nThat doesn't work the cancer kept on growing and it's always come here to thirty for Broadway for cancer treatment even though a stage for we treat people with stage four cancer chemo doesn't\nWork and he doesn't want more came motives I Want more surgeries had extensive surgery and he's here for non invasive treatment ...

the least impactful social media platform on the Web to killing\nMugele has announced that it will shut it down and social network after the wall Street Journal reported that the company did not disclose the security vulnerability in the spring and expose private data from hundreds of thousands of Google Plus it counts\nLet's check in with our expert on the Internet luring Weinstein who will of course his disclaimer before we get going go ahead Lawrence\nRight that I did consult to Google several years ago so now what is Google Plus from ... is a Google of a social networking platform it it is the equivalent\nOf Facebook or Twitter in in the Google ... said I've been using it since really became available ... years ago [noise] um this is going to be missed\n... if you're going to be missed by millions of people you know there's this story that's been going on for ages oh with a ghost town there's nobody out millions and millions of people use it very happy with it I've been very happy with it [noise]\nReally in a way ... they were sort of a victim of their own success because when they when they started\nGoogle Plus throughout its entire run Google decided not to put an ad on it so there was no ... there was no way to buy sponsored posts right these are both things that drives people crazy her latest book [noise] so there was no separate income stream coming from it in the meantime\nEverybody got kind of look or by Facebook into thinking well you got to have you got to have sponsored post you got to have these things that are manipulating your your time lines and everything and they got a massive number of people\nOnto their platform now of course a lot of people are kind of regret it given what's been going on but sizes everything was social media scale is everything and Google just never really got that scale now\nThis brief that occurred well I'll say right at the top ah they currently found out about this for a month ago they should have publicly about that at that time [noise] apparently\nThere is that they really didn't is they found that in a during a if I understand that during their own auditing their own security auditing and they didn't have any evidence that that had ever been exploited in other words it was a theoretical bought her ability but apparently nobody knew about it outside of school\nAnd the kinds of information that we're that we're\nTheoretically vulnerable where like name and email address no credit card numbers do financial information nothing like that law that stuff that people have with Facebook so they said well\nWhy stir things up when there's so much going on right now I mean that's my interpretation and they cut us out on it and write and now of course it kind of makes it a convenient I won't say excuse but by the it convenient to kind of a rationale for\nSetting into motion the sun setting of Google Plus over a period of about a month but they they should have\nDiscussed that publicly the first place\nUm and ah it would've been a lot better all around if they had in the meantime all of us who have been using Google Plus all these years of trying to find other places to go where experimenting with other things that are mentioned that there the Google commercial\nVersion of cocoa puff which operates further Gees we the the the business systems where you pay about five bucks a month or per head\nUsing of that's going to continue so Google Plus we'll be continuing commercially [noise] uh and then we'll just have to see what happens competing with Facebook probably a ... and facebooks turf with probably not a good idea and the first place that's a time\nAt ... at the end at the time well it seems like a logical thing to do you know you don't want to miss out but as we've seen the way Facebook did it to to have that an enormous growth has now trip them up and a lot of serious ways to so there's positives and negatives to all these\nAnd one quick question I hear Snapchat is going broke where do you hear\nA apparently Snapchat having all kinds of all kinds of problems um I guess their stock has been a wall up\nYet I have heard well uh their their founder has

colleagues would you wrote this book did it surprise them\nA great question I'm often asked that I Would say yes they were very surprised to hear that uh but I think as I call people that the evidence but I was referring to people parked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic now\nAnd no one knows what picture will be shown because it's randomly generated by a computer\nSo the computer will vary the picture shown sometimes it's a violent picture sometimes at the picture of a peaceful landscape like a mountain or river one something that wouldn't arouse the body what we find in the study is that there is a very subtle again highly statistically significant effect\nThink Jeff thing that the body is responding in the direction of the picture eventually shown seconds before the picture is shown\n[noise] years ago during the television days they would hire anchor people lose people are based on a system called the ... skin test\nAnd it was a series of electrical impulses that they would hook up with audience members to and then they chose videotapes of various anchor people and the the one that showed the most remarkable response\nFrom the audience because of the skin test\nThey're the ones that got hired or they were looking for some kind of reaction from people and the person who just you know didn't register at all on the meter or with the people in the audience they never got hired I I don't know if they still use that or not but it was amazing technology back in the seventies\nWell that's the type of technology that is being used in pre sentiment experiments measuring skin response\nAmazing work no psycho Comey says is the ability to move objects with your brain what did you want to cover their\nRight again this is something that doesn't make any sense at all under the materials paradigm\nConsciousness is considered to be at the phenomenon of the brain it comes out of the brain has no effect on the world what I found in my research is that that might not be true and I think the most compelling studies that had been controlled are once again that show very subtle effects\nAnd they were actually done a primarily at Princeton University which is interesting because I went to Princeton University and I had no idea of these studies were being run a Dr Robert Johnson who was the former dean of engineering a rocket scientist ran a lab for nearly Thirty years running these studies\nAnd he also looked at remote viewing but he also he looked at ... which is disability for the mind that matter the classic study\nUsed this random number generators these machines that spit out the heroes and one in a totally random fashion so again if we look at probability overtime a random number generator will have fifty percent heroes and fifty percent one over time\nWhat the experiment does it asks people to put their mental attention to the machine to make it produce more ones and zeroes for example and the person doesn't even have to be in the same room so they say hey I'm pleased put your mental attention to the machine and make it produce more one heroes\nAgain what do we find is that there is a small but highly statistically significant effect where it seems as though the mind is is changing the what used to be random behavior of the machines\nRandom generators picked up some incredible response is during the tragedy of nine eleven in two thousand one they did not know what the time what was happening what was going to happen but they felt something was going on because these random generators mark just went ballistic\nAnd in ... people have that ability going up\nThat's right George those to me or perhaps even more remarkable and this is part of the global consciousness project which which was an offshoot of the Princeton study where these machines the random number generators\nWere set up around the world so people weren't even necessarily aware that the machines were they're\nGenerating these numbers and what the experimenter have done is looked at the behavior of the machines around the world around event that we know are produced heightened emotions and nine eleven is one example of what we know that people had heightened emotion and it happened at a concentrate basically at a at a single moment that\nWe can look at what was happening when everyone was focusing their attention or many people are focusing their attention on the events what do we find that there was a spike at nine eleven but in the case of nine eleven which is even more fascinating to me\nIs that the spike happened before the plane hit the towers before the event that before the event which suggests almost a global ... premonition that this was going to happen\nFor a yellow her you know that name of course had an incredible ability or if you believe what he did\nFor ... she had the ability to bend spoons and keys and everything else with his mind now there are some who say dollars trickery its magic but do you believe that he had that ability he did some incredible things and a\nCandidate B. taught ... be taught\n\nWell I've heard of of spoon bending parties which sounds ridiculous but ah I've looked into it and it appears that people train themselves to be able to use their mind in ways to to affect matter beyond just a random number generator works actually\nBending metal for example and early ... as an example where many credible people have suggested that what he can do is real including um Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who sat in a two thousand Fifteen television interview that he saw\nKeller then and there are many people who have suggested that this is real I'm a side note on your a gal her very interesting I mentioned the CIA documents earlier\nThere's another document that I include in my book an end to upside down thinking that talks about Ehlers abilities but not in the context of spoons pending it's in the context of remote viewing bellies and what they say again this is a direct quote from a classified document\nWhere he was he was put under very I mean they were watching him closely what the documents that is as a result of ... success in this experimental period we consider that he has demonstrated his paranormal perceptual ability in a convincing and unambiguous manner\nSo you know there has been a lot of debate about him but these documents suggest that studies were run and he was able to perform which I think should open up to the possibility that maybe he was able to do things using his mind that town totally crazy\nMark would you give out your website and where people can get your book\nShore my website is my name's mark ...

[laughter]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nWalking\nBack mark over with us and we'll get to your calls as well this hour mark the near death experiences again and we were talking about whether the brain hallucinates shows that light that everybody seems to see\nYou're going into the tunnel or whether something is really going on here ... is a difficult call isn't it\nI'm Glad you brought this up towards this is a really really important one because if\nIf there is some truth in what people are experiencing beyond Lucy nation perhaps it gives us into a window into a reality that we typically don't see with our eyes but I I think we should explore this one further my perspective on it after having looked at the evidence to me the most compelling pieces of evidence are\nThe cardiac arrest studies known as ... cardiac arrest studies\nSo this is where people have their in cardiac arrest their resuscitated and the experimenter as talk to them soon after they're able to uh soon after they've had the experience rather than asking people to remember something that might have happened twenty or Thirty years ago\nSo these are cardiologist for example Dr ... a ... from Stony Brook is another one that we all scientists are looking at this and what they're finding is is that some percentage of people who are in cardiac arrest\nCome back and describe this near death experience and why is that significant\nCardiac arrest this is severe physiological trauma in many cases the person is clinically dead we know that when the heart stopped after a certain amount of time there is no blood flow to the brain and the brain stopped functioning\nSo if there is minimal or no brain functioning we would not expect people to have these experiences that are so vivid to them and as I mentioned earlier sometimes what they report during the near death experience when they're out of their body is verified as being accurate later\nI'm One example in particular is from Dr\nSam ... in a peer reviewed journal called resuscitation in two thousand fourteen one of the patient in particular had a very vivid out of body experience where he heard something in the room it\nWas later found to be the difficulty later and we know that this happened during the time he had no brain functioning because the times were being stamped and we know when the defendant later went off and it made it very distinctive sound and yet this person came back and describe the sound in the room that happened when his brain was off\nWhere they've been cases as well we're somebody is literally gone through this near death experience there floating above their body\nThey see the nurse and the doctor and everybody in attendance talking about the person you know well sorry we're losing enemies dying or whatever then they come the person comes back into his body\nAnd tells the attending doctor exactly what he heard and it boggles their mind\nAbsolutely it doesn't make sense according to this material is perspective that we need a functional brain in order to have conscious experience and memories\nAre but what I've found is that there are very credible scientists that are looking at this for example the University of Virginia the division of perceptual studies at the med school has looked at this very closely and Dr Bruce Grayson as one person in particular\nWas looked at these phenomenon and is is finding that something is happening when the brain is not functional and people are able to report things like what you described where they couldn't have known about things through normal means and it seems as though their brain was off and they said something that was accurate which is not by definition if not who's the nation\nMarquee Iran six hundred and twenty terrestrial radio stations as we speak and they're all sending out signals in the cities and markets than the area\nYou can't see those radio signals once they're out there is that a little bit what what this is like consciousness were sending out signals that you can't really see but they're out there\nThat such an important point\nI think we tend to be biased by what are ordinary\nA perceptual systems can tell us particularly our eyes and our ears but we know it's not even controversial to say that our eyes show or a small sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum and what we're dealing with here may be something totally separate from the M spectrum but we know that our eyes only show us a very small sliver of reality\nSo I Do think that maybe there are things beyond what our normal ordinary perceptual systems can show us at our existing but we just don't perceive them\nAll right let's take some calls here for you as they begin to line up and I've still got a whole slew of questions for you mark and by the way for a non scientist you're doing an incredible job on this topic you've learned a lot damage you\n[laughter] I have and I hope to summarize it in a way that a general audience can absorb it\nLet's go to bill from West Hartford Connecticut kid ... Connecticut built by the way is an amateur astronomer and an atheist hey bill\nHi George Hi Hi Mark yes\nI Am a rational ... than a materialist however I Do think that there is something to near death experiences I Do think ah there is this phenomena going on I just think regarding Andy uh where where the mind I Would use the word mine not sold but mine are conscious just goes\nUh or or exist temporarily during the ... is not heaven or hell in a religious sense just like there is no God or no devil\nI Would call an energy dimension or an energy universe and I have a new term for it I Would call it may be seeing your Larry to you know space no time\nA dimension but my question to you is specifically\nA I liked it sort of question your whole premise by talking about site medications all explained psychiatric medications medications for either anxiety or depression whether it's anti anxiety drugs clouded than Xanax her aunt antidepressants or major tranquilizers neural ethics\nFact chemical have the brain and therefore they do affect chemical you the consciousness meaning of the mind so\nBy changing biologically biochemical you the brain through these medications or even aspirin or Tylenol ibuprofen can it can affect the brain is through the headaches the going back to cite made it can affect the brain chemically we know that positively\nAnd affects the mind that's my first part my second part of the same one question is Alzheimer's disease dementia affects the brain does affect the conscious is the mines dusting that show it here's my question for you it doesn't show that if\nThe mine and the brain are not the same thing at least the brain is connected to the mine is connected to the brains and I'm trying to say\nThank you very much for your question bill and this is something I Do address in the book and I've thought a lot about personally because we do know that there is a strong correlation between what happens in the brain and the type of conscious experience we have whether it's like medications or if someone gets in a car accident and then has cognitive impairments we know there's a correlation\nWhat I argue and and some others argue this as well is that correlation does not always imply causation in other words just because two things are related to one another\nWe can't automatically conclude that one causes the other so here's this simplistic example from Dr Bernardo Castro when when I mentioned in my book [noise] imagine you have a fire\nLots of firefighters show up\nYou have a larger fire more firefighters show up\nA very strong correlation between the size of the fire and the number of firefighters that appear at the scene\nWe know however that the firefighters did not cause the fire that's not the nature of the relationship but the firefighters are highly related to the fire so I've used the brain and a bit of a different way with the brain is highly related to consciousness\nDamage the brain you you'd take psych med the brain and consciousness will be affected but the brain I view it more as like a filtering mechanism or like an antenna receiver which similarly which show a strong correlation between what's happening in the brain unconscious experience but it's not the producer of consciousness\nWhat ... what do you think mark reincarnation\nWhile I have a chapter on that in my book and I know about the studies done at the University of Virginia I think there is evidence\nWe we've had some incredible stories too of people who have talked about their past lives including little children uh and it just does Vermont\n... when they're checked out there's no way that they would know certain things unless they experienced it is it's it's mind boggling isn't it\nGeorge I agree with you it's chapter eleven of my book and I think the most compelling cases in addition to children being able to recall thing that they shouldn't have any way of knowing\nA man or sometimes verified by medical records by the UVA professors is in some cases the children have birth marks or physical deformities that are very specific that matched the way the child describes dying in the previous life\nYes and in some cases the medical records are found so it's it's something that's beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical something else was going on and the researchers call it a third factor\nOr a person's petrified of water and then somehow in hypnosis they died in the past life by drumming let's say\nExactly what's preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to something beyond the body seems to be a transfer from one existence to another ostensibly\nWe have Monique in Southern California with us I'm Monique go ahead\nIt's a culture or a nationality is more than ... ...\nNot necessarily not not not because of nationality or anything like that I haven't come across that mark I mean there were there were great remote viewers all over the planet or but it doesn't skew anything specifically\nI Would say that with what I've seen so far but I think more research it deserved on this topic isn't being research widely enough to understand if there are certain trend there's certain brain configuration that make people more able to do these things\nAnd in your case mark the definition of remote viewing would be what\nThe ability to perceive something with the mind alone\nIt's almost as if the mind alone has our he's outside of the body\nCorrect going back to the world on an allergy it's like somebody is able to accept another part of the stream even though they're localized in their individual world it's like they open up their ... and they accept water that outside\nI Want to go back to John are veteran here and ask him a question John you're still with us yes or a ... so you do or you you believe in remote viewing but\nIt's it's it's tied into all these other things it's all part of the whole show what would it take to get you to believe the other things outside of UFOs 'cause you know that's that's subjective to everybody\nOn unfortunately what me only because of my background it would be you know personal experience I a lot of things that I that was a including those sightings and everything else I've been able to do something else\nOkay so you're you're basically a skeptic who will believe if you find the proof\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nTo talk to George Nouri called the wild card line that he won't eat five zero one for one zero in on the first time caller lined is

I'm In my work they might work I've often not often but several times over my career I had the opportunity to accompany a rural folks farm folks on ...\nWith water which in yes okay I've seen it work see at work and then seeing the drillers calm and drill right to that same to adapt\nAnd there it is ... and ... you\nKnow again I'm a scientist okay so it's not that there's something there that we don't fully understand\nAnd then can we say that it's the dolls or the person or is there some other force behind it\nWell let's suppose let's suppose that ah the Dow is er and I've seen it with three different methods brass rods willow sticks and ... over a map mhm\nOkay I'll watch pendulum over a map which was the most strangest one of all that somebody could could could find water and yet there

James\nOkay all that whole period when all of this a lot of his early\nEarly research started into shall we say ... ... ... and other other sorts of things and I I I mean I've never seen a U.S I've never seen what I could call a UFO night sky and I've lived in places where the night sky was glorious\nI saw when I never did before but I saw\nYou know so I Can't I Can't even put up all this stuff that has to do for instance a desert tortoises will show up at the mud hole the desert tortoise in the southwest will show up at the mud hole prior to when the rain\nComes within within just now\nMaybe that's something to do with the change in the air pressure\nAnd they know the feeling\nYeah they can feel it it's a it's they're reading something but to the to the to to to the native folks that lived in that country that made that animal up pretty sacred animal\nAbsolutely let's get a quick reaction from you mark is the time was clicking by here no there's no question that if science skin see the things Steven just said we're on her way isn't it\nYeah even raises a number of really good point about the need to study these phenomenon much more to understand the nuances of how it all works I don't think we understand some of the mechanisms because it hasn't been studied widely enough and that's largely because it's so taboo particularly an academic institution to even talk about these things\nI've talked to scientists who say that it's a academic suicide effectively to talk about these things before getting tenure\nSo that's another reason I really wanted to write the book and put the evidence in one place for people to hopefully open up the conversation so that it's not such a taboo topic\nWell Steven as a scientist admits that there's something very strange going on you know what it is but he's open to at least say that it's unusual in different than you know something could be happening mhm\n[noise] well we haven't talked much about quantum mechanics here but it's a field of physics that has been around for over a hundred years which is accepted in the physics community as being real but it's totally counter intuitive\nThere's a phenomenon known as entanglements\nAnd the very basic phenomenon is you have two particles two pieces of matter that are physically distant from one another and when you affect one you affect the other simultaneously like an instantaneous effect which suggests that there's some hidden interconnectedness now Albert Einstein did not like this at all he\nCalled it spooky action at a distance because he thought the speed of light was the fastest that anything could travel and yet here we have an instantaneous connection between distant articles so there are things in the ... the fabric of reality that are totally counter intuitive but we just don't feed them in our everyday lives\nHas this changed your life\n\nIt absolutely has I think from the standpoint of understanding human potential and what we can do I get ... this is open me out completely but also it's it's introduced this notion that interconnectedness the idea that we're not actually separate even though it appears that we are\nAnd that takes on it brings a whole new meaning to things like altruism which\nIf we're all connected than helping another is really a version of helping ourselves that to me that this this has implications for interpersonal relationships all the way up to world peace\nOr I my friend mark thank you again one more time do you bought your Web site where people can get your book and into upside down

collecting Maureen would more goals chronicles stories from the role of the you know the unexplained the unbelievable let me tell you about marine fifth generation psychic trench medium for as far back as she can remember\nChoose communicated with the D.C shut the age of Fifteen\nShe was introduced to a person who's studied with laureen Cabot\nWas the official which obsessed with Massachusetts and she took Moreno under her wing and Guided Tour and ways to do only understand but also control this gift of the age of Fifteen she served as the medium for adults ... says\nShe's practiced studied and instructed metaphysical studies for more than twenty five years more has been with the New England ghost project since two thousand one and there's a company the group on more than one hundred investigations\nHere she is on coast to coast Maureen welcome\nOh thank you so much for having me we could afford to this Fifteen Years old all this happened for you yes\nAh I Know as you're reading that I'm thinking oh my God that was only a few days ago right\n[laughter]\nTell me about Lori Cabot the official which have Salem\n[noise] you know he's very a a wonderful woman when I was at that age Fifteen you know she was someone that was rarely renowned and the city and she still is um she's known as you know the high priest is a Salem and seal off and when I was younger I\nSee her walking around town you know dressed in her her garb and very regal looking very um you know she's ... big presents for a person and ... at\nThe time people will come up with open arms you did they go oh my God there's a which\nYeah that's a great question you know there are many people that welcomed with open arms but\nLet's just say the town and Sam I'm not necessarily [laughter] so it always seems to be at those days it was a little bit of a battle between the businesses and you know and the town in Salem and those who really believed in the witchcraft and um so basically she did you know she really changed\nThe whole way they look at it now you know obviously it's a big tourism right\nFor the type of season and it's you know go to Sam I'm so I think that it really worked out well for the town of ... you\nKnow you are a fifth generation psychic tranche medium that means we're talking about ... back to your family you said disability what year who did it start with\nNo my um [noise] it's\nInteresting because growing up my mother just never really wanted to I don't know if you don't want to scare me she just you know my poor father though he thought the girls insane [laughter] um but I Would come to her and talk to her about spirit that I was seeing and I to me it was normal it didn't seem unusual I didn't have anything to judge it by um and my mother would just\nYou know God Bless her she'd say oh here's some holy water you know just to\nYou know she told my father she is normal\nUm but she didn't really discuss it with me a lot until I was older and I was still\nYou know involved but say in a matter of physical and that spiritual around and one day I mean she was with talking you know in her sixties she finally told me that she is you know what Marlene\nThis has been from my family for many many years like her great grandmother and you know her grandmother used to help people in town and he'll them of their illnesses and keep them stop them from bleeding and do readings for them and she said you know I hear the spirit but I just turn up the radio\nSo\nWould you say that there was a member of your family that was better than another member\nI never you know never really quite thought of that um I Would say that I had you know my grandmother died when she was twenty eight\nSo I never really knew her\nUm but my great grandmother my grandmother rather I did know and she was the one who really got involved with doing reading for people so I heard that\nYou know she was very trusted in her city or in her town um so it's hard to know I mean I don't know have a lot to really judge by in my family history of who was might have been stronger than another\nDid they ever passed down stories from one to the other the the you could carry through\nYou know the only thing that I Do have was\nGiven to me and uh I have this little picture of you know and it was my grandmother actually before she had path and she was maybe\nMaybe five years before she passed and it's interesting 'cause she you have a picture of her and she looked like a gypsy um and my mother used to joke about it and say that that you know\nThat was her true self she was very unique that what you said so that the stories that God will always bits and pieces never never anything that was really concrete that I could say\nI'm about spirits anyway\nYou know you've been with the New England the ghost project Maureen since two thousand and one would use that\nA well rounded do much better than me to tell the story but he started this story\nAfter and a near death experience um and he had to work and do a um you know a special course our class that he took to try to keep him busy when he was hailing from his illness I'm and basically he started doing a cable um\nYou know he's got a cable program and during that cable program he had to do it on something so he chose you know doing it on go set his workshop and again he'll do much better at explaining that I Would focus\nOn but it's a team of individual that\nYou know over the years I've learned is you know to me everybody is really you know it's a great team of people you work really hard to get to go out and you look for things that go on for the night you know someone else doesn't really want to see one look into that they're quite\nSatisfied not knowing about the unknown all you have someone that really needs help there's been many calls over the years to run and the team um that were you know businesses um you know families you know you'd have restaurants and they don't really want to\nDo I go out and tell the public all the time this was years ago they don't want to tell the public that something is going on that they can't explain and people were getting a little freaked out and they need help\nSo it's really been a journey of love I think to go out and actually work because we're not paid you know it's not something that we get paid to go out and do investigations of people it's really going there to to just help on\nHow many people are just a off the wall when you go to their house and they're they're just losing it\nWell off the wall meaning terrified of spirit\nYou off the wall just crazy\nNow show [laughter] terrified as birds I guess\nUm you know as as it says we have done more than a hundred investigation on I Would say that you know not a hundred percent would we find something active going on at the time but we are big believers and know that you know it doesn't always happen on command\nUm so I really believe that there are a lot of supernatural things that are going on um if you're aware and you're open to it you might experience it you know some people say well I've\nThey're seen it and I don't believe in that well there's a good reason why you don't see it [noise] um so if you say how many people I'd say a good percentage of paranormal activity does take place out there and I would bet that if you did a poll and you ask people on the street\nYou get a good amount of you know maybe Seventy percent of people have had some odd experience they can't really explain and their lives\n... what do you conclude about what this may be I mean a lot of people have their thoughts about what ... what do you think they are\nWell I think there are varying degrees of what they could be right so our experience in my experience over the years has been\nYou know if I Do a reading for someone for instance um I get more of a loving spirit someone that's passed over that wants to communicate and come back and you know let their love when those are okay or maybe has a message for them that they weren't able to get before they pass 'em but then you know you called out to some locations where\nYou know things aren't really going while someone's gotten thrown down the stairs items and being tossed around the house um there's different you know event like say a you know people walking by and then you might see a spirit walk by and all these plants just\nDie as they're looking at them um we had one case of a woman who was living by herself with the door\nTo door closed in her apartment and yet she was hit on the back of the head with a a ballot stripped\nFrom the stairs or you know all these\nOut she'd have something go on in the oven and she'd go to put potatoes enrolled in oil and should lay down and take a nap while they're cooking and yet they would fire would start in her of and um it would wake her up with the alarms going off and she'd get up and look in the potatoes underneath on you know on the plane itself\nOn many occasions on it it can be hot right now\nWhat would you say is the strangest case you've come across strange ...\nStranger case [laughter] okay well when Ron would take me out to investigate many times in just about all the time you would never tell me where we were going on because they keep me honest right so I'm not Googling line that information eager for 'em\nTo one day he gave me a call and say hey marine you know I have this case that's ten in the morning you know can you come with me it's really only take us in our\nYou know ha ha ha ha so yeah exactly um yeah I'm sure on you know he's very creative\nRight so I say okay you know I guess I can go for a couple of hours so we go home to you know little ranch style house and we we get there and that's that's meant to guy there wanted they just what really rough and tumble you know and this one guy you know like one I think his name was ... and the\nBig big guy having tattooed me get tried it you know just\nOverwhelming right sit there and so why is just looking at me and we get in the house and he said I think I have a little girl in here spirit and you look around and then there is a shattered glass table busted and it just walk like someone to the house with a bat um it was just torn apart and they were terrified and he said you know\nMy phone's been ringing with all heroes on it and my wallet went missing and\nNow he's telling me all the things they kept paint I think it's a little girl and I'm like okay well let's see what we can pick out so after a few minutes and thinking oh my God this is not a little girl I could feel that you know experiment man very angry and very trying to get his message through and I thought wow you know this isn't meant no it's not and he was getting\nAdamant that you know it wasn't and I talked to use and\nBrings us out of the house and now I'm thinking jeez what do we get ourselves into right I'm Ilene Ron up at the top of the driveway with the guy knew any rags me down on the on the driveway and he looks at me he said I Want you to come back here tonight by yourself and I said well you know I really don't\nFeel it's a little girl and you gotta be careful you know you don't want to welcome in something that you don't know it's there and [noise] and he turned to I mean he said look I just got out of jail for murdering my best\nFriend she said and I'm telling you right now that wouldn't be him and it's got to be a little girl and I want to hear and I thought oh God I just have to get out of here so that\nThat is scary

house so I gather ... up and we went to his house and the places that massively looked like it has been trashed and\nThis guy insisted that there was this spirit of a young girl there and uh so anyways uh they were pretty big ... ah and ah they kinda got us for a while after we did our thing and\nAh one of them move separated me from the other one and the other one talked marine we later found out that that the guy had just been released from prison for murder or a friend of his and uh so he wanted marina comeback alone but that didn't turn out so if there was any fear was then [laughter]\nYeah she was telling us that story before I had ... it's it's one that's left an impression with us I think so\nWhat kind of equipment do you bring with you\nOr it varies on on on the particular case uh the you know the the larger the um the case you know as far as locations and the more people more pieces equipment a small case the lesser amount but you always want to um\nYou know tried to ah bring the proper equipment that you would need for instance if you have reports of a ... be unseen\nYou might bring more video equipment are and you're like thermal or I or whatever but you you believe\nVersus a sound equipment or something like that and it was and vice versa if for instance most of the the the um reports manifested by audio than you would bring more audio crummy so it it it varies appointing according to a location\nWhat would you say has been the most incredible visualization\nThat you've come across a I'm Sorry what was the word the visualization visualization\nUm actually I Believe I've seen a full body operations [noise] probably four times um but the interesting part about it or judges that\nThey weren't really well I was ... times and but more while I was just doing normal stuff\nI work with a a lot of White House history funds for them and we do you know public go sons and that type of stuff and there are two separate occasions or one that I Do these goes to his cause I'm On the board of directors of course on top of a White House so we do these haunted toys and one time we were in this um [noise]\nIt's ... uh like an observation tower where it's a square building with glass all around them and you\nAnd so he is windows all around you can absolutely see you know three hundred and sixty degrees and it was one daughter in and out of it and there was a group of people there and I began talking to him I'm doing my field and I looked outside and I saw a woman a walking on the outside towards the door\nAnd she got about halfway down the law the a side of the wall you know going towards the door and I I stopped because I didn't want to repeat myself ... she came and then they didn't want her to missing anything so I I stopped and waited for a night I saw her continually walk all the way to do it and I waited\nAnd waited and yet\nNobody came in so finally said is there anybody out there and there was a volunteer sitting on the the rock out there and there was another one by the door and she's just notice there's nobody out there but yet I saw her as clear as day so clear that I had stopped my field to wait for her to walk in\nAnd yet there was no one here and oddly enough that save a patient is where the coast guard 'cause it's on the coast guard base\nA coast guard reported seeing women walking on the wall in that same location so\nThat was kind of intriguing I'm an I'm perhaps the other one which is going to see opposites scale was on a Sunday Morning after we did a public a ghost town on uh what island lighthouse and benefit pool meals Maine we were in the White House ah keep his house it was on the\nUm renovation at that time we were sitting on the picnic table in a in a room off the kitchen and I look towards the kitchen I serve dog all across the door or the kitchen and ah but I didn't hear anything you know how it drives you hear their claws on the\nYeah yeah the the there was no\nThere's no sign out so I jumped up and meal you know ran to the kitchen\nAnd the dog to the door was closed\nSo I came back and spoke to the woman and she says why would you see and I says I saw her dog she says can you describe not so sure absolutely yeah SARS clear as day and I described the dog she just stood there and\nShook her head and smiled at me and she says well you know Ron there was a White House keeper here who had a dog and when it was time for him to be relieved to leave the island or the dog wouldn't go so all the lighthouse keepers afterward took care of them until the dog ... died in the island she says the dog you describe pretty much matches\nBecause of the dog that\nMethod you do your ... your considering going back to school after the following questions do you

how're you doing she never touched me in the morning there you go [laughter] so how often\nDo you get the calls Ron for ghost investigations\nYou know it it it's funny when we first started we we course it was quite common but there are so many group so like when I first started I always say there was\nA twenty ... you have to do was knew there was like twenty four in the country though is like twenty four and a new city but the judge I did want to mention you mentioned the hurricane Michael does just that image know of the ... the center and now has a Scarlett I don't know if you've seen that yet or\nNo I haven't seen that yet ... says pretty that's your own\nIs our number ... ... dot com but it's pretty cool sorry about that\nMaybe we can concentrate and bring them down from four to nothing so that would be good [laughter] I think we've been able to do some of that so when when when you go on your team when your team gets together how much research do you do before you go\nWell Maureen doesn't do anything because half the time she doesn't even know where we're going to use\nYeah she was telling us that you you don't want to ah influence\nI I have to know something about it for instance if you're going especially if you go into a big location you have to know a where to concentrate you're you're investigating for instance if\nThere are a lot of noise is coming out of particular area you might want to concentrate your audio recorder serious\nIf for a visual phenomena are in different locations you certainly want to uh you know put your cameras in there and and so you you ... you have to have a little bit of it I Try to get too much into the details with tour of the coin is for lack of it or\nAre you there to discover the ghost or to cleanse it would what did they ask for\nI Am not I am there for you know strictly investigate\nThat's a popular question 'cause and that was one of the things people will say when they read our first book was like oh you know you know what were they doing you know they're not going they're releasing spirits and you know those are things you hear from people but\nYou know they loved the book but the whole point is is as one and I've always talked about you know some of those parents have been there long before we have\nUm and we don't know why they're there right so we don't necessarily know that they want help to move on and that's one thing if they're there and they don't want to leave who are we to tell them to that they have to\nDoes the person who brings you when do they want the ghost out of there\nI always ask them you know what you want from us you know they basically uh you know what you expect from us in\nA in a very at the cases on that if they're looking for someone who watch like a house Clinton's is something we're not going to do it though you know or are we from someone else um but if they wanted to investigate this to understand what's going on and try to understand what's going on than will do that type of case\nAll right let's take some calls free bowl to view let's go to brandy and granted big California Welcome to the program I brandy\nAlright thank you for taking my call and say um yeah I had a question and I've had a really really rough year\nHere at probably the worst year of my life and I'm Wondering if you are able to tell me to see the year next coming or being a lot better hopefully things starting to go more my way\nMaureen this would be for you\nThat's for sure yet what um okay so Brandi I did pull a couple of cards for you um and honestly\nOne of the things that I see is a lot of emotional turmoil right so that you it seems like you're holding onto a lot of hurt that have been happening around you right um and I obviously don't want to get too personal um but\nYou know and the other kind of a poll is you know this was last year now and things that have been happening is like a pressure right so because of all these things going around you it feels like your hands are tied and you're not able to move forward\nOn what I Would tell you is that\nYou can get to a better place you really need to trust you need to let go of some of these things that are you know in your life that I hate to say it but even even if there is um like a health issue that is taking place it's a learning lesson right now for you\nUm and it's time for you to grow and you have to be able to to trust that it's not going to be this way all the time\nAnd I know that might sound cliche but I'm calling these cards around you and it tells me that you know you're really trying I'm ... but you're having a hard time you're like okay where do I begin to let this go on and you're doing a good job of trying to act the part I feel like you're going through your daily day routine to really try and you put it on the math\nBut you're not feeling it is that correct or no [noise] uh right [laughter] yeah okay right\nSo put ... think of it this way right so if you know I see that there's a hailing hand that you have and I used to me you up and go to person feels like a lot of people are the one that comes to when they have an issue is that correct\n\nThat you tend to be the ear that people talk to like someone always there\nYeah yeah [laughter] okay so you need to know that you know you have\nTo have patience with yourself and your situation okay um how many is coming so know that you you are coming to a breakthrough it is going to get better but I think a lot of it is knowing it's going to get better you know you have to put yourself in a place that's like a catch twenty two right so you almost have to feel it\nFeel that strength inside of you again which ... year kind of like well how do I get that back um\nAnd a lot of it is balance right is finding a balancing your life is what you really need to do at this moment\nAlright thanks good luck brandy hope everything works out for you during this time do you do you find Ron in marine that
