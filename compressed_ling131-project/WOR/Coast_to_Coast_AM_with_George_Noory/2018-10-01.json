always tell them not soon enough we get more requests for Dave than any other guest that I've experienced is I've been with the program for ten years and that's a that's because he always brings the goods I Am jazz that he always allows me to get the first interview when he unveiled a new book and like the other books this new one does not disappoint\nA Davis you probably know spent Twenty years in law enforcement then worked in the tech industry for a bit but found as true calling as an investigator of unusual disappearances and his work in that area has become a phenomenon known all over the world multiple books a documentary film\nAnd maybe some other surprises become Dave great have you back\n[noise] hey George I'm always humble that anyone even wants to listen to listen to me though or appreciate the invite\nOne to say you know I noticed something as I was reading the new book today\nThat you make some personal observations than I Am not a I haven't seen it you go this far in the other books I insights\nInto your own emotional reactions to some of these cases and it seems clear like the subject really gets to yeah you've got I think eleven hundred and thirty five cases that you profiled over the years thousands more they'd be looked into\nSome of them really seemed to get into your head though I I think in part because of similarities or some of the missing to your own life right\n[noise] you know I think that's true um I've been very fortunate to me family of people who have been lost\nAnd when you meet these people it really brings brings home the emotion and [noise] there's a lot of parallels to my life with a lot of these families and I've written about people that remind me of myself a lot of times and uh [noise]\nI've put in the book just recently ... probably because it's it's more of an evolution of my writing and\nHopefully people see that you know hey if people are really really good people these are the Drake who is fighting these are the upper echelon and it it's a conundrum to me why I don't\nFind people that are down and out in life that are disappearing but it it seems to me that it's always the high rollers the people that are high performers that are disappearing\nYou know one place in the new book you mentioned how as a rule you did not reach out to the families of the missing now sometimes you meet him ... due to various circumstances but in general you don't call somebody up out of the blue and say hey can I talk to you about your dad loved one or you're missing loved one because it seems like an invisible line that you don't want to cross over but I Wonder\nHas the success of your books help in the sense that these families now reach out to you that they're unsatisfied say with the the search effort or something and they're they're turning to you for some help her answers\nThat has happened and uh [noise] I don't want to inject myself into a search or into the turmoil that evolving with somebody disappearing now somebody reaches out want some help absolutely I'm going to be there I'll do everything I can [noise]\nAnd there's been cases just recently where that's happened and I've been glad to help and ah\nI've kinda guided them and it it seems that a lot of these families uncovered the same sort of issues time and time again and frustrating as heck to sit back and hear the frustration and their voice a\nCommon one is is it seems as though when jurisdictions stop searching they get to a point seven to ten days and they say hey there's nothing else we can do there's no place else to search\nA we're running out of resources we've got to stop well many times families and friends rally at that point and they get a group together and they keep searching for what I tell these people is you've got to get a copy of those reports that the jurisdiction wrote search and rescue reports the\nLaw enforcement report the who they interviewed who they talked to were they searched the effectiveness of the search or the areas they completely eliminated in the in the areas that they thought that they still should search more because without that you really searching blind\nAnd there's been in for chef lately where people have said no they said they won't give us anything\nI find that baffling\nWell I mean that's how they've treated you I was gonna ask you the same question about different agencies I Know how the national Park Service feels about you and that they are we should anybody who has not heard your earlier interviews or is not familiar with the books you might be listening tonight\nI'm maybe we start there where you can explain the history of your interaction with the national Park Service the forest service\nGovernment entities in general because they've shut you out I mean I guess I I'm interested to learn that they're doing the same thing to the families of the missing but ah it's really kind of clear over the big picture that they don't want to help solve these mysteries\n[noise] you know it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction so when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found\nDisappearances in their parks where they had worked that bothered um didn't make sense when they tried to find information they couldn't and they thought somebody with an investigative back right on to be looking into it [noise]\nAnd a sort of how it all started and I filed a series of the freedom of Information Act of course the confessional Park Service they have the largest\nWatch our

people who've gone further than that pretending to be you can you address that very moment before we jump into the cases\nFor this is one of the most frustrating parts of the you know in the public spotlight I go to conferences all the time people come up to me and they say so you said this or how did you come up with that\nAnd I'm thinking I never said that and there's a series of YouTube sites\nThat have the name David polite is missing for one one missing a national parks there all frauds they're not me there are people that have used my name to get innocent and listeners to get on and every time you click through they get paid by their Google Ads\nThe only site that has me is a candidate missing project YouTube site all the rest are not me in fact about eighty percent of them when you click in and you listen if you don't know it's somebody else talking about some other topic and it's not even me at all so\nI tried to tell us that people don't trust YouTube really don't even listen to him a less effect can't and missing projects site that's the only real site that you're going to get honest information from\nAll right um talk for a moment about search and rescue\nParameters because that that information becomes key to you picking the cases that ... on I mean there are metrics there are there's data um for search and rescue um how how they proceed and and I a huge database I Would think that gives clues about which cases stand out as being unusual\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the reports that they generate and\nThe national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports now find name a specific date and a specific time and that person has been rural to be a missing and presumed deceased\nAnd are found impossible distances away sometimes they're alive amazingly enough but I'm often found impossible distances away and there is no way no way they could walk there on their own or talk about that than up\nSo there's a couple of sites that talk about my work and talk about these cases and the couple of people have chimed in and said well you know Dave talks about people in this books that have been found and there's no mystery there they obviously haven't read the books and they don't understand the rationale behind why these stories are important [noise]\nSo you've got a two year old child that's in the middle of the wilderness with their friends or their family and they disappear and that child sound say three thousand feet higher in elevation and six miles away in a day and a half\nA well I don't know many parents to think that there are two year old could make that track\nBut that's not it I mean when I started to accumulate the data on it in off the grid the book before this one I had a list that accumulated\nThat probably there's fifty a cases in their starts off with the case let's say a four year old missing in Australia found five days later forty five miles away across the desert\nOf four years old I'm there's other cases where two year old in Florida found twenty miles away through the swamps ah another two year olds in Australia found Fifteen miles away in three days two years old\nA three year old found Fifteen miles away twenty four hours not possible in my book\nBut I mean there's a long long list of these and why did I start to accumulate that data because in search and rescue manuals that says that a two year old should be found Ninety five percent of the time in a radius of two miles or less from the point last seen these numbers absolutely blow that to smithereens\nIt's something search and rescue people don't want to talk about don't want to address that want to even think about\nAnd I can understand why because there's no way you could plan a search\nThirty miles away for a two year old it just you don't have enough people to do it\nAnd you have to work for that Ninety five percent tile but the problem is and all these books they don't talk about the other five percent anywhere I'm probably the first person that's ever talked about it\nBut as you state how are these kids making this extraordinary distance\nAnd extraordinary heights\nWhen I go to a conference I always ask people how many people in the room or parents you know Ninety percent of people raised their hands and I said if I said okay you you're just going to set your child down in the dirt on a trail walk away we'll watch the child what's that child going to do for the next hour\nThey said well maybe it'll crawl under Bush and go to sleep maybe they'll play in the dirt for a while maybe they'll run down the trail for a little bit get upset cry and then go to sleep\nAnd I said how many how many parents and you think your kid would run up hill nobody raises their hand I mean it does happen but it's pretty rare\nBut I have all these examples where these heights have been achieved by these little camp\nOr they cross a couple of mountain ranges or you know it's incredibly difficult terrain sometimes without any shoes on\nA yeah it's got to move\nYou know we talked about a two year old boy that they guest he traveled nine to twelve miles in nine hours over two mountain ranges\nAnd he was found face down and snow the next morning unbelievably alive and we found that guy years later and interviewed him and he has no recollection of what happened and it's his mom said we couldn't believe we found them and we couldn't believe he was alive\nDon't have a case in the new book ah in Southern California the Lucerne valley bill Hanks this was back in Nineteen fifty six is the child is five years old at the age of disappearance\nAnd you do the math on a bill I guess if he had walked nonstop for twenty four hours he didn't have to go point six miles per hour\nBut kids are going to war for twenty four hours with no food or water um it it seems just impossible\nUnless somebody picked him up for some something or someone picked him up and blocked him there\nAnd and the reason you have significant is that what you report on a child has abducted in downtown [noise]\nAnd they're found in West Los Vegas three hours later the trial for what you know sure somebody put 'em in the car and drove down there but when you're talking in the middle of the wilderness happening and when you talk about this happening when the\nPeople in the party and anybody never talk to anybody and when they check the trail walks nobody else was there nobody saw anything nobody sonic cars nobody else was there so how did that trial make the difference in that time doesn't make\nA in the new book uh it's law L.

Ga an organ pipe cactus national monument and it's an Arizona far southern part of the state right near the border with Mexico on February third Nineteen Seventy one\nA woman thirty two years old named Carol Turner who was a student at the University of New Mexico drove there and was going to take a few days vacation and break from school and kind of walk around she was inquisitive smart athletic brilliant\nSome people called er [noise] well I stumbled onto this case and saw it and some archive somewhere and I immediately wrote to the Pima County sheriff and ask them for any documents on that case\nI got the documents in my hand then I called the national Park Service at organ pipe and ask them for their reports amazed added a we don't have any I said have you heard of the case no well this person's still missing\nSo she was a thirty two year old graduate student she had been a PE teacher with a master's degree in physical education decided she wanted to go back and get to more masters degrees\nAnd she ... she was just really admired by all of the faculty that she worked around and and studied under and all the articles and all the report said that they stayed at she was really smart [noise]\nWhile she was about to graduate with a degree in sociology and biology and she was working and you're a university lab tech to earn some extra money [noise] she loved the outdoors type regularly\nOn January thirty first Seventy one she left her residence in southeast Albuquerque [noise] she was driving her white sixty eight Plymouth station wagon and she went about an eight hour drive to the monument\nAnd she slept in her car that first night February first it was established that she attended an evening ranger presentation at the end of that presentation she went up to the ranger engage them in conversation he remembered it and said hey she asked really good questions and want smart\nFebruary second she went to the park visitors center spoke to a ranger they're stating she had just returned from a hike to bowl pasture and asked about a guy the trip to a place called dripping springs\nSubsequent investigation found she spoke to a ... a ranger an individual named Larry Henderson you said he ... he remembers or ask good questions was interested in the environment wander nowhere to go to see more things\nOn February third she moved to your car out of the campground nobody knew exactly why and on February forth at nine Fifteen and I am a ranger was patrolling and found carols car parked in s this canyon picnic site\nWith a note taped inside the windshield\nAnd it said if I'm not backed by four thirty pm on February through these contact the ranger\nSmart smart thing to do\nExactly you know I Wish everybody would do that\nBut then as I went through this I started to think she was going to a place and she was heading to a place that she went to earlier and I always wondered in the back of my mind did something happened that first trip and she was going back to the second time and just in case she was leaving the snow I wasn't sure\nSo he purchased patrol vehicle and he had the two miles up from bull pasture he saw nothing and decided to check the trail register and it was signed by Carol the first day she went on February second he notified park headquarters advise them that he has a missing hiker and this starts the search process\nFebruary fourth and fifth national park service and sent in to Forman teams up that trail the search whether it was described and reports is cold and blustery they\nDetermined Carol was last seen eating an orange on the trail and they did find some spare orange peel scattered around\nThe Pima County sheriff was asked to join the search when the national Park Service started to get low on resources they also called in the border patrol and the tribal police US Customs month an air force base\nThey brought in civilian helicopters was massive the search for three hundred

chief ranger Roswell boils\nAnd it was three type written pages that outlines of search for Carole and Ninety percent of it real boring real mundane for radio what it says one additional ... was turned up on Monday February fifteenth\nToo limited locations about four hundred yards the park on the south west facing of the host AJ or less\nA very strong in distinct human odor was found but no

feelings on the ... the odor\nThe following day ranger cos after flying the area and a border patrol plane letting eat man search party back over this area again the odor was observed at the same location but only occasionally and not as distinct\nOther members of the team described it as a very weird and scary\nAll efforts were negative and search activities have been reduced to intermittent patrols at this time\nI have never and thousands of reports\nSeen anything described in a national park service report of very weird and scary\nFlight guys that yeah\nThat's really strange just a feeling they had or the fact that they're smelling what they think is decaying human flesh but there's no source for the older\n\nWell here's what it says other members of the team described it as a very weird and scary\nSo I'm sure all of us who spent time in the outdoors have spent have smelled the odor of dead flash decaying sometime animals die smell it I don't know if that could be weird and scary\nBut ah again\nThis was her second hike into that area which she nervous about making the trip is that why she left a note to where she just smart about it they never found her there was never

into one of the most baffling cases involving water that's a guy named Henry McCain and this is really pretty creepy\nThat is a creepy case and ah [noise] the new Brighton Minnesota it's a community just north of Minneapolis not very far almost the suburb September seven two thousand Fifteen to twenty eight am it happened [noise] McCabe was thirty two years old\nSo uh he was an immigrant from Liberia married to a woman named cream their two kids lived in a city called mounds view again just north of Minneapolis north side this is a cost her area of missing people that I've written about in the past\n[noise] he had a great job he was an auditor for the state of Minnesota for the department of revenue\nOn September sixty thousand Fifteen his wife with kids or went to California and it was a planned vacation well on that Sunday night Henry went out with a long time friend who is a very diligent guy always on time very respectable\nAnd he and his friend went to the club early they laugh early on that Monday morning and ... states that he dropped him off at a location in friendly at the super gas station or a Seventy third avenue\nAt two twenty three am Henry phone appears Trump pocket dial this wife while she was asleep and California and left the link the voicemail strange sounds screaming paintings growls et cetera\nAnd a guy from uh Finland did some amazing work\nSent me this booklet of things that he did and in there he said Dave did you know that there's six major disappearances\nIn Bermuda Triangle that matched dates of disappearances in your books\n[laughter] I never even knew that and then went back through it and he was right and that got me to start paying attention to these triangles\nNow in the Nevada try and go down there by you know it goes from Reno Las Vegas to Fresno that's the triangle and when I first got onto that I thought you know it seems kind of hocus pocus I don't know if I should pay attention but then I put it on a map I said holy crap you\nKnow what's in the middle that triangle\nJust national park yeah\nI go that's quite a coincidence so Yosemite kings canyon and sequoia national parks are there and I've got tons of disappearances in king canyon and sequoia as well [noise]\nAnd when I watched a documentary about the Nevada Triangle there's several thousand planes that have crashed and disappeared in this year is in that area\nAnd a lot of it can be explained by various meteorologist as strange air currents things which seems reasonable\nBut when you bring into account that there is also many many people that have disappeared\nIn that area under unexplained circumstances seems kind of a strange coincidence\nWell let's get into some or do you have any specifics from the ... were you when you get into or should we just go you jump into the cases of air disappearances in general\nIt was just go to air disappearances\nYou have a case in the books from Moffett Field Sunnyvale, California from Nineteen forty two what's the deal on that one\nSo that's a I grew up not far from off the field in Sunnyvale I grew up ... you know and I had planes flying into Moffett Field going right over my house every day of the week and it had notoriety in the early forties for being a place where all the blimps\nThat patrolled the coast of California that's where they were stationed in there and Treasure Island in the middle of the day [noise]\nWell in August sixteenth Nineteen forty two a blimp was getting are sent out of Treasure Island where they held the world's fair there was a man by the tenant earners Cody twenty seven years old and ... and Charles McAdams thirty eight years old [noise]\nAnd uh they've left Treasure Island no big deal general patrol all the details on this came from the navy file under a freedom of Information Act I filed fascinating report on this\nWell as they depart they ah start to head out over the Golden Gate and they start to go out over the Pacific towards the feral on islands in Cody was at the controls of an L. E. airship and this was originally taken by our military and it was owned by\nYear and they took it because there was a a needed for patrol\n[noise] we'll both men lived near Moffett Field in Mountain View but they drove up to a treasure island for the day to leave on their ship\nOr that night water vapor was in the air and it made the ship too heavy to carry a normal third person that would be in the bucket they only left with to\nThe first hundred and ten minutes of the flight was normal in fact there was no communication\nSeven fifty am the crew radio that they were investigating a suspicious oil slick and there were five miles to the fair on islands at eight oh five numerous attempts by radio to reach the crew but there was no luck\nAnd the navy scramble to over to you kingfisher aircraft out of Alameda naval air station to track down the ... [noise] on a plane and counter cloudy weather with a feeling of five hundred feet they decided it was too dangerous to fly below the crowd for the bubble [noise]\nCan forty five AM Moffett you'll receive a call from Fort fund the near the Golden Gate stating that they are to Eli ship with two pilots and all we're fine\nWell the navy made a huge sigh of relief and they felt that all was okay now this was a really really weird call but it was an ... file and they couldn't explain why there [noise]\nAnd then in a weapon Fifteen for fun and calls Moffett Field again they didn't get that in LA had crashed in the hills but Daly city Daly city is just south of San Francisco on the coast\nOr the navy response to Daly city and they find their airship on the ground with one bomb missing the gone to a near perfect condition both motors on the ship or off even though one trial was half open and the other was all the way open [noise]\nAnd the crew which was required were white preserves over the water bowl of white preserver that they were supposed to be wearing were gone there was a confidential maybe briefcase in each a airship and that was still intact the cabin door was open plenty of fuel within the ...\nThe written in perfect condition no distress call\nFor fun and called back and say they they made a serious mistake know LA was present at the Fort they couldn't explain why they made that original call [noise]\nCentral coast of California had a major search started almost immediately the manager found to fishing boat and navy boat in a postcard ship that saw the blimp dip and drop to wears on the oil slick\nThe when then gained altitude and disappeared into the crowd is it all pure fairly normal but it did go into the crowd and disappear the crash happened at four thirty to build you stream Daly city three miles east of the Pacific ocean\nThe crew did not use parachutes and shoots that we're in a craft were still there [noise]\nThere was a couple of theories that I'm Sorry to interrupt you there was a couple of theories that developed a ended the theories are just about as weird as the disappearances or we're going to go to a break and when we come back we're in the jump into the other details about this case and then I get your take on what might have happened to these two missing crew people\nEnded a break with the journey wheel in the sky\nFind them more of us and I just logged on to go to ... am done\n\nAre you considering a safe or gun safe to secure your valuables and firearms if so before you spend any money on any typical running a ... check out the amazing handcrafted rhino iron works shapes and rhino safe dotcom she for yourself why rhino saved customers are so passionate about their antique industrial\nStyle safes and if you're a gun owner you'll love the convenience of the swing outgoing rack\nAnd rhino save dot com you'll get free curbs I delivery a great warranty\nService so they'll do rhinos safe dot com today ... saved dot com\nI just ate hundreds of dollars by switching to go I'd never sell more lives\nDisclaimer go cannot guarantee you will feel\nMore alive you wind up with us from respiratory circulatory system or you belong or you are on the if you aren't due to bring soldiers on me and you would like to save money on car insurance but like a legal team up all your excellent life choices even though ... we strongly encourage you to go dot com or download the guy go out please the minimum of five hundred feet away from our large and presumably delicious delicious brains\nGeico Fifteen minutes could save you Fifteen Percent or more\n[noise] Shelley you will are nearly you ask you a teacher in New York\nAnd we all have to do list so what's on yours maybe taking the car for an oil change getting a haircut well what about maybe losing twenty pounds\nA Sean Hannity year and I can't help but those other things but I Do have the answer to losing weight and it's called and Jay diet and within Jay diet patients typically lose twenty to fifty pounds and only forty days or you get money back so don't wait make the call to my friends at N.

that said five five five and Jay diet or in Jay diet dot com\n[noise] and this is talk station you read is number one seven in W. all our voice of New York and high\nThat's one eight hundred four hundred seven one four or five one eight hundred\nFour hundred seven one four or five\n[noise]\n\n\nBefore the break we are talking about this US Navy blimp it's patrolling off the coast to California and uh the blimp comes back crashes on land the crew is gone they pick up the story from there\n[noise] the navy did their investigation and they said that uh there was no fire on board\nWhen it hit the beach originally when it hit land it drop one of its bombs accidentally that made the blimp wider was able to take off again and crashing that daily neighborhood [noise]\nThere was massive search off the coast that went on for days and they never found anything they review radio Bob there was no call for help\nThey could never explained why the blimp went straight up into the crowds after dropping the players\nAnd they thought that it would have stayed lower to watch the flick that they were watching on the water there were lots of water craft in that area they never found the crew or the emergency survival equipment that they were wearing\nAnd there's an area outside the Golden Gate that I've written about many times before because just north of San Francisco [noise] yup point raised national park which has had several strange disappearances I've documented and just south\nOf the Golden Gate to a location called half moon bay in that area of the coast I've written about other disappearances that are very very strange no they're part of the northern California coast north of that coin raise area [noise]\nAnd nothing immediately south half moon bay so it's this one area that have the strangeness attached to it [noise] and like you said that they came up with some explanation for to me that were laughable\nWell like ah maybe they got into an argument and uh and both fell off or maybe one of them accidentally fell over and the other guy tried to save him and was pulled into the water or I mean could that could does not have happened\n... ... what do you think George [laughter]\nWell I'm just asking you did to respond to those stories that doesn't seem like a there was any kind of a disturbance sign of disturbance in the in what was left or the craft or a and if they were wearing their life jackets you'd think that they would still be had been floating around out there when the when the search was underway\n[noise] or even if they come out of their life jackets they would have recovered the jak\nRight because the the area of the water that was searched out there with search so thoroughly and eventually those jackets are gonna wash up the shore and they would have recovered them on the beach so oh these explanations absolutely made no sense at all\nYou have another case from Scotland a that was held Nineteen Seventy five\nBefore I get into that if I Want to address something that you said just after the break and that was an explanation that fits the facts and I immediately thought of skin Walker ranch you know\nGive is going to bring this up at some point um you know as I read this book today um I notice that you you've ventured a little bit farther than you have in previous works or in the land in the air disappearances there's the Fred let Frederick ... case which is a famous UFO case\nThere's also a reference to a needs a National Institute for discovery science which was the organization that was studying skin Walker ranch in and several of the cattle mutilation that had happened in the winter basin\nAnd the circumstances where it looked like these cows had been dropped from the sky some of them disappeared altogether but some of them or their their legs were broken as if they'd been dropped from the sky several of your cases I thought the same thing in multiple missing poor woman books that looks like people are snatched down of the off the ground\nAnd then some of them are dropped back into these odd locations little kids that are suddenly miles and miles away I it it seems like I Know you don't want to commit to\nAny particular explanation because you don't have enough evidence to a to point to one in particular but some of this stuff\nCertainly ventures into the area of the paranormal and um I wanted to share this with the audience that I don't know David how how closely you follow the UFO a topic I Know you sometimes you get into those subjects but\nIt's been an amazing nine or ten months a where all these documents are coming out about government studies of UFOs the Pentagon's ongoing interest and one of the stories that I was able to break earlier this year was about skin Walker ranch that a program that have been created by the Pentagon\nOr to look at UFOs also went much further that it it studied what we would call paranormal events unexplained mysteries at places like skin Walker ranch and elsewhere\nAnd I'm at Jeremy core bell is made a film about it and I included in that film and is a reference to our book which\nHad been read in Washington it turns out an earlier this year I was invited to go back by Senator Harry Reid to meet with some people whose names I cannot um cannot make public\nBut they are they gave me sort of a download on the UFO mystery and what some of the research had uncovered and um and ... as well as additional information and some of that has been made public but the one of these guys pulled me aside\nHe had a at an ongoing interest in skin Walker ranch and other mysteries related to it and he asked a asked me some questions about the ranch and then he said\nYou know we think that that guy de ... that um that his mystery with these missing people might be related to the phenomena at the ranch and I asked a couple of questions that didn't seem to have a real solid answer or not one that they would share with me but\nThe idea that the phenomenon that's been seen there which is sometimes playful and sometimes dangerous might be related to yours startled me and I don't know how you react to that but maybe it makes you uncomfortable or being associated with anything as weird as that but you're stuff's pretty weird too\n\nSo how would you rank this person's credibility and integrity on a topic like this\nUm I'd say this person that I'm Talking about knows more about it than anyone and I don't mean just in the military I mean anyone or he's this person has seen a lot of stuff that the the public has never seen so you know he he has a\nVery broad spectrum and a very broad knowledge base about what we would call paranormal including UFOs and alleged abductions and things of that sort so I don't know exactly how your a phenomena fit in with a larger picture but the idea that somebody who's been looking at it is a I think that's pretty interesting\n[noise] well that's a wake up call [laughter] think so um [noise]\nSo you know way back when we first started to talk about the ranch I really put an emphasis on that area to see if there was anything related to disappear if I could sing my teeth into [noise] they could relate it to the activity there [noise]\nAnd you know there's really nothing around that ranch that I could say is related to missing people that I study\nBut ethics seated before sometimes I think I I relate it to law enforcement and if you have a say a series of bank robberies\nThe bank robbers aren't ever going to do a bank robbery in their neighborhood because they don't want to draw attention to it\nAnd I've always stated that I think that this is related to the profile points I I gave you one of those is water and when you look at Mississippi and Louisiana say it's just filled with water I have no cases from there it's bizarre\nAnd isn't George isn't there a lake fairly near that ranch\nYeah it's ... it's a reservoir it's called bottle hollow\nUm it's a manmade lake but the what's right in the middle of the ... reservation in the ... ah control that property and they allow camping and fishing and swimming and things of that sort but at the lake is a a\n... has a long history of really weird stuff creatures have been seeing there and the objects coming in and out of the water and there but a lot of drowning said that uh the the ... tribe believes that ah there's something in the water that pulls you down a lot of people at Brown there and ah\nSo ... you're right I get asked all the time if there's anybody in the vicinity the ranch you meet your criteria who's banished like that and I have to say no\nOther than animals livestock things that's or but no people have a banished then I Know of course we haven't really dug into the historical archives or to the extent that you have but I think that some of that\nWork is being done right now anyway it's uh it it was a it struck me as a significant that the person who told me that in D.C had brought up your books and and your subject matter\nI Want to try to get one more of these air disappearances in before the bottom of the break because I I think I'm going to open up the phone lines

in proximity different dimensions but they can interact even thousands of years ago they talked about abductions but the ... to\nTalk about what they look like what the realms were like what they did anyway so I just encourage you to do that but here's the story this is true\nIt it was before nine gene Ninety six I used to live in Rochester\nBut I was living in California I drove across the country many times I went to visit some friends of Rochester ah I'll Try and find out the exact date but right now I Can't I'm going to send you an email by the way I'll say I spoke to you\nOn the Appalachian Trail from Rochester to Philadelphia you there's ways to drive in many places in the Appalachian Trail you can pull off the road and just walk and take a nice walk on the trail and one time I did that in the afternoon\nAnd there was a man or woman and a boy and a couple of other people walk in one direction and we started talking and walking within five minutes another family came from around al ... similar to me out of nowhere\nAnd picnic tables right near there and the one woman who I was very suspicious of that just appeared\nSaid Hi to the other one and she had a girl and the shuttle can our kids play and the the the people that I had been walking with the mother said yeah and we shut down at a picnic table and the the strange woman said to the other lady that I had remark was what's your name [noise]\nThey they tell the name and the woman says that's our name too and then about three minutes later the lady looks into boys gone and she starts calling them and I\nUp and walk around and swear to God I Am not making this up\nThere was a close creature over the boy the boy had passed out or I don't know if the creature bump them but this is the part I Want you know it had kinda futuristic very tight fitting clothes it jumped this creature look humanoid\nBut not totally human it jumped\nAt least twenty feet from the ground without running jumped up to the the middle of a tree where the you know the branches start coming out\nAnd then I just turned around and I went back I didn't say a word I was scared I thought that the creature and those people that appear were part of the same group I thought they were military people and this creature was a genetic hybrid says what I Believe [noise]\nWell that's quite a story or Dave any reaction to that\nKnow

yeah I wrote a story my last book one right before the [noise] about a story a Spanish priest in Texas that was running from Native Americans and came up on this giant pizza pink granite in Texas it's a state park [noise]\nAnd he said that as he ran up to the top of the granite it opened up and swallow with him and he said that he was inside the Boulder gift and made it for three days\nAnd then he said at the end of the third day it's that amount and that's the only story I've got like that and uh people probably don't know this but there's stories of Iceland\nThat they will move road when they're building it before they will blow up a piece of granite or big Boulder because they have a bully in their society that things are living inside of those voters\nHave a ... a missing for one
