armpit\nAnd the cancers traveled all the way down to the muscle the ... so she got a biopsy she got stage up she came to me and the first thing she says she wants to keep our breath she doesn't want to lose or brass you went to other doctors who was the first thing I Want to do is to give her a chemo and\nTo do mastectomy and she just does not want came out she does not want ... to me and so she's decided to come with us\nFor treatment to try to get this cancer under control to control the cancer and to let her live\nBetter have her life and we saw another woman with a left breast cancer

butter is like a big reservoir to hold the urine so much of it as a muscle that pushes the urine out into space\nBut the rest of it as a lightning and the cancer the bladder usually not always but usually starts aligning\nAnd this man had blood in the year and he was found to have a flatter cancer each with having scraping for years and now the surgeon wants to remove the bladder and the man doesn't want that he knows that by removing the bladder loses prostate ... sexual life you will never urinate normally it's a big operation not everyone makes it through the operation\nAnd he just does not want to have surgery on his bladder and this is of course the work we do we treat many people are cancers for that reason people want to keep their life people want to keep their way of life

about the inventory still in the dream still or right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we start to move forward and in the dreams della a top most for\nAnd the pay for that my new published last week is on his website we're going to be discussing this uh tonight on the show\nIt's like on my news website over a coast to coast to I'm going to take history there there are a list of papers on the right hand side the current neighbor is the one that is on the town\nNow with your analysis here minute it gets a little complicated a little technical but the idea behind it is actually quite simple in an elegant which is is that some of the layers\nHave a different thickness in stone and take us through bad\nYeah um when when you when you're standing in front of the pyramid and you look up the walls are you when you stand close you don't notice there's so much but when you go further away let's say you're in your hotel and you have a pyramid view\nYou start noticing that there is a certain texture to the pyramid and um ah the review or a who was it was very well known a jump jump here who don't we reviewed my paper or he calls the waves and I call it sort of a federal effect\nUm and so when you look at the details of that which was published by plane as petri a hundred and fifty years ago who actually measured each individual course\nAs a function of total height\nYou then you actually see the numbers and so there is these uh you know you you start with really thick courses\nAnd as you get to the top of the courses get thinner but every once in a while there is a jump so uh you have a much thicker corps\nAnd then the thickness tapers off and then it resumes the overall trend which is a thinning trend and then you have another sudden jump in thickness and just keeps on going and going for twenty three times as far as I'm as far as I see there's twenty three peaks like that [noise]\nUm and ah and then before each one of these jobs petri noted that uh if you calculate the surface area of course and you divide that surface area by the surface area at the base some of these peaks\nHave rounds fraction of twenty fifth so you know one twenty fifth to twenty fifth ... so you found that there are round fractions of twenty fifth associated with some of these ... courses and that was it uh it was not for interpreted what does it mean\nA it was just noted but uh it just sat there um until I took a look at it again\nNow how many layers total and ... and the forty two story great German how many rows\nYeah two hundred three left and probably two hundred and ten a originally\nTwo hundred and ten originally is there and I have to have to immediately say there are some researchers who said the\nPyramid was not completed there was a they say there was there was a virtual top so it was actually ... at the top and the rest was a maybe a as fear and you know one of the the most prominent researcher who was proposed this is Robert ... bother jump off of all\nAnd the papers on I think it's on a Robert ... vaults or\nAcademia a page and it's also in costs me gloom ah his brother vote to attend these he's in the back of the book where he explains this theory so there are some people that I think the pyramid was not coming to a peek a and now of course other people say it was ... and so theoretically at least you can say two hundred and of course\nNow we have is there a consistency to the ah repeating of the ticker layers\n[noise] um\nIs it every ten steps that every ... there's some kind of ... you\nKnow I that's a great question I I that was the first thing also I was looking for it but unfortunately I unfortunately no it's not that easy it's it's kind of it's you know Jimmy it's kind of haphazard has to be honest with you I I'm I was just struck by when I first saw that I was just struck why did they do this\nUm because you know you were you could just you know simple mine that I thought each step they weren't just a applied the uh the pyramid and go you know in Egyptian the Egyptians designed their parents with uh something called they call it the set that which is the pyramid angle\nAnd it's a you know when you walk up a staircase basically for each amount that you go up you go a certain amount forward and that's how the conceptual eyes a pyramid and go so I thought you know each course it should be the same amount like you're going up a staircase each step is the same\nAnd and it's not and and ah and all of a sudden you know the steps gets much thicker\nAnd to question again there's little regularity even to that thickness as so when you know it's it's completely off hazardous but of course now I think I Know the answer it has to do with the interior architecture it has to do with spaces inside\nAnd we'll get to that or after the break but what is the most amazing to me about this is that with the different layers of which there are\nA couple of dozen veteran decker yeah that the orientation for the pyramid that it still ended up at the right angle on all four sides\nYeah a to complete the pyramid correctly without any errors but that's an engineering feat that is just beyond comprehension that\nWhich which to me I Want it to correct something I said in the fate to block interview I I think I said that uh the ... to ... um shot a shop to ... and ... published that al ... was disappearing or during\nThe twenty seventh century so I I wanted to correct that it wasn't an arcade into big tipper it was a star Iraq so it was starting to disappear in the southern part of the country\nAnd because of that because that constellation big tipper was so important to Egypt shows that the authors propose that therefore they began to oriented oriented monuments to another part of the of the big tipper and why the pyramids ended up in that end up north south uh orientation do\nI Want to jump in right there this his coast to

again I Want everybody to go over and get the reference at my news website it is a Chiapas pyramid dot com the links are at coast to coast am\nAnd go to the right side scroll down there's a list of published papers right there we're talking about the top one now my new I Want to jump ahead and let everybody know in that PDF\nIf they scroll down to page three twenty six you strike three hundred ... a a scrawled on page three twenty six where you have an illustration there of the layers and with a kind of way showing the grand gallery and of course the kings chamber and the queens chamber the descending passage way\nAnd the ascending passage way up to the grand gallery\nAnd so working from the bottom the first layer up a which we're talking about a road number eight Seventeen Twenty one\nAnd of course thirty for these must have been for you and I want you to take the audience through this but these are game changing moments when you see these alignment these layers weren't they\nThat was a game changing and you're right I'm I'm I'm listing all the peaks you know the total number of peaks was twenty three some of these peaks a or specifically noted by peach tree\nTo have surfaced a ratios that were around ... a number of fractions of twenty fifth so you know six twenty fifty five twenty fifth\nAnd I'm a and those are also this that and it turns out that those courses that are associated with these round fractious tend to run\nA over ceilings in a in that of course we don't have a lot of feelings but the few that we have there seems to be a correlation and thirty four is the most striking one it goes right across the queen\nA chamber and based\nOn this if this observation that there is seems to be a correlation between round fraction twenty or you know courses that have a surface area that is around ... number fraction of twenty fifth\nI Am proposing that the top part of the pyramid where we don't know of any spaces and war but where we nevertheless also see these type of round fractions of twenty fifth that\nThere must be space is just the same up there and I'm saying at least six if not then\nNow we're going to get to that ... exactly that's on page three twenty eight yeah but staying on page three twenty six with this cut away yes you need to have if you are going to propose these extra chambers above the kings chamber where there\nIs supposed to be nothing right but then you have to have some basis for this and clearly we have a I I'm just looking here one two three four five six seven eight\nAbsolute definitive uh marks on these roads starting with the descending passage way all the way up to the top of the king's chamber\nRight so for example of course not a Twenty one which is a ... which has a surface\nArea that is around fraction of twenty fifth Nineteen twenty fifth that aligns with the uh the uh you know ... that ah that guard the entry of to the great pyramid show right that that cost them a Twenty one is right under the V.\nUh so it is in other words it's associate with a feeling than the than the one that we just talked about is a course number thirty four also has a round fraction of twenty fifth sixteen in this case and it runs right over the feeling of the queen chamber\nOr then the other courses don't don't have round fracture the twenty fifth and they're not associated with feelings so it works out very nicely and then we go to the top and then we have eight a we have eight twenty fifth\nAh and that goes across the feeling of the um off the ground at tower\nI'm now there are there are two courses nine twenty fifth and ten twenty fifth and those ... line up with a with a two of the relieving chambers in fact that the tower\nUm and and then the final point I wanted to make is that the possible avoid which I marked in here um that was found last year is also aligning with eight twenty fifth so it's possible that that causes marking not just that granted power but maybe also the possible avoid if it's for real\nWhich we are talking about a rose sixty eight\nA that would be a that would be will eighty four\nNo roe eighty four is at the top of the king's chamber am I reading this correctly\nYou are it's not the top of the king chamber and that also happens to be uh\nKnow within the resolution of this scanned that they were publishing that also is approximately the top of the ... the big boys\nI got it yes of\nCourse we don't know exactly we we just it's kind of have the image so I just kind of like you know painted that into this illustrations just to give a rough guy\nI Want to jump back a really quick I don't want this to get away from me there was a tweet earlier that is a pretty important and this is from eddy\nYeah and and he says does ah does my new see any connection between a dynastic Egyptian use of the lion\nAnd the use of the lion and go back ... taffy and everybody's talking about go back to be today and its relationship with ... and the great pyramid and and the other things throughout dynastic Egypt is there a connection\nYeah that's a fantastic question um and I am actually I'm I'm currently looking into that uh with Robert shark we are um we're trying but I'm not ready to make a statement yet\nOkay but the they used the lion see this is what I find fascinating when we go back on these dates\nAnd we constantly land at ten thousand five hundred BC for a variety of reasons one of course\nUh what was going on with the stars we understand that but then we have all of the\nUh cataclysmic event the end of the ice age the construction of go Beckley tabby the erosion on this thing's all of these things uh Leo Rising right all of these things happen at ten thousand five hundred BC\nYet which makes go Beckley happy not an accident you\nKnow with his references of course with lines to as low extraordinary\nYeah no absolutely it's a fantastic question and I don't want to you know jump the gun because I Can't really speak with authority yet I'm so maybe the next show um maybe we'll have something more but it's a great question\nLet's go to a um I'm gonna get to the top half of the pyramid and we're going to work on that in a second but got some calls that have been holding for quite a while to speak with you my new let's go to Barry in South Carolina Barry welcome back to coast\nHello there ... and you know what I'm getting ready to say yeah man\nYeah go ahead Barry did yours\nGo back ... Kathy\nYou liked the minute you like to the area okay\nA day or our love hearing is that all that you may have more do you play so great for me to have the power\nAnd thank you bury what do you have for a minute tonight\nTheir remedies um and this ... I Believe tapes to the middle kingdom and and to reach us back a most likely a probably to him or taps time so um if there were there were very skilled positions or the ancient Egyptians I'm\nThe second part yeah Ken Mitch and uh which was the name of Egypt of course kind of a ... that's an\nExcellent question and I'm just going to give you a quick answer as quick as I can so um as far as we understand it the Egyptian language originally was a composite of two different cultures the one culture was the southern Egyptian culture\nAnd that script was mostly phonetic um and the evidence from that comes from ... a king Scorpio\nAnd that is I think were the African roots sly\nThe other script a that was intermingled initially comes from northern Egypt uh probably from Bhutto\nAnd Bhutto was a sort of a trading a settlement in in the delta and they were trading with ah probably mess up with the with the live on and so they had a different kind of script that was mostly a fixture oh so it was picked up graphs\nUm so what you saw what it meant while in the south what you hear is what it meant and so I think your question is very well taken and I think yes I think the uh the southern Egyptian script was probably a originally Africa maybe you don't ... hair or maybe I'm maybe even further south and that\nAnd she brought up another really good point before we get to the break we've got about thirty seconds Manu ... the Greeks adapting a ... a chemistry coming from candidate right\nYes the issue I think she mentioned it stinks so my we we think that speaks was making before uh before I came I think there was we were I think it was a line is and then they must make eat and by the way that's also probably an African of Africa or Joe\nLet's take a break right here coast to

the hour they are completely a jam W looks kind of Thomas in law why Thomas Manu\nJeremy thank you for taking my call Manu ... research you know my question as we have ... and the pyramids the banks have there been any\nIntention to reconstruct the original boring a key subplot to do and I know that sounds radical but for example the great pyramid is missing the capstone and it just seems to me that\nYou could bring in architects archaeologist perhaps with special needs some remote viewing\nInto an intuition and actually reconstruct temples repair the temples half that's been discussed\nYes and as such a great question I'm so there's two answers to that the first one is that uh the\nMinister of antiquities is trying to partially restored a monument so you get a feel for what it may have looked 'em but they don't want to cover it up all with you know modern reconstruction they just want to give you a sort of an idea so they may may they may do a section\nAnd then they leave the rest on touched so that's the first part of your question but there is something even more exciting going on and I have to reference a a Harvard or it's called digital visa and what they're doing and this is on the direction of Peter I'm a new alien um\nThey are basically recreating gays or a a ... in in the virtual world and I predict\nIn a few years you'll be able to uh descend into a virtual world and it will be exactly like the way it looked like the way we think it looked and you'd be able to go into all the chamber's look at the inscriptions and it'll feel like you know uh the real thing and I they're working on it\nNow with these additional chambers in the upper half of the great pyramid where did you come up with the number six or eight\nRight so because we have we have a sequence of ah courses that conform to this uh you know the the simple rules at the surface area is around fraction of twenty fifth\nAnd so and I am pretty convinced that they that the architect wouldn't just waste I'm you know energy to create these sticker courses unless there is a purpose for it so for every single of course that has a round fraction of twenty fifth\nI think there is a space associated with that\nMore and more phone call before the break let's go to school out west to Daniel in eureka California Daniel you're next on coast\nHi um I had a quick question about the uh so he'll watch uh I've heard him many times interviewed on coast to coast over the years and yes apparently he controlled and very closely guarded access to researchers in the public or\nOr to the pyramids in for research and just general public access and I heard that after the um spring Arab Spring uprising or he resigned what is access like now with the new minister and our researchers are given better\nAccess for research in the general public you know I'll take my answer off the air\nGreen question Daniel my new what's it like there now with ... you\nRegarding Dr hot so first of all I had a few email exchanges with him and he's been always very nice very courteous as just the questions and so I've had good experiences with him I've never met in person than he probably doesn't know why I'm\nI'm regarding getting a permit so we are currently applying for a permit um for a small study Robert Robert shock and I are on and I think I'm so I'm hearing mixed messages so on the one hand it sounds like investigators are being invited to come\nOn and on the other hand I'm hearing is that they uh they've become more selective so you know it probably depends on the project they have certain areas where they want research to happen and other areas they feel like it's a it's been exhausted\nUm you know so it's really in their hands and there's nothing you can do about it other than you just try it and see what they do\nWell do you think that the the ... one research would be ongoing like it is it ... was was\nStill the director of their\n... I think he is actually involve a Jimmy he's on the phone on the uh the board of directors\nReviews the data so he is\nInvolved or these not maybe not publicly but it seems he's involved the opposite force at by a ... foot\nUm you know I think they're sort of a mixed back here you know there's the public's eye of a tool you know comes on TV and gives announcements and then there's the the scientist York y'all just loves what he does\nUm you know it's difficult to kind of it all out but I think um you know they they have to strike a balance between protecting the monuments and allowing people to research done and I to be honest with you I understand it you know some of the projects\nThat uh you know you want to do you can't do them because it might destroy the monument so I'm\nWell you're being you're being shaped him political right now and I understand that I knew it and I respect that\nBut there's the other part of this where we have been told for so long if there is nothing to discover there\nAnd that they have not moved from match dance and now it looks like it's going completely in the opposite direction or they had to open ... are they going to have to back pedal\nYeah so it's true the listener's question I think I forgot and goes down you I think right yes\nUm yeah so I think what you're used to call the eleven so I think that has something has changed uh they're sort of a you know people are even talk to some of some of the scholars at the local scholars they feel like you know they have more of a voice that can you know\nA fairly or they can research and I think it's been I think it's been good for the country and I think it's\nGood let me jump in right there I knew I got to take a quick network break this was coast to coast am more by

guess my my new save Saturday\nAnd my new I've I've got to get to some of these calls they're coming in and let let's do that let's get some of these out of the way some of been on hold for quite a while now let's go to the first time caller line Skoda Isaac in Toronto Isaac Europe next time cos ad amount of\nTime you know well I think\nThis is a great show was just trying to ... to ... to one show were which is the looming or\nIs it any other language or would you call ... or you can really get a looming up\nOr what you believe a lot of the show or you know do this for quite a bit so uh [noise] [noise] oh sorry about it a law\nOkay so I said well let me let me jump in I guess what you're asking my new is ah the origin of the word pharaoh and where did it come from from a which which people\n... to ... to\n... to ... the meaning of the pro which it ... the push language\nKush which which is of course by two by four to five years ago yeah ... ... the you know we're talking about a quite of wait for ... years ago\nIt's been ... older than any other language you can put in a bowl of parliament show ... which was\nOf people who is just speak well it's a cush people still it'll which ... which are from the coach which do you think like oh it was a little late it was people well the pilot or\nThey should be you know ... or ... or ... well\nI'm going to I'm going to pass that up to my new I actually have a couple of comments about that Isaac and and thanks for the phone call a minute the origins of the word pharaoh and its meaning\nYeah I I couldn't quite some thanks for interpret I couldn't hear the whole question I Am so so he chipped colleges are saying that uh in the old kingdom a that term was not use\nSo the term pharaoh it's technically speaking doesn't apply to the kings of the old king them I think the first uh I and I can't remember if it middle kingdom or new kingdom when you start using that term uh and that probably means that's when it first appeared and that's\nAll I Know about it offhand I said I've read about this before but I don't want to say something wrong so\nI this is what I remember\nRight in that there's two two points that need to be brought out you're a boomer women were going back to a menace oh I'm In the first and now I'm going to say the word they referred to as kings\nYeah right right like ... and\nMeant is uh the first ah kings of Egypt could be some are saying the same a menace ... may be the same or they could be two different teams they weren't called Barrows\nBack then right and now there's another ah ah I have\nResearch that is a little bit and I find it fascinating that the Kurdish people were the original Egypt ... and the the ... that are there now I'm more more workers or possibly even slaves to the Kurdish people\nYeah um yeah I Can't really comment on it because I don't know enough about it um I I it regarding what the king was called I can tell you that uh by the fifth dynasty the king have five different title\nUm and then the very beginning um you know the kings were called horse king so it was horse in the armor and horse or a ... so\nUh so that that was the first that was the first title and then quickly after a campaign you know the designation or next to invent which is basically referring to operate or Egypt\nAnd then came to to lady's name a you know and then came to cartoonish name later um but uh the as you just set yourself so Farrow came later I I just looked it up if I was like twelve hundred BC is the first time it was used\nThere you go let's go east of the Rockies let's go to Jay out here in Los Angeles in jail you're up next on coast [noise]\nHello\nHello J. lo J. how you guys doing hello how high is there a first time caller long time long time listener\nI'm I Am actually um Egypt churn dissent on mom's side\nAnd I'm growing up as a kid I Would always hear my grandmother to say that leads they tell me a lot of stories that there was always passages from here there there's always secrets to the um\nThe great pyramid has secrets to this to tunnels here oh there you know there's always stories that Graham you know grandkids hear their grandparents say\nThe one that always stuck with me that I really want it to get clarification on I've seen stuff like on line but\nI Try to take it with a grain of salt\nUm I really am glad that you're on the show a ... I wanted to ask you for\nYour um [noise] uh expertise on this if you guys have ever heard is there an opening or any access behind the ... year old on top of their head or anywhere along in that area or maybe the bottom of the paw in the back\nSomewhere like that that has access to an insight chamber of this ... of the things that I'm holds or something very dear to humanity that we are uh [noise]\nWe're not being told 'em all the details of have you have you guys heard any anything like that\nWill shape you're in luck because men who's been researching ... paper about it\nSo I I'm a ... now my new before we get to what's underneath the the on the left front to love from palm uh there has been photographs of the top of this being tried in the ground up or what appears to be a hat\nTo roll but and I have also read a lot of research about uh the right here uh an entrance behind the right ear that Jay is referencing year so let's talk about uh the head of this thing's first and possible entrances\nYes so there is that there is a space or in inside the head of the things and it's been a basically locked up there's a there's a little hatch\nAnd I'm I'm I think Roberts ah ... was telling me about this I think uh you can there's you can't stand in there it's maybe six foot deep\nI'm but I'm not sure it goes anywhere I from my understanding is it's basically a blind LBJ but um but you know maybe there's some maybe there is a a hatch hiding somewhere but I don't know about that\nUm I can tell you that the uh you know the ... um they have a ... of course they have an extensive labyrinth charter under this thing's a and this was published in the thirties by a a chronic a person that was chronicling there was a crucial\nAnd that message ends up on our end somehow it causes someone to do something that they otherwise wouldn't have like you know design a pyramid\nUm I think it's possible I I think it's on the table I'm not going to close my mind to it is but we have to have some proof I I I I mean I'm I'm not going to embrace a theory like that until I see from solid proof of it but I think it's on the table\nLet's go to the international line right Robin Vancouver Rob really quick before we hit the brake what do you have permanent\nAbsolute on her speech you guys really quickly a notion struck me when you talked about structured spaces or look or make it quick couple of quick germs laundry\nLooking at the idea of a Greek scare the architect from all the tremendous job trends were big John charging tempers are forming old knowledge building big garbage structures\nAh who's to say I mean it'd be good to you know I guess people assume that the parents will be a periods are solid but\nCould they not maybe just structured spaces be are filled with ...\n... and everything you know arches inside big cavities like Campbell\nYeah Rob go look at a news research paper on his website and and read through it that's exactly the conclusions are that by news presenting in this paper my new we mentioned already six to eight and voids could there be more\nYeah so I I have to you know I've been a neat I have to mention shop here will do so he of course proposed an internal ramp years ago um I think it was Eighteen years ago with Bob Brier they published a book\nAnd he proposed his fifties on logistics basis basically to get the stones up the pyramid and the scan from last year business show it but I think the theory is all that I think it's possible that discount was not sensitive enough to detect those spaces\nAnd then of course I'm proposing that this that there are spaces that are not necessarily logistic I'm saying they could be theological and shop you're dealt with probably disagree with me or you know your review to paper or but he still thinks it's possible that there are logistical spaces in it but you know beat out of it may so we agree there\nAre probably space is up there and um I just want to ask you a quick uh because the pyramid of course who\nIt's it's it's hot spaces inside research is in the sixties wet to offer his pyramid because they thought it can how can it be that we have all these space it's inside you know corporate pyramid budding coffers German all we have is built on each chamber\nWell let me jump in I've got to take a break right there but this is something we need to talk about when we come back or gas my new stateside eight this is all the great pyramid on coast to coast I'll be right back stay with us\n[noise]\nSo much you\n\nTo talk to you meet your goal memorial garden minded

beautiful Sunday Now Monday morning here in Southern California my new uh the phones have been amazing you ready to a head straight back to it let's do it let's go to speaking of Southern California let's go to\nIsn't coated in the ... of him you know\nA numerically that is not not in writing but in the in the language of mathematics um and it's not complicated math it's actually some of the features that Jimmy and I have talked about and some other features that the basic features that we know about the great pyramid\nYou can find them in the ... in the dimensions of the ... of him you know and you know we don't have time to get into it today but the papers on my website\nGo check it out and tell me what you think but I think the answer the question is yes I think this is the world's first example of an architect using his own to him as a blueprint for monuments\nAnd thank you for the call Joe and that paper is underneath the latest papers the second one listed over on my news website and one last question from Twitter before we had to the break this is from dino\nAnd do you know says are there any other pyramids in central and South America that carried the same traits as the ...\nThe traits meaning\nBut just what it says in the winter\nWe don't know yeah um\nI I assume there would be a couple of things that do knows referencing near one would be size in orientation or to true north in may be uh something astrological ah within the alignment\nWell let me let me put it this way so I think I you know I've I've watched this documentary or which is intriguing they're basically saying is that all these monuments are lining up a across the globe and I find that fascinating I and I don't know how to explain that\nIf that is true that would definitely suggest that master plan that you know people were coordinating this this this this building activity and of course that's what Graham Hancock\nA has been writing about four years and uh so I I think it's possible yes but just specifically some of the trades I I Can't really comment because I don't know enough about it\nWe'll let me help you with this idea when we look at the the tops of the the the pyramids in Mexico in Mexico city and the mind structures throughout Guatemala Honduras and believes that the tops of these pyramids there's always some things there\nWhat about the top of the great pyramid is it would do it not not the top top but could there be a chamber or something at the at the upper levels\nYet as well I think so I think that could be that there could be a space or that um connects that connected to the summit\nEr and of course the summit itself I'm you know like I said before John a drop off ... vow has provoked pose that the summit of the great pyramid was not at peak was basically a virtual\nOff and uh and it would have been a you know as fear and it's interesting that the diameter of that fear is a meter a it's a very interesting a very interesting theory and others have proposed similar things there's even a shirt with I think I'm\nA this was first mentioned by a state Jeannie in a night in uh Nineteen Seventy one book by Peter pumpkins that there was this fear on top of the great fear of it is a lot of media and by the sphere so yes I I think I think those theories out there I but I don't know how you would otherwise pool but I'm\nNow you've got to anomalies in ... a a and one is clearly defined edge row one Ninety six and do you do have a ratio there could there be a chamber at the very top\nI asking so how big would it be what I'm looking at those upper rose or the dimensions of the pyramid at that high um how big could chamber be\nI think a chamber like that would be ... may be no more than five feet something like that five feet by eight Hi I'm saying right don't\nMaybe maybe a five six courses or something like that\nUm and it would be it would be difficult to detect it may be on on the ... especially if you have a grand gallery in between which you know the last year ... was from the queen chamber so I think in order to protect these spaces you have to put the place up in a in the uh in the or the chamber of that's off limits right\nYeah and how would you how would you detect more than one chamber ... scan show multiple chambers that were stacked up on top of each other\nYeah maybe not if they're stocked up maybe not but they might not be stocked up um\nThey could be you know like the one for example I mentioned that\nUh Rudolph gumption bring a is suspecting that will be a chamber of that's in the southern part of the pyramid maybe close to the face you know so they may not be stocked up I'm a one way you could do a Jimmy is by putting the plates ensure that knowledge that we talked about you know the one that\nUh who Don and buyer investigated it's up on the south it from the north east side\nYou know the northeast corner right in the\nNorth east corner it's a fairly sizable space you know I mean I I don't know how big the plates are but I Wonder if you could set up the place up there and then you might be able to actually discern the different chambers that made it might be possible\nHow expensive is a ... performed ... studies\nIt seemed like it wouldn't be that expensive because you're just placing the the wage throughout the pyramid and then of course running or computer system it's not like there was any excavations or right right it's not that expensive but\nYeah they have I think they've already spent\nThe main capitals already spent basically uh you know making the plates\nAnd then you know that you have to pay the people to do the experiment I'm guessing multiple a million dollars I think maybe ten ten million or something like that to do this
