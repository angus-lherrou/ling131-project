S. are lined with a with a a waterproof barrier to keep things from leaking out they're covered with dirt every day to keep a a rats another room and the other way\nUm our air is very much a a cleaner since Nineteen eighty\nAre six major air pollutants are all down\nA combined Seventy percent those are the ones that I mentioned the carbon monoxide nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide or water is is a is not where it ought to be but the great lakes have been cleaned up many of the offshore areas have been cleaned up\nIn Europe at the Rhine River is making a comeback the Daniel rivers as me come back as a matter of fact the interesting thing is people say well energy use as a big problem but it's funny the nations that use the most energy per person\nHave the lowest levels of air and water pollution today and those levels are declining so this idea that using energy causing ... causes pollution really is not accurate the nations that are not able to put energy use effectively\nUm can't use it to reduce their air and water pollution and so they're they're in a worse fate [noise]\nSo it's really a good news story what we need to do is get get a nations have become more wealthy and then they will start cleaning up there and start cleaning up their water and uh so it it really is a good news story a from a pollution point of view\nNow what's going on Steve because regardless what side of the fence you people are on with climate change why is it so bizarre as opposed to dialogue and hey this is my opinion and I appreciate yours it's screaming match is yeah yeah\nIt is kind of remarkable I have a I've spoken at a couple of universities and done a couple of debates but I get turned down about ten times to one I'm going to be up at the grand Valley State Michigan on the twenty fifth of October\nHim a little thing but it's fairly rare now that that a university will and fight a climate skeptic to climate discussion [noise] um so it has become very polarized and do you get booted\nNo I've never had a disruptive situation and you know I'm always very respectful and the theory is plausible of man made climate change and that we do have a greenhouse effect but over the last Thirty years the data showing that the climate models are wrong they made some assumptions which are wrong so\nSo a natural factors dominate um and we need to go on reducing real pollutants but not not carbon dioxide\nWell see that's what's so important people really need to distinguish the difference between pollution and climate change brought on by cycles this the sun is heating up the solar system itself is warmer than it used to be\nKept solely there are the earth is dominated by long term cycles called them a lot which cycles which are uh the tilt of earth's axis changes over time the procession of earth's axis are are they orbit around the sun changes and these are like twenty thousand to a hundred thousand year cycles they cause the ice ages\nThen we have medium term cycles every Fifteen hundred years or so that uh scientists believe the sun causes\nAnd those are they're they're fluctuating temperatures so we've had the medieval warm period a thousand years ago when I was very warm\nUm the little ice age in Europe uh about five hundred years ago when they were actually burning people at the stake they thought they were witches and they were causing the cold weather\nAnd our modern warming and then we have short term cycles as well El Nino is an example in their regular cycle every three to seven years\nCycles and the Pacific cycle so the in the Atlantic so the statement climate change is real is like saying water is wet\nLet's come back in a moment Steven open up the phone lines and what people participate with you\nSign up now for ... zone or free email newsletter get it today at ... dot com\nIn a capsule I spent years studying how to make this the best I didn't make this because I wanted to make a company other companies are starting to catch on to this and I buy every single other product that comes out so I can look at it and see it in test it and I fear that people will buy\nSome some counterfeit and take it for a couple of months ago as a bunch of crap doesn't work don't be fooled this is the real stuff we have absolutely the best process and I can say that because we purchase every single one and check them out I don't I mean\nStill building that dream home\nNow perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options considering will find you alone then you write for\nCall it today in orange\nThat was on a block it nothing ever worked for the first day that's really what nothing can compare with the famine says nature\nFor a limited time used discount code wor to receive a fifty percent discount on your first preferred whole health system and have it shipped to you free call one eight hundred two four six eight seven five one or go on line to balance of nature dot com again use discount code W\nO ... o ...

Streever wrote a book called the coming global superstorm and that inspired a movie called the day after tomorrow and while I was wondering was\nOr is it remotely possible that if things are keep going the way they are or with art and uh what is predictions\nCould very well happen that the events portrayed in that movie as well as the events portrayed in the movie two thousand twelve with yellow stone popping the cork in blowing Wyoming in Kentucky or is it very possible that the ban in both of those movies that very well happen\n[noise] yeah I don't know about the two thousand twelve of Yellowstone and that full Cain although I understand there's a big went under their their call during\nThe day after tomorrow is based on the idea that um manmade warming would would stop the Gulf Stream basically slow down the Gulf Stream which is part of a the a\nA global uh uh overturning a circulation there's this huge ocean current\nUh which which carries a millions of square miles of water of the gulfstream goes north goes up to Iceland and the sinks into it slows down deep and then it goes down into the deep underneath that goes down to the south Atlantic the Indian in the Pacific [noise] the the theory basically was\nThat are warming would cause a cause of water to melt up there the ice caps to melt would stop the current and it would cause a U.S move us into the next the ice age\nUm I think most scientists now realize that that that is very unlikely we just don't have enough ice up there um to to affect the current so\nAre there ... there was a fear though a number of years back that that was slowing down but after they looked at the data they found that the no the gulfstream wasn't slowing down it's really not happening\nIt was a good movie though [noise] yeah okay this is an actual thing right\nSo let's go next to John in Hawaii west of the Rockies John I'm not hearing much about the volcano these days what so what can you give us an update on that\nOh they'll make it\nStill doing its thing well okay go ahead John\nYeah ah my dad who ah who quiet down I just want to stay you we're we're talking\nAbout landfills when I when I was\nLiving in Oregon okay and I used to drive by the wind will that they had and I could see out in the meal that they had a big fat and it was up by plenty more ... booth flame\nYou know they were were burning off the methane\nGas well we're asking now why don't you put a generator on that and we'll do\n... you know electricity out come back and they said no no no it's going to cost ... can have anything out now that can't be the only land they all in the United states we know that\nAnd they're all going to be burning off methane gas now I Want to go why has there been anything done about that\nWell I think they're recapturing that are in some place as a matter of fact that's a big push in California they talk about they talk about that being renewable gas [noise]\nAh they also want to get methane from water treatment plants and even a dairy operations and and uh uh agriculture\nUm the problem is though it is really more expensive um gas from landfill is about twice as much as our natural gas regularly and it goes up from there um water treatment of three times as much I think there he gets up to about ten times as much\nSo they are capturing that and some in some places they're capturing the gas from landfills\nA but it does tend to it does tend to add to the expense of things that's that's the only issue\nNext stop let's go to Michael in Virginia Beach I'm Michael\nHi are you arguing thank you for having Steve von Loor authentic spoken to him several times are\nHurting on any shows and he has a breath of fresh air and inside and that accuracy or there is one point that ah other guests on coast to coast have brought up in the past and I think we should warn are good friends she\nNot to make the same mistake that these are climate change hopes are\nAre are using a ...

we're not going to go back to the days when most of the world was uninhabited we at all forests and we had all the vice and that just won't happen\nWhat's happening with rising sea levels\nSo sea levels have been rising for the last twenty thousand years you can go to\nTo NASA or their website and ... and see that data they've written a three hundred and Ninety feet a hundred and twenty meters since the last ice age no scientists can tell you when natural sea level rise stopped and man made sea level rise began\nUm right now the rice is about seven inches per century that's been going for the last a couple of hundred years\nOr any politician who tells you he knows how to stop sea level rise I hold on your wallet oh we need to adapt to rising oceans oh we're not going to be able to stop that and that is a largely driven by natural factors\nMood obviously has happened in the past because there were discovering the ancient cities that are under water\n[noise] um there have been some well yeah there were a\nIf you look at a I think it's emphasis in Turkey a if you look at a a piece of both of those cities are about\nUm uh there are some some um indications that the seas were higher at one point in time as well um those are about five miles from the coast but the ... used to be a big court or a big uh port [noise] um in in the northwest Italy an\nExcuse to be a port as well so there was some times when the oceans\nWere higher but again this is something we need to adapt to a we're not going to stop the sea level rise so matter what the what they think in California\nRoost in woodland hills California is with us Hi Bruce go ahead\nGeorge thank you for taking my call Hi Steve I'm Bruce you know before I ah I Want to talk about the word climate change but before I get into I just kind of like a dimension I perhaps for a lot of listeners that aren't aware\nIs a global elites that run this country who are masters at keeping us completely oblivious and gum and what's really going on\nThe word climate change is a narrative we hear all the time the weather stations a news article\nScientists that is not the proper word the word is abrupt climate collapse and we never hear about the word climate engineering these are programs now that have been in effect for over seven years and they've been ramped up over the last Twenty years and this is the aerosol injections they're\nSpraying God Knows how many millions of tons of aerosol anyone could just look up in the sky if they don't doubt this a lot of ... harp technology is and you know if anyone wants to prove this to himself I can tell you how to do it first of all any time you watch the news you are watching at Emanuel factored why\nYou're not seeing the real no weather satellite map that we used to the many years ago we're seeing animated cartoon but there's a site a it's a YouTube one Pacific redwood\nThis guy is obviously a former meteorologists he keeps on him is his name but he is showing actual weather satellite maps but here's the thing that's interesting\nYou can see storm front hurricanes tropical storms low pressure is on coming directly into California and they're being blocked\nAnd it's being blocked by heart technology which our ground based atmosphere heaters anyone could look this up they're very powerful I Believe they can put out as much as three billion watts of power and can have the upper atmosphere to Fifteen hundred degrees\nThey can steer hurricane they can stall hurricanes they can blast thunder head they can break up low pressure zone and this is what's happening this is not an act of nature it's an act of the military industrial complex what's having our with our weather ... when I hear about it and the new\nLet's can Steve's reaction to that Bruce like you\nSaid some I'd have to research I'm really not up on that I Know there's been some quotes eating attempts but to the rest of it it's not something I've run across um and there's been a lot of discussion about climate engineering but to my knowledge there's not been anything done on a large scale that something I'd have to look look into further\nLet's take one more caller may be too if we have some time in in Tulsa, Oklahoma he said go ahead [laughter]\nWell let's go to that man just said is exactly right I'm One of these conservative it happens to believe that\nThe way to add on is being Gail engineered the came trails or a proven fact even the discovery channel show now George should recently at gentleman on a show talking about can't drill team put out a video called Franken's guy\nAnd the idea behind it was to create a canopy over the blotting out son where people have so much heck shoes were headache\nAbout the fact that they're doing this so they're going to back off of it now what they were telling us that they said they were going to back off the trail we don't have the weather's going to get real radical now they have they have the ability to geoengineering this weather\nDown to a science I mean it's to the point now where you can go to Wall Street and bet on the stock market on the weather if they want hurricanes that they want to intensify the hurricane through the age of heart\nAnd now on top of that then you got the geo engineering of the soil and the crops which is destroying the honeybees are almost becoming extinct and if they you know that's pretty much gonna destroy everything now I Do agree with you about the nuclear power plant that was a foolish idea that may never come up with man is not smart enough\nTo harness that kind of power safely okay now I Do agree with that but here's the thing with Trump I'm proud of him he got us out of that climate accord 'cause it's a sham man they want they were doing is gripping the oil industry all nations away describing it into the pockets of the global elite\nAnd meanwhile China that's over there with their sky completely online with pollution not paying a dime into it either as Russia but the United states of America was going to point oh eight oh now I don't blame a Trump one bit I grew in fact I was proud of him for backing us out of that sham\nLonger he

was William ... author of the big foot terror in the woods William you were telling us about somebody in a canoe when a break on us\nOff and on this particular day he was standing there and the noise or the falls and on the opposite bank of the creek which was rewarded with toll kind of pointing spruce has inspired a pines\nHe sees something going up and down in the trees that he described as like a chimpanzee\nSo he's watching this thing going up and down and think keep to themselves what on earth is a monkey or a chimpanzee doing up here now he couldn't cross the river and when the thing came\nDown on the tree it went into the the trees the surrounding it a little in other words there were like low gross ten Fifteen feet and then this big tall tree standing in the middle so one that was up in the high tree he could see it and want to climb down we couldn't see it so obviously you're out there this thing has your attention\nWhen he's watching this thing going up and down and at one point it comes up\nSits there and one position and staring at him so now he's looking at it it's looking at him and then it lowers down again well moments later he sees them less willing in the bushes on the other bank which kind of came down a hill alongside the fool's\nAnd here is this little big foot sitting on the shoulder of daddy\nComing along the bank and going out of sight in front of him into the woods so you had one\nCarrying the other one who knows it's anybody's guess what this little critter was doing maybe it was like you know I I Know it sounds ridiculous but I think of it in human terms like when we used to go down to the monkey bars or something and play with your kid in the park you know\nThat's right now you mentioned earlier about a couple that moved on to their house to get away from big what happened\n[noise] well I've had a ... there's been a number of people that moved houses are a\nUnited sooner aren't and rural areas right\n... yeah for the most part are people who have backed up against a wilderness areas or for instance when we talk about I mean this is a very interesting a story\nA involving no sighting but evidence like it's nobody's business uh these people\nAnd when you talk about Maine George I don't know people really realize his main if the size of the rest of New England combined\nAnd you're like Ninety\nPercent of it is on inhabited so when you talk about wilderness it's not just the Pacific northwest British Columbia Canada here we have a lot of wilderness in Maine we have a lot of wilderness right here in New York state [noise]\nAnd so these people had moved from one house to another house in northern Maine [noise] uh the money was right the property was right the people that had lived there before them we're gardeners they will gardeners\nThis was like a match made in heaven or as it turns out over time they found they were accusing each other of using the gardening tool\nThe wife is saying the husband was to shovel wisdom break was so finally the husband get the idea that they're going to gather together with the tools they have to an inventory\nAnd then they were going to keep them all locked up with the exception of two small hand spades [laughter]\nHaving accomplished that they realize they were missing some tools\nAnd they started they left to hand spades\nOn what she called the the wife pulled the heat stroke table on the patio and they were using them for putting plans [noise]\nAnd no sooner had they left them out there a couple of days went by and now these hands spades withdrawn they it actually called the police report depth on the property of you know tools and this and that\nNobody could understand who would come on their land and the tools and take two of them is ridiculous you're going to go to jail for taking a shovel you gonna run the place Rob the place well [laughter] sure bright TVs and things like that [laughter]\nSo they actually went out into the property in the woods [laughter]\nThey found one of the shovel leaning on the tree and the wife scope doubt nine feet off the ground one of the one hand garden trial with a rubber handle on it showed into the side of a tree nine feet up\nNine feet up show they went back to the house they got a right I guess an iPhone something took pictures of it they brought a ladder out the husband couldn't Bush just staying it was buried under a tree several inches thick couldn't budget\n[noise] so they had recalled the police and told them the story about\nFunding to shovel in the woods showed the cop to shovel in the ... everybody was baffled by you know the turn of events you\nAnyways the long and short of it was\nThe Capitol and look if you have any other problems get back to us I'm not sure what happened here I'm going to pass it on to the detectives [noise]\nWell\nI said the long and short of it was a couple of days later\nThey came outside and the guardian behind the house\nHad been trampled down there were huge footprint in the bed or tomatoes were taken the head of lettuce one mash\nAnd whatever had done this which was obviously a big foot I stepped right over the fence not using the gate there was a gate on the garden and it just step right over the warrior winning had it's full of feed\nAnd then left they recall\nThe ah the police over to see what had happened that transpired and he actually told them that this was pretty much the best evidence he had ever seen a and that they had had reports\nPeriodically of people saying they show these big tall creatures coming in their property of walking now so\nIt isn't convincing yeah it's not like it's not like these things on being seen if they're not being talked about which\nIs a very odd thing you know you

come back we'll you she was William the abominable snowman the lady from the Himalayas is that the same as the big ... we talk about here in North America\nI don't believe so uh although I'll tell you something really interesting uh I had an account of was told to me by of all things a Russian professor who was out\nHiking with his landscaper that he had befriended because of his vast knowledge of things but time nickel and they form this unlikely friendship and turned that into a hiking partnership and they had run across\nA couple of big for its messing around with some trees are in the woods and they got close enough to them where they could hear them ...\nAnd the professor\nSaid that it sounded like a Siberian dialect that he was unfamiliar with no this is a Russian speaking immigrant saying that what he was hearing sounded like some type of Russian that he was unfamiliar with [noise]\nSo when you talk about the the Eddie in uh the abominable snowman it's hard not to think of the land bridge that was once they're above the Bering Sea\nAnd it did these things or had these things go back and forth I have no idea but it was just really unusual to hear this gentleman\nA speak about this on dialect that other people have said they've heard a voice as I had a couple that uh was canoeing in Minnesota and they talked on a pulled the canoe up on a piece of the lake where they thought look clear and they could sit there and rest for a little while\nAnd they ran across some sasquatch and the trees structure in there or they will only seen by them they walk by through the trees they heard them ... and they said it sounded like when you stand at the counter and the Chinese restaurant\nAnd they're shouting orders back and forth to each other so it's very very odd but as far as the uh the uh uh yesterday and the abominable below snowman\nI have no idea uh\nI have a Sanders since ... book the bomb Rose Bowl a snowman come to life\nAnd uh you know that thing is like reading or an encyclopedia on the creature a and yet getting back to what I said earlier none of this stuff means anything\nTo the majority of people around the globe that book is a hoax all of my stuff is a hoax all of the conversations about Bigfoot or a hoax the film is a hoax or the or\nA a durable ridges on the footprints taken everything's a hoax to them so you know we have to just keep doing what we do a in spite of uh what the majority of the people out there I think about it so that's one of the things I Love about coached [noise]\nYou know a a we'll tune in because we're hearing things that we\nCan get in Oklahoma Tunisia's nobody's talking about what you're talking about\nYou and photos and big could encounters where's the Tania\n[noise] well I've had a couple of them are one of them are called the ... falls incident but one day they'll share with you a ... was named the orb\nAnd it's really interesting uh these three scout leaders had four young boys that were all working on their uh Eagle Scout badge\nAnd they decided to take them uh to this mountain in a mountainous area or in uh Pennsylvania\nTo do a weekend of survival training or on the first day they were pretty much focusing on building huts lean twos and and different things like that and and the second day or the focus was on that of ah getting attention being have so they were\nSpending their time in an open area spelling out the words held than SOS uh using branches and bows and then they were making Smokey fires using a green a green bows and that night they decided to go on a night hike\nTo see what it was like a navigating around in the\nDark\nAre now during the day they had climbed up the side of the mountain to look down and see what they had made to see what it looked like from a higher elevation and they had gone up into the same area or at night\nFor the hike but when they got up there it turns out that the one scout leader was a UFO enthusiast\nWhich was very bizarre considering what you're about to hear he had a pair of military grade night vision a by knock you lose your own monarch yellow or that he had brought along now when they get up into the\nTrail one of the kid says hey what's sad and they noticed\nIn the distance a light moving around in the woods\nNow of course the first instinct was it somebody with a flashlight or a battery operated lantern but then they realized that this things started to daughter around in a crazy fashion which immediately told all of them there's just no human being and what it is we don't know so they started moving closer\nAs they got closer they got the night vision on it and they could see now that was in or around bluish white light moving around in the forest\nAnd now this really had their attention so they got even closer they've been trying to get ever closer to it they didn't know how big it was because they didn't know how far away they were from it finally they got to a place where they believed there were about Seventy five yards away from it and when they put the night vision on it\nThey can see that it was about two feet wide bluish white or but it was about uh ten or twelve feet off the ground and it was a looming aiding the trees around it\nRight so now they're passing a who was that bright\nYeah I mean it it it's a glowing light ... around in the forest and now it's stationary and what happens next is absolutely out of this world [noise]\nThe one scout is holding it and he says to the leader hey Mr so and so you better take a look at this thing it's doing something really weird [noise]\nHe described a picture this George a two inch wide let's just say ... a two foot wide beach ball he described it go on a ... coming out of the size of this thing as being like when you blow
