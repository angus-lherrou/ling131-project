{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "So right now a lot of our students are realizing that the excuses are kind of dwindling I mean in the twenty first century right now as long as you have a laptop and you have an Internet connection and you have a series of simple steps that's really what we teach is a simplified trading system of step by step investment strategy\nTo help define the way that people make money on Wall street there's no excuse not to and Sam ... said this many times the architect of our core strategy that really what trading is is just to transfer money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing I think that's an important\nConcept to remember because it's not like the money just grows on trees and all of a sudden it shows up in our county right what happens is there's a buyer and seller and there's a transaction that occurs and there's a winner and there's a loser and a lot of times we we forget about that side of the market but the markets are really just a conduit and this is one of the ways I explain it to my classes as\nThe markets or a conduit that just hooks us all together that's really all the marketplaces it's a meet up\nWe all go there to hang out and what do we do there well we buy and sell stocks and people who want to sell stocks show up with their stocks and people who want to buy stocks go there to buy stocks it's just like a farmer's market but at the stock market or commodities market\nBut it's just buyers and sellers and money transfers like a farmer's market when I buy tomatoes money transfers transfer from my account into somebody else's account and it's the same thing in the financial markets and a\nLot of times we don't realize that as we're losing somebody else who made the right decision is actually out there making\nYeah and they're also living their lives to most of us right now with jobs are stressed out we're worried about losing our job especially for the correction comes again\nMost people are just one paycheck away from poverty and so a lot of our students are figuring out how do I go from being emotional to becoming strategic\nAnd the way they do that is to get the proper education learning how a three hour session can completely change your life and you know Ryan you know I've talked about this over and over again\nHolidays are coming up it's that time of year again\nEveryone's going to make their resolutions yeah right well that's kind of silly because a resolution is basically your intention to do something and the two biggest ones we hear what\nI'm going to lose weight this year they came out of ... you know out of out of debt and made our money but the difference here right now is don't just make it a resolution make it a promise to yourself that you're going to figure out a way to get more financially secure\nYeah I remember my grandpa used to say this and I remember hearing it somewhere else too but I'm going to give him credit for it but he used to always say\nUh the goal without a plan an executed all plan is this is a dream you know go without a plan is a dream and and that's one of the things that we spend a lot of time on an online training academy is that step by step plan that step by step process on how to accomplish the goal because any and we are we're going to come up to the holidays here pretty quick\nAnd all of a sudden everybody's going to plan out their New Year's resolutions that I don't remember all the statistics we went through it back in January on the show but it ended up being something like within four weeks eighty percent of the people have completely given up and I'm not even thought about their New Year's resolution and part of that is there wasn't an executed plan\nThey didn't know exactly what to do tomorrow\nAnd the only educated plan right now is the gyms knowing they're going to start running their commercials and they're ...\nThey're going to make a killing thirty bucks a month but at the gym memberships skyrocket but at the same time putting our our best foot forward and giving us an opportunity to reach that financial goal is critical out there as well and and we have to do\nWhat we have to do what it takes to get Congress to go we want to lose a little weight we gotta spend a little more time on the treadmill\nAnd we want to make a little more money we've got to get those skills and one of the places where we can really start bringing the knowledge that we can work our way up into that skill set is I don't want to have their classes and we've got this stack the deck a tickets is dwindling we must be towards the end of the show but we got a few tickets left would you give away let's do it\nRight now I've got to have to class coming up in your area and they have to classes where you'll see exactly what it takes\nTo really live that life that you won't get your money making money and

with their own situation\nOkay thank you\nThank you and God Bless you just a few minutes ago I told you about the woman who went to the big hospital during the holiday week she was a religious woman they capture the hospital for a week\nSo I just want to talk a little bit more about that woman because it's so dramatic\nSo they kept her in the hospital she has got a fun getting breast cancer or breast to ride press looks like it's\nMound of hamburger bleeding and read the skin is all gone the cancer a through\nThe breast and the cancers traveled and she came in to see me after that terrible week in the hospital and her family was really upset and\nShe couldn't move or like she could barely walk in the cancer was bleeding and terrible and she came to me and we talked about all the options and she was in a week and she kept plenty about her leg having pain and they never examine our took pictures of her leg we ordered a special scale of her\nBody of what's called a PET scan but here's your PET scans all they go to the bottom of the pie\nI insisted that you have a PET scan to the bottom of her toes because I was so worried that the cancer had\nTraveled and we immediately got the test immediately saw the test immediately informed or the test immediately gave her copies showing this cancer not only was fun getting in the breast but also metastasized into the leg bones\nAbove the knee and below than the in the massive way destroying the bone causing intractable pain and we talked about all the options which is what I Do with every parish we talked about all the options because I don't think I should be a salesman I think I should inform and even though the show you're not hearing you say you got to do this or you got to do that no\nWe talk about all the options I talked to about ... surgery at about no treatment we talked about standard radiation we talked about fancy pinpoint treatment and she wished to have a treatment on the breast I asked her where do you want us to creatures of the breast of breast was\nPainful and bleeding she was had a raptor the town is filled with blood and uh so we mapped out and treated the breast of the day that we used to have the first crush treatments or daughter came to us that I've changed my mind I Want the leg treated them\nOr do radio surgery radio surgeries like sending a rocket ship to the moon because we have thousands of being ... thousands of angles it's not like\nMaking a hamburger or hamburger joined it's complex work a sophisticated work and this is the work we first performed in America burst performed the western hemisphere we have the longest experienced the most experience is so important to the doctor with\nThe greatest experience to treat the patient I always believe and we ... we should came in we treated her breast her already were treated her breasts I said look if you want her leg treated we'll talk about it you just tell me when I Will do it should be allowed to do like tomorrow said okay so it gave one treatment to the breast takes ten minutes like you heard from\nA patient a few minutes ago told you how the treatment as you lay down and make a motor on the body we southern beams which are the breast\nAnd then one treatment the bleeding stopped and then we started to treat the leg and then one tree with the pain got better by the second or third treatment the pain went away in her like she's out walking in and smiling and happy and you can speak\nHer and to speak to her daughter she is beautiful family a beautiful daughter sums of daughter comes into the sun comes in and the other daughter comes in and the pain\nGone away the bleeding has gone away the mass they've reported this big five pounds a hamburger and the breast has already shrunk by fifty percent of the bleeding gone away and this is the work we do and she was at one of the super duper most famous hospitals have all these ads saying how great they are and\nAgain the wall Street Journal recently talked about all those ads other mislead so the end the cancer you come to XYZ hospitals and the cancer is you know it wasn't the end of anything she ruined her week it was a holiday week

terrible pain and she was on narcotics and she came to us still with terrible pain has gone away\nAnd it's made such a huge difference in this woman she's though happy\nAnd smiley and hopeful that someone can help her what all those doctors and you know the governor of the hospitals ten and twenty doctors and insurance residents and students and\nWho knows who they are just wasted her holiday

I Can't do that type of a conversation and I have a five year old son who who over and over the the words I Can't or or just not even really allowed in our house because we do start to put\nThose or would you start to put those binders on us and and make it so that we realize oh if I jumped high it's gonna it's gonna hurt my head it's we stop even trying you know a while ago they are you know I'm ... years and years ago they they said it was physically impossible to run a four minute mile a vis the about a week ago there was the world championships for Iron Man and Kona\nAnd the the winter and about a six minute mile for twenty six miles after doing a hundred mile bike ride wow if you can't run a four minute mile you're you're not even on Olympic on Olympic track and field team anymore at least one for a minute mile not not to mention back to back to back right\nSo so so these these these these restraints that we put on ourselves we also put on our finances\nAnd we end up kind of painting that our own picture that we ended up residing in it and if you're if you're willing to kind of challenge the norm and you're willing to put in a little more effort\nOr a lot can be granted to you and it really just does come from getting started and putting a little bit more effort in but we could help a few more people get started we've got a stack of tickets here the show is just beginning what are you saying we do another give away let's do it\nRight now I've got a half day class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you see exactly what it takes to really generate that consistent income in the market whether the market's going up down or sideways\nNow in just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes the one of these classes and so if you're driving now is a good time to pull over and get that phone ready included with your passes is going to be a professional insiders kit that is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nNow the professional insiders kids critical because it makes it so you get started right now ... century twenty we need you to call now and reserved those seats\nThe number is eight eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ...

ready to start living the life you've dreamed of learn more visitors on line at O T a Wall Street dot com that's OT a Wall Street dot com [noise]\nWe'll come back if you're just tuning in human is Larry Jacobs director instructor development happens structure it online training academy\nShed some light on consistency in the markets were talking about\nGenerating more money we're talking about generating more income whether the market's going up down or sideways we're talking about how much the market dropped a little bit ago you know it's been about a week or so since we had the big drop in the markets but when you look at those opportunities they are they are that they are opportunities to generate and to give generate more income and essentially give yourself a raise\nAnd it really is important to remember that\nThe more that money is made on the way down just like the money is made on the way up and so really we wiped out number one we wiped out three months worth of gains on this last market drop\nIf we didn't know how to make money as the markets were falling\nIf you do know how to make money as the marks were going down if you have that skill you're able to generate as much money in a week\nAs over the last three months combines so it ends up being these great opportunities as one of the reasons why whenever we have a market crash there's a new wave of billionaires that come out of it yes billion with a B right billion with a B come out of it and a lot of times they are looked at as a\nA a not so they're looked at with not such a pleasant light we could say because when they made all that money a lot of people were losing money a lot of people were losing money in there and those are individuals though who look at a down market as a bad thing\nNow these individuals that were turning themselves in for millionaires and billionaires they were looking at a down market as an opportunity they had that skill set they had that knowledge\nThey knew how to approach that down market\nSo to think about a job if you had a job where you got laid off one third of the time that wouldn't be a very consistent stream of income\nA lot of times with the Bush biased with only making money is the markets are going up that's kind of the situation our income in our retirement accounts or in if we are reliant on just one simple direction the markets go up down or sideways\nAnd if we only make money when the market goes up well there's two thirds of the time two thirds of the direction where where especially laid off or we're not allowed to go to work and so that's one of the reasons why it's very difficult to follow kind of that classic just simple bullish biased and have consistent growth you look over the last nine ten years we've had this great bullish move\nBut how much opportunity has been lost on those down opportunities how much opportunity was given back in two thousand eight when the market crashed and if we don't have that skill set going forward this could be the beginning of this next big downturn\nWhere we could give back fifty or sixty percent of our retirement account how 'bout instead of that\nInstead of going through that process again how about we understand how to make money is marked going down we start doubling up on this stuff\nNo absolutely you know it's funny because one of the things that most people don't understand they start trading on their own and they make mistakes all the time and here's why the number one mistake most people making their lives when it comes to trading if they want to try it on their own first and then maybe get some educational a bit later on well here's the problem that most people don't understand\nFive percent of the wealth right now is being shared by Ninety five percent of the population were Ninety five percent of the wealth is shared by five percent of the people so that means there was five percent of us who have understood the right way to trade how to make money\nAnd what's really scary right now and I talked to a lot of students as I ask them a simple question\nDo you work for more money or just money work for you and most people are working for more money they always believe that they're going to get ahead if they're going to find their freedom and let's face it people who start trading are people looking for multiple streams of income and most millionaires we discuss this Ryan how are you an average five income streams\nThey're doing so not because they're working harder they're working smarter they're figuring out how to work right and what that simply means is if there's a way to learn how to generate income without having to put more effort that's the best way to do it and most of the time\nPeople don't understand that trading us like a system what's the system\nIt stands for save yourself stress time energy and money love it if you learn how from professionals to do things the right way there's no reason why you can't be generating income as well most people either don't know how to do this or are afraid to do this and honestly\nThey keep going out there in thinking that they're going to attain freedom by working more and more well most people I talk to my students\nGive you an example mc ... used to work in the workplace he quit he wanted to work for himself he wanted more time with his family well if you can learn a skill that will allow you to make money the same way the banks do and you've shared district me many times Ryan J. P. Morgan Chase had only nine losing days in the last five years\nI don't know about you guys but I Want to be on that team that keeps making that money and the only way you're going to do that is by investing in the education and learning how to do that can you see how this could help lead you to spending more time with family or just leave a job you don't like any more\nNot when the market was low so imagine when there's another correction\nThe first money that's going to come out is the most expensive amount of money that you've been saving towards retirement\nA lot of our students come in they want to learn the right way to be able to preserve capital how to make sure they're in the right funds when they're putting on their trades to be able to maximize for their retirement and well a lot of things that we hear right now is can you see or do you see how this can really help you pretty much preserve capital over the long term\nIt's always buy low so high it has been for a thousand years it will be for another thousand years that that has never changed and\nThat was one of the topics are ahead of my class last night as as the markets don't change the marks don't change we look at it on a phone\nInstead of looking at it on a on a on a ticker tape but getting printed off right but the markets still don't change it's all about by low and it's all about so high\nAnd somewhere along the lines we kind of got distracted from that and I think the average investor is out there investing their money on payday and they plan to sell when they're sixty five and none of that has anything to do with price and so if we're not buying it a low price and we're not selling at a high price\nIt's pretty much impossible for us to make any money now one of the fun things about the markets whether it's your retirement account or whether it's your income account it's it's the same right it's it's all about just identifying a low price and buying and identify a high price and selling\nNow we get kind of caught up in this\nWhole emotional back and forth of maybe stocks that we love her or or or things that we want to be invested in rather than being invested in the right things and and uh there's this guy Dan that ah when I first started trading I I I did a lot of work with Dan he was a great friend ... you know acted as a mentor and many different kinds of aspects\nAnd Dan used to always say you can't live your stocks they're never going to have you back and he would talk about and he had a little story to help you remember it I won't share though there but it was just kind of funny ... you would say you can't let her stocks they're not going to have you back\nAnd think about it if you're invested into a company right now it doesn't matter what it is\nIf you called them up they wouldn't even know who you are right but for some reason we fall in love with potentially investigated this company who number one doesn't know who we are number two doesn't care about us they don't care about us at all on an honestly why would they write and Larry you're talking about you know taking care of our retirement accounts and how nobody's going to take better care of it than we are\nAnd and it's it is true and the reason\nThat I firmly believe that is because nobody has to live off of our accounts except for us right nobody has to live off of your account except for you\nNobody has to live off of my account except for me and so in the end as kind of courses that can sound nobody cares\nThere's there's not an institution out there that they that they stay up at night going men I Hope I Hope John and Mary have enough money in their retirement account\nYou know what they say that because they want to make sure they have enough fees being paid to them as long as their monies in a retirement account but every day there's a new twenty two year old that opens a retirement account replaces somebody who is closing their retirement and then this perpetual kind of ... income stream that comes from that anyway so\nThe same time though we stay up at night right the average person has many sleepless nights over money but how much time as the average person spent getting educated on how to make sure their money is growing right I I find the financial markets very interesting because we go to a\nA car dealership and there's a car salesman there and we really don't take his advice on what we should buy but yet we go to a car dealership\nThat has the uh financial institutions name on the front of it where they're selling mutual funds and we take the cells persons advice to heart we go well he's the professional in the situation\nNow with a lack of education that's kind of where we end up ah falling behind the eight ball and the financial world one of the things that we can do is we can help a few more people out with that because we still got some tickets we can give away let's do it\nRight now we've got a half day class coming up in your area that the cost of ... ... exactly what it takes to really take control those retirement accounts and have them growing generating more income whether the markets are going up down or sideways\nNow included with your half the class including with your past is going to be our professional insiders kit now this is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors the professional insiders kitten makes it so you can get started\nRight now ... when he did a call now and reserve those seats the number is eight eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com\nAnd see if you can score some passes there\nNow Larry still kind of on this retirement check I Know there are a lot of people concerned about growing their retirement how can somebody number one protect against this potential downside\nBut also inside of their retirement account is there a way for them to continue growth as the markets are going down\nAbsolutely a little out of our students have figured out they can use other type of leverage assets to actually start\nAccumulating wealth well our stock market is in a downturn so this great ways that students can protect their wealth they can hedge against it they're learning about options\nAnd that's why they come to this three hour session to understand what's possible in the marketplace I can tell you firsthand talking to our students students like myself and you too we've been waiting ten years for this correction think about that\nMost people are dreading a correction we are\nFrantically waiting for it because it could be one of the best years of our lives a lot of people don't understand that again the markets go down there is an opportunity to make money just as the markets go up so imagine learning a skill right now to preserve your capital where you can lock in profits imagine you did that back in two thousand eight\nAnd you had money sitting in cash waiting to buy those bargain basement prices\nOf stocks and they got back to two thousand nine well this is going to happen again it's been happening over and over again\nBut most people continue to do nothing and wait for something to happen like I said again the cavalry ain't come in and the reason why so many people are poor P. O. R.\nIt's just they're passing over opportunities repeatedly so for all this did right now by spending three hours of your time is help you learn how to preserve more capital so that you can retire and the lifestyle that you're interested wouldn't that be worth it\nYou know we always look at things in the investing world is richer award how ... what do I have to risk and what's my potential reward\nWell your investment in this case is going to be about three hours worth of time or have take classes about three hours long so that's your investment that's your total investment is three hours worth of time so\nSo even if you were to say that's your total risk is three hours worth of time well what's the protests or reward what if you ended up generating another source of income what have you ended up adding another couple of points have returned to your to your portfolio every year because really your risk is the only time as far as you're investing three hours of your time to come out to this half the class\nBut the rewards are potentially limitless that's a pretty good ratio\nAnd imagine that you learned for the first time that you've been in the wrong things in your mutual funds and your ... can you can learn how to reallocate to give you that rate of return that you that\nYou really want that's what a lot of students are really excited about\nIt goes back to some of those are some of those unquote so we always like to throw out in here as far as you don't have to be ... and I'm going to do this one wrong or you take it it's yours ... yeah it ... it used to always say you don't have to be great to start but you got to start to be great\nAnd unless you do all used when a Ryan's is you don't want to spend your golden years at the golden arch absolutely I Love that one\nYou know and and it's all the wherever these fun cliches things that we love to throw around but they've been around forever 'cause they're true\nRight we've heard him so many times 'cause they're true no nobody ever says well no you you don't have to get started in order to be great you know you do you have to have to be great you have to get started but you don't have to be great in order to get started right it's awesome and\nAnd I love doing uh I get involved with a lot of different races were actually doing a charity race in a in a couple of days\nAre raising money for cancer and and I always compare it to just a race you have to cross the start line before you can cross the finish line it is necessary\nRight but it is it a lot of fun and trading investing you can take this really whatever level you want but imagine imagine if\nI imagine if it just made that slightest impact in your life to the positive how worth it with a three hour investment be now before we can get people in the class they gotta have tickets we got to do it give away\nLet's do it All right we're right now I've got a half day class coming up in your area that the costs of really where you'll be able to see exactly what it takes to keep their retirement account growing whether the markets are going up down or sideways now including with your passes to half the class is going to be our professional insiders kit\nIt's packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nNow the professional insiders kit makes it so you can get started right now ... century twenty we need you to call now and reserved those seats\nThe number is eight eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com\nAnd see if you can score surpasses there\nWe've got to take a quick break we're going to be right back Larry whatever force\nNext you know let's talk about the lifestyle of a trade or a lot of\nPeople now are sitting here and the interest of the ... and they want to make a change to make a change in our\nTalk about what effects are\nBack to current and show you what that looks like right around the brake ran and Larry we'll be right back [noise]\n\nIf you can invest just about three hours to open yourself to strategies that can make you financially secure for life would you do it for over Twenty years online training academy it transform lives worldwide with their exceptional trading and investing education and they would like to invite you to a free half\nDay investing class near you here's what one racing graduate had to say\nOn my training a cat I mean has taught me that he got to have a plan and they gave me the food is maybe a better trader a better plan or I'm a better father\nTrading where the layman can outperform the professional with some coaching and some education\nSo right now a lot of our students are realizing that the excuses are kind of dwindling I mean\nAnd the twenty first century right now as long as you have a laptop and you have an Internet connection and you have a series of simple steps that's really what we teach\nIs they simplify trading system of step by step investment strategy to help define the way that people make money on Wall street there's no excuse not to and Sam side and it said this many times the architect of our core strategy that\nReally what trading is is just to transfer money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing\nI think that's an important concept to remember because\nIt's not like the money just grows on trees and all of a sudden it shows up in our account right what happens is there's a buyer and seller and there's a transaction that occurs and there's a winner and there's a loser and a lot of times we we forget about that side of the market but the markets are really just a conduit and this is one of the ways I explain it to my classes as\nThe markets or a conduit that just hooks us all together that's really all the marketplaces it's a meet up\nWe all go there to hang out and what do we do that well we buy and sell stocks and people who want to sell stocks\nShow up with their stocks and people who want to buy stocks go there to buy stocks it's just like a farmer's market but at the stock market or commodities market\nBut it's just buyers and sellers and money transfers like a farmer's market when I buy tomatoes money transfers transfers from my account into somebody else's account and it's the same thing in the financial markets and a lot of times we don't realize that\nAs we're losing somebody else who made the right decision is actually out there making\nYeah and they're also living their lives most of us right now with jobs are stressed out we're worried about losing our job especially for the correction comes again\nMost people are just one paycheck away from poverty\nAnd so a lot of our students are figuring this out how do I go from being emotional to becoming strategic\nAnd the way they do that as they get the proper education learning how a three hour session can completely change your alive and you know why and you know I've talked about this over and over again\nHolidays are coming up it's that time of year again everyone's going to make their resolutions yeah right well that's kind of silly because the resolution is basically your intention to do something and the two biggest ones we hear what I'm going to lose weight this year\n... you know out of out of debt and made our money\nBut the difference here right now is don't just make it a resolution make it a promise to yourself that you're going to figure out a way to get more financially secure\nYeah I remember my grandpa used to say this and I remember hearing it somewhere else too but I'm just gonna give him credit for it but he used to always say uh the goal without a plan and executed all plan is this is a dream you know go without a plan is a dream and and that's one of the things that we spend a lot of time on an online training academy is that step by step plan that\nStep by step process on how to accomplish the goal because any and we are we're going to come up to the holidays here pretty quick\nAnd all of a sudden everybody's going to plan out their New Year's resolutions I don't remember all the statistics we went through it back in January on the show but it ended up being something like within four weeks eighty percent of the people have completely given up and I'm not even thought about their New Year's resolution and part of that is there wasn't an executed will plan\nThey didn't know exactly what to do tomorrow ...\nCould plan right now is the gyms knowing they're going to start running their commercials in there and you know\n... and they're here to make a killing thirty bucks a month but at the gym memberships skyrocket but at the same time\nThey're putting our our best foot forward and giving us an opportunity to reach that financial goal is critical out there as well and and we have to do what we have to do what it takes to accomplish the goal we want to lose a little weight we got to spend a little more time on the treadmill\nAnd we want to make a little more money we've got to get those skills and one of the places where we can really start bringing the knowledge that we can work our way up into that skill set is that at one of the half their classes and we've got this tack this stack of tickets is dwindling we must be towards the end of the show but we got a few tickets left due to the give away let's do it\nRight now I've got to have to class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you'll see exactly what it takes\nTo really live that life that you won't get your money making money and and I always like to see what he got two dollars or two million dollars you'd be able to see exactly what it takes to get that money generating that income that can really sustain that lifestyle that you deserve now include with your passes it's going to be a professional insiders kit\nThis is packed with lessons from some of our top

is coming from people who are in Brooklyn for court hearings and probation doesn't\nEveryone else thought the clinical trials were disappointment he was promoting the drug when other doctors felt the drug was essentially useless even the company that was making the drug thought it was so useless they stopped the study and production of that drug for that cancer reason\nWhile he was getting the same doctor was getting three million dollars from Roche\nOh something as Shakespeare says smells in Denmark isn't is it a cancer doctor promoting the use of expensive medicines that we know and\nCancer that the average cost per patient is ten thousand dollars for chemotherapy and for him you know therapy ten thousand dollars if you've gone to these big hospitals\nYou can see scores or hundreds or thousands of patients getting these\nPills every month multiply a thousand patients times ten thousand dollars a month I was twelve months a year and you can see this is big business and when he was confronted hated it\nDispute the fact that he had relationships with at least a dozen companies and he said of course it was on intentional that doesn't mean\nTo forget that he was getting millions of dollars from the drug companies ... remembers getting millions of dollars and is extensive articles in the New York times reports his extensive corporate relationships in his frequent failure to disclose them\nStraight the boundaries between academic research and industry and how weak the reporting requirements are\nAnd a a doctor from uh the University of Pittsburgh set of leaders don't follow the rules and we don't have rules and what are the penalties for up such lapses well in general they are not severe this is an article in New York Times and\nReporters asked this famous doctors chief of a big hospital is the main doctor is a physician in chief reporters asked this doctor if but what he was going to do about this and the doctor this famous professor chairman tenured professors are making millions of dollars asked the reporters what\nThey would recommend well what would they recommend telling the truth a\nLeading patients on to get useless chemotherapy because he has a financial interest in the company how selfish\nWouldn't you say that is selfish that people get chemotherapy aiming to therapy it thousands of dollars a month so he can keep his job so he can keep on giving\nBillions of dollars for its own benefit is that why he went to medical school I didn't go to medical school to sell my soul to the drug companies are the hospitals are pharmacies are surgeons\nI went to medical school to help other people\nAnd I wish that he had gone to medical school for that reason and I wish that he\nRemembered that now there's big doctor and the article goes on to say supervises\nThe clinical operations that one of the top cancer centers in America and they say he wields influence over the lives of patients and companies that wish to conduct research there\nThe Cancer Center alone just as day job his day job he got paid more than a million and a half dollars and that doesn't include\nAll his consulting fees and board fees and uh perks and a lecture fees and traveled fees and travel fees\n[noise] wow\nIt all of this doctor served on the boards of at least six companies and being on the board of a company means that that person has the financial responsibility to protect the company well\nIf he's your doctor and he's the chief doctrine the hospital and yet these on the board of six companies and he's getting paid millions of dollars from those companies and he has a financial responsibility to make sure those companies are solving where\nAre his loyalties\nAre they to the patients are they to his doctors the hundreds of doctors that he supervises is it to the hospital the multibillion dollar hospital is it to the multibillion dollar or drug industry where are his loyalties I can tell you that it\nIs so different here with me Dr leader minute they're too for Broadway where we're an independent cancer treatments that are not taking money from drug companies and pharmacies and boards insurgents in\nThe hospitals with those kickback scheme ... and the chief executive of the same hospital the chief executive settled law suits years ago they were filed by a big Research Center of\nSaying that he hid research conducted while I was at one hospital to start a new company and they didn't share the earnings\nAnd that same chairman it's a different man\nAt the same hospital sits on the board of Merck one of the biggest drug companies for chemotherapy in America\nAnd yes the federal government began to require drug manufacturers to disclose payments to doctors and that's why the paper found out that this doctor received three and a half a million dollars just in a few years from nine companies\nAnd he received more money from companies where the drug was not approved for human use so are some companies that were working on new drugs they weren't required to publish how much they paid him wow\nAnd the paper goes on to say that serving on boards could be lucrative in one case ... radiation company he's not even a radiation doctor like yours truly\nHe got two hundred and sixty thousand dollars in cash and stock awards in one year and it's not even his specialty\nWow wow oh wow\nAnd the and one of the biggest most famous journals the New England Journal of medicine he wrote sponsored a study that was sponsored by Roche a drug company and when the article in the journal asked if you had any financial interests he rode down\nRemember this is a man has gotten millions of dollars from the same company he wrote down he had nothing to disclose so what have we been talking about for years while we've been talking about the fact that there's conflict of interest\nAnd many many he's not the only one many many doctors sit on boards many many doctors get money from drug companies consulting fees\nAnd where is their loyalty where is the loyalty\nWhy is there this conflict of interest and why was he trying to hide this conflict of interest in the vast majority of articles that he published it was hiding\nThe conflict of interest to was saying there was nothing to disclose and that's what makes the appeal of an independent cancer treatment center so great for a patient who comes here to third city for Broadway\nFinally they can get a cancer opinion whether it's for a new cancer\nRecently diagnosed or recurrent cancer a primary cancer or medicine at a cancer you can get

combination or even no treatment here we talk about all the options were not afraid about talking about all the options after seeing so many patients so for so many decades I can tell you that\nIt seems that so often the surgeon talks about only surgery the chemo doctors talk only about chemotherapy\nAnd meanwhile what's the patient to do and that's why we're on the radio every day talking about\nCases talking about people talking about real human beings who are struggling to understand whether they should lose their armor their leg or their breast or along or their pancreas would roll over the rectum or bladder or their prostate or the kidney or something else\nWhether they should take endless chemotherapy or whether there's options and it's so nice to know that you can come to
