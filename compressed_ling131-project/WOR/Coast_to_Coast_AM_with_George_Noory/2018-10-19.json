back I Would say about sixty two year old woman she is married to a kid she came with her husband she has endometrial cancer in domains inside ... uterus\nEndometrial cancer Shia uterine cancer she had that you know bleeding and again another\nCase bleeding as a warning sign in dimitrius cancer she went to one of those super super big hospitals it's on the air all the time advertising and she had her uterus removed and twenty eight lymph nodes removed and then they gave radiation to The Vagina\nAnd then two years to go which was a couple of years two years ago which is two years later after that surgery she was in pain and she was seen by kind of colleges and she had a PET scan the pet scan\nCancer in the lung and the liver and the\n... surgery she had and all that radiation the China doesn't work right because the purpose of the surgery was to\nCure for the purpose of radiation was to cure her doesn't work and then she went from one super ...\nPossible to another super pooper scooper St Elsewhere hospital for three years she had chemotherapy well what does that tell us well when people have chemo for months and months and years and years means that\nIn general there's not an always but in general that chemo was not designed to cure the patient it's just to try to slow down temporarily possibly the\nCancer and she was going to the super duper play is probably one of the most expensive places in town where the key most ten thousand dollars a month or should three years of it was scans and reports in Yemen she probably spent with her insurance company when insurance we all pay for credit some free half a million dollars at a half a million dollars of garbage\nResults because the cancer just kept on growing went through the skins and the scans all showed the cancer was growing they never told her that ever sat down with her the super proper\nPlace to describe a joke and try another came or different came over to buy came over this came or another one or immunotherapy\nNone of her work three years later and so\nEducational point that's so important your friends or neighbors yourself and you're getting endless chemo it probably means that it's not endless it probably means it's the end not endless which is pretty bad news and she kept on thinking something good is going to come out of the chemo and nothing good came out she had neuropathy and pains in her hands\nLower the blood count and all the side effects\nIn toxicity that there's no life along in her and it wasn't working she complains of neuropathy in her hands in her feet and abdominal pain and she was an jumps either being inches pain in the late ... and the pain is getting worse than her weight is a hundred and forty ages five foot one and I examined her I looked at her skin is a mess\nIn The Vagina right where they operated on her\nWhich means it probably left cancer cells behind them and they did by definition right\nThen they gave her radiation that China which doesn't work which doesn't work by definition so all the treatment three years of chemo and the surgery removing the uterus and giving the radiation in China\nDidn't work the cancer kept on growing and now she's here with pain in the ... the and this three years of cable network and the surgery not working and she came and we staged or up we found the cancer and shoot\nBaskets to please read for\nCancer ... felt for get into remission and that's where we'll try to do even though she had all that useless treatment at St Elsewhere\nAnd this is what we do here so different we explain all the options are we talking about all the options we don't hide them we talk about them when they were copies that were scans reports that explained it this is the work that we do every day here at British or to New York but an older man who's eighty seven is COPD and is a gastrointestinal trauma tumor types are coma\nShe had chemotherapy and he'd to did not tolerated he tried it for a while\nHe hated that he had a scan three weeks ago he was referred by himself\nTwo years ago as a hundred and sixty pounds you went down to a hundred and twenty pounds so with this cancer and with the chemo he lost forty pounds a supporter of his weight is five foot seven and he came to\nUs for innovative treatment for is gastrointestinal is she a tumor what all the chemo doesn't work and the other

what made you so sure that the price was going to make such a big move\nAll at the time silver was trading near its production cost an industrial demand was absolutely skyrocketing\nIn why do you think a hundred dollar silver is possible now\nShore in fact China alone and expected to need an amount of silver equal to half of the global annual mining production that just China the whole world is moving to China just recently California's now requiring all new homes to have solar panels there's just not enough silver supply that kind of demand\nSo we're going to see a shortage Kevin\nAll I can say is that some smart people like J. P. Morgan has accumulated the largest private stockpile of physical silver in the world more than a hundred and thirty million ounces that's over two billion dollars worth of silver I'm sure they're not doing it because they expect the price to go\nDown the hall I guess not but could super retired than a hundred dollars announced\nHope you adjusted for inflation George Silver would have to be about a hundred and thirty dollars announced to reach its all time high so we think are one hundred dollars is well within reach\nOne could that happen\nOver the next seven to ten years but we believe most of the games will happen over the next three to five years just to ignore the potential in silver right now\nKevin our listeners are passionate you have anything that you can set out to listeners so they can find out more about a hundred dollar Schober\nWe do George or to make a special offer for you it's our latest sky high silver report listeners can learn more about China's massive move into solar\nAnd why experts the silver rising to a hundred dollars announce the report the twenty dollar value but it's free for your listeners by calling one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred\nFolks this last week even for just came out with a report saying China was leading the way with solar and that in two thousand Eighteen global investments in the solar will outstrip coal gas and you clear combined\nLet's get Lee or sky high silver report it's a fascinating report and don't miss out on the ... revolution call now to get your copy it's a twenty dollar value free with no obligation call one eight hundred\nTo nine nine Seventy four hundred that's one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred [noise]\nSeven Daniel full flooring yard sales going on now with incredible deals lumber liquidators we've got hundreds of floors on sale up to\nFifty percent off in stock and ready to go see big on waterproof floors all on sale from just thirty nine cents skin would look laminate flooring all on sale up to forty percent off refinished\nHardwood in bamboo starting in Ninety nine cents plus special financing stop by your local lumber liquidators store or visit lumber liquidators dot com today\nNo commercials we video on demand TV channel completing devoted to only the best movies on UFOs introduced conspiracies science it's called us on TV all access UFO\nI think Joyce many things are possible really do I mean I'm I'm Still wrestling with the living in dying process and exactly what it is when we cross a strange picture and you've got some spirit to ... to go to\nYes of course You're welcome to a shared if ... if you'd like to have it yet I was on\nI mean I'm I'm Still wrestling with the\nLiving in dying process and exactly what it is when we cross over um ... it's it's kind of strange for me I mean we've got a picture up the coast to coast damn dot com bubble goes on the Titanic a strange picture and you live\nIn New York and New Jersey W.

learn to say ours is just look beyond the person or in a dimly lit room he'll say something and then over a period of time increase but it's a very very important and understanding what they mean the colors and the\nShape of very very important Georgia so I can see our insurance you\nKnow I I Can't do the do you remember the ... story where he was getting on an elevator he could see ... and he looked at all these people in this elevator he couldn't see any or is it scared the heck out about how she didn't go in the elevator and the elevators the cable stamp and the people died\nYeah you gotta love Casey ... absolutely George nor did I won't reminder\nAs a psychic where do you get your I'll call the power where'd you get it from\nI don't think it's powered I oh God that we're really trying to think a lot of people say that and I think only God as the ultimate power but the rest of us tune in and I tried to help people I've had a radio show four more years and I can remember\nAnd it's actually afraid to call in I'm very happy to it and that's why she went and got the power from we all get our energy from life for us we get it from God at the moment we take a breath we take our last breath so the energy for us to you and I chose to you to help people\nPeople people listen to this show love animals joys and many of them owned them what happens when that pet that animal passes on\nThat's a great question oh it's all connected to our animals [noise] well you know how when my cat died we were so close they came to me that night and you\nKnow mom I'm fine [laughter] and I don't want you to worry about me\nWhen I lost my dog he came to me and a little hospital bed the night he died he was lying on his side I'm okay now I didn't feel well before I pass but I'm okay now I Know it's so crazy they called me mom they really think that their mother\nAnimal and that's to your question George Will either go to a dimension of all animals are they usually go\nWith the papal crossed over with they will stay\nThem on the other side so they're really no cut and dried rules about where animals go\nBut they do have a relief as we all do from pain and misery it's like a two wonderful dimension but\nAs I I don't want people to think that suicide is that right you're supposed to go when you're supposed to go and you know so a suicides are a whole different matter and I think Robin Williams and a lot of people have taught us a lot about suicides\n... birds\nYes don't do it [laughter]\nNo you'd asked me if I see ... and I don't but I Do feel or Joyce I Do have that ability to ...\nA feeling of this class send you a sense and you're feeling that's very intuitive so you can feel the presence or like when you're with in there or field is that what you mean George\nYes oh wow that's impressive\nSo if you were the person who is not that good to step away from them you would pull back right\nYeah absolutely now there are some people who when I call psyche or\nMa'am fires but they're not necessarily bad people they just have the ability to dream people's energy I Try to work with those people by the way I Try to help them and I've had some stories where they've changed and people began to like them again and surround themselves are on the person but\nI get a kick out of trying to help people who want to help themselves but just don't know\nThat's a form of hailing and that's terrific that's really really great because they don't know how to help themselves and you come in and it could be training for you but it's not because you know how to control your own energies which is really extraordinary for that's a wonderful form of hailing\nListing some calls are lining up here for you I'm going to give you a name and the birth dates ... the

New York and I\n[noise]\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast George ... when the rubber boss was with us almost three years to the ... this day Robert Moss has been a dream traveler\nSince doctors pronounced him clinically dead in a hospital in test mania when he was three years old from his experiences and many worlds he created his school back to dreaming is original\nSince this is a modern dream work with the ancient some Monica mystical practices for your into the rooms beyond the physical though he leads popular workshops all over the planet including three you're training for teachers of active dreaming and online courses for the shift network\nA noted the author has got a number of books the most recent mysterious realities Robert welcome back my friend\nTo pay dream weaving with George Foy\nLooking forward to this would this tragedy that happened when you were three would you tell us again what happened\nWell first of all my mother took me from Melbourne, Australia where we live in West straight to see her on the opera singer and the psychic media and the main ...\nAnd she looked in the ... the old fashioned when she saw that she didn't tell us she went out room came back white faced while she was right that went to in ... Maine yet when my father had been friends for the straight an army officer\nI got pneumonia and I died and how do the dog all told my parents that I had died as pronounced clinically dead and then they look to get and they said oh you boy died and he came back so that that is one of the experiences of my life involving the stuff that goes into the new books\nI must tell you George I don't remember anything much from what happened when I was out of by buddy age three members rather hard living under the afterwards what happened afterwards when I was eight nine\n... died again pronounced dead again on the ... and the conditions and the sister appendectomy in an operating room and that time I remember what happened it sounds like the classic empty to begin with up onto the field are you looking at the the the the the scalpel in the ... not money to be around going down\nDown the beach down to live in a pack a fountain pocket Melbourne, Australia big moon faces the gate wanted to do with an old marine nine year old kid would want to do go on the ride go some addresses\nSo I guarantee Luna Park age nine in my astrobiology and I'm drawn into I didn't know that goes straight maybe\nI'm drawn into another world and we're I'm deceived by very beautiful very very lovely people and they raised me is that right and I forget that I've got a buddy in hospital bed\nBack eventually opt to seeming to live a whole life of Ninety years old so and I'm shocked to find myself in the body as a kid and and now the hospital and from that George comes my lifelong understanding\nThere will be on the physical you know nine years old who you talk to about this she tried to talk it out that the medication you're hallucinating or something like this person who could explain\nTo me what happened in any way that made sense was an aboriginal kid from the indigenous tradition but we do that we get really sick we got to live with the spirits and then we come back and sometimes we have the same\nAnd sometimes we're nuts so the gift of these experiences with shrinks by coal dissociation was the buildup to either travel beyond the body traveling consciousness without psychedelic club drugs quite easily\nAnd an understanding that there will be on the physical and they are accessible\nYou must have been an amazing little boy Robert\nWell I'm not alone in a little boy you know I was sick I on my fathers and the army's that we're moving all the time army brat situation I'll tell you one of the things that kept me going is amongst mine this boat companions a phrase probably most of us remember from childhood was the big man and a lot of white airing upping face\nBecoming sit on my they didn't say backup Robin you know you're going to make it through you'll survive I can promise you that you're learning now that you'll know goals and they'll like you and one day or that you can't tell your dreams are easier right now people want to hear you\nThat invisible companion George was the older rubber younger than I Am now traveling across time to cheer up his younger self and helped him come through one of the things I've learned is\nWhere time travel is in our dreams and when we developed the odds of conscious or active treated me as I call it\nOne of the cool things we can do is we can actually go back to youngest self and be cheerleaders counselor to them in their own time and going the other way we can sometimes managed to talk to a why is the self who sees what life looks like a bit further down the road that we have gotten and can help us to get the right perspective\nAmazing now let's get into your latest work of course mysterious realities dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm you call yourself a dream travel or what is that\nWell it means that one of the things going on in dreams is that we traveled beyond our old and read dimension of reality into other\nWill we traveled the parallel worlds for example but we're leading parallel lives this isn't\nAs weird as some science tells us in the many worlds hypothesis that you and I live in right now in one of many parallel worlds well how do we know about that in human terms while we might know it from our dreams in which we find ourselves for example\nIn consecutive episodes living a life a bit different from other living right now on may be radically different so that's part of a dream traveling mainstream traveling also means\nThat in our dreams in sleep dreams event and conscious elusive dreaming we made travel to places where the dead or alive and this might be the source of understanding the solar consciousness survived physical test so this is a pretty pretty important area\nUh so the idea of dreaming travel goes beyond the routine idea about dreams as the little bubble up from the U.S no subconscious and that's all that's going on a this was the ancient an indigenous understanding as lived in my life and told and stories from that life\nBut in dreams we traveled to other places and we received visitations from people who've come cooling those people to come calling my employed glued but loving family members are ancestor those spiritual guy some kind or another\nSo dream travel means we get out that we get beyond the body in the brain we get into that whole field of known local mine but science tells us about getting the condom information field to get into the ability to access sources of information beyond the old ... and also part of this is that we are definitely a time travel is\nAnybody who follows their dreams for wild and write them down will notice that they dream of and before they happen and one function of time travel we see the possible future we can reduce the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead\nBut we all said traveled into the past from this my mother lives you learned about our connections with drama is playing out in the reality is now the time periods\nIn the multi dimensional universe so this is the key to the U.S ten understanding of what the multi dimensional universe is all about this is the power of direct experiences papa dream travel\nAnd my stories in the book come absolutely and entirely from my experiences in these areas and the experiences of some other people who work with me and they're giving me permission to use this story\nRobert if we did not dream of course we all do not everybody remembers him but if we did not dream what would we be lacking as human beings what would happen to us\nI think we'd be locking quite often a sense of purpose a sense of Seoul since the spirit because you know one of the things that dreams do is they connect this to a deep a source of knowledge of wisdom actually be on the old remind this is one of the reasons why\nMost human ... human couches across history a valued dreams and dream if they believe the dreams put you in touch with the guard or go to see if you like\nBut you can talk to with nature with the ancestors with the big self all the highest ... so we might be liking that I'd say terribly relevant to our time is that we might be lacking conscience because dreams can be the voice of conscience and dreams can be\nA ... a magic mirror that shows with our actions in attitudes from Baton and more objective perspective that we can manage for our cells\nAnd indigenous people say if you lost your dream you've lost a vital part of your sold your dream sold in fact has gone missing and probably the scariest story in my book mysterious reality is that the one called ...\nAnd ... which takes a look at what that might begin to mean if you live in a society where people are divorced from their dreams have lost the sense of conscience\nI've lost the sense of a deep up to ... percent of that pie but gone to lose the sense of what it really means to be a human\nA fully alive human I think it's actually as important as that\nI was mentioning now Robert that some people don't remember their dreams what makes them not remember\nWell first of all we haven't made a socially rewarding oath on to share dreams I mean we don't have good ways of talking about dreams most of us when we were a member of something a bit embarrassed how do we talk about this how do we tell us\nSo one of the things like you know society is a way that makes it fun and as I say socially rewarding to bring a dream to the table I invented the very simple false step process the sharing a dream of a story that makes it fun you can get it done in minutes to get some help with the fact that your guide to towards action but there are other reasons\nWhy we're losing our opinions I mean bad habits apart from that is part of it to be let out so the rushed out of sleep by the alarm clock but the need to get the job of deal with the family we think that we should lie in this in bed and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever and they pay any attention\nTo those in between twilight states of consciousness between sleep and wake that's a good time to catch it means there's good times and Bachmann loosened dreaming but many people don't realize that it just seemed to 'cause they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... says losing that others\nYet know about bacon save your life they can save your job they can say that marriage I couldn't be talking to you today if I did not know the ... and show that I have that I have avoided death on the road predates his death fatal accidents\nBy coming back from dreams that forecast book was happening harvesting the information acting upon it so I didn't have that head on collision with the Eighteen wheeler coming down the hill to fall on the other side of a blind\nSpot for example so that's one direction but time travel but time doesn't move in a new one direction and in fact to understand what our relationship with time is through dreaming we have to know that in dreaming we step out of the time altogether we step into a different place than in between place\nFrom which we can access time passed future or parallel so you may discover that in your dreams your getting really interesting experiences\nOf what's going on in other times altogether in those parallel times we're leading a power life this come very interesting when you begin to look at give some lessons you might have been in a parallel life that you can apply and you present my and how to avoid things went wrong and not at other parallel and I\nThink it's very interesting when you discover that you can go back to younger period of your life and reclaim something you love that that time\nWill be guide to that younger self or you find yourself also in the life situations the people in far flung places feel proud of your multi dimensional family I'm a bit of an agnostic about reincarnation but I firmly believe based on my experience\nBut we have connected to dramas being lived in other places in time and that from a certain point\nOf view it's all going on now I wouldn't be doing what I I'm not doing not found myself connect with an Anglo Irish men who came to the American college\nHe's Seventeen hundred

I was in a graveyard this week and I look at him\nAnd I was in a grave yet I've never been to before never been in this place and just having a walk\nAnd I'm thinking about a girl I loved and could never have from Thirty years ago and I looked down on the name of a headstone is her name the full name\nAnd there's the dates this person died last summer and I can't believe that her but I call\nShe's never beat in the air as far as I Know I make some calls I discovered she died last summer and something drew me to head and say he says what do you think of that I said it's a great story it's a very great story I mean that introduced this whole thing about\nYou know the energy and that connects that might exist between the living in the dead and how someone who has died my call them to a certain goal is to a certain place might even be an age of ... but\nAs I'm telling it it's also an example of how like attracts like I like stories so even on a day when I'm staying at the airport I don't need a new story today I'm given what else to live as a story immediately just like that and that these examples proliferate so\n... what it how it works is that the the the attitude and the energy you're carrying again to have result your attitude travels ahead of you in life\nShaping wanted waking put waiting fuel round the next corner which is a very good reason every tuning in life to pause and check your attitude check orders play you know when you're in a soundtrack check what you're saying to you so Trump the negative mantras themselves limiting beliefs\nAnd be open to something more positive coming into your life\nIs there anything physical about this I mean I Know you need the brain the dream but we're also tapping into I think the subconscious and it does its thing outside of the physical body but how important is the physical body to all of this\nWell I think those are good body is very important that the first of all I mean scientists telling us there is no barrier between mind and matter anywhere in the universe mind and that ... into leave at every turn in every level in fact some scientists tell us that at the heart of matter of reality as a dense of consciousness so\n... there's no hope of separating mind matter they're always play together but when we think about the kinds of messages the kinds of discoveries that we're exploring we have to remember the party has its own messages his discoveries there the phenomena but used to be called pre sentiment which I experience a lot maybe you do to what\nIt means in terms of the body is the body sometimes seems to know things that are going to happen before the the mind of the brain can recognize what is\nGoing on the body reacts\nTo something ahead of time ... sample I go to the doctor for routine annual physical one time\nMy blood pressure is much higher than usual even though it's controlled surprisingly high and there's no explanation for this until the nuts trying to get get some blood for a blood analysis hits a gosh are my blood is boat again it's all I knew\nLived in pants and after that I'm completely common my blood pressure is normal and she and the doctor trying to understand what just happened I said well this is pretty sentiment it's what's called an Alice in wonderland the the white queen can but the white queen screams\nBefore she ... her finger so she doesn't have to scream when she actually ... thing where I just did the same thing I had a reaction in my high blood pressure too and in that it forward took place on the doctor says my goodness that probably is a scientific\nProof of a sudden the phenomenon ... sentiment or anticipating symptoms he says but I couldn't possibly be reported people think I was looted you well you know I think so I think the ... we know in our body all sorts of things we know the thing\nWe know what the bleep we don't know that we know enough about it in all of a sudden medic response was we pick up things from a distance from other people and we feel what they're feeling in our body as well so that's part of the story\nNow you teach active dreaming what exactly is that Robert\nWell acted dreaming is way of getting active with dreams in the sense that you again remember your dreams are going to share them the right way to you and it could take action that will empower your life and bring some healing energy and guide in July from your dreams I mean that's one aspect of it\nIt's also a method of loosened dreaming you would call at ... medical use of dreaming we ... my favorite way of talking on the loose and treatment venture\nIs to start out loose that didn't stay lose what does that mean that means that we use shut many drumming and the workshops\nAnd we might take a dream that we remember as a starting point we might decide okay there's some romance an adventure still in the stream let's go on with the dream let's get back inside the dream and have more\nWe might decide okay it's time to brave up to a nightmare terror and stuff that stuff's going on by going back inside the dream and facing the scary based on its own ground it might mean I Want to talk to someone who turned up in my dream whether it's spreading Morrow someone else\nSo that's an example of traumatic loose a dream yet another example is that I encourage people to spend a lot more time than that risky try lied state to eat and sleep and wake because that's where creative connections made where we are extremely psyche can intuitive and creative naturally\nSo I encourage people to instead of complaining about being awake in the middle of the night\nRelax into that state make it a state of horizontal meditation if you like I tend to the images that rise and fall and see what he wants to make one of the scenes will come to you the full to loosen dreaming and finally\nActive premiums the method is also about treatment with your eyes wide open we got the how to look at Sinclair city outlook for signs of both in the world around you so this is also a program on the method\nAll attending to the dream like symbols of everyday life\nRobert did the dreams ever mislead us trick us basically\nI don't think that dreams themselves misleading I think that a spin on the dreams can often be misleading we might be in a rush to interpret reminded to interpret according to the wrong standards I think that didn't think that dreams in themselves as a deceptive\nI mean we can pick up things in the night of the problems with the floating around that we don't walk around we can pick up things from other other entities from whether they're just a bit confused or militias\nThat that can be confusing or deceptive but I think that any image that belongs to us that is truly our own\nCan be worked in the service of health inhaling it might not be great to begin with it might be horrible my dream of some horrible based but by learning to go back inside the dream and confront the issue on its own ground you might find that behind something that's scary you know learning\nYou and your dream is a power power the understanding of power that might might give you all kinds of spiritual ally or a ... guide a

friend Robert boss back with us as we talk about dreams will get your calls as well Robert you write about Carl young a lot in\nHe even had some of his own situations didn't need it didn't they\nWhat do you mean he's unfit choices Joe\nIn his dream life\nOh yeah he would do you own your own was\nInspired by dreams I mean he said\nIn memory streams reflections but he has interesting thoughts every day but he takes up in his work and study only what comes to him\nAnd dream so here is the man I mean a titan of scholarship and science who is driven all his life by his dream well out of the stories in my new book mysterious realities involve humans passage into the afterlife and actually what he might be doing now it's pretty interesting title\nBut the part of that is in the previous documentation is that Yom dreamed again and again before his death\nBut he was living in a Bush and all his retreats on the lake lake ...\nWhich was called bowling get out in the nearby village is living in another bowling gun on the other side of death and those close to him said that he lost all the or death you know absolutely confident and he knew where he was going to a towel on the other side of death on the lake and in\nA story in a mysterious around his Coby out of the ball and gun I follow you on\nTo that possible afterlife situation and actually get some insight into where how humans mind might be working right now is he works on a great new books or in the off the life I mean some people might be shocked and surprised\nBut that Robert his crazy enough to think that you would have an audience with him from the other side of that but you know you'll himself wrote a great deal not always the publication about his contacts with the deceased he talked in his in his memoirs and in his red book about extensive conversations\nHe had with the department at the shape your view of reality and he was one of those are always understood that one of the key things about dreaming is is it gives the U.S and the ability to understand what happens to mind go consciousness off to death because it dreams as yoga understood we receive visitations from the top the ad in dreams who made travel\nInto the realms where they are at home but very briefly one more thing about him\nAnd his relevant to this book in my approach to everything\nHe came late in his life to the conclusion that one of the things going on in dreams is that we live I'm quoting you continue to live in the reality is that we perceive and dreams so I'll dream may be memories of ongoing life situations nothing this reality but somewhere else\nBut we visit again and again when we when we slip out of the body and go into dreams\nSo this is a great a dream Sherman of the west he knew and the manager of a ... because it negotiated through a deep and horrifying experience of an under will journey and he paid the price of surviving that in coming back and adding his science\nAnd his scholarship to what he knew first and above deeper realities and giving us an incredible model of understanding with all the things we're talking about some of the great admirer of you\nWho wasn't young soldiers who'd Sigmund Freud and then eventually they broke often had the disputes\nFreud regarded as his air ... young was joking with Freud favorite apprentice but they broke because young because Freud although at tremendous scholar and pioneer of understanding dreams in his eye and writes who made himself is number one a study\nWhich is what you need to do to listen to to anything on dream some someone who's not a dream of\nDespite all that Freud adopted a rather narrow view of what's going on in dreams or rather narrow theory and he tried to apply it to humans dreams\nAnd you had famously a dream in which he's in a house that is on many levels\nAnd in the basement area fall below the comfortable Bush ... upper level is is uh the floor and bones and skull and something primal\nAnd Freud insisted on interpreting the dream to Yom as something to do with you know a mother complex and the desire to see somebody dead\nAnd you didn't break with him at the moment but then eventually he did because he felt that Freud was putting his dream experiences into coffin of narrow understanding\nAnd that break up with very interesting because the company by synchronous stick phenomena\nYou talked about the body and Matthew in relation to these things and one of the conversation with yoga and Floyd ... ... ... there's a tremendous crack in a cabinet to avoid stop so how scared and confused and and and and you wrote in describing that he felt something ... and his belly like a hot enough and he was going to happen again\nAnd there's another huge bang for the furniture sounds of blowing a pot\nSo what we're seeing in that episode is something that goes on in the form the phenomena of ... which is the thoughts and emotions we are carrying strongly\nCan have a physical impact on the world around us so it's a very interesting thing in my story about your ... your own says from the afterlife that Freud has changed the pinion he's of all he's gone a long way since he died but they don't have much contact together now\nI Love it in your book mysterious realities the subtitle of dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm what is the imaginable realm\nI imagine a round is a space between time I did too that the weather of palaces in schools and universities and pleasure pox that are designed by human imagination in concert with intelligence is from Ohio level I borrowed the word for word from from the writings of\nSome medieval suit the mistakes who spent a lot of time traveling in the region what what the advantage no realm is about is
