voluntary nerves in your spinal cord not up in your brain your legs your arms your face your fingers or swallowing and even your breathing can be paralyzed\nAnd the average age is about seven and a half years and they've noticed that comes after an acute respiratory infection in the late after in the late fall\nAnd it doesn't look good any good traces the spinal fluid and some of the children show a virus called HPV Seventy one but not all of them have that most of them have clean spinal fluid and they don't know what's going on right now they said our chances are one and a million of getting it\nHowever India has had Fifteen thousand cases over the last couple of years what cuts are right down to one in ten thousand\nSo what we want to make sure that it's not coming in and it's

who's at risk what are the long term effects what's the prevention and most important what's the treatment to this infection\nBailouts go it's scary though Gary why does it affect just children apparently found it\nMay it may be a because of the the respiratory virus that was out last year called de sixty eight really hit children very hard and put a lot of mental hospital and they noticed an association between severe respiratory infections and children and uh the acute flash of paralysis\nSo it's usually a you have to watch out for is that about a week or so after the coup respiratory

how does that sound that my ... today and get one year free\n[noise]\nI didn't quite have that twilight zone magic to it\nThat's one of the reasons I think yeah yeah the other reason is that rod really had no creative control over that series unfortunately what was his role [noise] well he he\nCreated the series um he he wrote the pilot film which was called my gallery was three stories and it was a it was kind of a ... movie of the week kind of\nThing and even hitched it he he's the one who probably pitched it to the network ...\nAfter that was such a success he pitched it and they kind of mutually pitched each other and and so he he wrote a lot for the series and he hosted it obviously but he had no say in cast and directing and editing and all that kind of thing and and you see\nThat kind of his absence come up all the time in episode we say ah you know rod would have done this or you know and he didn't have that freedom to do that\nHow come you never wrote a book\nWell he never a novel he did write your questions of short stories\nAnd storage sure but I'm getting the closest\nTo ever came to writing anything that was novel length was actually the stories that made up tonight gallery movie uh they originally were developed as they were long short stories I'm In a book called the season to be wary I'm ... but she never\nHad the time you know that's the simple answer he was he was so busy with tells me he he wanted to write a novel he really did but he just never could get away\nFor long enough period of time to dedicate to writing a novel [noise]\nThere's there's going to be a ... to the twilight zone\nYes it's it's already in production and it's just supposed to be coming out early next year I'm Jordan Peele who the director and writer of get out\nA is in charge of it he's going to be hosting it and producing it and from what little I've seen so far in terms of trailers and things um I Am cautiously optimistic I think they may actually get it right to some extent this time\nWe're the what's the venue for it where they're going to hear it\nIt's going to be on CBS all access\nSo it's not going to be on regular TV it's going to be a pay you know like um [noise] you know Netflix or Amazon Prime that kind of thing so CBS all access and the interesting thing about that is they launched the CBS all all access network with Star Trek with a new Star Trek series and now they're adding onto that with the twilight zone so it's like they you know the going way back to get these shows to to watch this new network so it tells you how\nYou know how classic these shows are that can be re injure reintroduced to a whole new audience in this way\nNicolas wasn't a rod surely one of the co writers of planet of the apes\nHe sure was and a lot of people still still don't are surprised when you say that but yes he was he didn't really get credit for it to the well he did get literally get credit for you on the screen it's ... it's the the credit is written by Michael Wilson and rod Serling a surgical\nCredit but ever since the movie came out there's always been this kind of you know what did he really right you know what what do you really can contribute to the final film and it's been a lot of misinformation and and speculation about what he did right so that's another thing that I think I clarify in the book\nSome of his is shows whether it was that gallery your twilight zone and in the era of supernatural to it what was his belief about that\n[noise] he was he was a skeptic but he was very interested in it he was a\nHeat you know Carol certainly was once asked that question and and I think the answer she gave us the best answer the gift [laughter] she said that he wanted to believe\nHe had that he really wanted to believe that you know the aliens had been here you know a thousand years ago and he was very open to these theories of you know the crop circles and you know they only visitations in UFO sightings and all that kind of stuff\nBut he was also very practical guy and he was he didn't have any experience of his own you'd never saw a spaceship or\nAnything like that so he was always skeptical but but he really had an interest in it and you know in the early seventies a rod narrated\nSome very popular ah documentaries about this kind of thing you know in search of ancient astronauts in search of ancient mysteries which led to the series in search of and during that time particularly he really got a interested in this thing but I don't think he ever you know went over to the side of being a true believer or anything like that\nNow the twilight zone there were thirty minute episodes but I guess mine is commercial time they were about what twenty two twenty three minutes\nTwenty four most of them yeah back then now nowadays or thirty minutes she'll be twenty two but back then it was twenty four yeah a little less commercials\nThat's still a lot of writing isn't it\nOh yeah yeah um yeah and and the amazing thing is how fully developed rod certainly could write a story and a character and twenty four minutes you know he he often a complaint about that to some extent said how hard it is to write a fully developed story and twenty four minutes and then he went out and did it over and over again you know so he\nUm he was able to succeed in a in a in a venue that you know it's very hard to succeed in\nIt's very difficult to pinpoint your very favorite twilight zone episode because they were all different and they were all great\nIt's yeah it's um you know it is and and the show was so yeah but as you said there are so they're so different it was very hard to to pigeon hole the twilight zone it covered the gamut from you know it's hard science fiction fantasy too westernized comedies to you know it went across the board so\nUm you know I you know I have a couple of favorites you know just a you know to\nThrow a couple of my favorite at this point probably as is walking distance wrote songs for season a episode about his kind of archetype or you know businessman who stressed out and wants to go back to his home town and you know religious youth and go back to a easier less stressful life\nWas that it will be the uh it's just like really as kind of a stop it will be a kind of a companion piece to its well distance\nYeah so they both very similar and they're both among among the favorites and that was that was a big theme Serling was this idea of going\nBack to his innocent youth in in Binghamton New York\nI I I Love like I mentioned I sing the body electric uh to serve man that was the classic a\nMan is yeah absolutely a classic and and it's again one of those shows that people still know to this day they know that ending its a cookbook you know the that stuff [laughter] ever [laughter]\nAnd then just so many good Leo what was the name of the one where the guy was obsessed with the ah he hated gambling and then all of a sudden he was obsessed with a slot machine that kept calling his name\nYeah that was called the fever and start a ever at Sloan who actually started rod Serling is very first breakthrough hit called patterns on crafts theater\nOr he started that and you start in the fever and yeah exactly he was he was against gambling and he got ... kind of dragged Las Vegas and he became a you know addicted to this one particular slot machine that they think says taunting him\nAnd it drove him crazy after a while then ... exactly right yeah\nFor the next day with us we're going to come back and take phone calls next our folks so if you want to chat about rod Serling talk about your favorite episode or just talk with Nicholas per ISI about some of the older type television programs check in

current state of TV\nWell I I think in a in one regard I think he would be thrilled with how adults television has become in you know in the in the realm of drama\nUh during the time that rod Serling his writing obviously we talked about some of the censorship but not on the issues but also the language and and just the ... the subject matter in general even if it wasn't a social issue um you know\nToday there are so many shows that are that are are so adults in scope or you know I don't even have to name them but you know Mad Men and Breaking Bad and\nYou know not just cable but but um but network television I think he would be thrilled with how how uh the with the quality of those shows now of course we have many more channels now and here there's certainly a whole lot of you know of of jumped to but um but I think in\nGeneral he would be happy with it and one thing I can tell you I'm sure he he would hate reality TV on the um he\nAnd and I don't say that just you know that's not just like me saying that at the time I you know I guess reality television for its time a rod had some very negative things to say about a show called this is your life if you remember this is your life\nUh this is your life with a show where they bring somebody onto the show in the normal you know regular everyday person and they will\nTrot as family members out there and they would go through his you know scrapbook and look at you know it was kind of reality television for the time and he just despise the show or you know I thought it was just the invasion of privacy and everything else so it's a reality of it and he would hate but [laughter] but I think there were so many shows now that he would absolutely love\nWill an old time television tuned to a really did not understand racial mix ups demographics when you look at some of these old shows where you gone back or even the comedians are the game shows\nThey were all older white guys you know in in I'm not I'm not talking like a middle age I'm ... older white guys [laughter] where did the television you know it would be difficult\nTo get that kind of a person like Jimmy Durante for example ... thinking him he was a big superstar very talented I don't think he would make it today\nYou might be right yeah yeah you could be right I mean well listen to the ... the um\nThe field has has grown so tremendously there's so much more competition that uh you know there'll be there'll be but it's kind of like talking about now major league baseball before the before Jackie Robinson you know and you know they didn't have the competition from the from the black player from the Latin player from all these places and how they were certainly people who played in the major leagues in Nineteen forty one\nWho may not have made it in Nineteen fifty one because there was so much more more competition\nWhat would I Would say about all the different channels available now in his day there was just three major networks now oh my God you've got hundreds of channels\nYeah well he would he would love the freedom that it that it gives to uh to writers and creators that you know in his day you know if those three networks didn't want to hear it that was it I mean you know and in some cases if he was you know had on the contract to CBS CBS didn't want to hear it that was it\nNowadays you know you can go to so many different outlets to get your creation\nOr seen and heard uh so yeah he would be thrilled with that aspect of it for sure\nI mean Netflix and Amazon truly rival the networks now don't they\nOh absolutely I some of the best television being made right now is on on those platforms\nIs amazing let's take some calls let's go west of the Rockies cursed in Boise idaho or to get us started Hi Kurt\nHey George I'm Glad he got Nick I Can't wait to read the book you mentioned earlier when you were talking about the impact of the fact that the entire series is in black and white\nAnd of course Nick mentioned that you know the film or look but I've always been amazed at what I was able to do with regarding the size of the SATs which to me it was as far as the visual impact was which was a testament to the\nYou know the semi talk for the lighting directors which I just\nI was just blown away with what they were able to accomplish sores ordering from Nick if he knew how many cameras but it used during the actual shoots okay Nick do you know\nI Do not know the answer that question by will absolutely agree with Kurt that it that's one of the striking things about the series is is that you know of course the production level in terms of budget\nYou know it was a fairly of generously budgeted show at the for the for the time but of course\nIn terms of special effects they weren't going to be able to give you the brilliance you know spaceships or shooting across the sky and that kind of things so that ... had to work with a you know more\nA relatively modest a set and the so and he did he got the most out of out of those particular sets and and every now and then to actually because budget was always a concern\nUm he would write a particular show that only took place in one the one room because it was going to be cheaper to make the actors one room and that's it and he would do one of those after they had a couple of expensive shows like I have the Boulder or\nYou know nightmare twenty thousand feet or something and then he would do one of these shows that we've got kinda got the budget back on the control\nHe jumped started many careers to did you not\nYeah I think so I mean it's it's certainly there are a lot of you know stars and soon\nTo be Robert Redford yay yay has learned Redford\nActually got his first job not on the twilight zone but in another show that rod Serling had written cold in the presence of mind enemies on playoff Ninety it was the very first appearance by Robert Robert Redford on TV [noise] uh and that was a great great show when he was a very good and that too\nYeah in the twilight zone episode he was a cop in the lady thought he was a death coming to get her yeah I'm not going to say what the ending is but that was a great show\nYeah was it was very that was written by George Clinton Johnson actually and that's a terrific show\nWhat was the name of the show Nicholas were ... more head was a woman in her house in a small flying saucer landed inside her house or something like that and she beat it with a broom\n[laughter] it's called the invaders and and that was written by Richard Matheson or the late great Richard Matheson uh he wrote several episodes of the show and that's one of the most well remembered\nEpisodes of the series it's ... it's largely dialogue free there's almost no dialogue in it until the very end when the when the you know spin a person you know a says a few things\nI found out who they were in the other one I like to was the lady who was having plastic surgery a because everybody thought she was ugly in a she wanted to look like everyone else and uh we sure found out what everyone else look like and that's\nThat's the eye of the beholder and that is um you know if there's a quintessential twilight zone episode I think that's that's it that's that's the one uh and again one of the most well remembered episode\nAnd the one that really gave me the message of people was the shelter above the fallout shelter\nYeah the shelter is a great a great episode Serling wrote that one\nAnd uh yeah it's about the idea that there's going to you know there's a there's a bomb threat a nuclear threat and what this what does this community do when there's only one bomb shelter and they all want to get into it and they can't get into it and they turn on each other and it was I was at that was a terrifically both on episode\nRenee in San Francisco is with us Hi Renee go ahead\nHi are you know I'm an episode that's a very rare episode but it was finally or at least ... years later and it was called miniature\nMiniature I don't remember that Nicholas dealer\nRobert Duvall absolutely right another great you know a great actor who one of his early early performances Robert Duvall a that was one of the hour long episode was the fourth season of the twilight zone they were all in our long as opposed to the half hour oh really yeah okay\nYeah and miniature was one of the hour long episode and it ... it was involved in a in a lawsuit at the time that\nUh the series went into syndication so it was not initially syndicated so it was not seen for decades or at least Twenty years\nOr in so that was long long settled and um there was a special on pulled the twilight zone silver anniversary special and they showed that particular episode along with a couple of others that had been similarly left out of the syndication package\nWhat was the tragedy when they were doing the twilight zone movie a helicopter crashed or something like that\nOh he has horrible horrible incident I'm a yeah helicopter crashed after an explosion you know special effects explosion and killed the moral starring in that particular story and two young children who are on the set\nA it was yeah you cast they pull over the\nTurner movie of course horrible horrible situation on Long Island New York is with us they just go ahead yeah Hi\nMake a couple of questions or\nOne would be the first one would be that seemed like it was very a scape is more than maybe someone stay back in the sexes so I'm just speculating if you had a job and he came home and watch the twilight zone\nOh I Am impressed with your memories they're fantastic all the detail you have thank you and I'm Wondering if you could help me with some trivia when I was reading science fiction in the seventies there was a short story that started out with at the end and then it had a little segment\nAnd you're rooting for somebody\nAnd they had the mental and then by the time he got to the\nBeginning you found everything was all turned around and I've been thinking about that story for a couple of months but I don't know the author\nOr not you know I I couldn't tell you that that that particular uh you know trope of starting with the ending going back to the beginning it has been done\nYou know a few times um you know in in stories and an end in film that I don't know if you've ever seen a movie called ... um that was the idea of that movie with the whole movie was told to kind of backwards started with the ending and un gradually backwards at the beginning [laughter] um but no that that's that I couldn't tell us from that from that description of may have written that\nDidn't one step beyond pop up after twilight zone\nYes uh yes out the outer limits came after the twilight zone as well but no actually one step beyond I Believe actually perceive the twilight zone by year I'm Out of limits came afterwards but I Believe a one step beyond which started in fifty eight I think\nNext up we're going to end in Tulsa, Oklahoma and were taken away I appreciate\nIt George Nick Sterling man he was he he had the ability to be able to understand human nature because if you listen to a lot of his episodes and I've got every one of them and I ... about every two months\nYou know every one of these shows has a point to it but he's trying to point to you know and I think it's because of the experiences at a combat soldier during World War two and which I you know it was all about uh the Nazi movement and all of that you know\nAnd the everything you've been through one of my favorite episodes it's hard to say which is my favorite but I think it had to be the one that's to be twenty five Mitchell twin engine bomber\nComing home from Italy crashes in the desert that the cat that airplane didn't go on a mission for whatever reason which was Robert Cummings Bob comings I'm Sorry and Bob coming it's just happened to be walking by a scene is newspaper of his airplane they had found laying in the desert\nAnd he went back in time where you went back to the desert in his mind\nAnd relive the experience even though he didn't fly that nation you know and or any I ended up in a hospital room\nAnd haven't psychiatric care trying to find out you know what caused him to add a nervous breakdown and it was because the shock of seeing an airplane on the newspaper just recently you know and when they when the show ended close to the ending of it\nThe nurse bodies clothing out there and she said well there's sand in his shoes\nAnd so somehow or another he really transport himself back in time to be twenty five ... crashed you know struggle with those shows that ... did\nHe had a time machine you know one of 'em this guy you know went back in time three different times and he thought he would try to capture events that took place one of them was just thinking of the Titanic\nThe guy went back tried to tried to change that well he failed you know at one time you went back and tried to stop the uh Japanese from being annihilated in Hiroshima trying to warn them that didn't do any good he got thrown in jail for his efforts on that\nSo I went back and he ended up in Nazi Germany but already thought he could alter that event\nCourse but a man I don't know we it they'd be hard to say which be my favorite episode the the the Christmas Story\nThe guy that played art Carney played the ah Santa Claus in a department store and the call Cowell was his name he wanted to be the biggest gift giver of all times the guy was all a shrine\nHand when he got a break from the department store you went and got drunk came back he was setting up on the chairs little boy jumped up in his lap\nSanta Claus just it was two grown man I mean he fell out of the chair on the floor you know where she got fired and everything he went outside and he was all down down he went in the back alley and picked up a bag and it turned into gifts mysteriously bag just all of a sudden became full of gifts instead of a you know and pecans\nMan he went around giving gifts to everybody and it just and that story\nYou know and the guy that ran a department store they found car well given these gifts out at this a place like a John three sixteen mission type place you know at least when it comes and goes where did you get all these gifts if you've got a receipt for all these ... and he goes no I just I found the bag and the gift rent it and I'm just giving them out\nTo the police station and the department store owner came in there so yeah there it is there is the merchandise go well you're at the bar by by you know and ah the guy's name was Mr done department store owner right and uh\nAnd they need to step out of the bag at the police station there wasn't nothing but empty cans in Iraq and so they had to let him go of course the store owner sitting here scratch your head the policemen scratches it couldn't figure out where all those gift recover from it they were coming out of that bag\nSo just before they released a coal oil Santa Claus he reached in the bag and grab a bottle of wine Nineteen thirty three and handed it to Mr gundy\n[noise] you know say merry Christmas and\nBoth of them got pretty pretty toasted on the wine and they walked outside and they seemed Santa Claus flying overhead and a slave with reindeer\nAnd ... and that right there just catches my heart Everytime\nI live in you as you mentioned something about cans and remember kick the can Nicholas\nOh sure sure yeah kick the can and that was actually re made in this well its own future film as well uh about a a old old folks home where a ... one of the old one of the people there and wants to get the get the residents to kick the can to feel young again and of course they do become young again my point kick the can and\nAnd the one person who was against it the whole time he didn't play and he didn't get to become young and he regrets it obviously and\nAnd that that was written by George Clinton Johnson actually that's a terrific episode\nWe're running out of time your neck but uh I I'm going to tell you this is a topic that is so dear to my heart of it brings back memories when I was a kid watching television my folks were there in the living room with those those are great time sort of thing\nAnd it's great memories yeah yeah it's it was a different time and you know for all of us and the yeah it's great to TV can bring you back that way and you know so it's yeah it's great to think about\nLife was different too sure it sure was yeah yeah absolutely it was a kid I didn't have a cure in the world we\nKnow and that's where the you know that that's something interrupt showing was was yearning for in a lot of us well isn't that supposed to be able to go back to being a kid and that being carefree and being innocent and and the less stress and everything else and that came out and and so many stories\nBy the way Billie was wrong about one thing you're

people do I just failed that everything else [laughter] not really\nBut you know I I was a middle aged guy always in a restaurant business I was a stock market forecaster I used to that was one of these guys who told Merrill Lynch which way the market was going I worked at a think\nTank parents got sick got called back to Connecticut\nAnd ended up in the antique business after a restaurant jobs didn't work out when things usually working life\nReally that's true but people love color collectibles aren't going to tell you when I Wish I still have my baseball\nCards from the Nineteen fifties I

Rose a couple of years ago in Los Angeles and the ... what would those cards you've been worse if you'd given them the him to sign even more\nNow I I actually don't think that would help the value very much probably it would hurt the value you don't want to do that with a you know you're better off having them sign a napkin\nYeah exactly now old football cards and stuff so they worth money too\nThat's what you should be buying right now really I always think if you do little things a little different than the average guy you'll make a little extra money right now everybody's on the baseball cards that nobody's buying football cards which means you should be buying football\n... interesting to write\nBasketball cards\nI once saw a guy who had a complete had Michael Jordan rookie
