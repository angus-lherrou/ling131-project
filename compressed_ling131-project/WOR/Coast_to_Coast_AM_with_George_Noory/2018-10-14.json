{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "The people tend to do better in life do so by taking action when opportunities arise they're not in their comfort zone they're not fearing all the time what they're doing is they're learning a skill that will allow them not only to help themselves maybe their kids their grandkids and again\nWhat I find with our students Ryan is they're not\nFrom a certain way or education or background\nThere simply people that are coach of all and they're passionate about learning something new again I mentioned this earlier the number one mistake that most people make with their money if they think they can do this on their own and then they'll go to the education later well that's the wrong thing to do one creates bad habits\nAnd number two they never do go back to do the education 'cause they blown up the money they had\nSo what do good students do I talk to them all the time number one\nThey've realized in the twenty first century that they could take a laptop anywhere in this world right now it doesn't matter because as long as they have an Internet connection and their laptop\nThey can trade all over the world in fact we had a student named beyond he's in San Diego and a lot of times are students feel it's too hard they can't do it well not only is being done this and his left his job which is exactly what everybody wants to do right we want to quit a job you don't love to do something we do love\nHe's become a excellent trader and he's also now started funding his wife's real estate business\nSo the two of them are doing something together\nSpending more time together spending more time on vacations in family but the important thing here Ryan is it they're loving what they're doing and there's so many people out there and if you're one of those people hopefully you can see how you can benefit from just learning a skill that can give you the freedom that you desire\nYeah absolutely and it's it's kind of interesting as we're as we're sitting here talking about the lifestyle of a traitor I'd just literally received a text message from a dear friend of mine and it just popped up on my phone and he was actually somebody who got me started in trading he was one of the first people who said this is how you open an account these are the steps that you go through\nIt very very first conversations these just become a lifelong dear friend of mine\nAnd he's a huge ski bum he lives up in Salt lake you just ... he travels around it as a great time\nHe just texted me with a picture of snow skis saying hey can you use these this season or should I take him to the ... because if I go to Salt Lake or use these ... from him rather than a hall in mind around\nBut it it's just there's just so much freedom that can come with it and it and it really ends up just pulling down to a couple of basic steps a couple of basic as you were saying\nChanges or actions that need to be taking because I think it's very critical it's very important it's it's very powerful once we do understand\nThat that that poor is just the state of mind right up passing over opportunities repeatedly and it's something that can be really easily changed just by stepping out of our comfort zone right just by stepping out of our comfort zone and doing something different we talk a lot about\nKind of cliche statements on the show here but it's because they're so true and there are so useful and and it goes back to if we've always done if we always do what we've done will always get what we got and if we're completely satisfied with where we are then then great let's continue to do what made us so happy in the first place\nBut if we want a little bit more for trying to create a little more income if we're trying to create a little more freedom if we have a specific goal\nThey were trying to accomplish that we haven't been able to get to we have to make the necessary change and that's one of the life lessons that my grandfather share it with me my whole life growing up he would hold up his five fingers I Would have to name all of them the first one is no your business the second one is be converted\nAnd that converted one as a youngster I honestly didn't understand what it meant and as I got involved with trading and I really started to go kind of soul searching down is is this something that's gonna work for me am I going to be able to do this\nThat converted when I started to realize was\nMake the necessary changes the necessary metamorphosis do what's necessary\nAnd and and in the beginning and that was the one I was kind of didn't put as much emphasis on when I was like ten eleven twelve even Eighteen Nineteen twenty you know but then as I really started into my my grown up years I started realizing\nHow be converted that pointer finger of the five to me became the most valuable because if we don't make the necessary changes we're never going to accomplish that kind of outlier goal that were after that one of the things we can do to help a few people get started with this as we still got a few tickets we can give away let's change some lives right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area\nThat they classes where you see exactly what it takes to really take control of the finance has really taken truly a retirement account generate more income inside of the

Ga Wall Street dot com and see if you can scores and passes there now Larry one of the things that I always like to say and I said earlier on the show as it doesn't matter if you have two dollars or two million dollars it's all about getting that money working for you\nAnd really getting it to generate that income so you can live the lifestyle you can reach the financial freedom goal that you're after but what are some of the things are what are some of the other kind of examples I Know you have your bags and bags loads of these of these examples of our students that you've talked to that we're in one place there now in another well\nThe first thing we always understand here is that with trading it's simply a transfer money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing\nAnd what's really sad as people will get themselves stuck think about this time right now people can sit in front of a television for hours versus going out there and learning a skill that can help them and every year and you were coming up to the holiday season again we're gonna start seeing all these Jim commercials again right\nBecause here comes resolution time and one of those things I hear a students say over and over again is beside wishing having had more time was this is the year I Want to get out of debt and I want to turn my finances around and what's amazing is how many students\nCome in through the classes that we're doing right now and simply imagine what their life would be like if they can learn a skill to help them generate more money\nAnd that's the key it's about doing something taking action and getting out here to change your current situation again if you're a coach shovel and something that you are really interested in learning how to do there is no limitations here in fact one of my students June\nShe actually came to my class and she said all she wanted to do is play golf in Costa Rica and so she started realizing that by learning how to trade gave her the time to do that I said it's great just sent me a postcard and she did and she said she was trading 'cause that's a whole nother piece of it\nPeople go on vacation Ryan right and they get raid the vacation they're making money to pay for it and so I asked you or your training before after golf she goes oh\nBefore of course that I loved that of course\nWe're talking with a group of students just a little while ago that the big trip through Europe and I remember him saying\nYou know where we were trading out in Europe and we made as much money out on our trip as we actually spent on the trip and so it's kinda fun to come back from a trip with a with a with a flat balance or even being up after having a great after having a great time\nAnd that's the thing is it doesn't matter where you are you just have to have an Internet connection doesn't matter where you are and it doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter what your background is it's all about just proactive we identify good opportunities\nAnd that's really what we introduced you to show you exactly what it takes how to do that inside of the half the class and we are pretty much at the end of the show but before we end we say we do to give away your let's give at least ten more people the opportunity to get some tickets here oh right right now we've got to have their class coming up in your area and a half to classes where you'll see exactly what it takes\nTo really reached that financial freedom generating more income in the markets like I always say if you're why is big enough you will find out how how is out at the half the class you know just a second you're going to have a chance to win a set of passes the one of these have to classes to get your bones writing if you're driving\nIs a great time to pull over including with your passages are professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like it had senior retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional insider kit makes it so you can get started right now\n... when he did a call now and reserve those seats the number is eight eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up being collars nine or Twenty one sorry about that but he does a pet ...

good morning I'm older varies one body has been recovered\nFor treatment is why we produce so\nMany men with prostate cancer with excellent quality of life in general this is the work we do every day here at radio ushered in New York it should be for Broadway\nBroadway thirty eight street in New York City where we accept most insurance is Medicare Medicaid and why we're on the radio every day to educate so that you can learn the\nOptions the surgeons at that super duper big place never told the results are so different if you came to a doctor Lederman if they did and they said well the success rate with radical surgery with us is twenty percent but do you go with Dr leader in the majority of the people are cancer free imagine\nHow many people would stick with that surgeon imagine how many people come here to radio surgery New York\nWell this word of mouth radio listeners save life I Know that you listen and save lives and you pass on the differences and you tell people the differences so many patients tell me that\nThe ... radio listener told them to come to Thirteen eighty four Broadway together for a second opinion for education and for this man most likely it will save his life this is the work that we do every day at Radio City New York\nAnd I want to speak about a woman she's a woman who was sixty eight years old she's marriage has kids and she felt the lump eight months ago in the left breast the upper inner portion of the left for us that was two and a half centimeters almost an inch and this is a woman who's sixteen years old she never had mammograms is another teaching point\nMammograms help save lives so she had this mess\nIn the left for us to think about the upper inner portion of the breast shut up by up she had showed cancer and then they removed\nLymph nodes while they told or only one lymph node was positive I went through the day that there was actually multiple them notes that were positive\nShe then had a PET scan other cats and and she was found to have chemotherapy and when she got chemotherapy she read the paper when there was chemotherapy testing showing her the benefit of getting chemotherapy with lymph node positive breast cancer her case was only three percent\nOf the doctors told her well it means that the chemotherapy is more toxic than the official and that's not really true and I met a lover of chemo you know that I bought a lover of anything unless it works to save\nYour life or life of our patients but whether it's the the testing showed was that the chemotherapy offered a three percent chance of benefit and this woman did not want to take\nChemotherapy ... unless there was a huge difference well in most women with breast cancer chemotherapy doesn't offer a huge difference she's one of the few women that actually saw the facts and the facts are the chemotherapy after surgery offers a very\nModest difference and then she totally lost interest in all the treatment which was a huge mistake because she missed entered doctors messed sending\nAre here for post operative radiation remember hit a cancer that started in the upper inner portion of the left breast and when she was diagnosed eight months ago already\nThat cancer traveled all the way across the breast\nInto the armpit that means they're cells already circulating from the primaries site in her breast all the way across the breast into the armpit it means that these cancer cells have the potential for them traveling even more and for eight months she's had no treatment her\nDoctors never told her the importance of treatments for doctors ever cold or how\nImportant it is to come to radio surgery New York to have her breast\nRadiated to help prevent this stage three cancer from killing her the purpose of treatment is to try to cure\nAnd no one ever told or they were all focused on how little benefit the chemo was offering and how great the toxicity of chemo and that's okay\nBut that just because chemotherapy doesn't help her very much or as much as you would like it doesn't mean that there aren't other treatments like our treatment for the treatment of her breast cancer that can help her tremendously and this is the work that we do every day\nHere at radio surgery in New York City for Broadway where\nWe treat women and men with cancer this woman I explained in vivid detail it's already been six months since er last PET scan her less damaging her last blood test and I suggested that we re stage are we focusing on what exactly she has where the cancer is hopefully the cancer hasn't traveled beyond the lymph nodes the armpit\nHopefully but we're going to document everything rather than just hope we're going to prove to her proved to her husband and proved to\nYou that the cancer hasn't yet traveled hopefully it has not yet travel\nBut I can tell you that in so many hospitals patients are treated as if the cancer doesn't grow\nIf your health is at stake you should stay away from the slow folks in so many hospitals that care is so in the fish and it often takes weeks and months to get things done and this woman eight months later and she's had no treatment\nFor her breast cancer it's unconscionable really if you think about it with our goal in treating patients with answers to cure the patient in a timely fashion and if you allow the cancer death of a head start and you have a mind to start\nAnd we do not want our patients to have a minus start\nWhich is another reason why so many people come to radio ... New York we have a real doctor a triple board certified cancer doctor working for you not working for the president of the hospital not working for the drug company not working for the surge is working for you and your sense the difference\nIf you choose to come for cancer care suspected cancer care\nTo us at third Judy for Broadway in New York City where we accept most insurance is Medicare

surgery our doctor Gilead I'm In the leading cancer and prostate cancer not in the first New York for ... brain surgery first in America and in the western hemisphere finding radio surgery you can also call Dr only in a minute to ensure killington for a\nFree informative and DVD hey Dr Lederman whereby\nWe are back on TALK about a gentleman who is a very interesting is sixty seven years old\nAnd he's from China and he listens to this radio show every day from Shanghai, China\nWhy well he likes the radio show he likes to learn is far away and he likes to learn new sixty seven years old he's married with three children and\nTwo years ago you had food sticking as you saw because itself because as the food tube\nAnd then this past summer the food is getting stuck bored with more pain and the lower to middle is soft because the food too and he was seen in China where he was residing where he lives and he had a scan the skin chose a mess this off because\nHe had one and ... and ... show anything of the second does could be showed\nCancer went to one of the biggest hospitals in Shanghai and they were just giving them fluids sugar water up by the every day they gave them fourteen or Fifteen days of sugar water educations\nAnd he was upset because the cancer was growing PET scan showed the cancer traveled he was having pain he lost a lot of weight he went from a hundred and fifty five two hundred and twenty pounds he lost thirty five pounds\nWithout being able to eat solids\nThat I said pain in the chest you had this ... of the shows women's cancer is a smoker\nActually is an ex smoker he smoked for fifty two years and um he came by the ticket from Shanghai, China here to Radio City New York he came only for consultation after listening to our radio shows every day on\nWhat's on the radio he listens on computer and I should tell you that if you don't have access to a\nRadio if you're out in the west the eastern part of the United states you can listen on the radio you could punch in the radio station name and look for live streaming and punch in and you\nToo can this while you're traveling around the world for living around the world so examine this man he has his way ms cancer is about a set of cancer patients so much pain and he's losing so much weight because he couldn't eat and\nHe only had a short period just stays a doctor Lederman I have to get back to China or it's going to cost me an extra twenty five thousand dollars for I don't know what this insurance or whatever it is\nDr leaving I Need your work a few intensive radio surgery pinpoint not invasive treatments to open up myself because like I heard you talking about the radio I said and he said can you please help me I said yes we will do everything we can to help you and they only gave me a few days to treat him\nWell she has neuropathy in her hands at her feet from the chemotherapy they gave her chemotherapy and all this extensive radiation has neuropathy in the hands and feet still persistent that's why we often talk about that\nSide effects of chemo are often life\nLong so she came to me I like them and to her and well one more thing\nWhen they removed the lump of cancer in Pennsylvania they left cancer behind the left what's called positive margins and they told her oh never mind that doesn't make a difference as well it does make a difference especially now knowing that her cancer has\nRecovered but she wasn't told that for the last three years even though her cat scans showed the cancer rickard can you imagine that\nAnd that's another reason why she's so upset that for three years they've been telling her that her cancer is fine she's intermission while in fact there's been nodules of cancer growing in the lungs for three years without her\nKnowledge now she said she liked her doctor a lot because he helped arrange a hotel for her near that hospital near that famous place in Pennsylvania\nMy thoughts are it'd be a lot better care was batter and he let someone else arranged the hotel or he told her what was going on then forgot about that hotel the point you go to the doctor is for medical care not for\nGoing to the motel six anyone can make a reservation motel six so we stage Rob she came to this huge ... all of this defect in her forehead or cancers back in the chest\nShe we arrange for PET scans to be done immediately to state your up we've had cancer and the lymph nodes cancer in the lungs cancer elsewhere so she has stage for recurrent cancer whereas elsewhere I should've been told everything was fine\nAnd we got the reports I showed her that was not fine\nSo that's why it's so important for patients have copies of the scans reports\nSo important to come for a second opinion she benefited greatly she now knows what she has and where it is and what are the options that of course she wants\nPinpoint treatment with us with just a few treatment she doesn't want months and months of treatment like they gave her at that place she wants a few treatments that are focused\nThat are intense of that have high success rates and this is the work we do here at Radio City New York whether she wants to cancer treatment and the lymph nodes like the super quick lymph nodes Russia's recurrent cancer in the lungs just cancer both the right and left\nLung and the adrenal gland\nMany people say doctor Lederman oh can you treat the adrenal gland or limb fills yes\nThese are techniques that we've perfected over decades we have the largest the longest experience in America and we're talking about a gentleman who has prostate cancer who used to nine PSA eighty Seventy years old already has three children\nAnd he had a biopsy of his prostate and nine Gleason score was found in hand areas they remember when you do a biopsy off of the urologist will\nStick a spring loaded gun and there's twelve corps or biopsies a comeback of those twelve showed cancer police nine is PSA has been rising up from six to eight and he went to one of the teaching hospitals in the neighboring state and it took him two weeks to recover from the biopsy which is another teaching point\nYou don't have to have pain and suffering from prostate cancer biopsy should be painless should be done quickly and most men\nThat icy never talk about this and went to a big teaching hospital ... students are residents which is fine everyone needs to learn that a patient needs to understand what it means to be in a teaching hospital it means that\nCommonly of a student or a resident doing the work this man went to a teaching hospital took two weeks to recover from a biopsy that in my experience\nThere is a recovery people are finding that even steal it they get a little out of the ... in the spring loaded gun pop\nAnd don't feel thing so for this fantasy Gleason line PSA prostate cancer I examined him is a large foggy prostate sage T. one seat and we talked about the reason for treatment and the reason for treatment well if he goes to the most famous surgeon further squeezing nine cancer of the day is all in our book\nWith page for figure three the success rate is only twenty three percent and the most

started treatment and he's happy to have started treatment\nBecause he knows he has the best chance to be cancer free\nAnd I want to speak about a woman who is forty eight years old so pretty young

the second time and so many people just kind of came out okay chemo X Y Z doesn't work say give it came on ABC and they give ... came out until the patient can take it and the patient dies that's what usually happens with stage four recurrent cancer and that's why so many people come to Radio City New Yorkers are fed up with chemo came out came\nA endless treatment are useless treatment\nThat that's why she's come to us she has bilateral high during a process that means that cancer is blocking her kidney so that means a year and can't get down to the bladder and\nShe was not told anything

done just a cat scans center out\nHere we were able to get that we're able to arrange for a biopsy to shore exactly what she has were able to treat this mass and get rid of the cancer get rid of the pain and get rid of the suffering and this is the work that we do every day we have experienced treating\nThousands of lung cancer is both cancers it started in the long Kansas City through the ribs spine and cause pain and suffering\nBleeding car rehab experience and were most likely able to stop\nOr shrink or make those cancers go away we see also many people with newly diagnosed lung cancers where they are just one spot and the surgeon wants to cut out part of their long and take away their breathing capacity and most patients who come to us just do not want to have their\nLung capacity

New York\nThis is talk rated number one seven ten W O law voice of New York\nThat all of a sudden you can start learning a skill that can make money and not have to sit there and think about a second job and again towel but later\nBut one of the ways I look at this and I get this analogy all the time when people are just simply trading one direction or they're waiting for the markets always go up it's like a car imagine that you were told you can get in a car tomorrow and you can drive somewhere but you can't put the car and reverse\nYou got to go in a lot of circles eventually going to get there but you can always a lot of time energy and money getting to the same place if you simply had all the tools to get you there faster so a lot of what I'm seeing our students learning the first time is it they're becoming\nDirection ally ... they don't care if it goes up down or sideways as long as the markets are moving they can learn how to make money and what a lot of them are seeing right now is they could create more freedom for themselves because they're able to make money no matter where the markets go\nYeah absolutely and I love I Love the analogy of the car and there's so many so many other analogies that we could pull into this that in in I always say in real life outside of the are investing life in our normal everyday life we there's no way\nIt was by a car that didn't go on a verse right but so many times we find ourselves in investments that only have one direction or one avenue where they can profit you know this the same thing you go back to our you know go back to high school education and where was your stock picking class where it was how to balance a checkbook class right the law to\nCheck it out right\nI just dated myself victory over there but it is it's true though I mean we we really didn't have\nThat stuff and so we're left to to rely on the quote unquote professionals really guide us through this process where unfortunately they make a commission off of these transactions and I say unfortunately kind of tongue in cheek there because that's okay with me that they make a commission that's\nThat's what they do for a living you know real estate brokers make a commission when they sell real estate so stockbrokers should naturally make a commission when they sell stocks\nBut when we buy a home it is up to it was up to the individual to make sure that they are buying the right home for them in the right market place in the right area that the right payment the right everything it's up to the person to do it\nThe broker just completes the transaction and unfortunately it's up to the person to also make sure that they're making the appropriate decision when it comes to their investing but when it really boils down to about Ninety nine percent of the world hasn't ... they spend more time analyzing the menu when they go out to dinner than they do analyzing what investments to to select\nIt it just puts his behind the eight ball and it's something that I think if we did a quick give away with a few more of these passes we could probably make a dent in and help people start making better investment decision I think it's a great idea let's do it All right well right now I've got a half day class coming up in your area they have their classes where you'll see exactly what it takes to generate more consistent income in the market\nUnderstand how the market works to understand what the risks are involved with a lot of different investments out there and early ... capital capitalize on the upside down and a half the class is about three hours long and so you'll be investing three hours of your time to really raise that financial IQ and start getting better and returns\nOn your investments now just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a good time to pull over\nIncluding with your passes it's going to be the professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more professional inside of kid makes it so you can get started right now\n... century twenty we need you to call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nWe are up against it need to take a quick little break Larry what do you have a force thankless\nTalk about more about the income they were talking about here but I Want to focus on income doesn't require you having to get a second job for all that passive or supplemental income and we'll talk about that right when we get back to Larry they\nIf you can invest just about three hours to open yourself to strategies that can make you financially secure for life would you do it\nFor over Twenty years on line training academy has

humans Larry Jacobs director of a structure development and top instructor it online training academy really shuts of life on consistent returns in the market\nSo one of my favorite topics though talking about consistency in the market\nSo many times I'll I'll run into different traders different investors and they've had some success they've had some success in the market but they really had a hard time duplicating it and that ends up being the key really in anything that we do is how can we make money consistently how can we make money over and over and the financial markets are no different it's all about that consistent approach being able to make\nMoney as the markets are going up being able to make money as the markets are going down and also being able to make money as the markets are going sideways we need to be generating income whether it's income for today or income for tomorrow in this segment we're going to spend a little bit more time talking about the income side of things but whether you're just tuning in\nMaybe your first time listening or maybe you've been with us for the whole show get excited the best is yet to come and learn a lot of our listeners like we were talking about are are are looking to replace their income with trading investing some are looking to upgrade their lifestyles with a little additional income\nAnd and you can even call it maybe that's that supplemental side that you were talking about a few minutes ago and and some are looking for this to go kind of beyond that supplemental and be their primary source of income\nAnd I've even heard people say that they're number one goal is to be able to fire their boss now now whether they're going to or not you know being in that position where you can make that call you know that starts to be that primary source of income but what are some of the key things that you guys work with students who are looking to supplement or they're looking to even build this was a primary source of income is a great\nQuestion right you know what I find with a lot of our students they first come into the academy thinking they want to make a lot of money when reality what they're looking for his freedom we've been doing this for over Twenty years we have over four hundred and fifty thousand students now in the academy and what we find over and over again especially coming to this class\nIs that they are really looking for freedom as I mentioned that could be they want to leave a job they don't like they want to spend more time with their families\nThey really are looking to take a vacation make people now are so nervous about going on vacation because they'd lose their jobs if they even took a day or two officer we're living in this constant stream of stress right now and what I'm finding is a lot of our students who come in thinking they want to make a lot of money\nIt's really about that freedom and it's funny a guy named Adam was one of my students\nAnd he actually did just what you said he wanted to come in here he was miserable at work\nAnd he finally got to a point we could trade and actually go into his boss and say I have enough and I had enough think about that to be comfortable enough so if all this did right now is bring you one really profitable trade wouldn't it be worth just coming in and exploring the opportunities here\nAbsolutely just kind of checking things out and seeing what it can do for you and that's whenever we talk about the happy classes whenever we talk about anything even at the half the class we always talk about risk versus reward\nAnd really specifically when you ... back to the half the class you know they have to classes or three hours long and see if you end up winning a a set of tickets to one of these you really investing three hours worth of your time and what if what if that three hours worth of your time was able to show you how you really could replace your income or how maybe you could raise your income by\nPercentage so that you could have that financial freedom that Larry it was just talking about and that's really kind\nOf the key to all this and you know what you were touching on was was the freedom side and and really those conversations go go fairly deep with ... with individuals one on one where you say you know what are you looking to accomplish as I go I Want to make an extra thousand bucks a month and that's a pretty quick conversation but then you say why\n... why do you want to make an extra thousand bucks and now that financial freedom conversation starts where you know you ... it's a it's a nice detailed process of well you know what my kids do this or I Want to do that and there's all these goals that they want to start accomplishing\nAnd part of what you need usually to accomplish those is a little more time one of the ways that helps you have a little more time is to have income coming from somewhere else having that supplemental\nSide of income you know where there's lots of different ways where we can build out the supplemental income it can be through a passive channel it could be through an active channel it can be through commodities it could be through options that could be through stocks\nBut one of the things about it is is we ... is one of these you always talk about I guess I should say there is is how multiple streams of income are are really kind of crucial throughout this whole process and you know the the average millionaire I think has has five or greater\nStreams of income and so when you think about like that that is that those those pieces supplementing each other if one goes away it's really no big deal you just get strategic and you build out another one now it's also one of the reasons why the the word job Jay obese stands for just over broke because if we just have one stream of income\nAnd it goes away well we're we're in her city right we're in stress city we're we're we're scrambling hopefully we got a little bit of savings to buy as little time but it ended up\nWhen we're throwing it into a deteriorating assets so just a few of the things that we want to want to keep in mind and one of the things I really love to have you Larry shed some light on in here because we do have a lot of our students\nWho are really out there trading they do have their retirement accounts and and when I talked to our students I'm hearing a lot of people say you know number one they either don't have enough money to retire on you know our number to those that do they're not quite sure really how to continue the growth\nAnd to protect the downside right and that's really that point you were getting at a before he took the break and so I'd love to give you kind of giving you the floor here to take that back over board or some of the things you and your instructor team are doing with investors to help make sure they have income for retirement\nAnd the number one mistake that most people may cause they think they can do this on their own then they wind up coming back and realizing they need the education\nSo we start talking to our students about is how they can start creating a strategy for success when it comes to the retirement\nRight now you know it's funny when the market started to go down this week a lot of my friends call me and they started going what does this mean they started getting all nervous now one student emailed me and said Larry do you see this is a bad thing in fact\nMost people who know what they're doing they're elated that this is starting to happen most people waiting ten years\nFor another market correction why because statistically the markets always tend to correct about every ten years or so last major when we had was obviously in two thousand eight here we are in two thousand Eighteen so what's now becoming more important than ever\nIs it took people about six years to recover from the last correction\nPeople out there listening if you don't have six years right now well you're planning to retire\nYou don't have anything saved right now you need to figure out how to create a plan to help protect you and a lot of our students come in the door\nReally nervous about I don't have enough money to start well you know what they're doing right it's pretty fascinating they're starting to learn how to trade other asset types like futures in ... and they're saving that money from trading and they're starting to fund their retirement accounts\nSo again a lot of people first thing they always say is like the mortgage I've got the kids' college up on\nTheir retirement always comes last so we start to teach her students read out of the gate\nThat they can come up with a plan they understand most importantly\nWhat you need is because a lot of people the one size fits all does not work when it comes to retirement you can't just do this you first have to figure out what your needs are learn how to manage that need most importantly how to learn some really important risk management and how to protect that money\nAnd then at the end of the day you will have enough to retire on based on what you need not someone else who's telling you what you need\nYou when you're talking about the kind of the cycles with the markets go through the big ups in the big downs and we do generally have a crash about every and we call them crashes but we do generally have a nice big drop in the markets about every ten years\nAnd one of the things about that is if you go back and look at um how often they're forty fifty sixty percent drops and so kind of that average uh that we can expect is about fifty percent if you go back into two thousand and eight new kind of measure that you got about a fifty percent drum Becky fifty eight percent about fifty eight percent you go back into their early to thousands fifty say the same thing\nAnd so if we come to here and we say OK here's here that's kind of what we can expect again that's kind of the new normal\nBut the thing that I went through with my father about ah we had a conversation about this you know back in about two thousand and eight\nOr you know we're talking about drops in the market we're talking about drops and accounts and and one of the things that we're we're kind of walking through was\nIf somebody had a fifty dollar if somebody had a hundred thousand dollar account\nAnd they lost fifty thousand and they lost fifty percent will they lost fifty thousand so now they're account value is that fifty thousand that happened in one year\nHere that drop happened I think it was fourteen months total rights that happened in pretty much just a year it went down when they take that average rate of return on the way up and let's just be very very generous and let's say somebody is averaging ten percent on the Web\nThat's ten years just to get back to break even 'cause when you take a hundred and you turn it into fifty\nTo take fifty and turn it into a one hundred requires a one hundred percent return on our money and so one of the conversation we're talking about was how long does it take the average person surely even get back to break even after going through a big catastrophic drop like that\nSo one of the scariest things right now is that people just don't have a plan that don't know what to do they haven't been educated and so unless you're really sitting there thinking about this and say to yourself fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me and\nAlbert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes was the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again it's amazing how many people are not willing to spend a little bit of money to get themselves educated to invest in themselves\nInstead of taking this big roller coaster ride and think about it Ryan going back to two thousand and eight if you knew when to get out of the market and locked in profit\nAnd then in two thousand nine you were sitting in cash it could've been one of the greatest time of your life right now so we had a three hundred percent increase since two thousand nine yet most people had no money because they lost it all in the correction\nYep absolutely one of the things we can do to help a few people really start to identify where to get in and where to get out where to protect where to grow as you get them out to one of the half day classes you ready for a little give away let's do it right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area and a half the cost of ... going to see exactly that how to generate more income how to keep that retirement account growing\nHow do I identify these turning points up down or sideways\nSo you'll know when to buy and you could know when to sell you could you could go back to the old know when to hold them know when to fold 'em type of the conversation on just a second you have a chance to win a set of passes or one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving\nRight now is a great time to pull over included with your passes is going to be our professional insiders kit that is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nThe professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started\nNow the ... century twenty when you get a call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com\nAnd see if you can score some passes there\nNow Larry I always I always said everybody when and I tried to say it on the show as much as I can well you have two dollars or two million dollars adapt to classes where you really get to see exactly what it takes to really get that money working for you and you're talking about it earlier as far as having our money working smarter for us and that's just doing the right things with our money\nYou know we've always also been talking about the market's being at all time highs and the risks that we have in there and then my dentist office I bring this up a lot on the show but it just it's so true inside of the financial markets\nThat might Dennis off as a kid shout out to Dr are buckle there's a plaque on the wall and every examination room where it says\nFor don't worry about your teeth and they'll go away you\nKnow being that same situation here that unfortunately has been proven true time after time minutes don't worry about your money don't worry about your retirement account and they'll go away\nYou know well let's just think about what people are doing right now in this moment we've been told that if\nTwo weeks is supposed to be investing in an Ira or some type of retirement plan which is great and then nothing against that but what people are not paying attention to is where they're investing that money and for the last two years people investing all time highs and so think about it you're an all time high\nWeek after week that's where you're investing your money and all of a sudden the market corrects well that correction is going to impact the first amount of money or the last amount of money that you basically have invested into\nSo now you've put majority or money in the market the last two or three years when it's been higher and higher and it takes a tremendous fall and this is why we said it earlier the market falls three times fast and then it goes up\nAnd as a result people see that fifty percent evaporation of wealth\nAnd that immediate sea of seeing that freaks out now let's take it a step further when the market goes down that dramatically like it did in two thousand eight what's next the loss of jobs for pictures and housing dividend cuts vivid and cut so all these things\nHave a greater impact than most people believe and yet there are people out there that continue every single day to roll the dice and take a chance and said this won't happen to me\nYeah there's a huge risk out there and that is a huge need for multiple streams of income and not just today but multiple streams of income throughout our life throughout every stage of our life\nTo create that stability and one of the things we can do to really help people get kind of jumped started into this multiple streams of income lifestyle is to get them out to one of the half day classes we still got a few passes here we can give away let's do it right now we've got to have to class going up in your area they have their classes where you'll see exactly what it takes really keep that retirement account growing\nMake sure we have income for today income for tomorrow and really generating and focusing on building out those multiple streams of income when the second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes on these half their classes switch phones ready and if you are driving now is a good time to pull over\nIncluding with your passes is going to be a professional insiders kitten other kids packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation ... capital preservation crypto currency is much much more\nThe professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now\n... century twenty we need you to call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that's eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nWe've got to take a quick break we'll be right back Larry\nWhatever force next let's talk about the lifestyle of a trade or a lot of our students are so happy they can move out of where they were to where they are now let's talk about what they do my favorite part\nOf every movie is just the editors cuts that's what we're going to do when we come back from this break we're going to go back to current on the lifestyle of a traitor right\nFrom a certain way or education or background\nThere's simply people that are ... and they're passionate about learning something new again I mentioned this earlier the number one mistake than most people make with their money is they think they can do this on their own and then they'll go to the education later well that's the wrong thing to do one creates bad habits\nAnd number two they never do go back to the education 'cause they blown up the money they had\nSo what do good students do I talk to them all the time number one\nThey realized in the twenty first century that they could take a laptop anywhere in this world right now it doesn't matter because as long as they have an Internet connection and their laptop\nThey can trade all over the world in fact we had a student named B or and he's in San Diego and a lot of times are students feel it's too hard they can't do it well not only is beyond done this and his left his job which is exactly what everybody wants to do right we want to quit a job you don't love to do something we do love\nHe's become a excellent trader and he's also now started funding his wife's real estate business\nSo the two of them are doing something together\nSpending more time together spending more time on vacations in family but the important thing here Ryan is it they're loving what they're doing and there's so many people out there and if you're one of those people hopefully you can see how you can benefit from just learning a skill that can give you the freedom that you desire\nYeah absolutely and it's it's kind of interesting is we're as we're sitting here talking about and the lifestyle of a traitor I'd just literally received a text message from a dear dear friend of mine and it just popped up on my phone and he was actually somebody who got me started in trading he was one of the first people who said this is how you open an account these are the steps that you go through\nIt very very first conversations they just become a lifelong dear friend of mine and he's a huge ski bum he lives up in Salt lake you just ski travels around it as a great time\nHe just texted me with a picture of snow skis saying hey can you use these this season or should I take him to the ... because if I go up to Salt Lake users bum a pair of skis from him rather than a hall in mine around\nBut it it's just there's just so much freedom that can come with it and it and it really ends up just pulling down to a couple of basic steps a couple of basic as you were saying changes or\nActions that need to be taking because I think it's very critical it's very important it's it's very powerful once we do understand\nThat that the poor is just the state of mind right that passing over opportunities repeatedly and it's something that can be really easily changed just by stepping out of our comfort zone right just by stepping out of our comfort zone and doing something different we talk a lot about\nKind of cliche statements on the show here but it's because they're so true and they're so useful and it goes back to if we've always done if we always do what we've done will always get what we got and if we're completely satisfied with where we are then then great let's continue to do what made us so happy in the first place\nBut if we want a little bit more for trying to cook it created a little more income if we're trying to create a little more freedom if we have a specific goal\nThat we're trying to accomplish that we haven't been able to get to we have to make the necessary changes and that's one of the life lessons that my grandfather shared with me my\nWhole life growing up he would hold up his five fingers and I would have to ... the first one is no your business is the second one is be converted and that converted one as a youngster I honestly didn't understand what it meant and as I got involved with trading and I really started to go kind of soul searching down is is this something that's gonna work for me am I going to be able to do this\nThat converted when I started to realize was make the necessary changes the necessary metamorphosis do what's necessary and and and in the beginning and that was the one I was kind of didn't put as much emphasis on when I was like ten eleven twelve even Eighteen Nineteen twenty you know but then as I really started into my my grown up years I started realizing\nHow be converted that pointer finger of the five to me became the most valuable because if we don't make the necessary changes we're never going to accomplish that kind of out\nFire goal that were after\nThat one of the things we can do to help a few people get started with this is we still got a few tickets we can give away let's change some lives right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area\nThey have to cost ... exactly what it takes to really take control of the finances really take control your retirement account generate more income inside of the market's really live that life the drafter and just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes one of these half day classes to get your bones writing if you are driving now is a good time to pulled over\nIncluded with your passes is going to be our professional

cancer treatment doctor they don't talk to you about a gentleman that sixty five years old he's a engineer he was born in her room he has about us to prostate cancer is going on all the usual treatments Lubrano Cassidy ... came out\nHe was diagnosed two years ago with back pain so unfortunately was diagnosed with cancer traveled and this is how prostate cancer used to be diagnosed in the old days before PSA which I remember a while for medical school and training\nThere was no PSA there was no early detection like today a most men were diagnosed with cancer had traveled\nWent to this fine patients had back pain Hi\nEssays now is going to say Seventeen Gleason night as a very aggressive cancer had met a study cancer he's been on\nA loop around and cast that extra two years with chemo and it never worked very well yes I just got out there for now it's been rising is more pain or he has more metastases rib is way it has gone down by twenty pounds from two ten to a hundred and Ninety pounds he's five foot seven he's an ex smoker\nI examined him he has pain or his stage for cancer through ... to ... to ... to ... to chemotherapy and that's why he's come to us\nFor help cleaning his prostate cancer and to get them out of pain and suffering this is the work that we do here at radio sort of New York\nWhat took you by the sixty four year old woman she's a real estate broker she has three kids she had mastectomy in two thousand twelve\nShe uh had the mistake to me I think that she could have saved her breast but unfortunately she went to one of the big hospitals where they seem to favor mastectomies ... to me and she had chemo and she had reconstruction and she had extensive lymphatic invasion\nOf for a for us but they never gave her chemotherapy which is a big issue then over\nI'm a recent holidays she went to the shopping center\nBlacked out she went to a hospital they took her by ambulance to a hospital in the hospital\nDid a scan of her had told her you got a brain tumor and luckily she got out of the hospital she came to me and we talked about all the options I told her all the options she was doing well we talked about fraction rid of surgery\nVersus other methods of treatment and then she went back to show or other doctors they said oh you've got a treatment today you've got a terrible brain tumor\nAs soon as she told him she saw Dr Lederman they've pushed her to have a treatment it's called gamma knife with screws and the head it was painful for was unpleasant for her and also the gamma night because it's one treatment it's less safe than our treatment studies have shown for a hundred years that if you give\nA small amount of fracture nation or separation of the dogs can avoid those painful screws we do not have those painful screws we stopped at twenty four years ago which tells you how long I've been involved in the field of radio surgery now for\nThirty years first in New York with radio certainly for brain first in America for radio search or the body the longest\nTrack record here unfortunately she went to the other place and they screwed on the frame and told her she had the treatment immediately and it was painful and unsatisfying for the woman she came back\nTo me to see what I thought of it I said I think it's really sad\nThat the doctors pushed or for that treatment that didn't need to push her\nBritish surgery is good but our radio surgeries patterns not invasive there's no coddling though bleeding screws and the head so it was big differences in treatment\nEven though she went to us I don't push anybody to do anything I Believe that every patient is the president of United States of his or her\nBody and that the other place she told him she went to Dr Lederman they brought up the screws and the rule drivers to screw ahead friend mentored treated the same day so do I think it's fair no\nThat's what we're fighting against every day here and in person and that's why we're on the radio together so you understand that there are options and you don't have to rush in for most things and she did not have to rush in and get a treatment that was\nPainful and difficult and less successful than our work we do have a book with about brain radio surgery if you want that\nIn color office who won two choices to one to two four six four to three seven for either a booklet\nOr DVD

cancer\nRates in the world government there came to us to help them out and we certainly said yes immediately\nThis is sixty eight year old man is a black man and he's from Jamaica so his double the risk really and we know that black men have doubled the death rate of other groups and we emphasize that not to scare you but to make you understand that every man could have prostate cancer\nEvery man can sadly die of prostate cancer\nAnd certain groups or even at higher risk like him being black in from Jamaica sixty years old this amount of drives flowers to Boston every day and well he has a\nRecurrent cancer he had biopsy and he was seen by doctors in New York and they treated him only with microwave treatment and Lutheran well that's not primary treatment for prostate cancer it\nDid it work they gave them loop run for five years loop run as an anti testosterone which left him with a massive ... of the man and six days old which shoe has breasts like Betty Boop and they never told him also that never told her about treatment options they never told him that he could come to us\nBefore he starts loop run to get a shot of radiation just to the ... or the breast bought areas to help prevent gone to master the breast growing has been a little brunch for five years he has huge brass which she doesn't want and the treatment didn't work\nSo the total failed approach unnecessary years of treatment unnecessary growth of his press unnecessary side effects\nOf loop run therapy with no benefit his PSA is higher than ever it's up to Eighteen yet microwave therapy didn't work and it caused great harm to his personal life I saw him I examined him he's got this high PSA got prostate cancer\nAnd this is why we're here we're here to treat prostate cancer and we're here to inform

Ninety\nFive formula of Kirk human which seven times greater absorption\nOkay well first of all I think well people might not know that term Kirk human they may well no ... which is a yellow spice and it shows up in curies and\nIt's part of the five thousand year old Indian ... system of medicine I've been studying ... and its derivative ... since the Nineteen seventies\nAnd I'll say this right off the bat that they are almost no plant materials in the world as extensively\nStudied is this a couple of thousand studies can be found in the scientific and medical literature we know that Kirk human is powerfully antioxidant we know that it has a remarkable capacity to protect the liver and deliver is our primary detoxify Oregon\nIt greatly enhances joined tell so people are experiencing joint discomfort due to overuse this really helps to relieve that and it's also what we called cardio protective\nIt helps to protect the heart it helps to maintain normal healthy cholesterol and one last thing that is really kind of astounding is that Kirk human actually causes your body to produce what are called neuro protective factors in the brain so\nIt causes your body to produce these\nAgents in the brain that protect the actual to issue of the nerves and the brain itself there's almost nothing else that we know of that does this\nSpecifically the b._b._c. um Ninety five that you mentioned offers about seven times the absorption of any other ... human extract so\nWhen you take two hundred fifty milligrams of this stuff you get about seven times the activity that you would if you took say a comparable amount of another curriculum and extract so this in my opinion is one of the most life and Hansing protective totally beneficial substances on earth and it has just\nDecades of scientific and medical studies to back it up\nNow Chris I Know that we talked about the green tea in the current human in your new green she she are liquid soft Joe formula which purity is given away for free today but tell me about the third nutrient on the list the risk their ritual which is super hot right now here was on some of the headlines and the science behind her spiritual\nI notes from red wine and French love it but why is it on your shortlist\nWell Rivera trial is one of those remarkable compounds that I just sort of shake my head at how many different things that does\nIt is found in wine grapes it also shows up and cranberries what we know about resveratrol is that like green tea and also like Kirk human extract it's profoundly antioxidant\nBut more than that it shows significant properties when you look at some of the things in the body if that happened during aging as a result of fat accumulation\nIn tissue and insulin insensitivity resveratrol helps to protect against those things so it's a powerful immune regulator and you know our immune system is responsible for keeping us healthy it is remarkably beneficial for the heart and this\nIs why it's considered one of the key is to the so called French paradox you know the French drink a lot of red wine they eat a lot of cheese they smoke cigarettes and they stay slim and they have good cardiovascular health which just seems completely unfair but is there a trial appears to be key in math and additionally\nThere is a brain benefit like there is with the current cumin\nWith blood flow to the brain so when you take resveratrol you get rain blood flow this means you get more oxygen to the tissues of the brain your brain cells stay healthier longer your mind is clear sharp and focused\nSo this is on my short list for all those reasons and for about a dozen more that would just plain take too long to explain\nAgain we're talking with Chris ... also known as the Indiana Jones of natural medicine sometimes called the medicine hunters well chrysalis laser in on how this wonderful formula you greeted conjunction with ...
