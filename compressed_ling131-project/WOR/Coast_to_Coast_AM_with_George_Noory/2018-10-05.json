I thought oh my God I'm agreeing with Lindsey Graham is truly frightening [laughter] but you know he basically said you turn to the Democrats you you better not get power because he can't handle it\nSo you know it's pretty scary and I I Will say this I think both sides have increasingly done it and the population is increasingly allowed themselves to be weaponized so you know the reality is is you know these people are not metaphors they're individuals and you have to judge them according to the evidence and according to the law\nAnd I'm now where does this come out I think that Kevin what it's going to be confirmed\nAnd it if he isn't confirmed as some of the moderates hold on it because if you you know if you do a deep dive into his record what it says he's he's a little bit more loyal to the establishment and the constitution\nSo I think he'd have to sort of bend the law to help the ... the establishment of the government go where they want to go and that's what's going to get some of the moderate you know problems and so but my guess he was going to be confirmed probably this weekend and what's interesting about this is the impact that will have on the election\nUm and I think one of the things that it's done it's it's really galvanized the Republican base because they're\nUh you know two weeks ago they were concerned about Trump's personality now you know in his tweeting now they're not they're concerned about what would happen if the um you know if the Democrats had the leadership position\nDo we do we all loses people because of all of this\n[noise] any any time any one of the things talk and support the violation of due process\nUm we we put our whole culture and our whole system in jeopardy and the whole our whole financial markets in jeopardy so you know I think this is we each have a responsibility under the constitution and long to\nTo protect the law and I'll tell you something you know I went through an eleven year highly lawless process where I was targeted in any you know efforts by government people to frame me mhm\nAnd when we have George Bush was that I literally you know I went to the process and safe\nAnd what happened was there were so many people inside the FBI at the department of justice or the different agencies involved or my attorneys or the general population who really believed in the law and it was here believe in a law that ultimately saved me\nSo we need to believe in and it's every one of us and um you know I think I think that a lot of people uh you know who have allowed themselves to be weaponized oh oh ah\nOh an apology to everybody involved or everybody had to give testimony and I certainly think the leadership that the Congress does American apology\nWe shall see how this all unfolds gatherings website so Larry SOL A.

Mr low ball as we talk about some horror films and the forest next hour we'll take your calls your questions and even your storage scale give us some of your favorites you have like tour films since you were a kid haven't you\nWell actually and and and briefly let me just say that William Castle wanted to direct a a\nRosemary's Baby but he had such a reputation doing gimmicky movie that they didn't let them do that but yet\nWhen I was a kid [noise] uh I was terrified of these I mean I I was like\nIn my Spiderman pajamas a you know just sweating under the coffee table shaking with year I'd have to go into the other room I was the kind of kid when the skipper were yelling Gilligan during Gilligan's Island\nI Would have to get out of the real you know it was a little too little too hot when skipper with yoga and whether it's you know\nAnd we were watching my dad and I think what a lot of movies that bonding thing you know authors dining\nCar and I'm the same way I was going to talk about that and I I Will but you're exactly right\nYou know I think I think women spend the money so I think that a lot of horror film but I think Korea has kind of been made and even with this new car or a with this new Halloween movie Jamie Lee Curtis is the hero she's she's going to kill a Michael Meyers when she gets a hold of them she ... she was praying for him to take that as being asylum so she could blow it brings out\nAnd I think that having heroic women in these movies that he didn't Star Wars you know and now Dr who was a woman\nI think that you know it's a it's a it's a these are women are still spending their money on media physical media on movies and they're they're controlling that dollar and I think we're going to see a lot of wind five five films with strong female will\nThrow throw out some percentages I'm going to give you some age brackets here among those who are Fifteen Years old to Twenty one percent of them do you think go to movies\n[noise] probably\nNone [laughter] none really [laughter] Fifteen to twenty\nFifteen to Twenty years old and I thought I Would\nI Would say forty ... above ... twenty to thirty twenty to thirty I Would say uh I Would bet I\nBet you that little higher maybe maybe ... percent\nThirty to forty percent usually\n[noise] thirty to forty I Would say I would say larger I Would I Would guess maybe fifty five\nReally okay now I think it starts coming down forty to fifty years old\nForty to fifty years old I think it yeah I think it would really come down I Would think the baby baby a twenty percent fifty to sixty\nAnd I would have probably even less and I don't know maybe the ... year old might be hanging in there but I think maybe the six year olds and and beyond are probably a much much more likely to enjoy a film in their home and the trouble going to a theater\nOne of the things we'll do just for fun next hour when we take calls for you is we'll ask the callers if they want to share their age it's up to them and vote on whether they go to movies or not I can't remember the last movie I went to\nI mean I I look at a lot at home on video I ... when you know they come out as a news new release or something I'll watch it but I Can't remember the last time I was in an actual really I\nDo enjoy I Do enjoy seeing a film in the theater with an audience but a lot of\nHiring unless you're really not sure if you're a business\nSo I I'm I'm biased because I'm watching the audience ...\nThat's what you do so that's one of the things we'll do folks who would take calls next hour in addition to your question your horror story of your favorite film if you want to give us she'd give time your age when you call in and uh let's ask you if you will when the last time you went to a movie\nOr you know what's interesting too about movies\nHow they have changed over the years I mean in the thirties and forties you had these grand musicals and these incredible songs and people were chance seen on them in the movies man those those days are gone\nMaybe they'll come you never know maybe they'll come back you know maybe George you know maybe you should dust off your capture you and I could make up all singing all dancing supernatural\nFor a dime a single George never was a tap dancer [laughter] to me I just saw a clip on YouTube a Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly dancing\nOr to take me out to the ball game they sang it has to do what and they were magnificent together I didn't know Sinatra could dance like that no no I always surprising how\nI was using the cartoon ... rail thin swaying next to a microphone I don't really think of him dance\nNow it's truly remarkable now are they still coming up with good horror films these days\nI kind of do you know you had mentioned the conjuring a movies\nI watch five years ago it was good that was two thousand Thirteen was in it I guess that's true but they're still making them there\nOn ... but I don't know third or fourth

you had um toy that you can get online where you have to walk into a store and buy it are you left out\nYou know that might be the kind of thing that you know kind of a attract that my better of

Japanese and being a good and pure assist which means you investigate everything\nYou have those little feet pajamas I think so I don't really remember them on it\nBut I've heard tales and ah anyway my father had inadvertently left a can of lighter fluid\nSitting on the kitchen table and you know I did what good Eighteen month old kids do and I put it in my mouth and I ended up in and out of intense drinking\nI drank it and that causes massive pneumonia and almost didn't make it so I think that there were some seeds planted then too that got me on this path of wanting to understand consciousness somebody\nOnce you were wrong I guess that's a nice way to think about\nYou do know I was born in Detroit and raised there and look through when I was twenty eight years old\nI think I knew that but I didn't remember until now so tell me where was\nThat I was born in the city and then we ended up moving to Dearborn Heights a war we spent most of my childhood and then the marsh first places I was to Michigan for me to the hills\nAnd then worked at all three television stations in Detroit to four and seven and then in Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to Nineteen Seventy years I moved to Minneapolis Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to St Louis knowing back and forth between St Louis in Los Angeles how about you know well\nI was right in Detroit right near city airport and ah it was about the time I figured out I could leave that I left and you know I still have a lot of nostalgia for Detroit and a lot of admiration for the people that are trying to make a difference there\nFamily still there I have some family um they moved out to Paris and township where I had my motives motorcycle accident\nWhen you're born heights really yeah well you\nKnow told me where cars you must remember there's the the street\nOh I don't I don't know who\nWas ... was it a busy street\nYeah it was a busy street but it was late and I think the trauma kind of over\nAre we going to I'm going to I'm going to close my eyes and I guess you'll remote feeling now that you were on telegraph road Mm that sounds that sounds about right near miss viewing skill new Michigan avenue\nYeah that sounds about right I Can't remember exactly to say for sure but I'm sure there's records\nOf its roots in your ... year my gosh\nYeah well thank you my friend I preach\nShe'll do this all really steer you in the direction where you are now um and you get a PHD and social anthropology you've just been elected vice president of the term psychological shows you usually get into that but this would lead the foundation for you\nWell I think it really started when I got to Wayne State University in downtown Detroit which you'll remember\nI Do and there were times worse the Detroit\nUh-huh good one oh really so that is right downtown yeah um well I discovered to books when I got into college in the first one was Thomas ... book\nCalled the structure of scientific revolutions and that book said that we live in a paradigm or a world view a kind of social construction of reality and that that world view has changed periodically through history\nAnd that was a big empowerment for me because I felt like well maybe what we're experiencing in Detroit this\nYou know kind of civil war that was going on the race war and class war and gender war and ultimately a worldview conflict I think that um maybe wasn't permanent and maybe wasn't defined by ultimate reality so that was liberating and then that led me to the second book which was psychic exploration\nBy Edgar Mitchell the Apollo fourteen out you're not ready and I didn't apply for the job at\nNo attic sciences but it was about ... Fifteen Years later that they invited me to come and be there director of research and worked my way up the ladder from their\nNon Europe show for your university no\nThat's right we're looking at ... personal experiences and from a psychological and\nNow what is the trench personal psychology what is the\nStuff you're interested in George it's all that kind of notion that there are aspects of our experience that transcend the physical\nThat people can have these kind of altered states or near death or out of body type of experiences and it doesn't mean it's pathological it means that may be a catalyst for some big breakthrough to understanding more about who we are and what the nature of reality might be\nMore with Dr Merrill Lynch ... just like the beer right it is and they were leaving only\nWell it's you know it comes from an old brewery village in Germany ... but uh actually ... brewery what she'll remember\nRemember the Troy lists\nAnd so the beer that made Milwaukee famous actually is now a Detroit beer at least last time I checked\nDo they do they still college which we're you know I don't know I haven't really uh gobbled up it's been yeah throw Hampshire\nRight although micro breweries have taken over\nWhat what have you know what have you learned about near death experiences above the other side what what can you conclude at this point\nWell I Know that culture takes a big role in defining what we experience so if we're told our entire life through our educational system and our families are work environment\nThat the only real valid reality is the physical you know that which we can measure and manipulate and\nTouch and taste a thin that's usually what we see and if we are brought up in a world your culture that except\nExtended realms of possibility then we're more likely to perceive those realms of possibility and some of it may be a cultural construction but I also believe very definitely that there are\nMore aspects of our human experience than just our physical embody met\nAnd if people can tap into this and use it in their living life I think they can do some remarkable things with that don't you\nI really do I think that if we start to own the power of our intention\nYou know the fact that the intention is a very important principle so from the morning when we get out of bed and we intend to make up a path or a plan going forward that's an expression of intention\nUh and then what about those big intentions where we want to achieve something\nYou know beyond our normal capacity that becomes a tremendous empowerment and so to the extent we can begin to cultivate these abilities I think the more we'll be able to accomplish those dreams that many of us have\nHave you come across any suing the stool

management theory\nThat was developed out of the work of Ernest backer who wrote that great book a denial of death\nAnd they have found that if people are you know functioning in a in a normal way and they get triggered by some reminder of their mortality it can lead to very pathological types of behaviors\nBut if you can bolster their sense of um personal worth their ... their value in the world and you you enhanced their self esteem you'll see that when you trigger them they actually become more optimistic they care about other people\nSo I think if we can approach this idea of death and the great mystery of it with an open heart and that kind of skepticism that is productive\nI think can become a great exploration and a wonderful adventure for people\nProbably could win no did you did you know gr Mitchell before he passed on yeah very well regarded worked\nWith them for years wonderful person Edgar said in the interview I did with\nHim for death makes life possible that you know I mean I was really interested in his story because he was a person who had been fighting in Korea he had been a test pilot and he talked about you know being on those aircraft carriers where\nWhen they would go off on a mission and then they had to come back and find the aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean it was like a needle in a haystack\nAnd so for him that was a scary moment\nWhen he got in the Apollo capsule and went to the moon he said you know there was plenty of space on the moon and it was hard to find [laughter] um but you know his thing that he said that I thought was so why is is that he felt that was much more important\nTo live a good life and to be a good citizen I'm to be loving inclined toward other people than it was to spend a lot of time worrying about what's going to happen next and I just thought that you know it's a powerful notion and he was a great man\nUsed their descended of evidence to prove that there's life after death [noise] if you were like quarter law ... knew this was challenged ducked was challenged or do you prove that there's life after\n[noise] so this would make a great reality show and I\nLove you Ina courtroom\nLet's do it [laughter] so you have a judge and jury and you have people representing different points of view on controversial topics so take this one you know life after death and you have these people arguing their various position\nWhich witnesses the common goal\nExactly giving their own um personal testimony based on their experiences ... put it right there and then you get into this question of what would shift to people's mind about\nThat question and is it that data is it the fact that in Stevenson collected these you know nearly a thousand cases and\nShowed that thirty five percent of them correlated with the birth mark is that what's going to persuade people or is it the personal experiences that somebody's reporting you know I had a conversation with my departed dad and he told me to go to this closet and find something\nYou know that's really persuasive for people much more than accumulating a lot of data I think\nI I think she'll to Dr Merrill Lynch which were those were going to take phone calls next hour\nAbout life after death let's talk a little bit Marilyn and the time we have remaining here about consciousness and how important it please and its role but it plays with all of this what would you first of all say consciousness is\nWhy I think again we can have many definitions for me it's been about our awareness and also\nOur lack of awareness of what we're not aware of so by that I mean when I first talked about Thomas ... book on paradigm shifts we live in a paradigm or a world view and the interesting thing to me about world views is that we don't even know that we have them\nAnd yet they're the most important thing that Shapes Our experience so it's like we're walking through life with these colored glasses on and it\nIt Shapes Our experiences and so we can't see those things that lie outside of our expectations and I think part of the process of becoming aware\nIs becoming aware that we're not aware\nAnd that we have what's called an attentional blindness for example we are primed to perceive those parts of the world that we expect to see and if we don't expect to see them we simply don't see them and I think that that is a remarkable\nUh aspect of what our consciousness is all about it's a lot of a functioning on auto pilot at the unconscious level and to the extent we can\nYou know turn the light on what those experiences are and what Shapes Our awareness where are we placing our attention that then offers us a point of liberation into expanding what we understand to be true\nDo you believe that the consciousness Lou ... outside of the brain\nI Do I think consciousness is something that has intelligence it is self correcting it is reflective\nAnd so you can go into a rain forest and see that as consciousness manifest in the forest because every ... is filled with life and with that intention\nTo manifest life and so I I Do believe that consciousness as something much bigger than our individual brain\nI don't think it's an ... the phenomenon of the brain and at the same time I think the brain is kind of like you know the radio that is taking the signal and so if you destroy the brain you may destroyed the radio it doesn't mean you've destroyed the consciousness\nOr the signal or the signal exactly\nIt keeps me actually rule will science ever meet\nThe spiritual ...\n[noise] I think so I mean I think we're getting closer and closer all the time I just spent time with Sophia the Android she's a robot\nNew Hartford was her yeah she'd be great for you to interview 'em and see if they would do it in a way that doesn't give me one has a talk show host or she's doing a good [noise] I Do worry you're nobody better than your George\nWe're we're coming back with phone calls your calls next on coast to coast to find out more about just going to go to ... dot com\nMy friends I mean\nWas doing or\nSpecial and I don't know\nIf you ... dollars or more in back taxes maybe

A. R. N. I. V. O. R. A. dot com call no\n[noise]\n\nWelcome\nBack Dr Merrill Lynch Luttrell those Marilyn in this reality court room how do you think the jury would decide based on his third wife to death\nI think most people believe there's something there I think people have had experiences that give them a sense that\nI think that there are a lot of experiences that people report you know\nBeyond the survival of consciousness or identity you know people ... reporting of like pre cognition knowledge of the future\nUh people you know doing what you did about looking into your mind for information about a geographical location the whole remote viewing paradigm you know they're all kinds of experiences that people have had that they report regularly and that\nThe majority of our population and including people with\nHigher levels of education report so this isn't just something that people experience who have no education and you know the critics would say you know they just don't know any better uh in fact what it is is something that people have very direct personal experiences about and which can change their lives\nAnd you have written in the book how some people's lives have been changed dramatically through this change\n[noise] yeah I wrote a book called living deeply the art and science of transformation and we were very interested in trying to understand how people\nCan gain a perspective on life that is richer and full or and less filled with stress and anxiety and\nHow can we do that and we know that a lot of people can become very rigid and fixed in their perspectives and opinions but it's also possible that people\nYou know began to shift their perspective and these kinds of experiences can lead to the sense that the world is more expansive and more complex and more\nMysterious than we had previously understood so we started to interview people about it we talked to the mistakes and we talked to the great spiritual leaders and people representing different kinds of\nYou know traditional a ritual practice type of orientation send and not in that we really created kind of a change model that said to us that there are ways in which we can\nBegin to bring our awareness and our intention to creating our life in ways that are are positive are um imbued with meaning and purpose and that ultimately lead to happier healthier experiences\nHaagen were younger people react to these things now what do you think\nWell I think we have seen a generation of people grow up with the media with video games that expand their sense of what they're capable of\nUh there's certainly a lot of fascination with ice you know horror movies I think you were talking about that last program\nYou know I think our imaginations are very fertile I think popular culture has a way of training us and we know that these kinds of topics are extremely interesting for people who choose TV shows or movies to go see so what's that about you know is that about\nJust something that is idle curiosity or is it something that helps them to take a deep dive into their own personal experiences and I think the ladder maybe what's happening\nWants to take some calls will pick it up I'm going to Giovanni in Los Angeles on the wild card line are you there\nGiovanni hey how's it going your roommate me it's been a war\nYeah and I've been a while and I'm always listening I Love the show\nAs always and a doctor Marilyn thank you so much for the work that you're doing on consciousness absolutely necessary your pioneer and I hope you continue doing your work and I hope that this uh this this birth more a wonder and and and and after you off into this world\nBut I wanted to share that experience of mine that are just really springs to mind when I heard you\nTalk about the about the forest or about the jungle it ended up being a form of consciousness or out of a of kind of a a pure consciousness\nWell my parents are from Nicaragua and uh our our indigenous people are\nVery very uh very rich culture of um of mysticism and and also ah you know being able to travel into you know in three dimensional and\nAnd ah and explored the potential of the mind\nThrough um through an ancient practices\nAnd so it's been instilled in me overtime or the practice meditation one uh one one one one moment at one time I'm On my travels I was probably Nicaragua and the Nick and Nick and in Nicaragua there's a a jungle called luck than on negative or roughly childhood or the the black a jungle\nAnd the this this black jungle is just as an Asian jungle with\nMost of it as untouched by man very rarely ex lord still still rich with with a with a with undiscovered I'm a lord knows what's out there but\nUh when I was in the jungle I sat down to meditate and while I was meditating maybe an hour into my meditation\nI felt what I believed to be this pure consciousness I stumped the jungle\n... it was so strong that I had trouble breaking for my meditation and and to a certain point I became a little bit\nHammered a bit bit fearful because I I was I kind of lost control over my ability to extract myself from the meditation for a moment\nAnd I believe that this is your consciousness was was calling me or or or trying to pull me into it somehow and I wanted to share that caused them if I Do believe that there's more out there ...\nAnd ah the more we explore the more we'll find just like you said if we put it into our mind that there's something there we will find it as opposed to just shrug it off and not believing something is there what did you think about ...\nI Am so grateful for that comment and the question I appreciate your support of words and I think that one of the reasons that many traditions have a guide you know a position in society that is\nThat a spiritual leader or you know domestic who's been on the past before so they can help guide the process because I think it's true that you can get pulled into realms and experience that are unfamiliar\nThat are unchartered and that have the capacity to kind of take us out with them and if you are with somebody who's experienced in a lot of this kind of journey work\nOr they can help calibrate that and you know keep you grounded in the experience but it sounds pretty remarkable I Will say one time I was in a meditation practice with Francis von ...\nAnd there's no doubt about that
