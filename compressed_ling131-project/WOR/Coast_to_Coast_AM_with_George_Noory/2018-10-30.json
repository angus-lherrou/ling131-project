{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "Free booklet DVD called two one two choices\nTwo one two choices most insurance is Medicare Medicaid accepted\nCalled Dr Lederman two one two choices\nSearching for Broadway and thirty eight for appointments called two one two choices\nWelcome back to the radio surgery our doctor Gilead I'm In the leading cancer and prostate cancer not in the first New York for ... first in America\nAnd in the western hemisphere plus finding waiting surgery you can also call Dr Lieberman at you when you're killing for a free informative and DVD pay Dr Lederman whereby\nWe are back when I'm such a Lederman we are here to be with you to learn together one thing about fifty six year old man he's married and he was fine until about eight months ago he was seen by a doctor he had a biopsy a cancer to cancer spreads who was fine and those ribs well he had\nStage for cancer he started chemotherapy it of course the chemo doctors say we'll take came over because came a goes everywhere chemo was best for you well the guy took chemo and guess what happened\nNothing he's lost twenty five pounds he's in more pain he got a follow up scan and the chemo was not\nWorking came out when at worst stage for cancer usually only works temporarily capped but works\nI Know that came up guys love to give chemo I Love the pharmaceutical industry loves that you'd give chemo because it's ten thousand dollars on average a month the hospitals law but the chemo doctors love and almost everybody loves it\nExcept for one person and that is often the patient like this man was only fifty six medals steady cancer losing weight loss twenty five pounds and paying the chemo was not working the scans show he has a massive as bones is that a steady cancer and he's come to us for\nTreatment because the ... not working\nSo many people come to us when the chemo doesn't work you can also come in place of chemo which is a great idea that we're talking about uh sixty two year old man from Ohio\nIs married with one son and he has a Gleason six cancer and a PSA eleven so it's an intermediate risk if he had surgery radical surgery robotic surgery or standard radiation success rate is only sixty percent with us it's Ninety percent so there's lots of reasons for him to come to us with\nRadical surgery or robotic surgery most likely he'll lose the sex life most likely he will be leaking urine and all the chance of success is not so fantastic\nIn fact if you look at our prostate book when You're welcome to call\nUs to get a prostate Brooklyn or come in you can see if you have a PSA\nTen to twenty and you go to the most famous surgeon and America the success rates only thirty percent\nSo again showing you the radical surgery removing your prostate robotic surgery is a lousy option it's a big surgery it's like getting hit by a train and there's a recovery and the complication right which is so high\nComplication rates to sex life that year and every life\nAnd this is what most commonly happens to men who choose surgery why so many men come to Thirteen eighty four Broadway this man as a a Gleason six PSA eleven prostate cancer we spoke about all the options and he wants option number one which is us\nBecause he wants to the best chance to be cancer free and there was a man who came to us from Germany's eighty one years old he's with his wife just died two weeks ago from concrete tightest knot pancreas cancer with pancreas title and he has three children eat\nComes from Germany's a non smoker and he had blood and urine so\nAnother teaching point abnormal blood is a warning sign of abnormal blood you may want to come into the U.S normal blood in the year and he went to see your ... which is a doctor specializing in the urinary systems surgeon who specializes and that sort of looked inside and he saw cancer\nAnd the problem is he saw cancer but he didn't do a biopsy deep enough to show us how invasive cancer was the patient at a high rate invasive cancer\nBut he didn't take any muscle now though Blatter has two parts one is the lining where the cancer usually starts and then the muscle the muscle the squeezes pushes year year and in my ear and out into the world what we need to see if that cancer invades in to the muscle\nWithout knowing that the doctor just\nOr the superficial treatment the CGI for superficial cancer but we don't know if he as superficial cancer invasive cancer they started treatment\nThat may be totally inappropriate for invasive cancer and the surges already told him that he probably needs to remove the bladder well this man\nCame to us because he does not want to have this bladder remote does it seem like a fight between us and the surgeons weld is but the surgeons don't tell you about us we talk about the surgeons in surgery but certainly don't want to know that we exist because if they\nTell each patient the options the true options probably no patient or a few patients would have radical surgery on their own weather are\nNon invasive treatments like our treatment for bladder cancer and that's why this man came to learn to truth to learn what's going on\nHow you could save his life and how we can save his bladder and what he should do and we made arrangements for him and he understands that the surge and discovering them treatment not\nKnowing if the answers to the base of or not this is the work we do treat bladder cancer is every day why because most people want to urinate in the same way that the ... and say we're toddler they don't want to go through a radical surgery with the same success rate\nWith a good quality of life with avoiding treatment fan I saw sixty four year old man this week he's married has five children who came in with a PSA\nFourteen has been seen by doctors ... four times a night the doctors to help them with the urine and they didn't tell them that the usa fourteen was off the wall normal PSA considered up before so it was more than three times higher he's never had a\nBiopsy exam but this prostate as prestigious large so what does it need well repeated the PSA we're giving them medicine to help with his urine and we're finding out if he has cancer or not so important he wants to live\nHe does not want to die of prostate cancer and he knows the people that are treated for prostate cancer have a twenty percent reduction in death rate from\nProstate cancer and I wanted to speak about a man who sixty years old is an accountant who was diagnosed\nWith colon cancer in the past two thousand eight and well he was doing okay until this past year it back and he was probably have cancer spread to the sacred\nYou went to one of the super biggest hospitals and the tri state area the biopsy the bone marrow biopsy the sacred and then they gave him Fifteen general large treatments to the\nPelvis for cancer was in the boat instead of doing what we do which is focusing on the cancer old Lee and give a few very intensive treatments you got large fields of radiation Fifteen treatments that three times more treatments two hundred percent more\nThat was great that doctors get paid by the treatments we give the leaf tree but why because we want to do what's best for the patient focused to be on the cancer not hurt the healthy tissues clothes a super duper big place gave him Fifteen treatments\nTo general areas and chemotherapy and now he's lost control of the euro and the radiation after he had the radiation he's lost control of the year and that he believes that the emptying the bladder\nControl has been lost because of the general fields I saw the fields and that was not what we do we do can point treatment why do we do pinpoint treatment to hit the cancer and not cause collateral damage that's what body radio certainly is all about\nThat's why we brought body radio started to America that's why we have the longest experience with every hospital including the biggest like this one and the biggest doctors and facilities cuts standard was okay\nMaybe this will get paid by the treatment but think about what you went to medical school for ...

to hassle of women there so you don't do it\nBut we wish you had to take into consideration is is that women are going to run things there's there's absolutely no question about that because they are going to be the most educated I mean the glass ceiling has been shattered for a long time but we're starting to see many many more women come into the c._e._o. positions\nAnd they're good one I ... yeah oh excellent went absolutely Exxon once [noise] and and uh\nSo we're ... we're seeing a major major change in our culture Twenty years from now you won't you won't recognize a commerce you just

thousand five to ... thousand twenty four [noise]\nSo in that fully there uh but Gen Z is not going to be entirely different\nThan Gen Y they that they are going to be this the same cyber reliant generation or they won't be as big because the number of parents that they have is is much smaller in generation X. generation X essentially is the parents of Gen Z\nA but it's what we're watching is is is a ... a new crop of kids and and I tell folks and he said listen you know people say well they they ... they complain about the new kids they complain about generation y they complain about the millennials they caught complain about the\nSame you know the kids don't want to work there they're entitled to it you know there's all kinds of things that are that I'm hearing about them and he said let alone let them grow up\nAs soon as they have to feed themselves they're going to be find it just going to be just like the hippies that everybody hated this as soon as they had to feed themselves and and and face reality I'm In my joke is they became Republicans so\n[laughter] you're gonna get blasted for that\nI don't care listen it is what it is [laughter] what but listen here's here's how it works is zero to a hundred years old when you're a baby you want what you want what you want it you want it now you don't you want it for free\nYou're a liberal and then once you're about ten years old and you have a some positions at the other kids don't deserve suddenly become a conservative\nSo what you have is you have conservatives at one end of the population and you have a a liberals at the other end of the population where we're gaining a liberal every eight seconds because they're coming of age to vote and we're losing their conservative every sixteen seconds because they're dying\nSo on all we're we're going to be a nation of liberals\nWhy can't people just here about people whether you're a liberal or conservative who cares why can't they just do the right thing\nYeah what he told me\nThat makes me crazy you know this whole division that we have going on now in our country\nAnd it's horrible yeah it it troubles me it really does we not\nIt's not what we're supposed to do I mean when you have a name and listen I'm I'm I'm a I'm a Republican but when you have a president day takes on a porn star in public and they have a fight on Twitter give me a break\nThat's the problem yeah\nThat's and that's part of the new technology again did anybody ever anticipate that you think or Jack Dorsey when he founded Twitter not that it would be used the tools like that I don't think so\nI Know that when when when you think of the mind that people in like the Eighteen hundreds there's more information in a in a single Wall Street journal and somebody would ever think about an individual would think about in the Eighteen hundreds so I I don't know is\nWhen you talk about the trends and change this is what we're losing Ken we're losing the ability to debate question discuss with all people screaming at each other\nI mean those days are gone I mean I I heard a couple of people in a restaurant tonight instead of just talking about something they're screaming at each other because they didn't you get ... they didn't agree with each other and in I've never seen that this bad him you\nKnow no I haven't and it it's called diplomacy and I wonder where it's way where it's gone I I I just simply don't know you know people ... ...\nI I Can't tell you the number of people at George that say to me I you know why don't we run our our government like a business and and so we you know where you're going to have these huge deficits and we won't make all these mistakes [noise]\nIf you think about it I'd rather have a government that runs like a government a diplomatic government or a Republican that's based on a constitution not one that's based on business\nPrinciples we used to have that yeah we used to have that but now we have a government\nThat's essentially run on business principles and it's it seems like there's there's no uh the you know we've we've just taken all we've removed the rules but what we've taken away the the we've taken away the diplomacy that was necessary to be a diplomat\nWill what's going on with China\nChina's enter freaky position China right now a\nNeighbor lax their uh their their child law to write how many

down\nChina's cooked and it\nKind of I'm Sorry that but that's that's just if I Can't think of it in any other way to say what they've done is they've they've committed the biggest demographic blunder and a history of the world with that one child only policies\nThey did it for about forty years so what what they have in effect under forty years old down to about three years old which is like three years ago they they change the policy what now they're letting their populace have as many kids is\nA novel desperate for uh how's it going to catch up\nNow you can't fix it because you you you you can't suddenly um you know people are born babies born is adult\nBuyers that's for sure no\nSo which which you have is is they're missing and this is a real number I'm a five\nHundred million people that weren't born five hundred million and a half\nBillion so so here's here's how it works any country I don't care if you're if you're a Polynesian islands or you're you're a United States you need to have heavy lifters you need to have people that make big incomes that have you know a big houses and consume a lot of state federal and local tax\nI mean China is run on tax just like the United states has but what they've done is they've eliminated a half billion taxpayers a half billion people that would go into their labor force and a half billion consumers\nUh and the the the the starting in about twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen their labor force is starting to shrink it had been expanding for years and years to what's going to happen well that will lead cooked himself because they're going to have\nA sexually a quarter of a billion elderly that they've got to support that can support themselves and now\nThat they they have a whole new crop of of kids that can support themselves and who's supposed to pay the tax\nGeez now what could happen in how could this affect us militarily would try to I mean would they do something desperate\nYeah what what whenever a country gets in trouble um with ah their economy the first thing that they do is they saber rattling which is what they're\nDoing and that's right and then go to war\nYeah they well they they they may not go to war because you know how many wars China has won in China's history zero they've never went to war\nI don't know what's going to happen there but but it's it's it's a it's essentially the same thing that's happening in South Korea and it's the same thing that's happening in Japan and that is they they don't have enough people\nTo to feed their system there there are the kind of he's not going to

star\nBecause she had nowhere to go and needed cash path and that lawyer is what Italians referred to as an old fashioned grease off he thought he was actually going to that he would he could run and possibly win\nA presidential nomination for the Democrats\nUm this was sold but weren't self serving isn't strong enough for ... both of those guys yet and all they had\nWas temporarily side tracked I'm a booming economy or tried to bring down that's nan but more importantly that man has had actually a little one still at home I yeah and that little one but a young white and ... and his wife\nAnd we had a president and did something so by all can't even talk about on on on radio in the oval office while I was aiming for him with my tax dollars\nAnd everybody said oh he has a right to a private life this guy did that if he did that was over a decade about so\nI don't have a problem with him saying whatever you want because you have to remember\nFrom its reactionary he doesn't start fights you look at everything from his campaign going forward he has reactionary if you'll pick on him he's going to come back at you that's human nature that second thing I disagree that is sad is that\nI'm ... now I'm not a senior in high school but and but I'm the I'm not that old either\nWhen I was a senior in high school I said that this country is nothing more than a big business\nAnd it should be run like a business I have started to successful business myself\nIs that men and women don't have time for now and then\nYou get a deal done we're not going to have a needing to have a meeting to have a meeting and then to pick a committee and then this and that we don't have time for that they're spending our money and so the fact that you're saying we need more diplomacy diplomacy death when ward\nDiplomacy doesn't save money we need a businessman I voted for him because he said no nonsense that is that anyone that would bankrupt it four times and they had the audacity to get back up yet on the horse\nI that I have\nIncredible admiration for people that are fighters in it and he doesn't care if people call him a racist\nBecause God Knows what than it is hard and other people know that ... I ... it doesn't matter about his policy she knows she is as I as a man and and uh and as a prize of that so I disagree with you on\nOh I'm Sorry let's get let's get his comments data in your comments are warranted obviously and you have a right to say these things what can you want to jump in\n[noise] well ... ... regarding running it but I'm the country as a business I think you need to run a country as a country that's been the single biggest enemy to any country a period is corruption and the business model does not protect us from corruption\nI think one of the things that when people say you run the country as a business let me give you an example I think you know most businesses are bottom line oriented\nYou're not going to pay thirty thousand dollars for a screwdriver or toilets or you're the pay the fair market value or even try to get it for the last one I think when people say let's let the country run as a business they're talking about things like that where let's not waste money as a nation\nYeah I I Would respect that I I Would I Would agree with that as well but it would also say that that our country is a public way the constitution and the constitution works where we have the best country on earth we have the best system on earth\nAnd the thing that frightens me about a ... a a a government run like a business is that the business model cannot protect you against corruption but the but the um Republican Ken that that's that's my position on that\nRight and you want to comment on my comments on the president's tweeting\nYeah you know I I don't disagree with with um ah the fact that this you know porn star in it and our attorney are are self serving they absolutely are self serving what I Wish our president would do is just\nNot areas you know this dirty laundry in public I just wish it wouldn't happen\nNow but ... let me ask you this devil's advocate in by the way I've commented on his tweeting too because I I think he needs to be a little more presidential he's got some great ideas I'm not a a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says\nBut I'd rather be a little more presidential a little more dignified when in back off the tweeting and stuff like that but if he let them spot what they did without defending themselves then what happens to him\n[noise] I I think that was in their punishment would be what they've said and and um [noise] uh I don't know I think what he has done his dignify it in the argument and I and I don't think there is one I really don't\nWould I Would buy residential every day of the week yeah to sell or rent up yes [laughter] yeah no in fact I'm\nYou know I I have a house in um [noise] but ... Springs Florida and I and I have a house in in ... Connecticut and I'm In the house in ... Connecticut ... thousand square feet I don't know my wife and I just read all around it and what we've decided to do is we're going to rent it will get we're going to come up with an executive rental forward\nAnd and that's going to be necessary because people are going to come into our area that don't want to buy houses people will come into all areas that don't have the ... got to be very big\nWhile he's got that company like air being beat up the rent to our house houses and I mean I Know people who own houses and they solicit through air being be exclusively and they're making a lot of money doing that\nReally they're very happy ... well\nYeah and I I Would subscribe to that [noise] it ... you're going to see in real estate across the board it you're going to see dramatic changes one of the things that's kind of puzzling me right now and I don't have an answer to it is this working from home and if that's going to remain\nIn place and remain as as a major issue going forward because that was precipitated by a small labor force that is actually demanded a you know their their own way but what we have now is a huge huge biggest labor force than we've ever had\nIs a very young right now and just entering the process\nCan I Want to talk with you about India when we come back and also we'll take final calls in just a moment how about your books can people still get them can\nOh yeah K C direct dot com K.

I think the best days are ahead not behind us I think the United states is going to see an economy that it doesn't understand and that that's going to be a just launched\nBy generation y that this monster generation that's fourteen to thirty three years old that it's going to start households and by dish soap and and by vacuum cleaners and furniture and automobiles\nLike the old days\nYeah I ... in talking to the you know I talked all sectors and talking to my automotive sectors are cars that drive themselves are not going to happen [laughter]\nGood good Darren he kills old lady in Arizona for crying out loud\nYeah well in the trucking trucking won't touch it\nWell no I support our truck drivers I don't want to see driverless trucks\nThat we don't have enough truck driver you know what that what we\nWould you like to have a truck behind you would know drivers sitting in it\nOr not going to do it might not you know we I have a mini mini as little mini Cooper right\nI Am a mini Cooper GDP which is a heart ride and I'm thinking to myself but by the first time I pull up next to I'm a semi with no driver\n[laughter] I mean jeeze icy day could you imagine that truck barreling down behind you know and if there's one tactical full paw just one it's going to rearrange you and you're out of it in a mini Cooper ... year history\nThat's that's where the truckers are telling me that people in the trucking industry say first time a truck takes out of school bus it's over it's it's just not going to happen you know we're we're we're dreaming\nThen a lot of truck drivers helped unload whenever they're carrying you know I've seen I've seen trucks at night stopping off at the let's say like subway and they're you know the truck has park there in the truck driver guy is loading everything in the store\nI mean how how is he has a driverless trucks going to do that\nIt it's not it it just not going to do it you know hey hey can I go back to China for just a minute yeah please okay one of the things that that a\nA R is troubling demographers about China right now is there are a from a forty years old and under there are about Ninety million or um men are males\nOr without that have no prospect of marrying because there's no female counterpart because of of either gender based abortion or is simply infanticide Ninety million\nWhere are they they're in the military\nAnd the it's the there there is just a ton and and ... that that's what happens when you have an imbalance in your population [noise] so that's another factor that China is dealing\nWith do you see another means you're more break you know\nNo I just I I ... and\n... yeah I just don't see any reason to do it well I'll tell you what what what I Do see is I think the future of the earth is the Americans and that is a you know Canada the United states Mexico central and South American ... uh we're self sufficient we don't need a Middle Eastern energy anymore we don't need the oil\nWe've dealt water yeah we've got water we've got fracking we're we're almost impossible to invade because we're surrounded by water it it just it I don't know I\nAm one of those always missiles low Kenny\n[laughter] yeah yeah but I I don't know it just doesn't seem to be any reason for the for for that to to to take place even even with wacko is like like a king John ... on and on North Korea I don't see that happening in ... in fact I say I say what I see in in Korea is going to be a unification of the north in\nThe south the you know that the south is not having children there for ... heard that I found like about one to\nHere's my concern though not from a country but from some terrorist group that obtains new or something like that and they do it and trying to planted on another country\nThat could happen that concerns me\nThat that could happen but what concerns me is a demographer is if if you have a South Korea with you know what I'm saying is that even one child per couple you cannot maintain it\nMarket economy on a shrinking population you can a possible\nIt has to grow so I don't know what's going to happen there with the north in the south I really don't North Korea is about ... their their right it or just above replacement level fertility\nMichael in Jamestown North Carolina Michael go ahead\nYes Hi George and higher I guess my question is that a trend going to continue to where people are moving out of the north east into like down south at West 'cause like Florida is now the third most populous state outbreak in New York state and also seen except become the largest city breaking a Philadelphia\nPeople are moving to the warmer weather Kenny\n... that is exactly correct and and and my new book the book that came out last year called upside property from the pound demographic shifts that we cover every single state if you are from Virginia all the way down to Florida go over to ... California\nNevada Arizona and a New Mexico or the populations are going to increase the population of of Florida is going to go from twenty million to thirty million dollar to buy real estate in Florida now and just sit on it\nIt was it the the uh\nUh an interesting concept is the fact that the the the senior citizens of Florida are now Seventy five two Ninety five I had a real estate journalist or give me a bus and she said one is the baby boomer influence on Florida real estate going to be going to ask what if it went when will begin to\nYou know shopping and I told her I said listen it hasn't started\nWhat does it going to be huge\nWhat is going to be off the charts with the same thing is happening with healthcare elder care and death care\nFor a Vegas is that a good market [noise]\nHuge off the charts huge can't believe it it it for one uh it it's cheap there are plenty of jobs or I go there all the time my brother has a house there uh yeah Vegas this is unbelievable\nShow ... All right Ken thanks keep in touch with us so you're always welcome on the program getting\nA lot to take care man\nOkay be well his website linked up at coast to coast am dot com very easy to get to in his book upside of course that he just mentioned in the age curve on a profit from the coming demographic storm spot on isn't it gets interesting to talk with them about that ...\nLet's dabble with the paranormal for a couple of hours and don't forget Wednesday night goes to go on the coast to coast\nNever missed a detail on a show or just sign up for the ... ... email newsletter for free it goes to ... dot com [noise]\n\nHe also served as a Fulbright professor back in two thousand three at the University of Trump's so in northern Norway Bruce founded the veterans' program at ... college and co founded the boots to books transition course\nNow that's the first college course in the country designed specifically for recently returned veterans Bruce first of all I Want to thank you for that and for sure be my friend I really appreciate that\nWell uh yeah thank you very much and uh yeah thank you for having me on on the program I I I Love this show\nI'm looking forward to this is just as you got to tell me why me with the incredible background that you have in so many different things how did you get interested and involved in the paranormal\nWell it's ... the paranormal it's been happening to me my whole life it started at age four with my first paranormal experience it was an angelic experience a near death experience and just from that point on it just that these things have been happening randomly but quite frequently\nAnd uh I've always had it on the back burner I you know I've been doing all these other things\nAnd have a lot of different interests and it's always been on the back burner but it wasn't until recently that I decided to finally put these all these experiences together into a book and a and then started talking openly you know not just with a couple of friends or\nFamily doctors but to to students and actually I I teach a class now at the college I'm On the paranormal that's been a very popular just started this this semester\nA lot of people Bruce or a little hesitant to come out and talk about their paranormal experiences some of them you know pilots they don't want to talk about UFO experiences as it's been a problem for you since you've come out and talked about this\nAh it it hasn't been I I understand the the the nervousness it or the fear even that they would have it I was a I was afraid of that that maybe people wouldn't take my work seriously\nOr or that I'd be ridiculed or the administration would find a way to maybe I I get an early retirement or something but I haven't found that to be to be true at all I I think what has happened is that people now see me as a safe person to share their experiences with and they often do so privately\nOr some of them actually I have two colleagues that are taking the paranormal class that I'm teaching\n'em to two of my colleagues at at the college so I it's been a very positive experience I guess the most negative thing I can think about there was a a a friend of mine her daughter's a graduate student in history and she told her mother that uh well I think he's just committed academic suicide\n[laughter] you know that was the perspective of a graduate student I can understand that you're just starting out in your doctoral program that's something you probably don't want to tell your your graduate adviser\nYou know as as it's happening now Bruce and as you probably know the field of the paranormal and the activities and the studies it's really growing now isn't it\n[noise] I I I I Believe it is and it's and it's gaining acceptance and it's it's always had the in the scientific community up of which you know I I I have friends in the scientific community I'm not a I'm a social scientist you know historian\nUh but uh it from what I gather there there's always been a tremendous interest in the scientific community but it but a reluctance\nTo uh to do much with it in fact I think ah my friend dean ... who's the chief scientist at ions good guy he uh yeah seven he said they're Seventeen thousand five hundred institutions of higher learning in the world and there's only fifty\nFive zero academics openly interested in studying site and some of those are skeptics so that's a very small percentage fifty out of at Seventeen thousand five hundred uh schools uh in in in ... or colleges and universities\nAnd from what he told me there's only five or six paranormal courses being offered in the United states right now\nWhich is very surprising\nAt one point Duke University had a department that's got to eat all of this ... under GB Rhine and now it's not there anymore but there are still did J. B. Ryan Institute thank God you to study some of these things\nYeah no I it's it but I I think there is an eye\nConfirmed this with with dean because he's doing and then you know he's traveling around the world talking about his research in very actively engaged in this research and there seems to be a and I suggested to me seems to be like a paradigm shift going on of of gaining acceptance\nAnd I think people are are increasingly you know professional people are are are increasingly a supporting the research and and talking about their experiences more more openly\nWhile and I and I look at this program you know six hundred and twenty radio stations we're on we're podcasting or on the Internet uh there are other podcast years out there dealing with the paranormal\nUh millions of listeners it's growing it's getting bigger and bigger and I think people Bruce are looking for answers that they can't find and other traditional places\nI I I think you're you're right and that's\nExactly what I've seen as people have come forward to you know colleagues and uh I've I've made a I'd make contacts with our um our custodial staff or at at that work at the college at night and they have incredible stories that I've just that ah it's just as kind of blown me away and I never would have\nKnown and less somebody had said oh you should talk to a you know Mr D or whatever he's he works in this building at night and he's got some stories so it's like they're telling their friends who are then calling me and and saying hey I got something I Want to share with you so I think it's I I think once\nMore people in positions of authority or or you know academics are professional people uh express their interest in and their support I think it's gonna it's going to spread a lot faster\nWith Bruce ... latest book is called timeless a paranormal personal history he relates thirty four issues and cases that he had and just incredible thing because in the beginning you say that it's not that you don't believe in ghosts they believe in ... to tell me about that\nYeah I I think that uh it\nIt well in fact it's my my my uh spirit friends who I I I Do have contact with a they told me that experience is believing and believing is experience\nSo this this initial experience I had at age four\nKind of open the floodgates for me and even though I tried to every once in a while put it on the back burner or because I didn't seem to have much control it just happened randomly these things uh it just kept coming back so they just kept coming back instead of a you know it it you know ... regardless of whether I wanted it to or not\nAnd then I just kind of accepted this is the ... this is the way my life is going to be and I just proceeded doing other things but it was always there in the background I think I was always destined to to explore this at a certain point in my life and it and then the last couple of years that's that has been the the the point which to do this\nOne did you have if you can remember your first paranormal experience how old were you\nYeah that I was very young I was four but I Would and uh we had traveled to northern Norway or to an island two hundred miles above the Arctic Circle my parents are are from northern Norway from that island\nAnd we were staying with my grandmother for lived there about nine months so it was a wintertime and I was playing outside and I remember very distinctly what was going on and I I was a\nI got very sick very suddenly I I just my body was getting stiff and achy Mike I couldn't move my head from side to side my neck was totally stiff I had this fever coming on and I went home and I got home to the old farmhouse we were staying my grandmother's home\nAnd she had this little bed in the in the kitchen and the old farmhouse kitchen because sometimes she would you know should be baking for a long time and just wanted to take a little nap and it was too hard to go up the steep stairs to the upper part of the house so anyway I was lying down there and I just kept feeling worse and worse than my\nBut the relatives came over and they said oh this is what happened to your eldest brother and then the next day he died and somebody said oh and that's what happened to\nUncle ... then when he got polio you know and they would just scaring the heck out of me and my and my parents and my grandmother and um so I just I drifted off to sleep a crime myself to sleep and I thought I was going to die and then in in the night uh I I I woke up and there was\nThis really bright light up in the in the ceiling and uh between the beams and this old farmhouse kitchen\nAnd ah it I felt like I it it was an end jelly presents\nIt it was it was very bright it was very warm I felt like everything was going to be okay it took away all my fear and uh and I went to sleep and I slept soundly and when I woke up I was completely fine\nAnd and my mother and my grandmother said it was it was a miracle and that it was the guardian angel that had had saved me so that was the first experience and experience and I never questioned it I just said okay that's that's what happens and I think that's what open the floodgates and and and and also my mother was very psychic too she wasn't a practicing psychic\nA right to see 'em there's always there seems to be somebody in the family who has this ability and it kind of passes down genetically doesn't it\nI I I Believe it does because her mother was also that way she was an herbalist she was a healer so and and and this is a very remote island at that point in the sixties they're the only way onto the island was by a a small plane or buy a ferry boat\nFreaking out\nYeah he he is and we're going through the intersection and on either side of it is a car you know two cars coming right out of so what was going to happen that I can see was that we're going to get T bone from both sides and just you know ... a pinch between the two\nUh and uh at that moment everything slowed down ... everything's slowed down and it was if I had all the time in the world to figure out how I was going to\nManeuver your way around a\nYeah and the next thing I Know I I I maneuver through and next thing I Know we're on the other side there was honking going on in the cars went and everybody was safe and a time got back to normal speed again and I I think\nThat I think what what happens is that we had we had glimpse the quantum world at that point in in the quantum world and in the paranormal world as my friends have told me there there is no past there is no future it's all just\nAn eternal now and and that that's what I felt like and I and then I thought this was probably this is an example of a fork in the road of time because then another dimension which\nWe might have had this horrible accident in ... knows it it it potentially at least the potential forty five miles an hour oh at each other like that you know that there could have been people killed and it's at least seriously injured and ah and we were unscathed and so or the other two cars thank God but\nUm so so I I I ...\nThat is what I'm Talking about and I had other experiences with you know when I was younger I I at eight years old I had another uh experience where I\nI uh uh was playing around it was in ah I'm up at deception pass I'm from Washington state and deception passed in the north end to with the island there is a a to bridge spans that go from the mainland to\nWhip the island the north end and there's a middle island called pass island and we always used to stop there when when we went camping in and we we'd run around and it was beautiful you know you could overlook the narrow channels that\nThat that separate the island from the mainland and I was running around and of course in those days early sixties there were no safety fences or guard rails to speak on for the\nExact way ... and I was running right towards the cliff and I remember running off the cliff\nAnd then everything was I was just like suspended in in in in in mid air was like everything stopped and once again I felt this this light in this worm\nAnd the next thing I knew it was like everything it stopped and then all of a sudden boom like in fast motion I was back on the trail and my dad was grabbing my shoulders and was\nYelling at somebody's watching

whole world was shaking it was like a the earth was seizing like a horrible earthquake but you know there were fissures in the ground and you couldn't stand up it was so bad in mountains were crumbling in the sky was turning the dark color and it was just like an end of the worst end of the world kind of apocalyptic scenario\nAnd I woke up in a in a sweat and and nervous and scared and\nI I went to breakfast with my uh uh friends are just like a continental breakfast and I told them about this nightmare and then we proceeded to the uh the base\nAnd uh we were on a tour when the sirens went off\nAnd they closed off the base and we went back to the education center and saw what was happening on nine eleven so so that was my um my pre cognitive or premonition dream it wasn't specifically about airplanes or buildings but it certainly was\nA the you know a in a very apocalyptic event that or or life changing and world changing event\nAnd later I learned that this was there were many people around the world who had a nightmare as some more much more specific than mine but that very morning that this happened\nThere is my daughter had nobody goes to we didn't know what you're saying yeah we didn't know what it was bruised but uh she she she had the vision she was in the in the city were ashes falling down on her she said it was about a foot deep\nUm but you know then then you like a day later it happened and she said that was it yeah yeah some people\nHad it that morning some people had it a few days before the day before but there's there's so many people around the world who have who has a verified that this that this happened to them and\nSo there is something to that this this the ... that people had since that and and and I'm On a massive scale so which is and it's been studied uh I think\nThat dean rating talks about in one of his books I I I Can't remember which one of his books but yeah he does talk about that\nWhat do you think of to let the the [noise] I\nI I think I've had experience with with telepathy with my with my mother and uh she was very psychic and we used to just a regular ...\nPlaying cards when I was a younger a ... a camping on the Oregon Coast we'd have wonderful camping trips\nOn the Oregon Coast and at night my mom would bring out the deck of cards and we would ah try to read each others' minds so she would send you know she'd have a card she'd look at it and send me the you know tried to send me with what the card was\nAnd uh ... well above chance we would get the the suit right we would get the sometimes the number or the or the ... you know whether it was a king or jak face card a very often we get we get it a right\nTo the to the point where it would make my dad upset because he was a very practical carpenter blue collar guy no nonsense and he let us do it for a while and then once we had got a few hits he'd say okay that's it stop it\nNo more yeah he did he said when dad said stop if we had to stop a and my my mom you know so I had a special kind of relationship with my mom dealing with that and I she's the one that I think really cultivated it and I I that's where I got it from it so it wasn't for my dad I got the story telling thing from my dad that's how I ended up being a history teacher but\nI think I got the psychic stuff from my my mom\nDid you have a big foot

living creature and it and it was wearing\nOf all things that was wearing a hat and uh it was just kind of leaning into the truck is we drove by and it couldn't have been more than you know maybe a foot away from the you know my side view mirrors I drove by\nAnd or the immediately I I I I woke up my girlfriend and I said I I think I just saw big foot and and she ... she said what what are you

hotel there is one here another miles from here and she goes no no you keep going you keep going\nAnd uh so we kept driving but but later I found out that that that particular location near Oric was

I'd I'd ever been to and I was sitting next to my mother I'm not sure exactly what my father was he might have been there too but I don't I just remember my mother sitting next to me\nAnd as we were going through the service and you know I the widow was crying and you know that that all the emotion of it all of a sudden I heard this a very distinct voice a very heavy Norwegian accent and it was\nThe man who had died that was in the casket and he was so to me and he said\nAh ah Bruce it's it's it's OK I'm OK there is nothing to be afraid of\nUh uh I'm okay and uh I I I I looked I kinda I looked around and looked at my mom and she you know and I didn't ask her if she heard it I just kind of looked at her and she kinda nodded at me so I'm not sure what that meant\nBut uh I didn't actually ask her about it but and then he said it again there's nothing to be afraid of everything is going to be okay and he said it and then that typical you know Norwegian accent and uh but I was looking at him and of course he was just in the casket and and dead but\nSo I I definitely heard his voice and um\n[noise] it it it was kind of comforting in a way but very uh I'm not going to say
