on with the stock market my friend\n[noise] or you know we've been warning you know for years but especially in recent months that were coming into a top either right now and now we've seen signs of that in the last few days or a week and the whole truth just like a ten to Fifteen Percent correction hair which already close to that\nUm we may make it you know in the next year but but this is the greatest bubble in modern history and it's been extended by six ten trillion dollars are free money printed\nSince two thousand nine and ... trillion and a half tax cuts from Trump two trillion repatriated from overseas this stuff just keeps piling in the stock market it's the most overvalued it's ever been even now more than\nEarly two thousand the greatest bubble we've seen in our lifetime which of course crashed or you know it was Seventy eight percent for the tech stocks and stuff and and this could be the beginning I've got some signs I can talk about and stuff but but this could be the beginning of it and\nAnd this is not something you want to sit through ... you know most of the times stocks go up and then they correct or twenty percent that's fine most people should sit through that\nNot I call this a great reset this only happens once in a generation and even more so every Ninety years like a clock and we're coming right on that clock\nIn stocks can be down Seventy eighty Ninety percent and take twenty to twenty five years to get back there you do not hold through this and you do not listen to your stockbroker at this time\nDo you buy back in when things hit the bottom\n[noise] you you know that's the secret to George a lot of people say well what do I do it might well first of all you can be a high quality bonds and make money which she did all through the Nineteen thirties the great depression when everything else was down\nBut the biggest bonuses it'd be preserved your money or in high quality bonds making some money or or if you're really daring and just short the market a little bit\nYou got money to buy things when they're down imagine if you could buy the best companies of the world like Amazon or apple or whatever or Coca Cola for eighty percent off or Ninety\nOff because they're gonna they're gonna comes out on our dollar\nYeah oh yeah that will come back and and now we also have demographic research that will tell people which parts of the world which types of companies will come back stronger or not so that's an extra advantage goal you know imagine if you could buy gold at four to seven hundred dollars in next time it\nGoes to four thousand instead of two thousand so no that that's the real advantage when when they correct as much it happens quickly these big corrections happen on and only two or three years and then you get to buy what what my previous book was called the sale of a lifetime ... nothing nothing beats that but\nProblem is most people lose all their money or their house goes down fifty percent of their

or stock crap like that some companies will get under pressure and they will go under or have to go through chapter eleven bankruptcy or restructure that's a good thing recessions are necessary the Federal Reserve and government the recession says bad thing\nThey're good things um\nBut and then you want to buy the company that survive you know we had the dot com crash that was a Super Bowl I mean the tech bubble took five years to build but the dot com crash came in the last year and a half up six to seven times\nFive and ten years that we used to have both parties used to be more centrist not that far apart now they are extreme far apart there's the far right\nIs the far left and this is around the world but it's the most extreme here and Trump is playing this like a federal\nThat's why how he won he picked off the far right and and win against the centrist Republicans and then the Republicans had to follow him because he now has the baton and he has all the power so so this is this is this is going to make this\nI'm much more difficult it the social and political level again down here twelve years of recession twelve and I think now Fifteen Percent unemployment after Hurricane Maria\nNo civil unrest these people just aren't like that they're not as polarized down here\nIn the U.S we are polarized this Kavanaugh thing it was just pure partisan\nYou know the Republicans believed him and the Democrats believed her the men believed him don't women believe I've never I mean this there was no common sense no rationality it was just\nPolitical partisanship and the people the Republicans hated the Democrats for attacking this guy and the Democrats hated the Republicans for defending him in and installing this thing and cutting I mean this is like\nI mean and and and who's got all the guns in the world we do so so this is really\nI think that that social unrest in this downturn is going to top the great depression where it was more people roaming around in their cars and not having housing and no jobs and soup lines this is going to be different people\nThe the blue and the red extremes are gonna blame each other for the crisis to Republicans going to say you damn Democrats let all this debt run up and do all this you know free money and stuff\nAnd the and the Democrats are and say Republicans you didn't let us stimulate on up and blah blah blah blah blah and and and they're going to hate each other and and so I I think that's going to be the worst part of this\nThat we really and and and I really think there's a possibility that there's going to be movements in this time or in the civil war I compare there's more to the civil war on the social political level at that time the south seceded from the more industrial and urbanized north they were totally different I mean the north was blue\nThe south has read this time\nEspecially with Republicans in charge and I think there's going to be facts I think states like California or the whole west coast\nOr the whole northeast is going to threaten to succeed from the red states because they can't agree on anything there's nothing that can be agreed on his cabinet thing was the perfect example that no middle ground it's either red or blue you know\nAnd his argument in its arguments in hatred and bitterness on both sides\nAnd and even you know the Democrats are always a nice guy I Know that Democrats are jumping up and down and women you know almost assaulting you know ... senators and in the elevator and stop this it every body yeah there's a very high tensions and\nI tell you I don't feel that here and it's another advantage to being Puerto Rican kind of like watching on the sidelines to see what happens and then if I Do decide to move back to Florida where I'd probably move 'em\nBack to 'cause we're familiar there and know everybody you know I I Will do it when I can buy a condo there for a quarter of the price [laughter] and and and and and but I Want to see what happens first and and the thing about that that the next year also George's this is this is when it's gonna\nYou know it's going to happen or not it it's either starting to happen now or or the latest by my calculations with every cycle we have an everything we got a ... vote\nIs going to start by late next year and that's going to be a Ninety year anniversary of the greatest stock crash in modern history Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two and that is one of many of our cycles we cover in zero our\nIn our newsletters that Ninety year cycle is the most powerful for the biggest what I call you know downturns depressions and the biggest stock crashes\nAnd this has happened every Ninety years since the industrial revolution cause the greatest boom and global his\nLawn you know here we had a couple of guests on who ah say very similar things to what you're saying there timing was off some of them said things were going to happen back last September or lose one fellow who was talking about Jewish prophecy and he called it the ... meter ...\nOh yeah yeah I remember that guy and it didn't happen it didn't happen then but you could happen now you're saying\nWell yeah I mean we we were in the same position and we were coming into a\nTwo thousand sixteen the marketed gone sideways for you were saying you know this looks like it made that finally Tom and then Trump got elected I mean we turn boys I mean when Trump\nWet that surprised when and the markets were had a two thousand point reversal from down nine hundred to eleven hundred just overnight and end of the morning I said look this is a river so\nThis is a tax cut coming in and all this sort of stuff this is going to extend this boom another year or two another twenty to thirty percent or more\nAnd that's what's happened but now we're on the other side of that now we've seen most of that hum and we're running out of tricks I mean what can you do now and the Democrats may when the house it looks likely possibly the Senate but\nIt's going to be much harder for Trump to push his gravy train for businesses it as the Democrats get more control and I see the economy falling apart by two thousand twenty at the latest and that's\nThat's not going to win reelection I was just ...\nI don't think Trump gets reelected and he may not even make it we're tracking Watergate on a forty five year cycle almost to the tea which would say you're about to see the special prosecutor get fired after elections early next year and Trump could be in trouble by late next year so so either were peaking now or best\nTrump polls on and no disaster we're going to peak late next year and see the greatest crashing history I don't see any other two options I don't see this bubble lasting pass next to the end of next year but there there's a fifty fifty chance it's happening now and you don't want to get hit by that\nFlows forty pursue we know what's happening with overnight stocks I mean can you tell what could happen when the when the clock opens tomorrow\nYes yes uh China went down a little bit and China made the biggest one was the only stock market that violated a critical point yesterday it went down some more but came back up to even but it's still violated but the U.S markets looked like the ... going to open up\nTwo to three hundred points

to re done with us we'll get to your calls as well very within the can you predict dumped five years from now\n[noise] yes you know we can predict out decades I mean I was predicting this you know\nThe trouble and the economy started in two thousand eight back in the late eighties I'm just from the baby boom generation when they were predictably spin and when they would stop spending so yes what we see is it the worst of this downturn in what we call the winter season that started in two thousand eight\nWill be over a bout about probably about late two thousand twenty two for stocks uh two thousand twenty three for the economy will be the worst and and probably real estate out there maybe a little longer real estate takes longer to crash and longer to come back and then we'll start to see\nA global boom again from about twenty two thousand twenty three all the way into two thousand thirty six that'll be the next\nGlobal boom the differences George\nIs that it will be concentrated as it has been thus far but even more so in Asia and especially in India and south east Asia most developed countries a lot of Europe Japan and East Asia have continued bad demographics in the United states is kind of the best house and the bad neighborhood\nOr where our demographics are we have a strong millennial generation but not as strong as the baby boom so we'll\nWe'll be in the middle but yeah we can tell about when the economy will turn around and where it will be the strongest the other thing we the biggest Boston bubble burst already has been in commodities and things like oil and iron ore commodities are down Seventy percent\nThat we're so far oil and iron ore eighty percent there's going to be another big commodity boom and bubble which will be driven by the emerging world and they're the biggest commodity producers and consumers they spent much more of their money in it so you can buy these metals and things like that everything from gold\nTo iron ore and and and copper and things like that and there'll be an incredible boom and again you just wait for them to go down first so yeah the next but between now and two thousand twenty two twenty three\nIs going to be way more than a downside and after that the world starts to recover and again that's when you buy stuff into the only\nThe orange or does it real estate has a new factor this never had before because the baby boom was so large because older people when they die they are literally permanent sellers if you want to call it a real estate\nAnd more and more countries including the U.S today and massively in Japan\nAnd places like Germany there's more old people dying and selling homes than young people of the next generation coming in buying so\nWhen we adjust for that real estate is not going to come zooming back and a lot of countries like stocks will so and and of course the aging baby boom sectors like health care will do better than other sectors so in our newsletter which by the way people can get on our free newsletter by just go into Harry Dent dot com and that's going to be ... it'd be in the next year\nThat that it's going to be different sectors the next boom is not going to favor everything eighty three to two thousand and seven everything went up the next boom is going to be more selective but there will be\nThe next global boom and then we can tell you when it's going to come and we can tell you about when it's going to peak\nEvery what happens we have a regional war somewhere what's that going to do to the economy\n[noise] well you know wars are actually stimulate I've been a lot of ways especially if you're not fighting and people don't realize World War one was the greatest gift ever given the United States Europe was at war and we were supplying them\nWith everything from farming commodity products to you know a transportation automobiles are tanks and everything we became a major exporter to Europe over that so you know that goes both ways but wars tend to cause higher inflation\nWars disrupt things and and\nUh the great depression was followed by World War two the disruption a around the world that makes people angry as we're seeing now and even worse this time and and when things get scarce and there's a fixed pie countries tend to fight over things we've this trade war and we said this in his ear all our book\nCame out a year ago this trade war with China and in in a global thing is well this is not just a short term thing and Jack Ma from LA Bob came out just a month ago and said this is going to take at least Twenty years to sort out\nThis is a major war between the leading to countries the U.S and China who's going to be king and that's why China China should be giving in more because Trump's right about this that they need us or our trade is three times tilted\nTowards them this is going to hurt them more but it's more important to them because they're the up and coming and they don't want to give him too much because they see this is a long term battle and they think longer term so [noise] so I don't know if it's more a trade war but but there's certainly after this downturn coming out of this downturn [noise]\nThe the potential for wars around the world will tend to grow\nAnd that's where I go to Peter in ... Arizona did get things started with us I'm Peter\nHi hey thank you for taking my call this is great I'm sure they're going to be a bank holiday during the crash\nThat's an interesting question what do you think\nYeah I mean that definitely tends to happen and and that's what happened in the great depression of course because people don't realize banks can lend up to ten times their reserves and guess what their reserves are ten percent of their deposits and whose money is that that's our money they're pledging they also tend to have you know capital they raise up to about ten percent\nSo so they're they're at risk or two but yes when when you get problem like this banking system will get in trouble especially when real estate goes down that we saw that in two thousand eight and nine forward and all of a sudden they don't have money now the new trick\nAnd then I'm I'm getting ready to go into a ... city tour in Australia and it's a big concern there because their housing bubbles already starting to crack a head of ours this time\nIs it banks in Cyprus just said well you know what we need money we're just going to wipe out of the the more affluent accounts were just going to take you know ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent of their count and say look I'm Sorry we need this\nWe're going to take your deposits and we're going to convert them into equity and are dying bank who wants to equity in a dying bank so this is in in in ... even in Australia that people are realizing\nThey're not supposed to do that but there's loopholes were in an emergency banks can do that so people have to worry you know you need to spread your money around I tell people all your access money\nOther than you need to pay your bills should be in a brokerage account whether it's in a bank or a brokerage firm on on line from I I prefer firms that are not into lending that's why I like a lot of the online trading firms that have\nHave it in a brokerage account 'cause they can't borrow against that they can swipe that but they can deposits in savings account so yes this can happen and people\nLost their deposits a lot of people there was a run on the banks this happens and and and and the magnitude of what I'm Talking about\nIs exactly what had happened doesn't happen in a normal recession like we've seen it started to happen in some countries the last global crisis it will happen big time and and in some countries worse than others\nNext up we go to Keith in Rochester New York He's taken away\nA Mr ... I Want to ask about Puerto Rico which was already Seventy three billion dollars in ... for the hurricanes struck and because of all the corruption there which is the real reason why the recovery has been slow\nThe former New York governor George Pataki is having to head a committee so that the bondholders get their money back to questions I live in Rochester\nHere where a lot of the Puerto Ricans believe it or not or ending up they are lower skilled workers who are not finding work and us taxpayers\nAre having to pay for their relief\nAnd the you're the first one to say that we're getting the better trained people laugh not happening up here ah in New York former Empire State and\nSecondly California which is not friendly to business when people leave the state they insist\nOn taking their short sighted left wing politics with them they go to places like Texas formerly all red state which is now only purple a to sum this up uh these people with their left wing politics they're spreading their disease all over the place\nOr anti five the extreme left wing organization has taken over Portland Ore than the officials there are ...\nAnti run the city and like you to wrap it up here a very conservative guy like me I Am saying flat out we're facing prove civil war and us conservatives are ready to fight and some of what you're saying make sense but it's much more dire than they were going to be at each other's throats\nAnd a starting with that Puerto Rican example a and I'm going to say\nThis bluntly if I can too many Hispanics like black Americans vote democratic they will not give Republicans and conservatives that chance and and the same way that all all of these urban areas have been struck dumb because of liberal\nDemocratic policies uh we're having them going to say this bluntly the non white people blacks and Hispanics they vote you know heard instinct Democrat and because not too many of them vote Republican and conservative we're heading for dire times\nYou know with or magnetic off its cetera what is the probability of a shooting war\n[noise] you know I think that's much more likely between emerging countries like India and Pakistan\nI'm there but what we're saying in zero hour we we trade global trade back to the Eighteen hundreds and there was a big surge in World War one people don't realize globalization global trade collapse sixty percent\nBetween World War one and World War two with the great depression in the middle with a big trade war with rising terrorists just like we're seeing now everything's happening\nLike happened that this works ... it's it everybody does the selfish thing as a country but it works against the old everybody loses or at least most countries loose and and that's what's happening now this trade war with China whether it ends up a shooting war or limited like you say in the south China Sea they can definitely be stopped there there's no question\nThere's problems they're Middle East I don't see a major war between like say the United states or Europe and Russia there could be limited because they nobody big enough to challenge just the one advantage we have it is there's there is no counter bailing power that can really take us on one on one\nSomebody hit us they would be dead long before we ... so I think that's\nKind of a good thing or in in the early Nineteen hundreds ... Nineteen hundred no there were major countervailing power has how you could have World War two but we're gonna definitely have a political\nHuge political jeez this trade war we said it's zero hour before this became obvious this is gonna last two to three decades exactly what Jack Ma just said and\nThere there could be some physical or but there's certainly\nGoing to be huge a political or trade wars and things\nLike right Harry stay with us for coming back for final phone calls with you in just a moment on coast to coast they\nGet Daily Show updates right to your inbox for free with the ... zone newsletter sign up today at ... am dot com [noise]\n\n\n\nWay\nTo talk to your enduring called the wild card in line at eight one eight by eight zero one for one zero in on the first time caller line is the one eight five zero one for seven to one\nTo talk to read from east of the Rockies eight hundred eight to five wives zero three three from west of the Rockies to recall eight hundred six one eight eight to ... to reach George ... use guy named George nine seven three one three soon Georgia text message anytime\nI Need money to Ninety six five to one from the city of ... businesses coast to coast am George Nouri\nWell next time we're we're talking about the paranormal with a psychiatry rushed to an amazing story stick\nAround and find out why he's involved in that\nBeyond belief that charge television program and you can watch free episodes by just going down to the bottom of our home page and click the beyond belief links that you will see\nAnd know hopefully you'll sign up and watch all of them later on but the watch the free episode of beyond belief dot com at the bottom of our home page coast to coast am dot com\nLooking for ways to look a little better most people are\nStem cells have been proven to work literal miracles on the human body Dr Nathan Newman saw there was a huge untapped market for the use of the stem cell technology as a non prescription serum to be applied at home to those problem areas of the face and neck\nLike fine lines wrinkles and bags under the eyes his product is called looming death\nHere was living in we're not really trying to just moisturizer or cover the skin we're going down using the language that the cell used to talk to one another to get the cell to do our work for us to tell themselves\nNot to break down in college and not to break down your lesson to build up to college and to build up to last into bringing you a blood vessels\nTo take away the inflammation and that can only be done at the cellular level cutting edge because medic surgery without the cutting\nLooming out is not available in stores but it is available from healthy looking dot com\nFind genuine luminous products and especially the lumina there um with the highest concentration of Dr Neumann a P.

Cox owner of blind ... dot com bust or as a family owned and operated business I started over eight years ago when my wife and I moved into a new home and needed custom blinds we did what many homeowners do and got prices from quote unquote professionals\nAnd we couldn't believe the high prices not long afterwards I decided to take a chance and with no experience in industry\nI quit my job in sales for a fortune five hundred company and I started a business selling custom lines on the Internet in two thousand ten lines ... dot com was born I not only guarantee you love our blind I offer a bitter free guarantee meaning if you're blind\nNo for any reason to remake them free of charge you only pay shipping\nAnd now he's made it even easier checkout blind no to a cellular shades first and only have installed without screws or tools listeners take up the keepers yeah you are here just use the cubs\nNow George thinks that it's not going to happen and I don't know I kinda think it will but I I don't know I'm optimistic I'm going to stay on the line because I Know you're going to have questions and I want to get a few links and because I when I started twenty three sixty thinks the path\nThat I I Do think I mean this is going to have to happen a lot of rules are going to change just like banks may suddenly started swiping money out of more fluent accounts\nThey're going to have to have forgiveness these loans are going to have to be restructured all loans are going to have to be restructured hum except for the most sovereign like U.S Treasury bonds and that may not be but\nBut this is the key to going through this the countries that restructure their debt and we restructured massive amounts of private debt and the great depression it made a stronger coming out\nJapan never restructured any of their debt and they're in a coma economy forever even when they're next young generation has come along so I I my\nBet is that they're going to come to point we're gonna have to say no we have to allow restructuring of student loans or to owner as we went too far and that to me what happened the education establishment I'll even call it a mafia\nBasically overcharging had the greatest\nInflation next you know of any sector education even more than healthcare\nThey're on a run and win win that got too hard they say okay well if we can encourage student loans\nThen people can afford these higher prices we can keep our bubble going this bubble has burst and and and too many students are never going to be able to pay off these loans so when you have excess loans it's better to admit it just like a drug addict\nAnd then change policies and restructure detox I call it de leveraging go on we're gonna have to forgive or restructure down these student loans however it happens if it makes it changing in the rulings yes I I Would say that's highly likely in the next couple of years\nInto thousand a year and I saw one way to bail out everything would be to give people like a hundred thousand dollars in the voucher to buy some good what do you think\nWell I don't like money printing except in emergencies like I think they should have done money printing quantitative easing for the first year in two thousand I like they did just to make sure the banking system doesn't just melt down like it did rapidly in the great depression but to put it on\nIn a ... you know permanent quantitative easing just perverts the entire system is bad\nBut the second thing I always said if you're going to print money don't give it to the damn banks who got us in trouble and did all this leverage and\nAnd the rivers and all this crazy stuff in the first place just send you know send period to to to get us out of the at least send them money to everyday people send them a check I wouldn't say a hundred thousand but if if they just sent everybody at twenty five every household at twenty thousand dollar check\nThat would have done a lot better for the economy and then in that that would help banks because things wouldn't have been as bad for the economy but it would have help people instead of the banking system this whole bailout his whole quantitative easing has only made\nWall Street stronger only made the rich richer is only benefitted corporate including these tax cuts and has not benefited mainstream\nAll the reason why I wanted it as a volunteer as opposed to check their areas because I wanted them to be forced to spend that rebel and them you\nKnow right and they don't spend it or do they you're right that that's much better way the point is to get every day people some relief and and to have them spend that money to stimulate the economy and then that helps that you know businesses and banks and everything but it should have gone to the people and not to the damn banks\nNext up we're going to hear in Port Huron download very good that you\nKnow hello there George and a history of that question for you mentioned earlier about the banks and you can't just now but uh the taking the money I'm typing and my what about credit unions are they going to be doing the same thing or what's what's up with those\nOkay I I Would much rather have my money in a credit union than a than a money center bank\nBecause that's where all the leverage is been it was kind of opposite of the great depression a lot of people a lot a lot of the problems worse farms were over expanding\nAnd borrowing money and those were in more rural areas and that's where the trouble is and it was rural banks going under more than the money center by this is totally a money center banks thing\nAnd and also when you do with bank if governments have takes procreate money or pull ... they're going to do for the more fluent in towns and those going to be in the end the bigger\nMoney center banks so I'd much rather have my money and a credit union than you know bank of America or Wells Fargo or or or city bank and stuff like that\nOkay let's take a call or two before we wrap things up with Harry Dent Hi Barbara in North Carolina\nOkay thank you and\nI think you just answered that part of one of my questions but before I ask that\nAre directed my cat he may not have one right way parents flying lighting up I'm like oh hey humiliate crumbled and the combat can line\nRight yup play all about timing\nIf all of that time one of my guiding the looming comic I'm hearing that you just answered my question like about the smaller amount so my Social Security income that much\nUm I don't have to worry about that so much and I'm a larger account hold her is that what I understand\nI mean if they're going to have to restructure Social Security there's certainly going to take the benefits off of a larger\nAccounts and more affluent people first I mean the everyday person is going to be more protected and whatever's scenario\nAnd bank insurance agree that they can insured deposits and they can insure them all that's all right oh deposits are insured they can ensure everything if you have a major clubs but the smaller accounts it'd be spread out a few pounds and you have more money and your brokerage accounts which they can't get at\nYes you're going to be way less vulnerable than and what happened in Cyprus it was a lot of rich Russians that had big accounting so those were the biggest losers those were the ones they hit and of course\nWhen when things go bad people gonna hit foreign deposit there's more Iceland went down and basically stiffed all the foreign depositors and foreign loans and protected their own people\n\n\nLet me tell you about Dr a mini me to see has forty years of experience working in the mental health field a medical degree from the University of Manitoba is a diploma in psychiatry from McGill University now throughout his entire life\nHe is had many close brushes with death as well starting in the womb\nYeah use other number of paranormal or a novelist experiences visions breed cognitive dreams out of body experiences encounters with message burying the operations as well welcome to the program Dr many may just on coast to coast Dr welcome to the show I'm looking forward to this\nThanks for inviting me\nVery interesting that the somebody with your medical and psychiatric background would be so heavily involved in the paranormal and how did that all happened for you was it the near death experiences that started it\n[noise] well I think it was because I almost died so many times you know when my book the borders of normal first came out many people asked me if the book was based on stories with my patients had told me that my aunt was always no not at all because whatever patient tells the doctor is confidential\nA doctorate bound by the Hippocratic Oath states that are doctors should not be Pete anything he's told by his patience and I don't so the material in my book was based entirely on my own personal experiences stories from my readers and for my audiences\nAnd from family and friends and from my own extensive reading research into the paranormal\nIn terms of why I have these experiences I think it is related to the fact that I had so many close calls with that so many ... that that\nUm you know there's been a lot of literature written about the near death experience but the um term near death experience you know it's going back to talk to him in ... in Nineteen Seventy five so that's over forty years ago I was right\nNow I think he estimated that something like one in thirty Americans that they're headed near death experience or know someone who has had one and that's a large group of people but there's an even larger group of people who have almost died but never pronounced clinically dead and never had the typical near death experience\nBut when I looked at how my clothes brushes with death effected me I see that I have some of the things after effects that Dr moody described in his patients who had a classic near death experience\n[noise] in other words I'm having had all these close\nCalls the death I tend to have a deeper appreciation of life and I I also have overcome my fear of dying and I have found give myself a shift from materialism into spirituality and then he and an increased need to find meaning and purpose in life\nWas that a pretty dramatic shift for you\nKnow not at all I I Would say was gradual\nThe first couple of paranormal experiences I had I was quite young and I honestly I didn't think anything of them I just kind of ... the ... you know I just thought well that was weird but I didn't tell anyone about them because I didn't think anyone would believe me and in those days no one talked about those experiences\nBecause there was no rational way to explain them but then as time went on and I got more and more of these experiences and then when I went to um a life threatening illness and and came out on the other side thanks to a stem cell transplant from an anonymous donor\nJeez\nYeah that was that was quite dramatic I'm Better at that point I felt like I Need to share what I've been going through because it would help other people\nIn the ... stem cell transplant so why didn't they let harvest stem cells from yourself\n[noise] [noise] well that's one way of doing it but the the um anonymous stem cells donated it's called an aloe Jeanette transplant mhm with more effective they actually found someone on the worldwide ... computer\nOf Israel but I'm the owner bank and they found his name on the computer and he was a perfect match for me\nSuper ... what was what was wrong if you want to get into that\nOh sure well I had leukemia rule gee I'm yeah\nAnd I had it for many years well actually I had leukemia for sixteen years and I was in the hospital I had numerous um blood transfusions numerous courses of chemotherapy and then finally the doctor said we can't keep giving you a chemotherapy because it's doing tremendous damage to your body you\nWas it was still in remission\n[noise] well you have to be in the mission in order to receive a transplant so they gave me chemotherapy\nUm and I was in remission but then I Would keep having relapses and that's why I eventually they gave me the parents find huh [noise] now that the person who gave me the transplant he was an anonymous donor that\nThe rule at the time was that after you when you I was allowed to contact him if he agreed to contact them and I did read him just to thank him for his generosity and I found out that he was in the he's the ... was the name of the U.S navy [noise]\nAnd when his name came up on the computer he was stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf wow [noise] so he was flown back into the donors sent from Washington DC\nAnd the team from the city where I live flew down to Washington and took a sample of his themselves and then flew back to my city and that's what happened and that was eight years ago and I've been fine of ...\nHave you still in touch with them the devil to happen\nYes um I actually met him in in DC and we kept in touch and we've become friends\nThat's amazing you save your life\nHe did I can thank him enough he did save my life and they hear altruism\nYou know he said the way it came about was um [noise] they were having a donor to drive and one of the bases where he was stationed and he just got in line with his buddies and all is required is itchy swab type ... that's it\nYeah it just it takes time to get the DNA so that's when his name entered the donor bang and then um years later by name came up on the computer and at that point he's even forgotten that he had agreed to be a donor [noise] but then once you know\n... we found out that he was a perfect match for me and he was flown back to the ... center in DC they gave him some injections to stimulate his bone marrow would produce more stem cells\nAnd they gave him these injections for five days and then he had produced enough themselves so they took a blood sample which contain to stem cells and that was what what was brought back to where I live closer but yes we've become friends and I just saw not too long ago\nIn Dr ... the fact that you are dabbling so heavily into the psychic realm as that help or hurt your psyche has your practice\n[noise] well I tried to keep the two things separate I mean you know in terms of the psychiatric patients generally they don't talk about paranormal experiences they have you know serious mental disorders that they need help with and that's why they come to the psychiatrist\n[noise] however since I had that experience in psychiatry\nAble to help people distinguish between ... experience and with a psychotic experience\nRight and and and there's a big difference there\nWell absolutely there is a big difference I mean sometimes if a person the something or here's something they don't know what it is they think they're losing their mind but in fact these types of experiences are quite common\nYou know for example um if someone is believed if they've lost it I'm a spouse or a child quite often will be some type of post death contact with the deceased loved one\nSo let's say a widow might see her deceased has been in her bedroom at night and she might talk to him or she might feel his tax on her shoulder or something like that and these experiences are quite common\nIn fact one study showed that up to fifty percent of people who've lost of of a loved one will have some type of post death contact with a loved one\nEven if a person has no belief in an afterlife and many of them don't I mean these these types of experiences are not related to religious beliefs are belief in an afterlife\nUm in in fact you know an atheist and nice to have these experiences as well as religious people\nYou see that everyone is psyche again I I tend to believe you can agree with you\nOK but\nUh when you say that what's the basis for that what makes you say that\n[noise] well the thing is the the word psyche covers a lot of territory you know it includes things such as ESP or telepathy or pay cognitive beams and other things have talked about such as physicians voices and so on deathbed visions near death experiences\nSo certain types of fake experiences such as ESP\nUntil after the extremely common and a lot of people have experienced that type of thing [noise]\nUm for example someone phones you and you're thinking about that person then you say oh you must be ... I was just\nThinking about you right or is that\nVery common um and I think everyone has the ability\nIf they're interested to nurture their intuition or their ESP or they have a path a fence but a lot of people are interested in it as I said when I first had these experiences myself I just kind of brush them off I didn't think too much of them [noise]\nIt was really only after I got sick that I start to think that maybe there was more to it than meets the eye\nWith with the psychic roam out there in the ability to tap into it have you found that certain people are better at it than others\nYou mean to rent the did you ever come across research from a psychiatrist who has died named Dr shift ... curricula\nNo I'm not familiar with her ... her oh her\nIn a it was my aunt and she was she went to a Oxford University and she got her degree in psychiatry yeah and specialized in all kinds of things and then decided she was giving all that up to study telepathy\nAnd when that's all she did she wrote a couple of books was called breakthrough the creativity of but she was convinced\nTotally convinced that telepathy was the real deal and the and again the psychiatrist seen that and so you're the only only other psychiatrist I Know that has really jumped into this\n[noise] oh I'd like to look for that ... that sounds very interesting I'm\nBreakthrough to creativity I'm\nDefinitely gonna look for it but you know they're in 'em ups written by physicians but near death experiences for example even Alexander ... who have and yeah\nAnd he's never surgeon and marry the meal she goes to heaven and back in our therapeutic surgeon and of course Oliver Sacks he's in Iraq just to go to the hotel this nation so physicians have written about these things but I haven't found another psychiatrist who who's written about Aaron\nYeah you're going to enjoy that so I mean she she just did the the devoted her entire career to that uh she uh she passed away and very bizarre way she was in the bath tub in a radio\nFelt in their home no I Hope to God I wasn't listening to my show no that's terrible it was just a ... or ...\nHow did you get so interested in ...\nShe just always was and there were so many things that had happened to her and she just decided there's something to this and she's going to study it and she she went into it in a big way\nWell that's good but I Know there's been some studies done on telepathy at my monitor these medical center in New York\nWhere they were getting into the the the ability to transmit information to people who are dreaming and in that study they had Sanders and receivers\nAnd BBC rates were in a sleep lab and they were hooked up to any teeth and um the AG could measure what we call them sleep rapid eye movement\nAnd then when the the voice when Jim state the Centers for giving random images\nAnd they were told to concentrate on the images I Try to send them to be with and they found that people were more susceptible to ... to to let the when they're asleep\nAnd it's also true that people are more susceptible to a lot of the when they're under hypnosis so there are ways to augment leprosy but in my case and in most people's cases it just happens spontaneously\nDo you have a lot of patients that have these abilities\n[noise] no I wouldn't say so\nAll right stay with us Dr we're going to take a

bit about the death bed visions and your thoughts about that do you believe they're extremely common don't you\n[noise] that's right a lot of studies have shown that it's it's very common for someone who is dying to see a deceased friend or relative um that actually happened with my dad when he was in the hospital he saw his late sister he mentioned over this phone so you mentioned her name she was out in the hall\nSo she got on the plane and sure enough that's what happened so sometimes people have these experiences have these dreams and they disregard them you know and I've heard of other cases like that too\nSo as you say these ... can be very powerful and and where does this where does this message come from that brings up another subject which is sometimes people receive messages in dreams which aren't the cognitive\nAnd who's giving them the message\nChats the question like where's this message coming from [noise] you know we can we can speculate you know we can say it's coming from the unconscious or we could say it's coming from something they've added or we can say it's coming from the spirit\nWorld you know but some of these\nMessages for example this woman I mentioned who had the dream that should be killed in a terrorist attack where would that be coming from that could have been her fear\nMhm you know um and maybe it was just a coincidence that somehow when something like that happens it seems to be more than a coincidence\nOr there's there was a movie about a group of people government people who tried to enter the dream state of other governmental leaders to to assassinate them\nAnd you know the wanted them to die of heart attacks and they were going to put fear into their dreams and stuff like that do you think that really might be going on many\n[noise] [noise] well that reminds me of the collapse of the studies that I mentioned that were being conducted at my monitor these medical center in New York because I think people can be more susceptible to telepathy\nI don't know while they're dreaming while they're asleep I don't know to the point of getting having making someone have a heart attack I don't know if that would be possible if that's ever been done\nWell who knows when people die in their sleep what caused right that's\nRight that's right because you know I sort of take the position that anything is possible you know and I think that's possible\nAlthough we don't really know and that and how how did we know that's right you know [noise] um so yeah\nThat could be pretty remarkable mhm\n[noise] yeah I was also talking about messages in dreams 'cause I've also had that experience where I received a message but it wasn't um wasn't it the cognitive gene was just a message and I didn't even know what to make of it that I remembered it just clear as day when I woke up this is the message I thought I I just saw these\nWhere it said this is a world of illusion\nAnd the biggest illusion is time\nDidn't Caesar's wife have a premonition about the ides of march\n[noise] that's right and in fact she dreamt the night before he was killed she dreamt that he was going to be assassinated\nShe begged him not to go to the Senate hey nerd who plays also with ... told Julius Caesar it'd be where the ides of march which is the fifteenth of march and he he ... ignored his wife and he was killed so\nYeah that was a very strong premonition premonition is usually a warning\nHow many people don't act on their premonition stole maybe\nI'd say probably the majority I Would agree because I don't think people believe them they don't believe they're intuition\nAnd then they do the water should uh after the fact\nYeah exactly and how many times has that happened I Know that say the majority of people don't pay attention to it because they they think well we live in a you know scientific rational society and we need to think of things rationally and they'd disregard things which could be dismissed as superstition\nIs always the fear of being labeled superstitious\nThere was a a movie called let it ride with Richard dry so she was above horse racing and they'll yeah one of his friends apparently really understood who's going to win the race but didn't back on that horse bid on something else some loss\nIn ... in the movie screaming at ground you knew you knew you knew that's a little like not acting on your premonition\nYeah for sure that is yeah and you wonder why I think it's fair I think people are I don't believe that they don't believe it and also they were afraid of getting into something which appears irrational\nTell me a little bit about blind people in a obese and things like that\nWell that that's very interesting story because there have been reports of blind patients who've been blind since birth who have another body experience during surgery\nAnd then when they are recovered from the anesthesia and they wake up to ... to tell the doctors and nurses are what they saw and what they heard while they were out of their bodies there was one patient who is blind who when he returned to his body after the surgery was able to describe the color and the pattern on his\nDoctors pie and of course the doctor was astounded there was another case of a blind patients who left his body during surgery [noise] I think no he was he was wasn't surgery he had a cardiac arrest and they took out his dentures\nAnd he left his body and he was observing everything that was going on and then when he when he recovered and they couldn't find where she put his dentures wanted his teeth background\nYeah have you back\nBut then then they said I don't know I put them and he said well when I was out of my body I saw you put them in that door over there and she open that door and sure enough\nThere they were they were well yeah it works it would work yeah\nWhat what have you learned many about all of them is what do you think it is\n[noise] I think\nWell I think that there's a spiritual component like I have to say that\nYou do I do and you don't tickets paranormal\nWell I think it's related to the I think it ... I think it's paranormal and I think it's ...\nI mean there's certain words that are used to describe these experiences are these phenomena some people call them fake extend people call them paranormal some people call them spiritual or anomalous or mystical are mysterious Israel different words of being used to describe the same event\nBut I think paranormal event and have a spiritual component\nYeah but I'm not saying every paranormal event but some do of course it depends on the person having experience or they want to interpret it or what they want to how they want to think about it\nDo you think science should do a better job investigating these things\n\nOkay\nWell come back to our final hour with Dr many major this we're talking about his work the borders of normal\nAs a psychiatrist in you do have to decide whether a person is truly experiencing a psychic issue or is a psychotic how do you tell the difference Manny\n[noise] well the thing is if someone has a vision for example or someone hearing voices certain qualities that would distinguish the say came from a psychotic experience for example if someone hears the voice I'm a psychotic hallucination tends to be very very frightening\nIt's also very frequent it could be everyday auditory hallucinations could also be other things besides voices\nIt can be found if machinery and in\nFact they may be more than one voice\nTo hear the voices talking to each other about the person the voices might be an accusatory or threatening whereas I'm psychic hallucinations and to be ... feet when\nThey may occur only once had price in a lifetime and they tend to be a reassuring and calming the other thing is with psychosis you can't just look at when symptoms such as hearing the voice you have to look at the whole person\nBecause psychosis is the major mental disorder which affects the person's ability to function in society whether the person as a student or whether they're going to work\nOr within the family if then if they're not able to function and if they have a lot of other than an aside from the ... for example the thought to ... or paranoid idea ... or you know feelings have ...\n... that you played talking but then this type of thing so there's more than just one thing that you need to make a diagnosis of psychosis\nCan you make a misdiagnosis ... conceivable\n[noise] yes in fact it had happened there is a psychologist that did an experiment where he had a group of eight people including himself and he had each one of them go to a different emergency room and had different hospitals around the country and it tells the doctor in the emergency room that they were hearing voices\nAnd in each case the patients while they were patients they were actors pretending to be ...\nThat they were misdiagnosed as it gets ... they're admitted to the word they were given medication they didn't take medication and once they got the word the the patience to me that they were faking so they were able to fool the doctors but they weren't able to fool the other patients\nPatients knew how did they know\nWell because these people were otherwise normal the facts and the fact that they said they were hearing voices in terms of their parents their behavior that conversation the way they were thinking the way they presented themselves everything else about them as completely normal so that if I say you can make the diagnosis on the basis of a single symptom\nHow come to the doctors couldn't figure that out well unfortunately you know sometimes doctors make mistakes well that's true but but the patients that and I think because well the patients live with it they they know the honest so well they know the symptoms and everything that's right\nAll right let's take some calls for your duty in the Ozarks in Missouri hey Judy go ahead\nThank you so much for taking my call waiting and waiting to talk to someone who knows a little bit about the brain are a lot about brain I have been a mistake in net had visions all my life and I have that many many near death experiences wherever that my body\nBut I think one of the most interesting things that ever happened to me is when I went to London and then to do and I saw a picture of the war room where they did all the major planning for their European front\n... well that's where I used to go and out of body experience when I was little\nAnd there were a whole bunch of us up up above kind of sitting like in the balcony and we were out in spirit that not legal and they were very upset because I was so young and they didn't think I should\nBe any [laughter]\nBut you did that it is a remote viewing huh\nNo I ...
