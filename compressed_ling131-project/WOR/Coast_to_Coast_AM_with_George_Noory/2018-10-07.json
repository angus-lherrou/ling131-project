want to help in the future\nYeah and I think the key to this too is it's not about creating a fulltime job it's about creating that full time life\nYou know we talk a lot about financial freedom and that's\nThat's really what it boils down to is being able to move to Spain if you want to move to Spain you know for for a while I spent my my winters in the Caribbean and\nI was living in Boston at the time and and I had somebody actually come up to me and say why do you go [laughter] chuckle Everytime I think about it he said why do you why do you leave Boston and go to\nA Puerto Rico and the winter time and I looked at him and said have you ever spent a winter here in Boston and he was like well yeah and I'm like that's why when it gets really pretty freezing cold here in the wintertime and I'm running from it\nAnd that sort of the things that that the markets allow you to do is it doesn't matter where you it doesn't matter where you go as long as you have an Internet connection we've joked about it a few times Larry where back when I used to do that I wanted to go back and forth as I Would be down in Puerto Rico and I'd have that big Eighteen the air card hanging out of the side of my laptop\nThat it was almost the same size as my laptop\nAnd even my satellite radio down there like it only worked from like ... it only worked for eight AM to like noon 'cause that's when the satellite was over me and so it was it was hilarious but where we are from a technology standpoint is is is light years beyond where we were you know twelve years ago Fifteen Years ago when when I was just getting started and this\nAnd it's kind of a fun it's been a fund evolution to see but for everybody who is just getting started right now it's like\nIt's like you have no idea how good you have it I feel like when I talked to a new traders I'm like my grandfather and I'm like oh and I went to school I had to walk up pill both ways and the snow you know we had dial up Internet and now it's just in the palm of your hand but we have so much access to our money that really\nGoing in and just getting a little bit of skill and getting a little bit of a little bit of knowledge\nCan really go a long way we don't have to call up a broker and say hey you know what about this what about that it's just right at the ... of our hand identify the price and we want to pay set the order and then wait for price really come down to you it it ends up being that kind of classic negotiating tactic\nYou say you know and my grandfather told me that's when I was like five years old I remember going with him and he was buying my grandma new car and he said watch this he says I'm going to tell them the prize I'm going to pay and and as soon as he says no we're going to get up and walk away\nAnd that's really how you approach the markets you say you know what I Want to buy this these these shares a stock but I Want to buy this price and if I can for this price that's okay there's lots of other stocks that I can go buy it a great price and you have to have that mentality and that is the mentality of the professional one of the things that can help you operate like a professional though is confidence\nConfidence can come from education confidence can come from building skill a great place to start that is it the half day class we've got a few tickets left before

share with our audience out there as far as times where where people have come in and they've they've got the ball rolling they've taken that initial first step and how it's gotten him to that point a financial freedom\nLet's consistency Ryan most people come in they make that commitment it's really pretty simple you know you have to be willing to commit ... coach ... beat a point in your life when you're really wanted to make a change if somebody's just kind of going from one thing to the next to the next year really never going to achieve what you want to do it's all about stepping back\nAsking yourself a simple question how's that life working for you if you're not happy right now than you happy\nYourself out of your comfort zone start thinking there are better ways to do things but more importantly learn from people who already doing what you want to do I have heard my whole life you know going up at school that copying someone was bad well that's completely false you want to copy somebody\nWho's doing what you want to do and who are successful so you need to be able to have mentors you need to be able to have coaches you need to be able to be somebody who really is willing to make a change\nBecause people don't change in fact on Stein once said the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome\nThis is how most people live their lives they'd rather just continue to be miserable not do anything different when there's a whole opportunity right in front of them to go out there and she said giving up a couple of hours of your life where you can be watching TV or doing something else it's more important to invest in yourself to invest in some TV show out there\nAnd I remember seeing a as you were saying copying somebody being that the way you learn it it really is I I remember being in a in a class um you know ten Fifteen Years ago and I remember the instructor actually saying\nYou know if you want to be wealthy do what wealthy people do if you if you see somebody who is in the situation that you want to be in and if you follow them around all day long and you do the exact same things that they do eventually you will be in that same spot\nA and he brought up the the the the inverse side of that too and he said\nIf you follow somebody around who is making terrible kind of financial decision somebody who maybe it's a homeless person who's kind of lost everything and you do exactly what they do you know that's the same thing if you're copying that process you're going to end up in that situation and it's the same thing in the financial markets and it's one of the reasons why we teach\nOur students how they could identify what the financial institutions during one of the professionals doing what are the best people in the world\nDoing inside of these financial markets how can you identify that\nSo that you can go in and just simply do what they do so that you can get

feels rated number one seven\nThey knew that they could have non invasive treatment pinpoint treatment for this kind of cancer and they declined they didn't want to upset the patient she already had a heart sat on this to forming surgery while\nWhile while while while\nFor me where the radio to inform to educate to help that woman in Philadelphia and not have the forming surgery and yet she in the family were so\nThey were ready for the surgery they prepare themselves for the surgery so what they could have easily cancelled that surgery or postpone the surgery or told the doctor look I just want to have one week postponement they can easily do that is not set in stone\nThat could have easily postponed the surgery one week come to see me talk about all the options learned about all the options and then decide in person rather than to go through the forming surgery\nAnd these are the kinds of discussions I have with patients every day whether it's about saving their mouth or man the boulders throw their their their lung the breast pancreas liver bladder kidney leg arm prostate\nThis is the work that we do and we are the first with body ready to go surgery pinpoint treatment to treat cancers\nMost anywhere in the body with non invasive invisible beams with high success rates so the beauty is that it's highly successful\nWell tolerated in general not the forming with no hospital stays all our work is out patient therapy this is the work we do and of course it's easy to understand why guess who Dr Lederman first in America first in the western hemisphere\nWas there a tactic body radio surgery non invasive treatment for cancers\nMost anywhere in the body let me give you another example and I'm thinking about it just because a few hours ago I sat down to my desk was a card from a family\nOf a young woman thirty five years old who four years ago had breast cancer stage for breast cancer\nShed a terrible breast cancer in her breast and that traveled already to the spine she went to one of the big hospitals in New York City they buy up seed her they were going to start on standard radiation tour pelvis\nBecause she had cancer and the pelvic bones and that a friend of theirs whose mother I took care of said hey\nBefore you get that radiation the radiation was going to start an hours before you get that radiation why don't you call a doctor Lederman and see Dr Lederman and maybe something will change\nAnd that's family cancelled the radiation that's a big hospital got the patient discharge beautiful woman thirty five years old accountant married have a happy husband and family in general [noise]\nCame to me we've found the cancer we found the cancer and the spine into lumbar spot and the sacred causing terrible pain eating through the bone\nBut instead of giving standard radiation which would've radiated her ovaries at her uterus and major sterile at age thirty five we were able to treat her and treat her with pinpoint treatment\nSo as not to harm her uterus not to harm her ovaries we put together a program for her treatment or radio surgery was only a few treatments pinpoint to the spine\nGot rid of the pain got rid of the cancer she is now cancer free four years later from stage for cancers thanks to our work or prayers\nAnd furthermore three years ago she delivered a healthy baby\nAnd she delivered that baby after radiation only because she came here to Thirteen eighty four Broadway and we were able to send in invisible beams to attack the cancer not hurt her ovaries\nNot her her uterus keep her fertility keep the fertility of eight thirty five year old woman\nAnd this is the work we do and it's so different\nAnd sometimes very frequently most commonly it's hard for patients\nAnd their families to understand exactly where that beam is going but this is the work we've pioneered first in America obviously first New York first of the western hemisphere with pinpoint stare a tactic body radio surgery with high success rates\nFewer treatments but more focus treatments to attack the cancer wherever it might be in general from head to toe whether it's in the brain or the eyes of the nose of the mouth skin

year old woman she has two children and for four or five years she's had a brain tumor growing she was seeing that some of the biggest hospitals\nThey did a scan of her brain they found a ... growing right by the eye of the brain stem the most delicate parts of our brain and her eyes started turning inward the tumor was damaging the nerves so that her I was going in in in er right I was going in towards the nose\nAnd she couldn't change it and so she lost stereo vision she lost her vision and that I and she was so embarrassed\nOr shamed by what was going on that she would call ... hair over the right side of her face\nAnd she kept on seeing doctors one of the doctors offered surgery and she didn't like the risk of the complications that were associated with surgery by the by the brainstem\nThen she saw another surgeon another surgeon and this tumor this minute GMOs growing in her brain and it got aggressive was felt to be an aggressive ... teaching point there's often\nThree ... owned a benign an aggressive an a malignant cancer type but and she alma and\nShe was about to have an aggressive tumor because of its growth and\nShe was getting no headaches and double vision that blurry and as the eye and finally\nA friend of hers told her to give us a call and she called up two one two choices she came into our office that there should be for Broadway I saw her and we spoke about all the options and it was clear that surgery most likely would be devastating because of its location\nAnd the critical location by structures and furthermore she didn't want to take the risk of surgery and she doesn't want someone else's hands in her head and that's why she chose or treatment and we treated her and I should tell you one more thing we treated or a year ago\nAnd since that time she's been into my office repeatedly for checkups and her tumor despite being called an aggressive Benjamin continues\nTo shrink down her ... her eyes straight and she's functional and she carries on and they tell you she is very happy the headaches of resolve themselves the eyes straight ahead\nAnd she has a remission\nFrom this tumor that was seemingly so devastating when the surgeons told her she had to have surgery they forgot to tower that with Dr Lederman the success rate for ... and she almost tradition registered in New York is\nNinety seven percent I think a lot higher than with most common surgeries\nAnd we're talking about a fifty two year old woman from Jamaica Jamaica I met with government officials and there's lots of cancer lots of prostate cancer a lot of breast cancer was a fifty two older ones from Jamaica with breast cancer and then there are left press the upper outer part of the breast as a mass there she had a biopsy\nShe can feel the mass she was told that she needed to have big surgery and she just did not want to have surgery examines her she was a five centimeter mass at the upper outer quadrant\nOf the rest of her exam as normal I've asked for cancer marker tests and PET scans everything came up negative this seems to be the only side of disease and she like many women choose to have primary radiation at Radio City New York avoiding surgery\nThat's what she chose and that's what she's doing and she tolerated\nBroadway and thirty eight straight pay a visit\nBringing documents are will get them whatever's best\nAnd we'll sit down and if you want\nYou can do what you want it's up to each patient each\nMan or woman can do what they want you don't have to save your breath you can lose your breast if you want but many many women who come to us want to keep a body intact many men one to keep their body attack they don't want to lose their kidney or their prostate bladder or their breast breast cancer occurs about one percent\nOne percent of breast cancers in men so for this woman she is super happy I can tell you that she had about the biggest\nSmile on her face during the week that she has cancer free kept her breast avoided radical surgery she is happy and we are happy for her\nAnd I was talking about another woman who is sixty nine years old this or this panic woman she has three children ... me for

... pelvic pain and well I examined her she had a mastectomy shut an implant but it it looks more or less like a skin\nCovered beach bar baseball it doesn't look like a breast and when they say breast reconstruction they're not really often reconstructing what looks like a breast but often they're putting a bump there\nThat may be satisfied as a surgeon but I think usually does not satisfy the woman she's lost her ... she's lost sensation there\nAnd the parents certainly markedly different and now she has flank pain so she has a right breast cancer and flying paying the never completed the therapy and that's another reason why so many people come to us they just don't want treatment else where they want treatment where\nThey know the staff were the staff though the patient with ...

every other doctor every facility every hospital gave only standard treatment which means a lot of healthy tissue gets hurt\nAnd hit by radiation to get to the tumor we said there must be a better way and the better way is to focus on the\nTumor focus on the cancer and not heard healthy tissues and that's what we brought to New York decades ago both for the brain and then first in America with

it\nBut most likely we see lots and lots of patients and we see what happens in we document that and we can see that radio surgery is great that shrinking the cancer and stopping the cancer and also stopping cancer pain so talking a lot about cancer pain today because I was so shocked to hear the kids from reading the most capable doctors have\nLots of patients in pain well\nThat shouldn't be they should be sending them to radio surge in New York for focus\nTreatment to get the patient out of pain and you can come by yourself you don't need to wait for your doctor you can just cause cause make an appointment if you want\nIt's up to you had two and two choices which is to one to two four six forty two thirty seven to one to two four six forty two thirty seven give us a call see if our hype\nLives up to reality\nAnd I suspect that well this is Dr Lederman Michael how are you\nI mean how are you\nOkay how are you today and what's your question\nI have a question actually my guy or a patient about Fifteen Years ago when you were able to match dialing spittle\nOkay and and um\nHe saw the part they can set buddy die eventually follow la say emphysema lung disease emphysema I'm Sorry to hear the thank you but\nI I mean we can't just sit you my dad at at least question anytime you're on him and said that when I go to that I have a question and when you have done\nIt didn't have any questions about why they think that is because you're not going\nWell okay that's number one but I talked to a lot of people I'm not living in the ivory tower and out of my life with my patients then I'm close to my patients and if you remember seeing the I'd met hiding I'm there every day with my patients just radio surgery in New York where we're with\nOur patients so I got to dissipate most questions I mean some people will come with a a ball questions and I can anticipate those but for most people with most people with cancer I couldn't dissipate most questions I Try to answer them so people feel comfortable and also so they feel that their questions are normal questions that they're not\nStrange that these are people questions that I deal with every day so your data treatment Fifteen Years ago junior would disappear saying Gleason score was\nA little and you don't\nAnd houses treatment to remember anything about his treatment\nMember in telling me that it hit me like a a he said it was a black a garbage bag but they fit in in his phone\nRight as a custom made body stereotype to frame it so we're talking about the the there is a plastic bag was made of Styrofoam that molds around the patient's body so it's painless but it's very accurate and very strong to keep the patient and then the exact position because we want the patient in a precise position\nThan we computerized everything in the body we find the cancer we find the body and we find the stereotype that crime computerized all three and then send beams and in your father's case beams in the process that\nWay and I remember having no I'm the last time that we had to come to see that was back in back it's either the cat had gotten snow or had\nA status thing side which was very optimistic but we ended up and up with a emphysema that he had and it just you know that just took them\nTo emphasize moves unrelated to the cancer right\nRight exactly well yeah it was to that but it was ... so he was a smoker\nI felt that smoke\nSo what's your advice to other people\nThat don't smoke and what's\nHow's your your father's treatment was successful how long does he live after the treatment\nI Would say close to five years okay I didn't have any side effects and the treatment not not not\nSo no side effects and the cancer went away so he was satisfied experience yes he was markets any route any regrets about the experience\nYou know I Can't say we had to go from the Staten Island all over the Internet in traffic but that actually that's that's just kind of like a joke and complain about anything he\nYou know that we want it to the doctor and get a painting and I sat there for the video cassette that you have mhm\nCame in the man we pop that in Asia let's go back in and we walked in and he said that that that that I Want to go south [laughter]\nAnything that I told her that wasn't true inaccurate\nNot at all that Lebanon and remember offhand now cycling yeah more or less I mean and I've flown out of the it was terrific\nWhat would you tell other patients who have cancer\nAnd so we don't get that delete 'em in the whole\nThing two things through Congress where patients round the world would just have a family member to talk about later on the show flew in from Houston for treatment we've actually moved\nOr office for Thirteen ready for Broadway so for people from Long Island you can take the Long Island railroad we're right by Penn Station and Grand Central and Port Authority so we're more convenient and over and track\nBut they didn't actually fighting the south I Am I'm at you in the treatment so why can't they gave it that um that light on what you\nActually see gee in the blood us for superficial bladder cancer yeah that is I haven't had water plants are getting a smoker or ex smoker\nAs well but I guess from being on my dad a lot of years of age both probably didn't help\nYeah that's sad so anyway we take\nThere are a lot of people with bladder cancer if it's superficial that means it's just in the\nLining of the bladder and hasn't invaded or that kind of treatment is pretty good we take care of a lot of people who have invasive bladder cancer who want to save their bladder so obviously number one as you pointed out not to smoke is really great not to be around smokers is also important I guess when you're\nA kid you don't have that chance so parents should be as responsible as they can and\nGet their kids out of the smoke and hopefully get out of smoking themselves and we actually\nWhere thirty for Broadway and be happy to see you or your loved one\nAnd like I say thank you God Bless you so for a patient who had lung cancer brain Mets who had brain surgery to listen to this that brain surgery at the hospital and then they were told to go home on the hospice to die\nNow that doesn't make sense at all if they're going to send the patient home why would they do brain surgery unless they had some other motive or maybe they had complications from the brain surgery at Radio City of New York we do things differently number one our treatment is\nAnd general non invasive if you have a cancer in the brain or a brain metastases Britain metastases means that cancer traveled to the brain from another site like from the breast of the long or the liver or the pancreas we can treat the patient noninvasive Lee outpatient in just a few minutes to just a few treatments so they can avoid\nGetting your head opened up and you can imagine the difference between invasive treatment of your brain opening up your hat general anesthesia ... someone else's hands in your head\nPerson's our treatment where you live in a table\nLike Star Wars beams come into the cancer and few minutes later you get up and go\nTo lunch or go to work or go to ... as you do what you want and by avoiding the cutting and bleeding in the hospital stay avoid a lot of the complications and avoid a lot of the cost and you can spend more time doing the things that you want to do and for the patient who had a lung cancer spread of the brain yes we also trade\nBelong so there's lots of reasons to consider a fresh second opinion at\nRadio surgery New York this is where we do this work every day it's not a sideline for us it's our existence our name as radio sort of New York what we do is radio surgery every day all day that's what our team is about and our team is there to serve you\nIf you wish at thirty for Broadway Marianne how are you today on the\nThing that can be getting thank you for taking my call on at that town and give you were on my brother Seventy nine years old was diagnosed with me now a casino and those salons\nCannot an oak ... okay I don't know carcinoma what's your question to the\n... and you have the right treatment on on the [noise] considered for for his cat that cancer\nOr number one shore and we just talking about another patient with lung cancer or just a minute ago [laughter] I don't know carcinoma there's two major types of lung cancer small so non small so\nMost most lung cancers are called non small cell and they include added no car stomach your brother ran square ms so our success right when we aim to beam at the lung cancer is Ninety percent Ninety percent of the time we can stop\nIt or shrink it or make a go away where we aim to beam and we have the ability to do both lungs casts both lungs if necessary\nChapter on just one other thing that I wanted to tell you is that he has had chemotherapy for the last six months and add in the first round the sign up for a treatment ad that then it started to get larger and that's why you\nKnow why that is right to know why that is now\nBut tell you why it is and it's very simple when king was first given for the first few weeks the first few months the cancer in the body has never seen chemo so often chemo was more effective at the beginning I slid after a while the cancer starts mutating it it changes it resist the chemo so\nFor your time is very common chemo works a little bit of the beginning but after a few weeks or a couple of months than the cancer fights back the cancer evolves against it mutates and resist it\nAnd the differences with chemotherapy there's usually just one mechanism is only one trick of the chemotherapy and the cancer can learn that trick very easily with radio surgery with\nOur treatment heart treatment works in billions and billions of different ways and by working billions and billions of different ways the cancer can't out smarter\nAnd that's why it's so much more effective\nAs so for a lung cancer I mean your brother had maybe a benefit for a couple of months to do\nWith us the benefit would be most likely where we have the beam for the rest of his life\nI see do you think that it still he still time to see you\nKnow he if he wants to come in and let them make an appointment next week I'd be happy to see him sit down because they say we spend a lot of time with each patient we go through the details of scams the blood test explain it to him and his family to you and also allow me to understand exactly what he has\nAnd then talk about all the options and demand wishes to have radios surgery so nice treatment well tolerated treatment if he has pain or suffering it offer relieves the pain if he has obstructed airways from lung cancer it off and opens up the airways has had\nThat said he on oxygen now\nOkay well it often helps the patient open up the airways sometimes people have even blood and there's viewed um they're coughing up blood because the cancers eating through blood vessels Ryan radio surgery often allows the cancer to die there and the blood vessels to heal up so it has a lot of potential benefits for someone like your beloved brother\nLess on he how can you read to Dr\n... two and two choices has ... scissors to one to two four six forty two thirty seven\nVery into health so God Bless\nRelatively book within ... thank you we also have a book with a DVD if he wants or you want which explains a lot about our work and also the DVD shows a lot about our work so either way to meet in person is always the best of the book or

finding waiting surgery you can also call Dr lead a minute to ensure killington for free informative booklet and DVD paid doctor Lederman walk\nBy and Rob thank you yeah we are back Rob and I are making art of radio surgery so if you like to come and visit our lobby we have\nThe art of radio surgery and through the art of radio surgery everyone can learn a lot about what we do and how we do it and why we do it\nSo You're welcome to come in and visit our lobby and see the heart of radio surgery and his things to the great talents of Rob that we're able to do that better color and I want to\nReally the question this is a gentleman who called about\nA woman in his family who had a cancer deep in the shoulder area and he was saying that they wanted to do a twelve inch incision and the doctors didn't think they could reach the cancer and he was asking can we do that work and that's exactly what we do we're able to hit cancers\nAnywhere in the body there's absolutely no spot\nThat we can't reach so we treat cancers that are small or large primary\nOr met a static even if chemo radiation or surgery hasn't\nWorked or isn't tolerated so for this woman who has a large cancer the shoulder area yes that's what we do and yes we can reach it and yes experienced treating cancers nearly everywhere in the body I could tell you a few space spaces that we created but you might get embarrassed\nSo you can imagine where we've treated most everywhere in the body don't talk to about a gentleman who came actually came from China sixty four years old for the prostate cancer Gleason eight cancer and why did he come to us well\nHe saw the data and that was going to read some of the day that right now because you may want to know what happens to Gleason they\nCancer patients prostate cancer patients Gleason was the pathologist he put a scale on the appearance of the cancer from\nOne to five and two areas so one plus one equals to is the best you can have five plus five because ten the worst you can have this and how the Gleason eight and if you look on page has set out on another page or go to the most famous surgeon in America the most famous surgeon America for ... to ten years\nHas a twenty eight percent success rate\nSo may say wow I didn't know that then you probably didn't know that because most people think and a lot of surgeons and urologist let people believe falsely\nBelieve that if you cut out the cancer you're home free well here's the most famous surgeon in America who cut out Gleason eight cancers and a ten years over Seventy percent of the cancers relapsed only twenty eight percent were cancer free so\nWho would call that successful treatment I don't think many people would cause successful treatment especially coupled with data from Harvard Medical school that\nQuestion man about quality of life\nAfter surgery sexual problems occurred in Ninety seven percent of men after open surgery for ... for prostate cancer urine or problems occurred in eighty percent and now a lot of men are being told that robotic surgery is better and this study actually looked at that and\nSexual problems occurred and open serving Ninety seven percent of time with robotic it was even worse\nSexual problems occurred after robotic surgery for prostate cancer Ninety seven point seven percent of the time and urinary problems occurred with open surge eighty percent of the time and with robotic supposedly all the lights and bells and cameras just supposed to see everything and not have the complications right well\nUrine or problems many leaking unity and you're paying eighty six point eight percent of the time so in fact the vast majority of people with us today after surgery had recurrence of the cancer and\nSexual problems mean directions inadequate for intercourse and urinary problem screening the cage or being in your pants so why would anyone do that when you could come to registered in New York and have\nMore than a hundred percent better improvement and that's on page eleven figures Seventeen showing police and eight nine ten results more than double\nSurvival cancer free survival rates Seventy percent or cancer free with us and with us the majority of them and keeping sexual function and Ninety nine percent keeping urinary control\nSo it's easy to see why so many men want to come to us about a patient this week who went to a surgeon or does robotic surgery so I went there it was like a ... they had girls dressed up like dancing girls and it was so beautiful well why do they do that\nThey do that because it's to the Vert your attention rather than telling you if you had robotic surgery for a Gleason eight you'd have a twenty eight percent success rate so called success right I mean most likely\nYour cancer would come back and most likely you wouldn't have another direction whether it's a dancing girl or not and most likely be wearing a diaper so they're\nTrying to divert attention from the lack of success in doing surgery for prostate cancer how beautiful their office is well it's the version of attention and don't buy into it\nIs wrong it doesn't matter how pretty the dancing girls are they're not going to be dancing for you most likely\nAfter radical surgery or after robotic surgery for prostate cancer they're\nProbably going to be danced and for the next group of patients are going through surgery and\nThose patients should look at our book club first time get our information first I Believe with a quarter million men a year having prostate cancer you should have the data first if you only knew the Gleason the aid that you're going to have a twenty percent success rate with radical surgery or robotic surgery but\nThe most men having complications you'd never do it\nSo get the data first and look at the complication where there's a letter from one of the major robotic surgeons in New York City soon as\nCompetent page fourteen of a book that they talked about the complications of robotic surgery including infection bleeding position all insurers GPS from both says\nCommentary on below vow injury rector oh rectal injury your reader on jury cardiac or respiratory problems ... shortening Uri throw strictures incontinence infertility impotence\nThey know that cross the tech to me as the number one cause of shortening of the penis in\nAmerica and almost low managers told that ... and you wake up from the surgery and like Ronald Reagan set in the movie where's the rest of me well where is the rest of you while the rest of you went out in the bucket with your prostate so before you choose what\nTreatment you have I Would urge you to not only for prostate cancer for every cancer urge you\nTo get the data first it's just so important for you to have the data in your hands and analyze it before you make a decision so if you go to a doctor's office and there's dancing girls in marble and mahogany from the Taj Mahal it to the version\nTo get your eye off of the results you should be thinking about the results and you should be thinking about you and as one of the piece of art in our lobby says you can love yourself or love your surgeon but sometimes I don't know that it's possible to love both so think about which order is most imports and\nPersonally I think a patient should love themselves first and questioned the surgeon and look at the data and that's how you'll get the best results for yourself and if you need a second opinion we the courage to come to Thirteen ... for Broadway Broadway and thirtieth street in Manhattan we take most insurance is

asked his anthem that's found in as to FX 'cause I Know there were dozens and dozens of studies maybe you can pull out and highlight a couple of your favorites\nYeah for sure so Dr Mark Miller he's a PHD at biomedical research or he explains that well he's talking here about how free radicals compromise and undermine function and sell you the performance in the body he says after his Anthony's simply\nSit heard at negating this as evidenced by clinical trial showing improved performance and accelerated\nRecovery in fact research published in the journal of medicine and science in sports and exercise found that those who took four milligrams of ... daily over twenty eight days scored better cycling times with greater output and those who did not take it for the bike that\nI mean remember this after that and it's one of the few that fireball antioxidants that can actually neutralize free radicals\nEven at the site of the mitochondrial membrane if like fabulous body armor protecting

studies conducted by leading researchers around the world that really act\nThat benefit to that than than either way muscle I put it that are with us did that too and this comes from after that that research published in the international journal sports\nNutrition November two thousand and alive and\nThis is another study done with cyclists they took for granted access\nThan than it was a small study but very positive showing that cyclists improved\nTheir trial time by two minutes and twenty kilometers bike race I mean that's a meaningful improvement in a race like this and the researchers said that they also bring fat more efficiently which makes sense\nBased on this research purity can actually make the claim that asked FX will promote and improve power output\nIn your muscles I mean
