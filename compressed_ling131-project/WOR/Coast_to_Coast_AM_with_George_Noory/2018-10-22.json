thanks again for having me\nA absolutely no good times on the show and I appreciate it [noise]\nSo returning to work on big what does this feel like you're dating your ex\n[laughter] it's a\nIt's kind of odd like you said it's it's always been doing in the background and it's something that's always had my interest I think it's an elusive topic that uh there's a lot of conjecture out there but not a lot of facts\nYou'd never stopped working on it does you know I mean your focus may have been elsewhere but it's always been sort of a you kept an eye out for articles and information\nYou know I Can't say that I've committed much energy to it\nIn the last seven eight years focused on missing people but when you're going through the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people I'm always reading about all kinds of things that I see on these first pages of news news articles and such and\nI started to come across these ah these stories about\nUm something that looked like they were when you read the articles but when you read the title of it like Ninety percent of the time it will say wild man and I hadn't done a lot of archived work on the topic before but [noise]\nYou know eight years of digging through these archives for missing people articles I just started to pull them and put them in a folder and over the years that got large\nAnd eventually I said you know this is pretty intriguing I I think even if you're an optimist or a pessimist on the topic it's convincing that something over the years has been around us\nAnd it's been documented and and it shows the historical aspect that most people don't understand\nUm ... we're going to get into the specifics articles about big wild man and giants and sometimes do the same and sometimes they're different but I wanted to just for those who were not listening ten years ago\nWhen your first year can you recap the ... project how you got started on that what you learned and how it's kind of got its hooks into you are all these years later\nSo I I never had a dog in the fight or I was working for a technology company I was getting ready to retire and raise a couple of kids and\nTo the guys I was working with the super wealthy came to me and they sent me in this room and they told the story that independently without knowing each other when they were kids they had a big for the encounter in the mountains of the fear of\nAnd they found each other later in business and you know we're sort of set a coincidence I started talking about Bigfoot and they've found each other and and were shocked that they each had a similar encounter and they said you know if\nWe yeah Twenty years of a police officer ... years investigating an HR you're the guy really to give it that independent look will finance it you go about it at your own pace you know your kids to raise that\nHelp us out with this we really we really want to find out and initially said no and they kept coming back coming back and they said at your own pace you can do it\nSo I I Wonder about looking for an area that had a few things first of all I wanted Internet I needed a hotel and I knew that there was Native American history with the topic that ran deep and I needed it within say six to eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Los Gatos California\nAnd I coordinate on the area to ... which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek where the Paterson given one film was made sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring this together and then I went up there and make contact with the group of police that a police background I approach them and I said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me I'm not going to I'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth\nAnd every witness to come forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that there would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury [noise]\nThe reality is when you sit\nWith a scientist who reads that science behind the paper [noise] they know that\nThose hundred and ten ... tell a story that phenomenal\nWhen we come back we're going to get into that a little bit more and then jump into specifics from ... new book big foot Wildman and giants ease Harry noon and night night I mean big what

I don't know anybody that's\nClaimed to have studied them in the wild walking into the wilderness and found a spot and studied them year after year\nSo they have intelligence that's quite a bit different than the average animal quote unquote that you see in the woods\nAnd even the animals on the ape gorilla et cetera side of the equation totally different they they act different they walk different they look different\nAnd one thing that everyone has to think about it's never in North America have there been any wild ape gorilla bones found ever\nBut we have how I'd while or giant human bones found and that's that you really make you think\nYou know some of the descriptions any articles uh are made me chuckle a little bit because the writers who have no familiarity with the topic of course because it's new to them they're they're explaining\nIt must have been old Fred's so and so who disappeared into the forest a couple of years ago and now he's grown hair all over his body\nThat I [laughter] I traveled with you on those and I think people are scratching\nTo bring in some rationality to an irrational observation [noise] um and the parts of the country where these things are saying you know get way way below zero it shows how Fred that decided to leave his farm going to live and that type of environment\nAnd and grow hair all over his body like that a thick long hair you mentioned in the in the clip that I was reading there from the late Seventeen hundreds you had a notation at the bottom\nThat said maybe this is what Daniel Boone saw ah I didn't see the Daniel Boone any Daniel Boone story in here other than that reference that you made but he had an encounter is a fairly famous encounter right\nThat's correct and uh I I couldn't find in our current news article about it but I saw other secondary in third level things that were written about what Daniel called I I think it was a Yahoo\nYeah and\nThe description was pretty close and I don't know it's it sure seemed possible but again if you went in to the quote unquote credible archives you're really not going to find that you have to do really deep and and find out what maybe some explorers wrote about that they heard in which he encountered so\nBut again and tribal Bigfoot I've written about things where an explorer from the Watergate church\nWas coming across country on a horse\nAnd he wrote in his explore notes\nThat this thing came up to him while he's on his horse and looked him I I actually spoke to him large hairy bypass said he'd never seen before that matched the description of a wild man or a big foot and it came from the archives with ... church butter de saint church and it's in there so\nTo say that these things happen happen ridiculous\nOr the first entry the oldest entry comes to us from Jacques ballet you wrote about it and have a clip from\nSeptember Seventeen sixteen eighty it was a reported in his book wonder in the sky a large black wild like mass landed in a field releasing a huge error covered being that we're seeing briefly and disappeared now that's the kind of thing that will drive\nUm big foot people who think it's an ape just crazy\n[laughter] you know I I'm not sure how many people listening actually bought a ... book on or\nAbout this but when I was going through it I I like to think I'm a mile wide and an inch deep I like to read about different things that could be associated with topics I'm doing research on and what I read this summer fell over and said wow I don't think anybody's ever heard of this\nAnd uh his book which was a Kickstarter project right um which kind of did the same thing with the UFO topic that I did on this big topic it was a stronger I again I don't think a lot of people want to hear that\nYeah I I uh I was part of that project and um and supported it and it's a tremendous book and people can find it anywhere they should check it out we're talking with Dave ... about his latest work big foot Wildman and giants archive articles sixteen a de de Nineteen twenty two\nGreat stuff packed into here we're going to take a short break and come back and sometime in the next hour I'll open up the phone lines you can join the conversation from big foot so little feet here taking us into the break with a song from waiting for Columbus\nMostly not hamper twenty and one of my family county's only\nSeven seven saddens us out on nothing hours and he's in Austin the muscles in my late\n... early ... handles on them as the sanctions and they all can you\nDo for the building that dream home\nNow is the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options considering find use alone then you write for\nCall ... or ...\n... you can read his number one seven in ...

I don't remember where it is in the in the book but\nThere was a an incident where somebody's camp fire their camp kept being messed with while they're out in the woods somewhere\nSo they they waited in a work in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures that came it was one or two they were short they were like\nFibers five or six feet tall not to ten or twelve feet tall but covered with hair and they were just signed up playing with fire\nSo think about\nUm let's say a twelve year old kid who doesn't have much association with fire not a grown adult comes into the fire is playing with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California\nUh I think from the mid Eighteen hundreds\nAnd I think it was a hunter that knew something was messing around but he couldn't figure it out so he waited on originally and they came in and he saw this\nAnd the um it's not unusual that hunters and campers and other things in the woods have seen these things do an unusual things other times or they're seen them awake playing like kids in the water um it's\nAgain the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes match proportionally a smaller Bigfoot you think well must be a young kid\nThe attitudes are different in different reports to a generally not hostile shy want to get away from people when they encounter him but they can be pretty nasty when provoked a there's a phenomenon it's reported in several these clubs where they throw rocks big rocks that humans disorder to chase them off\nA and there's one report I think it's I I forget where it is in the book I'll have to look for a of a big but that's supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOh it was ... and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because who side how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older articles or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to those conclusions\nAnd I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but\nIn the near term I never found a big foot nowadays that's\nConclusively killed anybody and when I started writing the missing for one one books\nThere's a lot of erroneous information that I have associated this topic on big for with missing for one one I never have I've never stayed at that I thought that was involved in these things [noise]\nWhy because I've never read a credible article implying that they did and\nSince the four one one books came out all of a sudden people have started saying oh yeah you know this campsite these campers were killed this was happening and I get these once a year or say and every time I followed up I find that it's not a credible source it never happened yet the myth\nKeep perpetuating on the Internet and they're not true and\nSome people believe all you know it's a cover up\nBut as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies\nOf people do not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut it's never going to happen they will tell the truth and you're the feds aren't going to be able to keep 'em clamped up\nSo when you hear these stories all these campers were killed by something really mysterious if it was happening I'd hear about it from these guys and they say half the time they say it never happened it's a completely phony story so\nAnd imagine what your emails or like but I get a ... ah just because people know that we know each other or why doesn't ... go ahead and admitted big with its kidnapping people\nAnd I I wouldn't have to say this a day there are some accounts in this book these newspaper clippings where there are references to these huge Wildman carrying all women and children\nYou know there was never any names attached to it though you know no no and that's a that's\nThe tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting carried off who\nShot and why aren't the name there and if somebody's writing about it and say it\nSeems to be a there are instances where in in these accounts where\nA humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at these animals are not only did they described them as a I think it's it's gay they describe ... gay and I don't think it's in the context of gay as we used the term these days but gay humor is what they said like a friendly\nAnd the number of times I have heard a hunter say there's no way I could shoot it it looked to him and it ... I I have never heard of a hunter say oh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot it in the head or it it looked like an animal I've not heard that and\nI've heard the human side of it from a fireman a policeman credible credible sources that continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history\nOr so there's something to this they got gotta skew where they said they started looking like him or apes and animals and\nAs you know Georgia's this segment of the big foot world that wants to go out and kill one\nAnd I don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one may be some kind of over loaded on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill them it's not going to happen\nBack in time and almost all of them believe that they came from the stars\nWell there are an awful lot of associations between these creatures being cited in in proximity to UFOs and it makes everyone uncomfortable the big put people to die hard don't like it\nThe UFO diehards like it even less or they they're not comfortable with that at all but you have to follow it where it leads and you know I I don't have a conviction on it either I don't know what these things are I don't know what you up those are where they're from\nBut um there was enough cases over the centuries and a lot more of them now thanks to this new book you can't ignore it I thought the interest there was a couple of stories clippings where there are reputable witnesses who say they saw these creatures are engaging with cow's milking cows\nSo this is the part that really really unusual several years ago one of my best friends their parents on a dairy farm [noise] and I started talking to him about this and I said you know I I keep reading that\nThey may be milking cows you know what do you think about that because you know I'm going to talk to my parents [noise] so they own a huge target for anyone out there and talk to them in this oh I think he's eight years old this guy's dad and he looked at him and he said you know\nEvery once in awhile Mike how will come back from nowhere completely though\nHe goes I don't understand it [laughter] then\nThe same man told him he says you know every once in a while I'm On the far corner my property something tells me don't turn around get back on the horse or get back on my TV and all the [noise] and he does\nAnd then the man said well you know every once in a while I found a bucket way out in the corner of the property got their\nSo called dogs [laughter] I think when you get the trust of some of these dairy farmers way out in the middle they are going to tell you the same thing 'cause I've heard it many times\nUm you know there are some funny stories I they're not in this book but I've recalled I think you and I have talked about before about big what are what they eat and they'll you know they're kind of particular this image of a big foot ... a cow a sticks in my head but I mean they've been known to eat a lot of berries and\nDifferent kinds of fruit um do they eat meat as far as you know\nAccording to the tribal people who are seen him take dear sir or they're an omnivore\nAnd many times when the natives\nAre in the middle of the woods hurting themselves they'll come across a deer that stuck up on a tree and like a two hundred and fifty pounds here

I Want everyone to think about what was the percentage of people in the wilderness in Nineteen sixty seven that had the ability to take a film\nOf anything while they were in the wilderness it was minute\nNow think about today nobody has ever come close\nTo taking video or film of a ... foot in the wilderness for a minute and a half like they got on that PG film yet today there's probably close to a hundred percent of everybody in the wilderness carrying a smartphone which has the ability to catch that\nSo I Want everyone to understand that I Do believe that Paterson film is real why haven't we caught this by to on film and that quality of a location and segment like they did in sixty seven\nThere was something phenomenal about that event that caused that female big foot to stay there because every other time they immediately run they won't look at the camera like this when did they won't hang around and linger knowing that people are watching them something unusual happened\nWell again not to take everything back your skin Walker day but it did the comparison is a pretty clear is that ... there was a loose if there are cameras all over the place\nAnd if you uh had activity in one area and set a camera that would move somewhere else and it goes back to sort of the question that one of the callers asked about drones say you had a drone that had heat seeking technology it

Indianapolis the true story of the worst disaster in us naval history the two authors are Sarah ... and a claim documentary filmmaker one of the world's leading experts on the USS Indianapolis she became obsessed with the story at the age of Thirteen\nAnd over the next two decades she met and interviewed one hundred and seven of the ships survivors she produced an award winning documentary film about the disaster\nAnd a has a lot of other research still researching this story Lynn Vincent is the number one New York times best selling writer of eleven non fiction books with more than sixteen million copies in print\nShe's a veteran journalist and author of more than a thousand articles has done investigative pieces that have been cited before Congress and the U.S Supreme Court\nI'm Sarah and Lynn welcome to the program or I Am blown away by your book grey tabby here\nFrom dark\nSarah I'd like to start with you how did you get hooked on this story at age Thirteen or most teenagers at Thirteen or not reading about the USS Indianapolis\nActually with a documentary that I thought I was watching it with my dad was about the core and they reduced the story of the ship to align which was the ship the current the bomb and suck [laughter]\nAnd I had to know more about it and so you know at the time there was no Google or anything like that so I actually had to go to the library [laughter]\nImagine that and you know they're looking to what was available at the library I still find anything somebody's got to tell the story you know from what I did learn about it it was very interesting and I think there was a lot of mystery surrounding it though I\nKnow I thought out what I could but you know someone will tell this story before I'm old enough to do it\nAnd yeah FlashForward graduated from college and [noise] well no one told the story in the right way\nSo I sought out the survivor and found Murphy who is the chairman of the survivors organization at the time and he invited me to a reunion and that's where I actually got to meet the man who survived Indianapolis and I mean yeah I was [noise]\nKid who was a meeting her heroes for the first time and they exceeded all expectations and they took me and kind of became like family so you know they have a couple of years later after I had to spend time with them and visited them at their homes\nThey asked me to be their story teller and that kind of the cliff notes version of it [noise]\nAnd when for you how did you uh hook up with zero on working on this project you've done so many other books I I Would imagine that being able to write the true story and correct\nWide and greet misperceptions a and strike a blow for justice for the for some of the key characters would be um an amazing draw for you\nWell it was a very exciting project for me the way I got involved was I\nHad actually been praying I'm I Do pray about my work and I had been praying to\nHave\nAn opportunity to work on an iconic for over two stories and all of a sudden in two thousand eleven out of the blue I get this email from this young filmmaker named Sarah Vladeck well what there it didn't say about her journey with Indianapolis with that\nI'm being Indianapolis a storyteller she wanted to render the story as his screenplay and she actually did that she wrote a an eight part miniseries than she pitched it to a major production company and they said hey this is the best thing we've seen since than to brothers\nBut we only base mini series on foot\nSo you're going to need to write a book I fall she and a screenwriter I don't know how to write stuff though for your family and friends she reached out and and make contact with me\nAnd um she didn't know number one that I'm a navy veteran she didn't know that I had been praying for an opportunity to do a story says like this one\nUm [noise] and\nMy only problem was is that all she was wanting was advice and I wanted to help her write the book [laughter] so uh my joke is is that I had to figure out how to manipulate or into letting helper but uh eventually over the course of\nSeveral months we finally met and then uh\nWe agreed to work on it together and we didn't really get started in earnest until twenty four and um and then when we did it I guess the project tickets and a half years\nTo Syria where you are on a campaign to right or wrong that the story had been wrong that a lot of the people who were key players had been treated unfairly is that how you started or you didn't know about that when you started\nI didn't you know I I knew a small part of that um that was\nDefinitely part of what I wanted to tell but really I mean the major objective of it was to tell the whole story of this ship you know she'd been reduced to\nA sinking story or shark story\nAnd no one knew she was this incredible ship that admiral sprints commanded you know most of the Pacific war and the campaign that he participated in from her deck or that Roosevelt took her on the first cruise\nYou know us acting president ever left the country on and so there was so much more like well you know everyone's got to know what an incredible shift this was in what she did a besides being sent [noise]\nBut I'll tell you grab me ... my father was a at ... he drove a landing craft from those ships took us troops on the shores so of course you know the fact that they you know was was involved in those complex grab my attention I'm imagining him being there and some of the scenes that you describe\nI'm Lynn what do we start with you describe in a

NATO\nAnd everything and we tried to present the Japanese point of view in a sympathetic way I'm meaning that they were acting\nOut of there since their conscience conviction and so um we were able to make great ... um\nWell it was it and then more for that we've published after the war who first published in Nineteen fifty two and a Japanese language and it was later published by Henry Holt and the safety uh here in America in English\nAnd it was really an examination of Japanese submarine warfare in World War two but written from men or ... point of view and there was a chapter on it the voted in Indianapolis\nThat because we were looking at the larger Pacific War in the end of the of World War two in general we were able to really develop his personality a lot he was the commander who cared for his men he was the commander who was very very frustrated with the state of technology on Japanese that Marines and\nRarely against protocol at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic top down military um he went around saying on doors after ... for radar and more technology for his that marine because\nAnd so they were always in fear\nAnd one of those harrowing stories was where you know there were\nAbout Fifteen men on a floater net and those are the kinds of nets that had the cork pieces throughout the net to keep it afloat and men were spread out on this and just this huge frenzy of sharks attacked and there was nothing left\nAnd so reports like this were coming in that you know and even all the way until rescue I mean part of the rescuers that counts because by the time that there are rescue arrived the men were really in ... they were able to tell or know what was happening by that point in the story but\nYou know the rescuers are reporting that they're fighting off sharks are literally punching sharks in the face to be able to pull men bored\nBecause the shark attacks increased as the I guess [laughter] you know I don't know how much sharks realized things but they said it seemed as they were pulling the men from the water the shirts um the attacks increased and you know this is\nI Can't imagine how horrifying that would be I think saying one shark would give me a heart attack and imagine hundreds of them you know one of the sailors reported they were so sick they could walk on their back you know from shark to shark that we're underneath them just swimming there they\nCould stand on them there's one account you have a sailor you sort of go becoming delirious and he's looking down the trucks they go oh there's food I'll just reached out and grabs a boot right\nMhm [noise] yeah I'm a young ... and by the name of John wolf than he actually took his socks off\nAnd thinking he was gonna wiggling toes as bait to learn the sharks and catch one [laughter] and then you know he kind of came to a sense is that the last minute and realized oh this is probably not a good idea but you know he was\nNearly out of his head at this point and put a sock back on quickly and managed to stay safe you know so they\nWere doing the worst thing [laughter]\nSo some of the worst effects Lynn are happened to those people who drink the water they just went completely crazy\nYeah that was really chilling to me because you know here\nYou know if you can imagine they're they're on their ship ah the everyone knows it's almost the end of the war and they were having this leisurely a sale they think across the Philippines the um and then you know the next thing they know they're trying to survive this horrible ordeal these these young sailors who were just\nSame pranks on each other the day before and then by the second day forty eight hours then now we were talking about the hoarding of water but it's Sara mentioned there were only a sixteen rap\nBetween there were there were four groups within three groups that there were four groups of four rap or three groups that format in any case\nThere were four groups of four raft but then the one group split apart on the second day okay that's\nRight so that there were so any water that was available with only available on the raft and so there were only about forty men among all these hundreds and hundreds of men who had any water at all and so by you know second day in and the third day and they\nWere starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so\nThere were than men who absolutely knew not to drink the salt water no matter how they're the they got that there were others\nWho although they knew that the sun and the exposure and the de hydration itself with perversely causing them to lose their faculties lose their ability to reason\nThat feminine them to come to the idea that they can train them so out of the water and so you see one sailor holding up the torn piece of his shirt\nA while the other one poured the water through it into the into his mouth and thinking that that would drain the salt out well of course that didn't and then others when you know take small heard is that the water\nI'm hoping that no one would see them and talk and out of it but then eventually they would just begin gulping it like they were hoping it out of a mountain stream\nAnd what happened with this is a condition called ... and\nBought that full bird\nBlood cells ... from the brain um brain short circuit just like when a tree branch falls on a high voltage line and they would just go out of their heads and um they die very horrible deaths from drinking the water\nYou know you have the the Japanese commander who decides oh let's get outta here because he figures there's no way the ship is here by itself something else has to be around you that or it was out of sight all of a sudden and he thinks oh it must have gone away or\nYou couldn't imagine I guess it immediately that it'd sunk that quickly so he leaves I'm which is I guess fortunate because they could have surfaced and finished them off\nYou have a ... pilot who ends up testifying at the court marshal later or an American pilot who saw what he thought was a battle he ended up telling somebody about it but no one paid attention uh we got to go to a break in about a minute maybe a ... survey you want to talk about that guy\nYeah there was a gentleman by the name of Richard live Francis and he was an army pilot he was transporting a general who had been wounded and you know that the generals up in the cockpit with him and it's a late night patrol you know it's just after midnight\nAnd they see this you know kind of explosion coming from below and\nThere's no reports coming in saying that there is any kind of enemy action do you think well maybe this is drills or something of that nature but yeah I guess at the end kind of out of sorts for him so he said well you know report it and he did actually try to report it a couple of times\nAnd yeah the army side of things that will let the navy do whatever they're doing just ignore it\nAnd he still want to hear a navy personnel at Guam I Believe [laughter]\nYou know hey I saw this should anyone look into it and they said no there's nothing reported in that area don't worry about it\nAnd so you know there's actually more to the story with that where you know they his son who you know this gentleman ritual of Francis have passed away but his son carries on a story and you know there\nHe actually had diary entries of the time and coordinate the one he saw this and it did line up with it but he didn't find out and tell a few days after when were released about it that he would\nWe're talking with Linda ... about
