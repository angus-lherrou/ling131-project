the America was Sarah tactic radio surgery for lung cancers for ... for cancerous of travel to the lungs\nFirst in America when every doctor in America and every hospital in\nEvery facility thought standard she was okay\nOne doctor stood up and said no it's not okay there's a lot of people suffering and I told you even in this hour\nAbout that man with the cancer and the sacred left in pain I told you about the woman who had no car some of the bladder she was being told she had to remove the bladder\nAnd now this man I told you about the men from Israel with stage four gastric cancer in remission should get a sense that there's a lot of interesting and good things happening at Thirteen eighty four Broadway where we see patients with new\nAnd recurrent cancers even if\nPrior chemo or radiation or surgery didn't work or isn't tolerated her as an wanted we have lots of information to send to to give you just cause if you want at two in two choices are numbers two one two choices why

particular option and we don't sell anybody never tell anyone what to do would tell people what the options are that's what we do here at Thirteen eighty four Broadway for we treat\nNewly diagnosed and recurrent cancers most anywhere in the body with us in the bowl or the breast you name it might have such a leader in the short break we'll be right back\nEven if other cancer treatment didn't work call Dr Lederman we hit the cancer thirty eight than Broadway brain body prostate called two one two choices two and two choices most insurance is Medicare Medicaid accepted Dr Lederman first in America except no imitation\nWelcome back to the radio surgery our doctor Gilead I'm In the leading cancer prostate cancer ... first New York for ... brain radio surgery first in America\nAnd in the western hemisphere body waiting a surgery you can also call Dr lead a minute to ensure killington for free and form in Brooklyn and DVD hey Dr Lederman whereby\nWe are back and the reason we have so many shows is really to be able to provide information in education to you which we hope is a way for you to learn and get better care\nAnd to get the best possible care and keep your body intact and get the care that you want to not regret it and sticking about regrets I Want to talk about uh thirty eight year old financial man of Wall Street man who\nWas born in Bangladesh and she comes to me really with a sad\nPainful story of having sarcoma that has traveled just a year ago it was fine he was a normal thirty seven year old man\nThe year ago and he felt electric shock and pelvic pain and he went to one of the big hospitals in New York City the scam is a mass they tried to do a biopsy they missed and didn't get the answer a week later in more pain he had trouble walking\nAnd he went to one of the even bigger hospitals any of the scan and the biopsy it showed sarcoma sir comas a cancer of the connective tissue and well they told him he had to have radical surgery and they did three weeks later radical surgery on this big mess in his\nAbdomen and when the radical sorted out radical certainly is supposed to remove all the cancer right that's why they're doing the radical surgery while the radical surgery they cut the nerves to his leg so he can't walk properly they cut the muscles to the legs so he can't walk\nProperly but they didn't remove all the cancer they left cancer behind well that's not what radical surgery is supposed to do radical surgery is supposed to remove\nAll the cancer well they left the cancer behind\nAnd he's had trouble walking you could barely walk you can't lift Disney or as like since then because they cut the nerves and they cut the muscles\nAnd he's been on permanent disability ever since then and then they left cancer behind he was in the hospital for a month trying to convalescent then they gave 'em weeks and weeks of radiation weeks and weeks knowing it's or coma and knowing that tacoma's usually don't respond to standard doses of radiation\nAnd that's why we brought radio surgery to America to be able to give more intense treatment with Ninety percent success rate for SARS Columbus and other cancers higher success rates in fewer\nTreatments that's what we do but that's not what they did in the hospital they the hospital they gave 'em weeks and weeks almost two months of radiation and that doesn't work either the surgery didn't work and ... from crippled the radiation doesn't work\nAnd then the cancer just kept on growing had complications yet other complications from radiation then the cancers traveled to his lungs and they started on chemotherapy that his lungs started popping closed and he had numerous sources and they tried to help her with lungs that doesn't help either\nThen they had more abdominal pain the kids who was progressing right where it started\nIn the left side of the abdomen pelvis\nAnd the cancer is growing more of the lungs and he started more chemotherapy and he had more abdominal public paid and he had more than our conflicts and then rather than giving our products in a more conventional way they gave him the most invasive way everything that's been doing has been the most of the base of ways they open up his belly and put it up\nPump to pump pain medicines into his spine rather than to maximize\nPain medicines in a more conventional noninvasive ways that I really think of the most invasive way the most debilitating away the most difficult way the most expensive way and it hasn't worked\nNone of their treatments have more the radical surgery doesn't work the radiation doesn't work the chemo doesn't work they've been up there if he didn't work and now he's coming to me as a thirty eight year old with a tremendous paying this could barely examiner because he's got such a large mass of the abdomen he's got so much pain so much suffering and I always hear for\nOur evaluation and I evaluated him my diagnosed him and I told him what has happened to him and he's pleading with me please Dr Lederman please take my case please\nI Do not want to go back to XYZ super hospital and why does he not want to go back to super hospital where does not want to go back to the super hospital because their treatment was invasive and maybe it was great for the hospital do radical surgery is great for the hospital\nBut it's terrible for the patient when they left cancer behind then they get weeks and weeks\nTo months of radiation which is great for the hospital but it's terrible for the patient why because number one it doesn't work it's expensive it's not convenient but it didn't work\nAnd then the cancer traveled to his lungs and they had\nChemotherapy they made a therapy and that didn't work either and then he had more and more pain with cancer growing and then they put chemotherapy devices in his abdomen the most difficult way to\nTo access the most expensive way and that's not working either he's left with intractable pain and why does he come here was here to get better results of this is the work that we do every day this is exactly the work I Do when patients have cancers recurrent cancers they come here\nYou could have come here originally we could have created the whole cancer with out that invasive radical surgery we could have treated the whole cancer the servants were unable to remove the cancer because up against the bone well they knew that\nThey knew that they didn't have to leave the cancer to cut through cancer but they did they cut through the cancer and this is what they did exactly what they did here at Radio City New York we're able to non invasive treat cancers are comas and brain cancers and brain tumors lung cancers and breast cancers all non and basically\nThis is our special to you this is our work this is

they could come in and talk to the dead the only thing and I was never scary to me I mean the person was just standing there and yeah I could see his body and the gas it\nBut he was he was talking to me and uh you know there was no question but would ask the question\nOr the relative would ask the question what they want her to know and I did not have to repeat it because the goes target but they would just give me the answer and then I Would tell whoever asked the question the thing that scared me George and all of this was\nI'm definitely old enough but that back in the day they had ... and these\nYoung they did they did hire people who cried and everything else\nOn carried on they did everything but wrong the floor that scared the ... to me it wasn't the dead person that was the live

that\n[noise] no I think than the older I got the easier of course it was I think the more you do anything the easier it is and then in ... even though I've done this for so long I still learn stuff

it open fairly long if I'm doing a place like a hospital or an airport or restaurant where there are ten Fifteen twenty goes waiting to cross over\nThe county morgue um gosh there was all kinds and there and I just have to learn how to keep it open long enough\nAnd it was it was a learning thing you had to learn how to do this and it was trial and error because I really couldn't ask anybody about it and as crazy as this sounds our youngest daughter ... can do this\nAnd that she doesn't do it my way because she does not want to see the people in our eyes she just wants to hear them so everybody does it differently I think everybody has the ability it's how you develop it and how you use it\nEvery time I've talked to you you've been upbeat about everything you do have you ever been scared to death with something that is happening\n[noise] I ... this past year has been unusual and um\nI was afraid of one thing oh maybe twenty five thirty years ago that happened a a ghost actually flipped and a red handled acts in front of my face\nAnd and I wouldn't houses if I thought a ghost can kill me I Am certainly not stupid but\nI remember I was in the garage and that acts hit the concrete floor and slid into a fiberglass garage door he had no idea how loud that was when the yet\nAnd it was the three steps into the house from the attach courage and I remember sitting on the top sitting down and going maryann what are you doing here [noise]\nAnd then it dawned on me knock it off because of all I'm going to do is give them more energy\nI Can't walk into a house and be afraid because that's what they don't eat they don't sleep they need human energy I'm not going to feed them\nAnd I ... and the bottom line is your dead nominal live I've got a step over you bud and you know I Can't grab throw you into the light it still free will\nBut you're gonna leave this house one way or the other and now that I'm older you know when I was fourteen Twenty one twenty five telling a

not how it's done\nI did that way and I sit there on friday night and watch it and they do it anyway [laughter] yeah yeah like oh my gosh and then people\nCall me and they'd say why did you let them do that if like I did they did it on\nThere and they knew better right course they will love would call me up to date because she always got her her scripts you know like three days before the new one right when she was good with you she like\nYeah and she would call me up and she'd go you should see what they're having\nMe do oh why oh no\n[laughter] but yeah no and she she knew that it was the first half hour was usually over the top the second half hour they seem to bring it back down a little bit but it got the information out there even if it wasn't as hokey as they made and\nDr James van Prague nuts\nWell no because he couldn't see the ones that they were filming\nWhat do you mean talking about why not it looks so we're earth phones bears like the ones I owe\nSo no he was a consultant on the show to are also but he did and uh but he really couldn't help set the stage because he really didn't know exactly what the heck they were going to do it's like when we were in one of the studios I Know\nWe're doing a um\n[noise] a something for one of the talking head magazines I don't know which one it was and we came around the corner and there was a\nMissed Barbara stand with standing there [noise] and I I looked at her and I in my mind went\nTotally blank all I could remember was Victoria ... from the ... ...\n... and she was classic actually\nAll while and she was a little clip of a thing she was so tiny and so and I'm I'm starring because it's like oh my gosh\nAnd uh and she was there a pound and she was so disgusted the way the movies were being made now the way the studios were acting\nAnd she says none of this would have been allowed in James made the mistake of some one of the cameraman said who is that [noise] and James Mates mistake of saying some old time movie actor\nOh no oh yeah I mean you know better than that of\nCourse he did but I think he was just let's get this you know let's keep going\nI literally I I had to talk her into bloody me make the white light and go into it and I she says I got to keep things going here and I said and how's that going for you is anybody listening to you and she just looked at me and I says and how many people have you talked to since you've been dead\nAnd she just looked at me I said you have no idea how much better you can do if you went into the light\nAnd she said\nHuh and I said have you talked to other people live people she said no and I said so do you think I'm telling you the truth she said yeah go ahead and make it she says I'll go but you show up and talk about an inch you went in the light so\nI Hope so one of the people that when I get up there she screams\nDo you remember that movie pulled guys in the the little ... little lady kept by little I don't go home I won't want why did she say that\nI don't know I I had no idea I\nI thought that they possessed or tricked or something sounds the way it changed your personality\nOr so I Know they they turned it on a dime I didn't understand why they did it it's like when he goes whisper was being shocked for somebody to buy it out there in LA and uh the person that would take me around took me to this this house of a couple of producers that had a ghost in their house\nAnd sell it turned out that they knew who the ghost was which is\nActually sort of unusual because usually the person doesn't know they don't go right\nAnd so and I guess he thought it was really important he says to me while I was person on the ... whore house he says and and uh and I helped you know we work on that\nAnd I looked at him and I sort of

the language or the ...\nYeah yeah if I was angry at five and\nI Want I wouldn't use I wouldn't use it try and try to stay away from ...\n... yeah but I mean could that cost a curse on somebody's life Fifteen Years later you know maybe\nIt depends on how powerful the individual is\nOkay and then um as far as uh uh uh I don't know what it on the idea of energies shopping or something I've noticed that ah in myself when I feel kinda awkward and uncomfortable or around people if I think of myself as sort of a White House generating not visible light but\nThen for red warm you know and you're not supposed to draw attention to myself it calms me down and I think it makes other people feel better too\nI think so too I'm reading a book on Frank Sinatra and you talk about energy this guy\nEither way either ... direction I mean he was on or off\nWhen he was on a lot of people love to be around him when he was off a lot of people wanting to be away\nFrom it was amazing how that kind of energy works both ways positive negative next up we're going to rolling in Springfield, Ohio we used to the Rockies hey roll and thanks for calling\nMorning our way to day\nWe are fine thank you hope you are to\nOff Yes sir I had a weird experience at a local\nLike I'm not far from where I live probably within an hour\nHas friends come over the person I worked with and said hey ah or going up to the lake you want to go and not a well I had just had a scan acts that my name was all swelled up and I dislocated\nIt I thought well now he goes well you might as well get up and\nMove around on others as otherwise it's just a hot stove up so I have talked me into it I went and uh like I said it was about\nAn hour away and we got up that direction and\nHung out with people for a little while and uh they all wanted to go to a bar probably I don't know maybe\nAnother thirty miles from where we were there and uh I was like whatever you know I got to be late afternoon but time and the early evening and a wintertime\nAnd we got out there and I got this real strange feeling after I got into this bar a they knew people there I didn't know anybody other than who I drive with\nAnd it was just weird it felt like everybody in there that was in that bar we're focused on me I didn't understand\nWhy at the time you know and I thought well what the heck ... about\nLike a bar full of empires from something\nHere exactly as like well I mean I felt like a a lamb or the slaughter right and sign up on a rope or something yeah\nAnd and I I got real uncomfortable and I told him I said hey look I'm not feeling good I I Need to go so they they agreed and and we left that place and then they went to this other place that way out in the country and it was an old I mean\nThis was an old dad gummed CD bar\nYeah and I went in there with them\nAnd to this place and it was a bunch of old people that there again I felt that hard enough and the air\nAnd I told him I said hey look I'm all just go sit out the car\nBut these these folks who brought you there they felt comfortable right\nOh well I've known them because I worked with him um and ah yeah they're to me it didn't you know I didn't feel any threat from them it was just in the places that I attended they know where they took me\nAnd I'm like I said it ended up being a night of heavy snow and it ended up being a level three snow warning which means that you're not even supposed to be out\nSo we're out in the country after I go out back to the second bar after I go out and sit in the car and they finally decided well come on let's go well we go down the road a little bit and next thing you know\nA war off on the farm and the caller won't move forward or backward guards there was like six or seven of us in the car and uh they tried to push and couldn't get no no moment um so they decided they were going to walk up to this house and see if I could get some help\nOn the house was completely dark and you know I sat in the car I couldn't walk so I was I was I was stuck no matter what on there is no way I could run away do anything\nAnd I think that was you know part of what people were sensing when I was there you know in those places earlier in the evening\nAnd the more time went on time went on I started getting nervous around these people and and so I just sat there to myself and the only thing I could think to do was uh are farther art in heaven hallowed be thy name\nLeaders are doing that under my in my mind over and over and over reciting the Lord's Prayer and it was weird because those guys are this one girl that was what this new that I went up her where\nShe looked at me and I was an outer ring a word she says are you pray him and I says yeah and she goes we better\nShe knew what was going on\nI was like oh my goodness oh about ten minutes later here come the people at walk up to the house and says any luck you know the telephone nope instead and I was like wow that was weird so they get in the car started up and pull out with no problem\nLike I didn't understand that we're in a car\nPulled out of the bomb where we were stuck\nNow at any point did they try to hurt you or anything\nNo no but you know I just kept I just kept that that thought it was the lord and Jesus in my heart\nWhich we have these dreams Myers about\nNothing is going to be strong\nAnd then the the like it's in me\nWhat do you think that ... role in what do you think their game was what were they trying to do\nA lot I don't know maybe trying to um where they were somebody into um where they're going to kill you [laughter] I don't think so\nNo I don't I don't think so but I think they may have been trying to um when me over somehow or another 'em\nLike they wanted your soul\nIt was weird I I had talked\nTo this only to my therapist one other time but I definitely felt an odd present I'm I'm very I'm intuitive anyway and uh it just something that struck me as odd\nI Hope you didn't hang around with them any other time [noise]\nUh no actually you know I don't you run into one of them since then and uh they're still around but I'm a while it was where you\nGotta you gotta be careful

Tibetan book or the dead the understanding of being aware of the reality of dash\nAnd living each moment as if it were your last moment in a way or the only moment here's a useful way of re calibrating your mind and so it's a part of reality it's nothing to be afraid of\n'em it's not all that pleasant to think about it either but it's just part of the existential reality of being human
