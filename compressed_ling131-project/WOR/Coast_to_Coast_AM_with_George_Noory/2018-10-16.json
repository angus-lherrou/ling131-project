hospital was treated hit back actually after hashing\nI'm walking I get him to be steady ... um that they're kind of under the opinion that you know in New York hospitals couldn't help then how can

Seattle, Washington these family said he was only sixty five years old also though he was a heavy contributor to city search for extraterrestrial intelligence ... from city with us this is disappointing and sad so\nIt is most definitely that yeah he was a well he was very instrumental\nIn Nineteen Ninety three when Congress kill the NASA SETI program he was one of four high tech figures that stepped in with the money to keep going and that was Paul Allen of course but a bill Hewlett David Packard and Gordon Moore and those are all familiar names\nFor anybody who's tuned into

you know that there were big big chunks of time where he wasn't but he was interested he you know he was interested in any kind of new discovery that could be made\nThanks to new technology he saw technology which is of course the way he made his fortune he saw it as a you know the facilitating if you will fuel for new discovery and I think that's why I got interested in SETI\nWould it be amazing so that uh if you get that signal that you've been looking for with all the other groups from city that uh you dedicated to pull out\nHis well his name is on the telescope into maybe we should

be an incredibly busy month for space 'cause that'll be placing some thirty of these small cube set satellites about the size of a shoe box into space\nAnd one of them George that stands out in my mind is a little space craft cold the orbital reflect or get a little ... it's a small shoe box sized satellite which will then unfurl itself in space looking like about maybe the size of a length of to school buses\nAnd it'll be maybe as like a big long reflective sword in the sky it will be visible in the night sky for weeks but here's the interesting thing about this George which actually created by an artist named ...\nOf the museum of art so now we're going to be saying art in space and not only of course in the future when we see individuals like artist pig in that first manned trip around the moon which sucks\nBut George you got to see as many people that amazing launch a vet SpaceX rocket itself\nOh it was great it was gorgeous\nTo unfortunately I missed it but here's the scope

is what they say at least eight sometimes can change on Halloween anything October the thirty first\nThey're eight pm Pacific daylight time and of course people along the California coast you know exactly where to go because there's many of these public viewing areas\nBut maybe this one will not be a spectacular because you need that near sunset launch\nBut George going back quickly to Florida we find out people are asking what are we going to have the next big Falcon Heavy launch now on the schedule it shows November the thirtieth at seven PM but that would be great but many space scientists are saying realistically will have to push this back to march twenty nine fame\nAnd finally in the lives sky don't forget folks the moon coming to the first quarter rather bought the

we can use much more because our mind power is George is is like an iceberg with Ninety percent lying hidden beneath the surface hidden but it's still\nThere and it's all similarly massive and I I Try to teach people how to activate that how ... what he's consciousness\nAnd I call eats all week called the hidden Ninety percent of our our mind power this self conscious I don't know you probably ... million times about the subconscious\nMind your conscious he's like a sub continent off let's say Alexander's days there's vast treasure house waiting to be explored and utilize\nAnd our subconscious

[noise]\nAnd um I could hardly see the players\nAnd they the map started England played Scotland but I heard the match in my headphones and then suddenly I hear that Gary McAllister who was the ... you know the guy who strike who puts in goals most [noise]\nGet the penalty which means that Ninety percent there would score Scotland would score a goal and from the heavy ... believe it or not I move the bone away from his foot\nOff the ball down ice cream\nIn the helicopter one two three move and the bold moves away this has been documented by the BBC filmed\nAnd if you get on my Web site go

to coast Mitch Horwitz with us or one of today's most widely known voices of spirituality Mitch is also an award winning historian longtime friend the coast to coast am of courts and Mitch is a very popular voice of audio books as well his latest the miracle club Mitch welcome back\nMuch George great to be here I always a pleasure my friend what you've been up to these days well\nA today is the launch day of the miracle club which is very exciting for me because it's probably the first book I've written that is strictly practical that goes into techniques and methods and ah it's a big bridge that I've cross with this book and I'm very grateful to have the chance to talk to the coast family about it\nIt's a great title to by the way the miracle club it sounds like a movie already\n[laughter] you know it was a group of a cult explores here in New York City in the nineteenth century and they were dedicated to exploring everything just like you do on your show and I really wanted to revive the spirit of that original group\nOr their motto was try that that just one more try and that's really been my informal motto throughout my whole life so I use the term in tribute to them\nHow many members of that club that was probably about five of them they were just a little group outside of Manhattan and Eighteen Seventy five while we're experimenting\nWith San says and medium ship and talking to the dead end table rapping and so on they weren't around for very long but they formed the nucleus of a much larger and more influential group that the esophageal society which is still around today and which is probably responsible for the whole revolution and alternative spirituality\nThat is amazing too because during that era the Eighteen hundreds it seems like the dabbling in the paranormal was different than today Mitch yeah and they really took it seriously didn't they\nVery seriously and they had the spirit of childlike wonder I mean they were delving into mysterious things than they were looking into some dark places\nBut they were doing it with this offensive just asking themselves what is out there how can we understand life you know it was a period of time when a Darwinism was in the attendance and people were starting to think maybe we've been wrong about\nGod and spirits and the invisible world and these people said listen we don't want to throw science out we embrace science but we want to use science to try to experiment with whether we can detect things about the invisible world\nThomas Edison believe it or not was a member of this original group and he talked about wanting to construct a machine that can help people talk to the dead it's not clear whether edits and ultimately did that but he and a major general Adnan Doubleday uh we're both early members\nThat's amazing now tell us a little bit about the book the ... club and and because it's also a practical guide book isn't it\nIt really is you know for many years I've written\nAnd I've been on the show talking about alternative spiritual history the history of the occult but I've always also considered myself a believing historian I experiment with the ideas and the methods and approaches that I write about and I wanted to take the opportunity\nTo write about the things that I've tried myself I Believe very strongly in the powers of the mind I Believe that thoughts are cause of death I Believe that if you walk around with a deeply held emotionally charged mental picture that is going to affect what happens to\nYou and you can use that and there are reasons for this\nAnd I wanted to write a book that would give people concrete hands on math\nIs what do you think a miracle is Mitch\nA miracle very simply put is something that is a radical departure from all natural expectation and occurrence that breaks away from everything that you could naturally and reasonably expect to arise\nFrom circumstances and I've experienced\nMiracles in my own life the very fact that you and I are talking you know I didn't start reading my own books until I was into middle age I Am currently fifty two years old and my career did not take off until I was in my forties and that didn't happen by accident there was a mental picturing there was a visualization\nWas an affirmation as\nWell as a lot of sweat equity but I Do believe if you can find a miracle has a radical departure from circumstance miracles do occur today\nHence the subtitle of the book which is how thoughts become reality and you're you're very strong believer in that aren't you\nI really am and you know it's funny if you actually take a look at your life sometimes there is a long interval sometimes there is a long gestation period between a fought in the event but if if if listeners really sit back and survey their lives\nThey will find an uncanny ... grew in sea between things that they've thought about and things that have happened to them\nMitch have you found that people who dabble with the dark side tend to do some of ... is this similar things that the positive people do but that's something always goes awry for them\nWell it's an interesting question you know when we face these ethical questions of how to use our powers\nAll the time in life you know a person could be completely materialist he or she could be an atheist and they still face ethical questions\nEvery single day about whether they're treating other people fairly and honorably if you take seriously as I Do that our minds have these extra physical capacities that responsibility becomes all the more that responsibility becomes that much stronger my contention is that\nHowever we may feel buffet by the winds and currents of life we are much more powerful than we think we are we have a hand in advance mentally and and often shows up in ways that we don't suspect\nSo my messages also be careful be careful because what you're thinking about absolutely has a practical dimension on your life and on the lives\nI had already Geller on before you came on and he's he was in Israel and of course great mental list\nAnd it was telling us the story and how he was commissioned to help the Brits in a soccer match against Scotland and over the stadium they put him in a helicopter and he was supposed to influence\nThe ball and and I guess when the when the Scottish kicker was going to the ball or a mentally moved up and the guy missed it or something like\nThat [laughter] now here's a story about or he's an old or a family friend and he was over at the house hold up my brother in law I've and when I was Fifteen Years old\nAnd I've and expressed all kinds of skepticism and er he said to him do me a favor arrive and go into your bedroom and draw a picture and so I haven't went in his bedroom drew a picture came out and said\nYou drew a house and I was shocked and said that's absolutely true\n[laughter] I Know we had gr Mitchell delayed astronaut when he was on our program was talking about a tie class episode yet at NASA tie class\nAnd it ... or or type pin\nAnd he lost and you couldn't find it and he was telling me about it in and out of the sky just out of nowhere they heard upping and it was the tight class that that fell on the ground and came out of nowhere the other part of it the part that class ... into the the pointed at the end of it\nYeah was in ... ice cream [laughter] yellow\nSwallowed it I mean it's amazing these are living there for that [laughter]\nI was just amazing but back to these miracles and when we take calls next hour I'd like for people to share miracle stories with you Mitch if we can but\nBack to the dark side of it and I don't want to dabble in the dark in too much but nothing too but you know people dabble in the dark side the curse of other people they put ... on other people\nAnd then a lot of cases those things happen to these people you know how how come than the dark side has that kind of power\n[noise] well it represents something that's in us you know we we we we are being of of of a broad spectrum\nAnd my contention is that thoughts are ... and whether you are using your thoughts through spell or whether you're using your thoughts through a ritual or whether you are projecting thoughts at other people\nSomething's going to happen there is going to be some effect however one of my favorite teachers metal God or to grade teacher in the mind power tradition\nTeaches that the only way that you can project negatives spell or thought on to another person\nIs if that person could wish the same thing for someone else is if that person could wish the same thing for someone else if he or she could not get rebounds to use so in a certain sense well we grew up calling the golden rule is protection\nAgainst evil forces and I want people to listen to that very carefully because we're apt to overlook familiar things we're apt to overlook simple things\nIf you are concerned about negative forces in your life the golden rule can serve as an enormous source of protection there was an esoteric and a cult dimension to the golden rule that we don't always appreciate\nWell that's absolutely true now why do our thoughts shape the reality of what happens\nThis is my contention in the book and I felt they really had to put myself out there and come up with a theory of positive thinking I'm going to be very brief about it across all kinds of scientists from cyclical research to quantify the arising we have made the determination over the past eight years\n[noise] you know it was funny I had written a history of the positive mind moving a couple of years ago called one simple idea and I began to realize\nEvery chapter that I wrote every person who I talked about in the book I was using their methods I was road testing these things myself\nAnd I thought to myself look if I'm experimenting with these methods myself and that's what's driving my historical research why am I right about the methods sweater and I write about the steps what am I right about the techniques and it was a big step because a lot of historians are afraid to an mask themselves\nAs believers and what they write about but I've never been afraid to do that and I just really wanted to share with readers the actual hands on things I Do in my own life\nHow powerful is our human mind which\nIs powerful in ways that our generation is only coming to understand look\nWe are realizing that things work out there like placebo surgery we're realizing that people can lose weight literally George and lower their blood pressure just based on the thought that they carry with them\nThings that we would have thought were unbelievable a generation ago are being validated and clinical experiments today I think the universe is ultimately mental that doesn't\nMean that we don't live under many laws enforces but if one can understand how much that means your thoughts are more powerful than anything you've been brought up to realize\nIs the power of the brain or are we dealing with something outside of the physical body\nWe're dealing with something outside of the physical body and I think we could say that conclusively today because we have actual experiments but the thoughts change the brain\nYour sustained thoughts will actually alter the neural pathways the electrical pathways in your brain that's demonstrable by brain scans it's literally mind over matter so fought changes the brain and fought has to be something that's extra physical that goes beyond the brain\nWoodward's human beings sometimes things work sometimes they don't Iraq if they don't work what does that mean\nYou know it's very important that that's an extremely important point because people will sometimes try a method it works they're thrilled they try it again it doesn't work and then they feel project one of the things that I read about on the book is that we live within a cosmic framework where we experienced many different laws enforces\nThe law of mind is constant as a law must be but so is the law of gravity but you're going to experience gravity differently on earth\nThan you would on the moon around Jupiter doesn't mean gravity isn't there doesn't mean gravity is an operative but it's affected by mass the mind just the same way\nCircumstances are going to intrude upon how we experience these things so we're ordinance that we experiment very clearly and very carefully\n... gonna come back and talk more about your work\nThe miracle club next hour we'll

for silently reciting affirmation stew yourself\n[noise] and it seems to work doesn't\nThat's been my experience George when people ask me for a simple step to take that is always the step I give them again my ... is never neglect simple things we have a habit of overlooking simple things used them there's more depth there than one might expect\nOne or some of the positives of mind control methods we should use\nWell one of the things that's most important is writing things down right down your goals and I don't mean on a computer I mean get out and old fashioned pencil and paper and do it\nBecause once you do that you've actually created a physical manifestation so to speak of the thing\nThat you're looking for the actual tactile act of writing something I think not only helps persuade you mentally and in terms of your neural pathways of the goals that you're moving towards\nBut you've actually done something empowering you've done something real if you sit down and for a sustained period of time make a list of things that you truly want in life\nAnd you know these are things you want with all your heart there not diversionary but they are essential\nLife goals take that list put it on to some sort of a laminated card or something that you can carry with you look at it morning noon and night\nThink about it as much as possible and when things on that list come to you and over time they will come to you and they may come to quicker than you think just expressed gratitude and most important of all don't tell anyone what you're doing remain silent\nBecause sometimes you share these things with other people and the roll their eyes are those say it's nonsense than they knock you off your resolve remain silent make your list carry it with you review it three times a day memorize it and when the results arrive\nExpress things that's a method we can all do and it's easy isn't it once you get into it\nIt is easy the the the the the important thing is to do it with consistency is\nTo do it with silence and it's to do it with total stark honesty arriving at a definite aim in life or a a a a a small number of things that coalesce around one aim has enormous power and aim is really another way of saying focus and we know that\nWhen you focus the sun's rays with a magnifying glass were prism\nThey become enormously powerful what is a laser other than focused light natural laws are consistent your mind is powerful when it is focused which is why I keep emphasizing the idea that you have to really nail down what you want in a very concrete way and be very honest with yourself that's worth focus comes from\nMitch since you've been doing this have you use these techniques for yourselves\nEvery day every single day George\nAnd I must tell you you know I my life has gone in directions\nThat I never could have expected I've done television narrating and and and and written many books and articles including in places that are not known for their cult enthusiasm I've written about these topics in the Washington Post the wall Street Journal the New York times I never\nFrom that was possible and so I feel like I'm an example of the effectiveness of these methods and everything that are offered to the coast family or things that are protesting myself I Would never ask somebody to do something that I hadn't experimented with myself\nOr you could tell you love doing what you're doing\nI really do I really do I mean you know it's a dream come true in the most literal sense you know Fifteen Years ago this is exactly what I pictured myself doing and exactly what I wanted to do be patient sometimes things happen quickly but sometimes a gestation period is also necessary\nIt is amazing work how people get this membership into the miracle club\nThe miracle club I used to say that anybody can join the miracle club you didn't have to\nSign your name up anywhere there was no magic decoder ring in anything and of course that's true everybody who's listening is automatically a member of a number of the miracle club but I got to thinking you know speaking of magic decoder rings maybe it won't be fun of people had a little membership card so I asked a friend of mine a great artist named Tim boat\nTo draw up a membership card in America club but anybody who emailed me and I'm super easy to find throw my name into Google it'll ticket on my website\nAnd my email email me and I will send you your own membership card to be in the ... club you could find it you could folded laminated Carey in your wallet just something fun to have with you to sort of keep you on course throughout the day to keep your thoughts\nSteady and productive so I I thought it would be fun for people to have an official card a designating their membership and the miracle club so send me an email you get America club membership card\nWe're going to take calls next hour with Mitch or which of course we will take your miracle stories as well I Would guess Mitch it's surprising how many people have miracle stories in an overwhelming though\nYou know we have to understand that life is made up of of of joys and and sometimes Greek tragedies but in as much as we do experience catastrophes in life and let's face it that's a part of what\nMorning noon or night cardio mobile they do take unlimited medical great EKG\nAnd

A. dot com\n[noise]\n\n\nThat will come back to coast to coast George story with you along with Mitch Horwitz Mitch told me about the power behind writing down the goal women going for it\nYou know it's interesting when we write down a goal it really demand that we pull something out of us that's authentic and that's kind of magic key\nTo all of this material I Would say that absolute passionate intensity and the one the hidden he behind every health health program with it something will work without it nothing happens now one of my contention is that we really need to have one\nAbsolutely definite chief aim in life and that could be something that we very often resist\nWriting things down can help us with that because if you write down what you really care about over a course of days are over the course of weeks you'll see that it will all tend\nIn one direction and my challenge to the listener is whether you can come up with one overarching goal that facilitates all of the smaller ones what would that be if you can come up with one chief aim you have arrived at mental focus and mental focus\nIs the open sesame so to speak to everything that we've been talking about\nInteresting work Mitch or what's with us and Mitch did you get some professional help when you put those together or did you do this all on your a\nToll on my own you know this was really my tribute to the thought of my own heroes and the mental human tradition or things that they've thought about things that I have experimented with ideas that I came up with myself a you know I view the miracle club is something that we all belong to all of us who are stripers all of us who are experimenter as\nWe are all automatically in the miracle club and my idea was just to create something around which we could all gather and experiment with our mind\nWhat would you say would be a great miracles story that you've heard about\nA great miracles store that I've heard about was a financial miracle what I had a friend in New England who was recovering from a very\nSerious disease and he was facing financial disaster he had only one hundred and two dollars left to his name and he was on the brink of losing his health insurance one night I challenged people like challenged people to make a marathon reading a book George that I Know you are very deeply the magic of believe\nYeah and loved though\nYeah and my friend rather than reading the book decided to get hold of an audio version of it that I happen to narrate he listened to it over and over and over for about five days on the fifth day he got a call from an old boss\nWho said to him you know you left behind a four O. one K. account here have you checked that account and my friend said on that you know you can carry thought it was a few dollars and cents his old boss had to have you looked at it\nThere's over fifty thousand dollars\nBeing you know how to count all heroes you\nYeah I can only tell you that that's what happened and to my friend it truly felt like America\nThat is a miracle it really is yeah it's exactly what the experience and it was quite recently released expected you know\nYes yes that's why I tell people you know again George it can sound sort of Hackney to say never give up at these things do happen when you least expect it you can always give it another twenty four hours you have no idea what twists and turns life is going to take and as much as life visits catastrophe on it and it does\nIt also visit extraordinary absurdly good news on us and you never know you never know what life is going to take and twenty four hours I always in poor people who feel desperate among other things among other things give it twenty four hours more\nYou are a believer in visualizing before
