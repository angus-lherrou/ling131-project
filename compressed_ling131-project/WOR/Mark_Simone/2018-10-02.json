supposed to be a very funny play about it comes from England and it's about snicker players you know snuck or the ... not popular here but very popular in in the u._k.\nAnd it was written by a Richard being wrote a very funny play called one man to governors that starred as then unknown James Horton\nBefore he became famous I didn't know he was an actor Corey yeah absolutely it was a Broadway actor you know I Do it was in history boys on Broadway and he starred in one man to while hosted Tony Awards\nOh but I just didn't realize you know he was an actor\nI'm very good very good anyway I'm looking forward to this place a farce I something am I on usually\nNot I find myself more much more attracted to musicals than just straight plays\nA I think you know most people do like musicals and musical certainly the engine of Broadway and they make the most money but\nGood non musical play as a lot of fun to to I'm looking forward to I'm looking forward to the nap which I was going to see tonight and the next week I'm going to see Elaine May all in the Waverly gallery and the word around Broadway is that Elaine May at eighty six years old has given a sensation will performance\nYou're a cast them as you know are we alone no no but it's a tough part because she's playing a woman who is suffering from creeping Alzheimer's she's how ... eighty six and she's how many performances a week or two and a performance is only my God he's a pro I'd love her so those are the two place to keep your eye on folks\nSo uh this headline caught my attention out of the newspaper the Scottish Sun which I I read regulars are what you uh feel like this headline evil Scottish serial killer Dennis Nielsen who murdered Fifteen people had sex with their bodies ... was\nA terrible sheet at Scrabble see of all the tribes he committed an advantage guy or give up all why does this and you know forget the fact that he killed all these people and then\nHad sex with their bodies he strangled or drowns as victims mhm then he'd have sex with him\nAnd uh but he died in May of story is I don't know died but how did he cheated eat the tiles no he would he would like palm or steal the blank tile see places from I Do for the blanks are obviously very valuable I ... them all the time oh there you go\nSo uh apparently he always what would steal the blank tile that this was from a bunk made or sell me an ad in prison finally spilled the beads\nThat he has to assist or he just gets more curious a guy named Alan Baker\nWas his soulmate uh-huh but since ... eleven he now lives as a woman calls himself Sarah jade Baker [laughter]\nBut at what the hell is going on there in the prison playing Scrabble insects changes during a her or his jail\nTime depending she met the serial killer ... who was caged for life because he killed between twelve and Fifteen and he used to play board games together and now he's building the beads so the matter what you thought of as brutal serial killer he was a cheetah Scrabble Michael it I think that's just all forget what that's what I\nThat's right hey here's one for you and Ohio teacher confessed to having sex with a Seventeen year old students the images you know but\nWhy did she have sex with him because he looked and acted like her ex husband woman's name is max yes you have a thing for well that's the weird thing 'cause you think of the acts that didn't go well so why she wants to have sex with someone who reminds her of her ex husband her name is Lucy\nOh sorry Laura boost the thirty two year old home economics teacher twins Burke high school in Ohio yeah she was placed on administrative leave and that's it uh after having sex with a teen\nIn a classroom pantry my guess teaching home economics is probably a pantry into your room and what better place to have some hanky panky ended up hanky panky pantry\nBut [laughter] reminded her\nOf her ... maybe maybe not but he acts ... maybe who knows into this Seventeen year old kid reminded her of her I guess her ex husband looks pretty young for his age\nAll right I have a mystery for you yeah you like mysteries I Do love mystery we field prison in Dublin mhm prison guards found Chinese takeout containers in the prison yard trash huh\nHow do I get takeout I don't think they did that show the prisoners get Chinese takeout at the pretty like a good mystery\nWell let me try to figure this one out so we may be like some chai somebody come in as a visitor and they oh not a Chinese\nFood intake no new ... oh I bet it was I bet it was drones that dropped it all over the fence bingo they they ... they may have been drones\nSomebody well how do prisoners have better about Chinese food what you want to file the Orlando or they just you know what I ate food that's where you get drugs in prison I could they they they ... as I can travel through small holes apparently so\nAnd they brought the Chinese food and by the drones you know you go to hold\nThat will that AQAP next hey if you miss anything today we invite you to check out seven ten W. R. dot com slash lending Michael we have the sexiest marine about a woman or we have the horse that runs into a bar who doesn't\nUh we have the rocket man movie trailer and the studio fifty four documentary trailers so we got all kinds of stuff and coming up next Bill O'Reilly joins mark Simone your chance to win a thousand dollars right now at ten o'clock\n... if we don't know that he was that big a drink of it was blacking out passing out have you ever passed out from drinking yes of course you have yes really\nWell I mean you had all those topics lead to focus on the air lie down look at the bottom of this out you know you have the moments yeah well\nYou've been a news director for many years of a perfectly stable normal a career\nOh no no no no not while I was doing a respectable job if that's what I'm saying so ah I don't think I ever\nPassed out in school or if you know I don't think so I never drink that much okay well viewing Trump\nBut he never drink at all I don't ever touched us if you never know cigarettes he says no coffee but I've seen them drink some coffee ha ha ha ha well you know during a one of those Eighteen our campaign days I've seen them take some coffee but the\nUh you know I Would you say every high school kid is passed down from drinking\nThey may be some you know for the moment I don't know if ... Jersey no I was upstate New York oh even worse [laughter] forget it you know ... of the lambs drinking age was Eighteen when when I was growing up yeah so\nI guess if you get what this is stupid you can't argue about whether it was drunk and of course this is Anita thing this doesn't mean anything hey look at Ted Kennedy\n[laughter] he's a fifty year old man drunk out of his mind to throwing up all over people driving his car if a bridge drowning people and he was a lie in the Senate [laughter] it was the leader of the Democrats in the Senate\nDoesn't seem fair does it it was stumbling drunk at all times Ted Kennedy\nConstantly drunk I remember those as is the one night in Washington DC him and Chris Dodd the two biggest drunk server and remember the waitress sandwich oh yeah yeah I went in a restaurant they got this waitress in between he was on the bottom\nKennedy Kennedy was on top and they had her like as a waitress they called it the waitress in any way that was not the point the point was there's no liquor I think for a andme was closing time in Washington DC nobody can sell liquor after that they were in panic\nAbout getting some liquor no stores that sell liquor if Kennedy is a was a brilliant guy he calls dilemma company orders the biggest stretch limousine they have and Dodd says what's the point of that and the lemons he pulls up sure enough it's got a fully stocked bar and\nWho would have thought of that [laughter]\nOnly Ted Kennedy and hit when it was their hero the life of the Senate so uh I don't know the uh there's an interesting article is a ... inside the beltway a real swamp ah stabbed which meant a newsletter\nBut even Axios\nAnd they don't like Trump even they said in the big article today about the Trump methods work\nYou might hate them but the Trump methods work no matter how much you infuriates people no matter how many crazy things he says he gets the job done look at a NAFTA did you think he would get in Mexico and Canada renegotiated and just a couple of months\nNow and he did what he said he was going to do you did what he said he was going to the tax plan he got that through and as they point out no other president\nHave cabin or close to being nominated they would have given up by now with what happened last week especially the end of the week no other administration was stuck by this guy and fought like that\nWell he is keeping a distance from the guy the ... he is supporting him but he's not I don't think he's all in on them\nOh I think he's all and I'm from ... what I hear there is no backup plan they're going to get this guy and\nI think he's all in on them I think he's just not publicly looking like that because he thinks he's not stupid he knows that might hurt Capitol yeah the more he's around cabinet so he's trying to create a separation there so it doesn't hurt cabinet too much hay and when they talk about this NAFTA\nYou're going to read all these fake news stories about just some cosmetic changes that I just think I Would say yeah you know if you look at the list of what they got on\nA Seventy five percent of car components now have to be made in the U.S that's big that's that's a lot Seventy five and raise the cost of cars a yeah a little probably thirty percent of vehicles must be made by workers earning at least sixteen\nUh dollars an hour candidate agreed to lift barriers on us farmers for all of this whole list of things that lifting the barriers on\nImportant things to farmers 'em and they also give us farmers access to a big chunk of Canada's dairy market which is very important us farmers also get to more access to Canada's eggs poultry us yeah he's a big thing this was huge you know when you go into Canada with your drugs if you have a drug company they get the rights to your patents\nThat's right it's like China they get your patents so when you go into Canada with your drugs you needed to sell millions and millions of bottles a year drug but they steal your patents now that will not happen a U.S drug companies have ten years where Canada can't touch the pat and that's a big thing\nOf it very increase protections on intellectual property so there was big changes in NAFTA much more favorable to us yeah sure so but if you read the New York times\nCosmetic changes that a little ... that's all it was so uh but they but this uh Axios points out the Trump methods work and he's the king of what they call earned media now you could go out and spend a lot of money\nA and take out ads in the media or you could hire publicist\nTo try to get your written about in the media or you could get what they call earned media you could do something that would make headlines everywhere and get you a ton of publicity and [laughter] I think if we can all admit Donald Trump is the king\nOf earned media the greatest in history without a doubt without a doubt he said that in a rally last night he goes when it comes to earn media nobody is better than me\nIf you can name somebody else who got every cable news channel every newspaper to do nothing but right about him every cable news shows go twenty four seven coverage of themselves name somebody I don't mean the OJ Simpson for a couple of months I mean\nFor two years three years nonstop yeah [laughter] so the carrying of a earned media and hate Trump was at that rally last night he was talking about drinking I'm not a drinker\nCan honestly say I never had a beer in my life okay\nSo one of my totally good types things I don't [laughter] whatever they're looking for something that I say I never had a glass of alcohol I've never had alcohol I guess you know for whatever reason [noise] can you imagine if I had what a mess that they would I think it's likely the world's worst but I never drank I never drank okay\nJoe Bartlett got his mouth hanging open he does like this is like a guy from Mars never drank never had a beer amazing really is phenomenal it is pretty good\nUh never smoked a cigarette while you're Donald Trump's a brother right now was an alcoholic and died of alcohol that's one reason I think there was some other people in this family that\nHad some problems with alcohol so that's one reason he stayed away from it but he gets drunk on earned media [laughter]\nAs his vice he has other ways to get high yeah so I Will get back to Donald Trump or New Jersey this is very important Menendez this slimy sleeves ball dirty swamp steak snake Menendez is running\nFor reelection and the Senate what's the name of the guy running it's Bob Hugh can Bob Hugh can you gotta support this guy Bob ... it looks like he's got a shot he's tied andme yup Bob Hugh can has tied Menendez which means he's actually leading\nBecause they read all these polls now in favor of Democrats they use a very small sample of Republicans ten percent less than they should in the sample so he's actually leading right now but in the fake poles it's tied a human's a good guy right we don't know anything bad about him\nWell yeah he's a you know wealthy guy was from the pharmaceutical industry um you know the knock against him from an end is is that he you know may drugs\nTo on affordable is is that that's yeah not all him yeah All right it was you can hear [laughter]\n... every time you go to the pharmacy\nAnd every drug is expensive it's all ... well it's not a nobody made a more expensive than Menendez it was the Senate\nSo expensive by not uh doing all that competitive buying and you know in the Medicare and the VA hospital so they buy drugs they're not allowed to negotiate because of the Senate I I don't see how negative can lend given you know he was on the brink of going to jail yeah the reason they do that for drugs\nAnd drug companies is there the drug companies are the biggest lobbyist in Washington they own Menendez they own all the senators all the laws\nAre slanted to help the drug companies so how could he blamed [laughter] so uh but that's the commercial uh above Menendez and all that sleazy in his memory was tied up with that big donor who was flying them around on private jets with a bunch of a buck some been bows\nThat's your Menendez for you or he was tried\nFor corruption\nAnd it was pretty close it was made pretty clear in the trial that he was corrupt that he was sleazy that he was doing all kinds of things wrong they just finally rule that wasn't technically illegal yet but I don't think anybody would argue that anything he did that he was accused of was proper\nI think they proved total improper sleazy very immoral corrupt conduct there\nIs that enough to get your thrown out of the Senate no effect\nYou get a raise for that you ... [laughter] you [laughter] but this guy could lose and it's very important\nThat you get out and vote and defeat Menendez who can is an ex marine right yeah I think so ... that is part of his commercials sending the Marines you need this guy get rid of Menendez you got to start cleaning up New Jersey you get the worst politicians ever\nAre it happened yesterday right outside right in front of this building every so often somebody will come up to me and said do you know where such and such street is or do you know how to get to hear I mean he used to have that all the time nobody asked you for directions anymore because everybody looks on their phone\nWhat has happened yesterday and they had some kind of foreign accent what are they not have GPS in the third world countries or something [laughter] I think they do but\nUh she asked me a whereas York Street every river York Street around here not around here no I don't know\nMentality Brooklyn so he was really well [laughter] York isn't on the like the Upper East side\nUh I don't I guess growing up but uh uh I'm\nTrying to be nice but I don't want to say I was wrong with you know you have a phone book and they don't you have Google Maps [noise] maybe she just wanted to talk to you and I don't think so [laughter] I don't think so I don't know [laughter] ah but you know you go to a lot of people I Know that go to Africa to the deepest jungle of Africa\nThey tell me every native primitive native has a cell phone and they're handouts absolutely true\nAnd they have the finest cell service in the jungles of Africa China came in there over the last few years and they you know it's not like a\nThe oyster bay Long Island where you want to put a cell tower you got to go before a planning\nBoard for nine years right this is Africa the jungle you could just put the cell towers everywhere so there's a cell tower like every ten feet\nAnd the signal is so clear and the Chinese then came in and sold very cheap phones to all the people there so everywhere you go and was primitive village a little odd everybody's on the phone [laughter] still have to pay the monthly bill\nBut they make it very cheap there or you could make these phones real cheap I\nMean they're not using it in the iPhone excess max [laughter] speaking of which I've been using the new iPhone now for two weeks the most frightening feature in it I don't know why they put this in their you know in your eye when you get this thing no conscious steps and how many old I Am you know you look at it I did ten thousand steps that's ... the new one has this feature\nWhere it shows you every week and send you a report of how much you've used the phone and it was frightening my average is five hours and forty minutes a day\nKidding me no you mean\nThat you get yours yet whether you see yours [noise] five hours and forty minutes [laughter] that's almost six hours [laughter]\nWhat do you do when you're watching videos well\nThen it breaks it down apparently a number one check the most was male than Instagram a kind of stuff ah yeah it is frightening but\nIf you went back Twenty years ago you might find out that you were watching TV the total of six hours a day you know when you eat before the phone when you came home personally and just put the television or just always on yeah so uh but it also has it shows you how many times you've checked your phone is frightening\nWhen you see the statistics I think it was go to John in Westchester hey John\nYes I don't look good good let's say I'm not sure if anybody brought this up but I was listening to the hearing when when this Ford and went to the safe way\nHe went there with my mom\nYeah they split up and they wanted to separate doors uh-huh okay cc's judge come out he turns white the attack happened six weeks earlier but she has no problem walking up to him and saying hello now conveniently ... they ... how about a month split up to now her mom can't corroborate the fact that she saw judge if Evan\n... matlock you're a boring everybody's with all these ... feels that way but I get it and that it does it make you that it doesn't make sense you're right the whole thing just sounds a little screwy let's go to pat in Brooklyn a fat\nHigh high like how you doing good I just [noise] okay now you were talking about New Jersey and the Democrats in New Jersey but we need Democrats in New Jersey because the taxes and needed to maintain the infrastructure or as such\nA way to first of all that's not correct It's just the opposite the more you tax the less revenue you get into the government in every case in history where you lower taxes you always get more revenue second of all ...\n... ... you have all the money in the world to rebuild your infrastructure a hundred times over they'd just waste all the money\n... ... what you're saying is natural light there and I'm not an and\nI Am a case where taxes got lowered and revenue went down\nMark Mark what you're saying\nSome keep repeating my name but again name a case in history where taxes were lowered and revenue went down name a case\nWait a minute taxes lowered and loving it went down never had that in in terms of economic that's the way it is however mark thank you so much by by dare\nOnly thank you very much was nice of you to call like so much they have a hard to make a case to raise taxes in New Jersey [laughter] but ah every case Reagan\nCut taxes revenue doubled into the federal government this will get no coverage at all zero coverage but Donald Trump in the last few months set the all time record\nFor revenue into the federal government highest numbers ever in history again it's it's hard to explain but if you study the Laffer curve if you lower taxes more people come into the system or the economy grows it generates more revenue you remember when you raise taxes to a certain point you lose money because people leave the system New Jersey a Christie did a study\nThe higher taxes cost the state what was the seventeenth billion in companies and people that left the state yeah in in revenue last anyway when we come back oh you'll be with us

K.\nYou remember the story about two months ago I think it was August he showed up at the comedy cellar that's one of the top comedy clubs McDougal street in the village\nAnd they have a lot of comedians in there and a lot of times big stars coming there to try out stuff they like using that place oh Seinfeld or come in and suddenly pop up on stage try out some stuff\nUh Chris Rock will go in there and try on stuff uh so you know August Lewis CK all of a sudden came out I think it was a Sunday night he just walked out after like five other comedians and a lot of people were offended that he was there a couple of people walked out they said they should have been warned\nSo last night he does it again there's Louis ... K and a bunch of women walked out they were really offended by him they said there was something very arrogant about him or just popping out like nothing's wrong he's the guy masturbating into plants and the like Harvey Weinstein and\n[laughter] I\nDon't understand these guys who said Sharon's crying and whining these other guys are open the door and a robot star masturbating but this is Lewis CK and he admitted to all this and this last night when he walked out he just made jokes about it like a you know I haven't been around in a while I don't know if you notice but I've been away for a while or so a lot of people\nVery arrogant but this is the second time now in the last few months so apparently he is really trying to make a comeback that's the question if you're Matt Lauer can you ever come back if you're Charlie Rose can you ever come back Kevin Spacey there's a lot of these\nAll right what can they do I think they're going to need a little bit of extra time me this ...\nThis ... thing is still hot it's possible you could come back but I don't think so I really don't look at OJ Simpson that was Nineteen\nNinety five a there was never any OJ Simpson come back I mean you can't imagine how many years later is Nineteen and if it's twenty three years ago he might just any\nNetwork or broadcast outlets saying well he's do football commentary you could do a analysis murder\n[laughter] that's true okay murder that's different but even creepy or the murder is masturbating into a plant in front of somebody in a restaurant [laughter]\nThat is crazy that then I I'll take that over the murder or uh you're you're so busy trying to convict cabinet of rape where it's just like some groping in high school this Matt Lauer there were a couple of cases where it really looked\nYeah you know he did put out that list way back when ah here's the ten people I'm looking at for the court so\nUh for a year and a half they probably had George Soros funded serious opposition research working on all the names of cabinet doesn't make it I think you will but if he doesn't make it to probably go to the woman next to Amy Coney Barrett she's far more conservative but\nThese crazy Democrats I'll bet you they've had massive opposition research teams I mean commandos funded by Soros and all those sleazy left wing groups doing opposition research all these names I'll bet they are ready to go on any of these ten minutes doesn't mean they've got his true\nBut stuff they can use against her\nA though [laughter]\nThat's sick cabinet doesn't make it that go to the next names\nAnalyst who who knows maybe the other nine will say sorry I'm busy I Can't go through\nThis where you go through these crazy nut job Democrats waiting to get anybody you see this Jane Fonda statement the other day\nThis crazy Jane Fonda is back what was this statement she made\nShe's promoting something I think but she's all over the place eighty years old now more fired up than ever oh she's at the Ninety second street why she says we have to get in the streets nobody should work if Trump gets re elected or we lose the midterms we need to shut down the country shut it down [laughter]\nOh my gosh\nLet's start with our first of all this is annoyed Jane who in her protesting a Vietnam went and hug the Viet Cong our worst enemy so she obviously just gets crazy and I guess that's good still going nuts [laughter] totally nuts at the age of Eighteen years old\n[noise] shut it down shut it down well that's what you listen I hate to say it but it looks like the Democrats will probably lose the midterms if they do\nI don't know what's gonna happen I really don't know we've never seen this kind of craziness we look at these people screaming and yelling at restaurants at people and it's just insane if they lose the midterms I don't know what they're going to do\nWe not be able to go out\nAnd you know the answer to this Bill O'Reilly where is this all going to go have
