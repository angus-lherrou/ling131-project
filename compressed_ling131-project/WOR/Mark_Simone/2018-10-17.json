the way she was everyone is fine but who knows it's fine to home a little over ...\n[laughter] yeah but it was inside a parking garage are covered parking garage so it was echoing I'm sure but it was it they they hit the ball\nSo it was pretty good muscles and I bet you screamed at the drive through [noise]\nHoops and and that somewhat tweeted that Hillary's always had problems with the polls show

the roads you have to see every or they'll\nBe coming on the Florida they're all they're measuring the uh those grocery carts they're hitting people are in their cars and\nHe's running across crazy what's the what what ... what did they tell women to do if you have to get your car out of the parking garage at night\nPerry Mason\nYeah I don't know that's interesting I I Try not I try to Levi to avoid being in a parking garage speculate especially\nAt not just women I don't like to know is that it's not Uri yeah it might run into Deep Throat and that is true that is where Bob Woodward met him I don't\nKnow I saw the movie screen ... all the press that spread hey so a more teachers sick or is it happening\nEvery day every day almost every week we got a teacher sex in this one is from Louisiana a teacher was arrested and charged with having sex with a teenage student\nThere was a pep rally going on in the gymnasium and they were having sex in the classroom her name is Constance Robertson twenty five year old Saturday to teach having sex constantly ... other one lender on there you are curious oh in here get this a video of the incident was discovered by school administrators\nOh wait a second who would take the easy so she's having sex with a student during the ... there's another students shooting available\nCame from the sixteen year old student who recorded the incident on his cell phone and was sharing it with other students\nSo while he's having sexy shooting video yes well this guy's pretty talented kid I thought I'd give it to get a job back about being ... is this could could both he works\nFor the ... apparently school [laughter] anyway he showed off the video got caught and the woman could face up to ten years in prison and only a five thousand dollar fine\nYou know with the prison thing uh come on yeah how about this one from Davis, California you know just this is one of those stories just when you think you've heard it all police are investigating after high school student allegedly\nMade cookies and distributed to fellow students and one of the ingredients and the cookies\nHuman ashes slot where they get the ashes it says they think that they bake the sugar cookies with one of their grandparents cremated ashes baked inside the cookie\nDid they do this on purpose or the ashes just sort of fall off the shelf I this is ... they weren't ... they weren't next to the\nLet me explain that to you go over the earned you sprinkle some as you say that say oh this looks good the sugar cookies\n[laughter] maybe maybe they store the or next to the uh the baked goods and maybe they don't think\nIt's hard to tell which is which maybe he was getting some flour and it got dark flower anyway it turns out that this is according to the students so testing is underway in Davis, California to determine if they actually\nDid containing remains the cookies so far no adverse health effects of a reporter all would be the adverse health effects\nMedia ... yeah where's grandma and the cooking\nThe hell of a radical crackers ramp grandma crackers that people cookies oh my God that is a\nWeird one ad last but not laid out a roasted pig's head was found in a trap pillars luggage checked luggage somebody got Atlanta the godfather cut me I don't know we get some of the bad there was a cooked pig's head wait two pounds it was seized and destroyed\nOr the travelers from Ecuador and his luggage was searched at the Atlantic\nAir for at they'd land air ... airport yeah or enda in there was a well an anchor pounds of it but\nOf course it was cooked but it's coming from Ecuador it's against the law right but it's a delicacy and all but it's against the law to bring in because they're afraid of the good could contain a\nWhole are hoping mouth disease right that's why so it's illegal to carry the stuff we learned something is an educational show that's very true I never had pigs had before I like to give it up to ... to miss anything today check out seven ten\nW. R. dot com slash Michael our podcast food there yep you get our entire shows we got the podcast Roy right there on the website coming up mark Simone always got YouTube star while coming up with them\nAnd do you ... the thousand dollars heft is ten o'clock so log every\nWhat New York's most most of the Fox they rated number\nOne seven ten W O o voice of New York and high heart rate\n[noise] uh well uh pumped first Trump or I Know where Trump would say a pump pay or I don't know how you would handle the vets\nA couple of go in there all along to look at her mind and we know you did it but here's the thing we got to figure out how to get you out of this and the best way for every round yep so uh and then a Pompeo is now going to turkey to talk to them who\nThat is like a ... like the ... of the government Tom egg and has to go meet with everybody for the godfather and yeah like he's going to come back with the real story [laughter] but at the same time I go to Hollywood and see the producer waltz in a [laughter] so we'll see what happens when the\nApparently the hit squad the Fifteen members of the hit squad they've identified seven of them and they know that a couple of them traveled dress traveled in the entourage of the crown prince and the king at times so are there you go\nYou would see these it'd be different guys though when you you figure it'd be the death squad hit squad we one group and the ones that guard you on a trip would be a different group but apparently in the entourage that keep\nSome death squads guys kids they have to kill somebody wherever they are nice to have a death squad around you know never know when you need it\nSays that just Buddy Guy it's part of them are professional death squads guys case you're in a you know the member that came to America\nYeah he'll shrimp prince last year he toured toured everywhere he went to a Silicon Valley every place maybe in case someone wrong you got to three death squads guys they got the bone saw their [laughter] they don't go through customs [laughter] diplomatic pouch is a Silicon Valley\nThe self righteous or we can't do business with the Pentagon Google typed\nSilicon Valley is going to explain the biggest single investor is Saudi Arabia and the crown prince oh he's the biggest venture capital a guy in the world he's put more money into Silicon Valley than anybody knows they you know Silicon Valley very quiet about that\nYeah well\nYeah I Need to know that they can't we're not going to the conference in Riyadh were not going to speak there at the conference I I don't I don't see them returning any of that money they got why don't you return all the investment that the Saudi Arabia put in so we'll see what happens is will be a slow process\nUh but we don't you don't want to lose his contract she had a hundred billion dollar contract coming right now so how do you get out as a while you'll have to figure out some of the sanctions but you want to keep that contract for a couple of reasons one if you cancel the contract you hurt Boeing Raytheon and uh\nUh all these companies you don't want to ... cost of all these jets also you always want the Saudis using our planes that's very important because if they're using our planes if they spend a hundred billion to use all our planes that means for the next five or ten years they're totally dependent on us for parts\nAnd for training for those planes so it helps\nThe future uh I don't know\nYeah sorry about that Mr could show the but you know just so inconvenient for you to be killed\nIf we feel terrible for this guy terrible but the kind of turn the whole world upside\nDown because of his Twitter account [laughter] this guy who nobody heard of two weeks ago [laughter] if you weren't in some Georgetown dinner party you've never heard of this guy you ever hear of this guy never knew news directing this guy had never heard of this guy so are we going to\nTurn the whole world upside down over this but we'll see what happens to a more important things is Elizabeth war and you know she was one of the top contenders for the Democratic nomination Democrats I hear now do not want her\nFor the nominee 'cause they see now that she's like Hillary she's ... she's screws up things this DNA thing was a publicity stunt\nTerribly bungled it's a total disaster they don't want to risk a hundred million billion zillion dollars on a campaign run by her they think now she's a ... screw things up they learned their lesson nominating a woman who ... all the time\nIt's a big problem also they're starting to question why she even did this\nShe's not in any election trouble why would she suddenly do this now and this is the last thing they needed going into the midterms three weeks until the midterms and now she's got this whole stinking near uh the DNA test completely bungled President Trump now\nToday a calling demanding that she apologized to the nation for her hoax [noise] yeah you know she says now now that came out she's one one thousand and twenty fourth Indian which mean she's not India and\nIn fact there was never any test to see if she was a Cherokee Indian they had no Cherokee Indian DNA to test again so they tested against Peruvian Colombian and Mexican DNA I don't know what that means but they there is no evidence that she has any Indian blood at all\nAnd she's saying well never had anything to do with my career and I never really used it for any purpose Harvard put out a thing back when she heard or seen the first woman of color professor [noise]\nSecond of all do you remember the Indian cookbook yup the American and Native American cookbook\nShe contributed to recipes and she said these are Indian family recipes American indian recipes that we're always cooked in her family\nWouldn't that means she's saying pretty recently generation wise that she had Indians in her family sure thank God for how we car the great journalist to research the recipes and found out that Elizabeth Warren plagiarize them\nShe stole them from the New York times or ... boots sexual ... and one of them was for a\nCrab omelet [noise] you ... are we supposed to believe in the wild wild west so they were doing ... [laughter] that's where we're the Indians right there in the middle of the country\nLast summer when I get crabs well I mean I'm\nSure they populated the east coast before we had a little amount maybe with crab\nOmelet I I really don't think you can ... I I\nYou can't get a crab [laughter] over there and so a good try to find a crab bomb but they don't make them how would the Indians we hadn't crab omelets\nSo just a liar this bond glare she's another Hillary she's Hillary without the cash [laughter] small time Hillary that's all she has a Stormy Daniels a you know I Know you're also saying why did the president the caller horse face that's not presidential\nWhy does he do that why does he do that how many years do we have to go through this this is what he does\n[laughter] it's what he does he should know better or don't you think I mean it didn't cause problems and when they didn't see him up to criticism yeah that does seem to bother says what he does\nA there's a party him a that's a child he's like a child I felt\nHim are you related to an eye on these very yes or no I always found it and I know he's not very childish Philly did very temperamental little kid it's not ... there's a little part of the becomes a child at times I used to see that sometimes if\nWe had to sit in the meeting like alone would twenty people around a table and it was a long long meeting somebody who is joining on he'd like\nA little throw things [laughter] like make faces and the part of him as a child\nThat's what came out here so let it go to know that we have a child is president let's get now I didn't save the child I said\nHe has a little side of that that's a good thing to have not when you're president may be okay it's a nice and it's like seeing him on a like an older guy very serious but all of a sudden this something child even Warren Buffet you see that sometimes when he goes to Dairy Queen and these eating the ice it looks a little child\nLike ... to quality my own and keep a little bit of kid in his little kid so that's all this is only this is like a tough kid from queens who calls you names and so although I don't understand the horse race does she looked like a horse race\nNot really I think ... it\nMay be but she could go back to and then nobody looks at her face though yeah don't go by now go get the pictures from eight years ago when he was with her she looked pretty good back then yes it was it at your ten years ago when she looked good back then\nAnd she was a porn star she must have looked good to men mhm was an actual points that are still making money with that body yeah but not really she's doing the strip clubs you know for ten dollar bills it's not like making porn films but um\nShe responded by calling him tiny ... which I Know he won't like I'm sure he won't like though uh I hate to think about how he's going to respond [laughter] or what he's going to do to prove a wrong\nUh and then she said a guess you have a beastie out of the problem which is good combat\nAs it could come back in yeah so a cause if she's a horse race and then she said at the end her last line was game on tiny food [laughter] but ah she also knows a lot of money now\nFor that case against a show he or she is child like and he does like to lash out but there's a strategy to it oh God at the Frank as always very slowly at all on display good\nYou know what I think it happened is that Stormy Daniels a had a change of heart and she probably convince the attorney that you know maybe ... was a little bit sick\nAll right thanks for checking in with us as always Twenty years of this got a horse color anyway um [noise] uh getting back to mother here's the deal Muller knows what's what's coming\nAfter the midterms most likely sessions gets fired new attorney general means he's on recused and he can take charge of everything including Mahler he can fire Rosenstein which\nMost likely what happened so Mohler is taking action now to make that tough to do right after the midterms he will put out a report or as I said legally it only has to go to Rosenstein that's the direction for the special counsel to report only to Rosenstein\nSo Rosenstein can reveal what he wants so he will\nWe get the reports say he'll talk about obstruction there is no obstruction\nThat's impossible and if there was an obstruction case Rosen seen has to recuse himself because he's the guy that called for Comey's firing he wrote that the two page memo detailing why Comey had to be fired and Mueller\nIs a ... closest friend and he was trying to get the job when Comey was fired in fact combing went with him\nTo see Trump for the job interview so mother would have to recuse himself so there's no obstruction a Russian collusion there's not really any hint of anything and knowing that Mueller he'll put in some question marks or maybe this may be that some make it looked like he has to continue but\nWhat most likely will be in this a report will be a new lines of inquiry that he's had to open he'll open up some other things that he's found that he must look at so that'll be the way of making a tougher to fire and cause them to look like\nTrying to block these new lines of inquiry\nTons of inquiry probably\nA would have something to do with Trump's business money tax is something like that uh the question is ... always been pretty much an honest guy a straight arrow what he just lie to keep his job in a\nDo stuff like this who knows but also remember mother has a history of getting things wrong and the biggest investigations of his life he always got it wrong got the wrong guy\nA big example was after nine eleven the anthrax attacks Mohler lead that investigation he was convinced it was Steven Hatfill\nRemember the guy the lab worker everybody was telling this can't possibly be the guy ... never let up destroyed the guy's life for two years turned out he had the wrong guy the government had to give this poor guy ten million to make it up to him\nBack in Boston the through the wrong guys in jail and kept him there a couple of them died in jail government had to spend a hundred million for those families to to clean that up so more as a history of really bumbling things up so who knows what'll happen uh where we've got lost to get to we'll get to a ... driver\nHoover about to launch their I. P. O.\nAnd analysts say a hundred and twenty million for the ... I feel that that's the value of the company a hundred and twenty billion ridiculous it's more than GM Ford and Chrysler combined amazing the number of ridiculous you know you talked to experts are saying that's ridiculous number preposterous\nSo the only good thing about this rover drivers stories maybe it'll affect that I feel a little give it to a more real price because you start to see the problems the Louvre has with these drivers it's not like they're not employees\nYou know like freelance guys so you can't control or all of this behavior and apparently there's always been accusations that Hoover doesn't do enough to screen who these drivers are a ... it's not a massive facilities with\nMen and norms garages and thousands of Dr ... is just a piece of software basically it's like six guys in an office in this piece of software that's all it is a hundred and twenty billion ... billion so hey when we come back Lionel will be with us we'll see what he's got to say about Trump ... all the stuff going on in the world\nWill get to that in a moment on seven ten W O R let's get the latest news here's Joe Bartlett\nOkay Mark that Hoover driver right now is out on bond allegedly kidnapped and groped a female passenger the woman fell asleep twenty four year old ... or allegedly started driving toward Boston and then a stop the car and reached under her shirt\nWoman was headed

points in the first forty five minutes of trade\nWas on ABC did and I was ... it was a very good interview it's a very very even handed by she looked like go ahead no it's okay I asked me Scully used to\nDo that no go ahead and ask me or you know I'm not upset\nNext question I'm David elderly nope any other questions grade have a nice day\nI'm leaving hurry [laughter] I mean nothing nothing a stiff fantastic\nNow in the meantime Elizabeth Warren how can you take somebody somebody who is a person who was doing okay for a while as somebody who is head Elizabeth listen to me a favor don't push the in the thing I got away with the last time\nWe forgot about it let it go people have the attention span of an ad don't bring it up but she has I\nRemember they end do you think oh Jesus what no don't want to call this guy right now and he's a geneticist filing that religion that he's a friend of mine he's my brother in law Dave anyway we check this out and guess what I'm a Cherokee and they said\nYou did it again if we go on the issue was we forgot it now you revitalizing\nThe Democrats are saying you kind of short and maybe we're perhaps a\nChance Joe Biden is looking better\nHow stupid and these people will be it's not even a big issue so a lot we live in a hyphenated world I'm Irish American and Italian American\nPeople never been to Italy can speak Italian I don't know their name we're used to that peeled genders or fluid Rachel Dole is all on black on white men then okay don't push it Rachel dollars all never said a DNA\nTest he was smart enough not to do that but Elizabeth Warren Harvard\nProfessor you would think it will be subject to some of the greatest minds\nSomebody would say by the way DNA cannot really tell us you know men daily and genetics doesn't tell us exactly ... versus the uh you know the difference is this what are you talking about what he did it herself or used by her own weakness hard\nTo say we're out of time but who don't have to say well no I I Do I feel like you don't have to say hey you it\nSeriously grade kudos to you and you're honest to God from the heart for people to listen to this because this is so you do know is so effortless you can't recreate this you can't put people together to do it\nNo regard for\nThat's obvious anyway I have a wonderful day mark I mean that's just to\nBe with us everybody watch while on YouTube ... YouTube a check on Twitter ... you to watch them there\nAnd check on the Web page with a great story for the most expensive sandwich or New York New York this year the hundred and eighty dollar steak sandwich took a look also watch Elizabeth Warren\nWhen Bill Maher calls her Pocahontas right to her face what's the reaction also which is this guy Brian's do through the most biased gr on television this we usually watch the meltdown over Donald Trump\nYou know and you've got to think what does it cost to send a Fifteen man hit squad and do all this stuff ah it was really worth it over at tweet\nExactly you know he wrote these articles he wrote for a lot of places most recently the Washington Post but they say nobody really read the articles but his Twitter account was what was driving them crazy\nBut it is prince this crown prince of Saudi Arabia Simmons M Mohammed bin salon but they call them NBS it's like you know in the government they never set of some of bin Laden\nIs right and it was ...\nUh because he was the original spelling was with the you know some\nAre and members sometimes Rumsfeld at a press conference would say uh as far as it will be element older reporters would look up and you have to explain that to some of the government you can't say anything the normal way it has to have a code name big long phrase\nSo this crown prince as he took power you remember he locked up all those billionaires even prints I'll I'll we'd he'd lock them all up and he tortured them and he took money from them and our we'd had to give them six billion so he confiscated many many billions of dollars when he took power and he's the prince that came over here\nTrying to look like he was the reformer he allowed women to drive a all that kind of stuff but any invest in Silicon valley in our movie industry has nothing Hollywood takes a lot of money from this guy you know they're keeping quiet about\nThis uh but uh it as he\nBought a as he took all this money to buy stuff he bought a four hundred and fifty million dollar yacht oh four hundred and fifty million dollar yet he bought the most expensive home maybe in the world outside of Paris it was two hundred million he has a special plane that ended up costing them hundreds of millions\nWhoa and God Knows what else he buys that we don't even know about so why is he getting all upset over a tweet ... ...\nI don't know that happens sometimes when you suddenly have billions of dollars and uh you you can do anything you know when you hit squad if it costs hundreds of thousands of the operation that's like two cents so you spend a ...\nThe more money you get the none of your you get a look at this hedge fund guy\nThis guy is in the newspaper today he buys a work of art he's a big hedge fund guy with the multi multi billion dollar guy who runs the twenty four billion dollar fund he buys this piece of crap look at this\nJeffrey Coons I Know you're not supposed to say that but look look at this thing it looks like a bunch of orange ... stuck together it's just a big lobby mess of crap\nOr I mean [laughter] if your son brought this home from art class you'd call the teacher and say what do you teach in this kid but he paid Thirteen million phones man Thirteen million for this big it's strawberry colored says strawberry colored\nIt's a bunch of big balls all glued together stupid looking thing\nIf you saw this in somebody's house you'd see what the hell is wrong with this guy\nThirteen million and apparently it's not completed yet so he's suing the art dealer Larry ... and the artist Jeffrey Coons\nOr he's suing them for a fortune because he can't he it's been three years now and he can't get the top balloon down it finished ... this is what the lunatic Neal I just I'm just talking about the prince and this guy when you have this much money you become a totally deranged lunatic so he's in court suing over this\nFirst of all who publicly admit that they even bought this piece of junk and paid Thirteen million for Goshen is are arguing in court that this guy is obviously a very sophisticated art collector and should know that the great artist Jeffrey currents needs time that it often takes him several years to complete a work\nSaying but this is not a great painting it's like just a bunch of well it's just orange balls all stuck together [noise] what the top of your the balloons I guess any paints them but the top balloon it said it could take 'em a couple of years to finish she's a very delicate artist suffered another balloon you as a couple of years so\nFirst of all if you look it's in the paper today look at this piece of junk who could tell if it was a balloon missing [laughter] I was twenty seven of them sticking out who's going to even know that needs one more\nSo that's what happens you go nuts when you have this much money and even go to court yet he's probably gonna spend a million on lawyers to sue over just the so that's why the crown prince could get that insane over one tweet\nThat explains it hey if you had twenty thirty death squads that will do anything you say you'd be sending them out once in awhile\nI suppose yeah you could\nYeah you know hey the guy um drops of passing the game you'd be sent the death squad will\nBe going out [laughter] so ah the President Trump a is\nGoing to do everything you can uh you gotta wait till you got to make sure you have all the evidence before you do anything and uh hey you know we talk about this last week the United nations what the hell does the United nations do\nWhat is their role in the world serve lunch\nThat's all they do you know the president's gotta go solve in the north Korean nuclear problem\nUh he's gotta go solve this problem ... where's the United nations what did they do isn't this supposed to be what they do these kind of matters yeah where's that route raise your right and we you know they always say well what's the president do about nuclear weapons in North Korea to become his job [laughter]\nWhat is the president of every other country ethical fix the north Korean nuclear for it's always our problem and again you created this United\nNations that we could go back and watch the speeches where they created it it was going to take care of all these kinds of things\nUh like if something like this happened in Saudi Arabia they would step in and make mine yeah where are they on this you know having a peep out of them they're always yelling about when we pull out of a bad agreement\nBut when some real world crisis happens they're nowhere to be found they're all in hiding or so the Bush family can't say a word they're owned by the Saudis Clinton's can't say anything they're owned by the Saudis\nAh UN doesn't get involved in world matters that's not their field [laughter] it's all Donald Trump or now the elections are coming up that's another reason they play this up and make it look like turmoil in the world\nUh you got to vote for Democrats if you do vote for Democrats\nAre two things will happen one uh you'll have the worst committee chairman so you've ever seen is bad as these idiot Republicans are this could be worse Maxine Waters will have the banking committee\nThat's a little scary yeah I don't have to worry about a financial crisis than with Maxine Waters around them enough banking committee this nutty a far left Jerry ... will have the oversight committee or an uncle not that much you got below sea back as a as speaker so there will be hearings\nThat's all they'll do in Congress to things total gridlock they will not pass anything and\nHearings all day on everything Russia hearings you're gonna have to hear about this Russia again uh they'll have a special committee just to subpoena his tax returns go over those those ... says a subpoena everything you've ever done and I'll have televised hearings all day long now a couple of things gridlock has actually okay\nThat's actually a helps the economy if you see gridlock a investors are like that because it freezes in everything right now the situation is perfect right now economy wise or less regulation tax plan sort of gridlock or the economy will do well\nYeah OK but the hearings all day and if you live in a those crazy MSNBC hosts and CNN host it'll screwed that up you won't get to see your favorite shows there'll be running these hearings are all day and night but they also look ridiculous\nAnd the dream\nBut no he died and then that was it the show went on for a year or two in the ratings were terribly couldn't so they had to go back to the old show they couldn't figure out how to do it so they said we'll make it a dream and he wakes up so you can do that like they asked Roseanne when she came back what are you can do about Dan being that she goes to forget it was just\nYou know we'll just bring 'em back and never happened but I could never happen so you you can do that the the it only becomes a problem in syndication reruns are because then nothing makes sense\nA Jamal ... that was a really bad so all my ah Middle East experts tell me the real thing is that this Saudi royal family you get sick of it like a mafia family they're like mobsters they're like\nThe biggest my family in the world so to show he was part of all that for a while he was part of the inner circle for many years so the real reason may be that he had broken away from them he uh was you know involved with the Muslim Brotherhood he might have joined the other side\nAnd the real concern was he knew too much about the inner workings and since he was starting to tweet negative stuff it wasn't so much the negative tweets but they knew this guy knew other stuff uh-huh they didn't need that come out and go so at some point they have stopped them\nYou know normally just annoyed by the treat you can shoot the guy but usually when you're chopping off limbs with a bone saw it's

from Saudi Arabia and it probably was some funding there or not I don't trust them I Know I don't trust them either I mean they were behind the attacks but\nIf you're doing and attacking you need some
