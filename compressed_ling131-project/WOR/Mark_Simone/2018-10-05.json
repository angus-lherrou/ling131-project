I think that's what will happen\nCabinet gets in and as they start their movement to impeach Kevin uh I think a movement will begin from somewhere to uncover the facts about her and expose her and she lives\nShe should be prosecuted that was horrendous where she put the country through absolutely if its ally\n... clients sweat Nick ... has taken back everything she said withdrawn all of her

that wasn't such a big deal yeah then I said well you never get Canada got\nCandid on Monday Night it's done NAFTA's renegotiated more in our favor they are not cosmetic changes it they might claim read you the whole list on Monday is a lot of major changes there one thing he did he snuck in there the NFL was having a huge problem I don't know why he did this favor for them I think probably because Bob Kraft asked him to\nA part of the problem was the super bowl ... stuff and they show it in Canada they cut out the commercials so\nIt's like whatever ... whatever the viewership is and candidates like forty million less viewers so then reduces the rate the NFL can charge it's part of the candidate law\nThat they can cut out the American commercials insert their own in the super bowl Trump or too says it took him two minutes negotiated an end to that so they will now run the American commercials in the super bowl and the NFL can make many many millions more on the super bowl there you go that's a nice favor that he didn't he didn't have to do that\nA big rally last night was in Minnesota oh guess who he's talking about\nI don't want to mention al Franken's name okay [noise] he was he was gone so\nIt was like oh he did resign I quit I quit\nHe was the biggest idiot ... not only was he groping women he said let me take a picture of me groping them [laughter] you gotta camera

as the other person killed somebody\n[laughter] well it's still I think that well I think that's why these fights the most extreme example in the war [laughter] well I I think that's what Trump saying he gave up too soon is if you Rob a bank it's not like John Dillon jury one back [laughter]\n[noise] ah oh he talked about the NFL he Obama administration\nNobody nobody\nA pretty good pretty good he's the guy\nHe knows how to do that in the negotiation some little thing he did give surrounds you the million big things because they just do that little thing that'll help you if you do that that will help you on these big things he knows how to get your given them a little thing\nConvincing you it's going to make a big difference for you on the big things if you do this little favor first okay that's good tactic yeah and it actually works that is what are you are with North Korea he'll say released those prisoners right now to make you look great you'll be in a stronger negotiating position with those prisoners released\nIt actually works is all over ... we'll start with me oh and you something very good I like it it actually works\nUh so the big vote tomorrow uh we'll see what
