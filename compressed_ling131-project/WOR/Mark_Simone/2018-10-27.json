little repetitive I'm but I'm just fine we were I was all set to sign up for that many gap plan ask and I guess hearing what you were saying before that it's going to be on discontinued\nIn twenty twenty but you could be grandfathered in so do you think it's a better idea to do just with the G and pay that deductible rather than take the chance of taking the ad than your premiums could go up and ... years\nPeople that were talking to are saying yes yes because\nThe ideas that then you're uninsured will later on\nOr you know generally the EPA's better than the G I think slightly because of that excess part B situation but yeah most experts on the subject are saying to avoid that because of the potential increase for cause\nFor sure so that that's that's generally the consensus that we're seeing any other questions\nQuestion sure um unrelated sure um\nI also have to take my pension and I'm so undecided about between the lump sum and the annuity\nOkay so many of you have the pension decision brewing and I always do a test it's a symbol annuity test you shop private annuity companies compare that with the pension that you're going to receive if there's a significant difference\nYou can go with the pension with your company if you are not comfortable with letting your retirement resigned with your company\nThat would be one way to roll over your a lump sum pension and do an irate also let's say you have another annuity you at higher sources of income maybe your spouse's pension and gum and even a pension and gum and you want to have more growth potential that might be a reason to roll that lump sum\nInto an IRA for more growth potential so you have a lot of options at your disposal I Would look at those but do the symbol annuity test meaning if uh you know what you're going to get on a the annuity portion\nYeah pension yet how much how much a month\nAbout Nineteen hundred\nThis out and leaving a death benefits anybody or no no uh maybe uh do you have a desire to leave a death benefit anyone or no\n[noise] um yes\nOkay so that might be a reason to do an IRA roll over because you could buy let's\nSay an annuity privately and maybe instead of getting Nineteen hundred a month you get Eighteen hundred a month but you leave a death benefit your loved one stuff like that that's what we would cover in the what to do\nWith my lump sum pension revue

founder and formulate or of balance of nature this is a conversation you don't want to miss as we discuss a variety of important issues related to health I Want you to ask yourself\nHow can better nutrition improve my life Dr Douglas Howard and Susan Howard thank you so much for joining us today and I just want to ask you I have so many questions about balance of nature I don't even know where to start high it's great to be here again Hi Laura that to be back I'm very curious as to how\nThey can actually be a product on the market that's nothing but\nFruits and vegetables with absolutely nothing else in it how in the world can this be life changing and where did you get the idea for it and how did you know which fruits and vegetables to actually select for the product balance of nature\nWell started out I studied in Russia for several years and while I was there I started seeing the need for nutrition more and more and when I returned back to my practice in the United states\nThen I started seeing how lousy our diets really were when I started really realizing how important that balance of chemistry is how much a to see the deed e and back then I still believe that the was the vitamins not hormone anyways and uh\nAnd I started seeing that the necessity of balance of chemistry and so I started searching which one was the best which vitamin was the best and balance and at the same time then the the notion started coming of a you\nKnow we're we're discovering more and more chemistry and fruits and vegetables raspberry tall a course at two and a six and then all these different chemicals that we're finding had positive effects\nBut they were from different fruits and vegetables and so then I was on that path and I was looking for which of these vitamins [noise] is going to be the magical vitamin there was a day that\nThat I was like well I'm searching for the perfect balance of all of this chemistry and at the same time there's all this chemistry we haven't even discovered yet that's when I started learning that there's hundreds of thousands of chemicals just in an apple alone\nAnd hundreds of thousands in an orange and and all of them and then I went well wait\nI may be dead when we find this magic chemical I'm looking for because out of all of this how am I going to find the needle in the haystack and on top of that\nI already know where the perfect balance of all of these items is it's in our fruits and vegetables it was already made for us for our bodies and so that's when I went okay I've got to get back to that I just have to get my patients to be able to consume that\nAnd as I did that first I started trying to have them have better diets well that was like leaving a horse to water and trying to get him to drink to didn't want to drink\nAnd then and then I started having some people juice because either okay well I can get 'em to juice and get a concentrated amount well later I realized that's an extract because for example I got people to Jews but they were using mostly Karen apple let's say maybe cared apple and celery but I've had patients starting to come in with care named mia which means\nThey were turning orange because they just were consuming so much you know and a carrot juice well that wasn't healthy that we're not supposed to be orange then I started trying to figure out how to get this and then I started realizing the number one component of all of these fruits and vegetables as water\nIf I can just remove the water without damaging all of the other chemistry\nThen I can packet more dense I never imagined I could get it as dense as we have it I never imagined that I Would be able to get it down to three fruit capitalism three vegetable capitalism and have the same nutrient value is eating over ten servings of fruits and vegetables every day\nYou know what I find so interesting is what you're talking about is\nWhen I Try to eat healthy and get the fruits and vegetables that I mean it's really a process\nI have to go to the supermarket it's very very expensive where I live you have to spend a lot of time chopping\nAnd in order to keep the nutrition and you basically kind of have to eat it raw it's really hard to get ten or eleven servings a day that you're recommending Dr Howard and sell for me balance of nature is just an easier way\nTo do this and actually more economical\nIt cuts out all the shopping cleaning chopping and chilling he just swallow it that's it and there is there's a lot of chewing involved in that much fruits and vegetables absolutely so\nNow I'm not going to tell you don't need the fruits and vegetables anymore you do that but the beauty of this also is is once you start taking balance of nature it's interesting your appetite generally starts to increase towards fruits and vegetables and many people report decreases toward sweets\nOh that's a wonderful thing yeah wouldn't it be great if we could all substitute that Dr Howard when somebody does take these at ten servings a day with balance of nature what is it that they can expect to feel I mean how is it that's something so small like that could actually maybe prevent some of the\nDisease is that you were talking about and some of your literature\nWell it's interesting will have anywhere from somebody saying from minutes after I took my first dose or just like somebody flipped the light switch on and I just feel it all the way to nothing I mean\nIt doesn't necessarily mean you're going to feel something in your in your body by the time you feel something or by the time you feel a symptom you've lost over sixty percent of the function of the cell to shore Oregon and that's important to note\nSo what I really developed this was not to feel anything but was to prevent\nAging diseases was my original purpose to prevent the risk of of cataracts and strokes and heart heart attack and heart disease and cancer\nMacular degeneration and aging diseases is what we really that was the focus of what I was doing it's not a cure anything I guess that's what I'm trying to say that purpose wasn't to cure anything it's to give the body the chemistry and the nutrition that needs to do what it needs\nYour body is far more intelligent to and knows what it needs to do more than I can can force it to do something\nFor those that are just
