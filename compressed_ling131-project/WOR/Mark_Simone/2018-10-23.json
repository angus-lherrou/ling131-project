R. dot com slash when Michael we have all the videos up we have everything else and Michael I thought we leave you\nWith with the great presidential comments of all time is that a good way to go out let's do it All right here now the greatest residential statements in quotes of all time seeing them are\nThe only thing we have to ask not\nWhat your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country\nAnd of course [laughter] the care of and now if you watch the fake news to Lester Holt type fake news to keep saying over and over again the president said the without evidence\nThat there's other people in this care of in a gang members drug cartels sex traffickers are Middle Eastern which by the way everybody believes as true uh and I would think he's got some intelligence to that extent from somewhere in the White House but if\nYou watch all the fake news Lester Holt types I keep saying he claimed this without evidence so they're saying without evidence that this caravan is one hundred percent clean safe guaranteed no nobody else was mixed in there where is there evidence\nYou know I have a problem with that when they make a judgment call it by saying the president falsely well they haven't proved that fall yeah right uh he he's the president\nIn the White House with all the intelligence agencies working for him I assume\nThat they monitor this caravan a lot more closely than they're saying I assume they send drones over it or whatever they've had to do yeah or the blown up pictures and analyze them a lot of people look at the pictures of Kevin just civilians look at it and see\nThat it's a very strange demographic mixture everybody in the almost like Ninety percent of the Caribbean seems to be twenty three year old males where's the women\nAre ... and sometimes you see these meals that these young kids a lot of people then experts believe it's sex trafficking they're coming in the United states with these kids are\nGoing to probably some very desperate people in there maybe a majority of them\nYeah could be but if it's a two percent em is Thirteen four percent drug cartel one percent a Middle Eastern terrorists types you don't want that coming into the country\nI think the Democrats have something to do with it and now they're saying I think we made a big mistake because people are seeing how bad it is how pathetic it is\nHow bad our laws are they made a mistake\nIf you go down in flames in this election Democrats blame Chuck Schumer apparently he's one of the masterminds here Schumer polo see a figure Soros to send them expert Schumer apparently set a huge role even in the cabinet stuff it was Schumer plotting\nBehind the scenes this Kavanaugh thing backfired it was a tremendous disaster for ah for Democrats it got the Republicans fired up again Democrats had a lead in the polls that's all lost because the calf and then they send this caravan Democrats Soros all these types\nHave sent this caravan heading\nTowards the border and the problem is I think after looking at everything Kavanaugh wise most Americans and they're not as stupid as the Hillary or Schumer everybody thinks they are most Americans don't believe these the Kavanaugh accusers\nAnd they actually think that Americans are going to think that this caravan heading here\nJust at election time as a coincidence [laughter] we haven't had a care of and for two\nYears you're supposed to think this is a coincidence that you just it's all times and they'll get here just before the election\nThat is a ... and you have a massive mailing them\nUh and it it in a year where there was no October surprise this up and [laughter] so uh the president will send the military to the border he's already a organizing that\nThe uh thing is you're not a there's all kinds of rules about military engagement US Army in military are not allowed to do certain things in the United states however they are at the border if there's an invasion and this would qualify as an invasion\nThey are allowed to do whatever they have to do at the border that can use weapons that can do anything at the border so also be\n... this is this Chuck Schumer everything comes up with backfires this\nIs one big Willie Horton ad this will get everybody fired up on the right they will be coming out to vote they don't want these invasions they love immigration immigration is the backbone of America\nOr immigration has nothing to do with the illegals breaking into the country they're two separate things this is quite a reminder also it's going to be a big push to get the wall done [laughter] once they get the Republican House and Senate back\nAnd after this invasion I think you'll see funding for the wall I think it'll be\nIt'll really start go I I think there's really has fired up the Republican base 'cause normally they're pretty complete ... the party and powers complacent\nIn the mid term elections but now yeah I mean this is you know it's going to get people out\nAnd what was Schumer and company thinking when you watch the care of and they actually think that people crossed America's well that looks good let them in [laughter] [laughter] well I Know I don't know [laughter]\nSee the thing is I think the Democrats made a big mistake they could have been focusing on other issues like health care health care is a big issue that they could run with but it's getting clouded by all this other stuff\nYeah now a obviously this caravan is organized funded by Democrats all the New York times will say tomorrow he said without evidence that out without ... without evidence you ever stop and think it's a it was seven thousand people a lot of turned back it's five thousand people right now\nYou ever stop and think oh where are they getting five thousand meals a day yeah and they seem\nTo be fed a you know it's not easy to march a thousand miles you got to eat something now and then so somehow this five thousand lunches every day there's five thousand dinners every night there's a five thousand lunches the next day what do you think all that's coming from who's paying for that\nI'm not sure who say that you know but if he's listening check your mail\nBy [laughter] had terrible story now a lot of people under ...\nI'm going to say this without evidence purports to George Soros gets a [laughter] he lives in Manhattan in a big townhouse but he's got a big place up in ah Westchester and on this state in Bedford a there's a staff there and somebody from the staff went to check the mailbox and then there was an explosive device was actually in a box but they open to\nIts biggest state lots of woods so they took the box up to the woods and left it there and called the police police called the FBI they've got the bomb uh luckily nobody was hurt terrible thing finding a bomb in your mailbox you know a maybe a little tiny one just get rid of those catalogs\nBut you don't want a real problem and they're a terrible thing and uh some people starting to wonder is that real or did Soros or do that there's never been any hint ever\nOf right wing doing that to laugh when it's always the other way\nAround there you go no evidence mark that at all I\nHad without evidence but if you check the actual record book you'll find a all the bomb making and all of the bomb planting it's usually terrorists uh you know like the bill airs Obama's buddy all the bomb making is always left wing against the government\nJess thing that the left did this so that they could\n... writes I have no idea could have been some right wing not once in a while there's something but that's very highly unusual for that or you'd never see a right wing bomb\nVery very unusual it's usually an tell you that you know with authority anti this inside of the so you don't know we don't get to the bottom of this it's Bedford a sleepy little town one of the one of the nicest suburbs although\nFerry pouring it's the most boring place in the world every house has a mile apart nothing goes on up there\nThey have like two restaurants that are great but they're packed every night I Would assume every house has a video too I don't know I don't know it's just such a crime free area they I don't know if they would have video speaking of video they have a video of a show he leaving the embassy\nHowever it turns out this was a body double a and they apparently took his show geese clothes off and put them on the body double they think it was one of the Fifteen guys on the team\nAlthough what kind of a desk or it has a fat guy like that on the team but they did he must have been the autopsy guy [laughter] so uh\nSomebody on the team put on the show he's close and then left and then not only left but walked around the neighborhood so that he would be seen on surveillance cameras the only thing is if you look at ... he's got grey hair\nVery light here this guy has dark black hair not very smart or they put a hat on or something [laughter] uh but I don't think that fool anybody and now where the body parts turning up they found some what they think our body parts from ...\nIn the garden of the council generals all home and how do they know that they actually test the norm I ... I don't know what I mean this is from sky news I mean well this is as outlined body parts where ... where a guy who was killed next door you think it's probably saying Saturday consul general that could be anybody's potty\nParts in his yard so [laughter] that's like chicken ... she's house or something but uh they found some body parts I assume they'll DNA tests right yeah they can I Do have to go to show you lived in Washington have to go to his house here and gets you can get DNA off a toothbrush or anything like that\nSo they'll have to get off the tests that are either ... or so they just go get your like your brush your your Komen pull I'm sure they already has on hairs out of it and that's how they get in ... so are those tests that\nUh Arabic on the Turkish a had a made a strong speech about ah\nThis you know who when they catch these guys they should be tried in Turkey that sounds like fun because you had a chance between ... trial in Saudi Arabia and turkey I don't know what you'd pick there are some people still don't trust turkey and all of this you can never trust the Turkish\nGovernment people you can't trust but they've been leaking information gradually like in little trips day by day which has a lot of people thinking that they're up to something\nOr they think whatever they know they knew day one when they release it then it could be they try to create a rift between the Saudi the Saudis and the U.S that could be you know they don't like that alliance\nUh it does all kinds of robberies over there like cutter and the Saudis big rivals now their enemies are so they may may be you know one thing about the Trump Administration they made tremendous progress with Saudi Arabia\nShopping center and the Sears is big so it's usually one of their what they call the anchor stores now they're going to close a hundred and forty two these stores so a lot of these malls are upset it's not going to look for good for the mall to have the anchor store have huge going out of business store closings banners it kills morale\nUh for the mall although all these malls are dying and nobody knows what they're going to do you know when they build a shopping center a big shopping mall\nIt takes years to plan that's Fifteen Years in the planning before you even see it [noise]\nSo uh for instance in Norwalk, Connecticut there's a mall that's about to open right off Ninety five it's huge it was you know it's gonna have a Bloomingdales it's going to have an nordstroms it's going to have an Neiman Marcus it's going to well this is all planned Fifteen Years ago\nWhen there's still a retail business I I Would imagine everybody is in court right now trying to get the hell out of this deal and not do this who who is ... [laughter]\nIt's gonna be a big empty mole they'd be better off a converting it to a commuter train parking or something then it could make some money you know a ... in a fifty seventh street this the nordstroms\nMen store that open first nordstroms in Manhattan\nYes and that's a little when men don't shop that much with the big thing is to nordstroms women shop it's not open yet you know so it was supposed to open about the same time a devout opened yet and I imagine they're going very slow on construction they don't want to open this than any more Neiman Marcus is supposed to open in the new Hudson Yards on the west side first Neiman Marcus in Manhattan\nBut again that deal was signed probably ten years ago now there is no reason on earth to open any big store in Manhattan you're not gonna make any money retail is dead I don't know about that you don't know about that go in and you have a\nGood store I mean even Marcus was because there I mean not like seers empty\nAll day if you ... if you're a fugitive and you've got to hide Neiman Marcus Westchester mall nobody ever comes in there just go in a thin I've been in there there's nobody ever in there I hate to say it but you walk into the finest stores Bergdorf\nBarney's ... all you see are dozens of sales people know customers and the sales people on the on the phone's just looking at their phone that's all they do all day\nIs a very sad at a certain stores uh you know like Zara um and some of those unique low I mean that's very low priced in great stuff but low prices those are packed all the time but all the old old school stores just empty all the time\nYou know a finally landlords are starting to give him a little normally don't given on rent but not only are coming down and rent because it's a big problem for all the buildings the first floor of every building is empty there's no retail you go to find a shopping street Manhattan Madison Avenue\nIn the sixties walk up and down there two thirds of the stores are empty so landlords are now or even on fifty seventh street and other places allowing a monthly rent\nThey've never done that before that's what you're seeing a lot of pop up stores all of a sudden you can rent by the month now in his face desperate isn't it totally completely desperate uh let's see also look at the Alec Baldwin in a minute is\nA big talk show week to remember how bad the ratings were weak one where did you hear about a week to raise a Alec Baldwin the talk show Sunday nights who thought this would work in a big fat guy sitting in one of those big over stuff chairs\n... who thought that would be a prime time it away anyway we'll get to that we'll get to the ratings on that we'll get to a\nLots of stuff will get to a a star is born a we'll get to what's going on at CBS and more coming up and Harvey Weinstein of Roger Freeman the great entertainment reporter will be with us on seven ten W O R but first let's get the latest news is Joe Bartlett\nLock

they got a lot of fans this is going to be like the next Jersey Boys is going to be like a big fan\nI found it really is a you know it's interesting that we have to musicals and want to say because

Obama appeared in someplace that held like three thousand and there were a thousand empty seats he only two two thousand so to book a venue that has twenty thousand seats and think you're going to fill it\nAnd then to have to turn away eighty thousand that's pretty impressive\nHe Trump has a good road show yeah so don't ignore those or rock stars says don't ignore those figures and it was a great rally le ah Schumer Pelosi led Democrats ... idiotic stunts after another that Kavanaugh stunts screwed them up and now this caravan of illegals\nAre ready to invade the United states ... obviously nobody believes this is a coincidence that they're going to get here just at election time [laughter] charity so why they think that's going to work this is perfect for\nDonald Trump we want people to come into our country we have a three point seven percent unemployment soloist is spending more than fifty years but\nOut of the fake news Chuck Todd and Lester Holt this is insane legal immigration order K will orderly border we want chaos we want invasion we don't have borders we don't have a country we have to protect our our\n... I I agree it makes sense these are people fleeing oppression they fear for their lives mark fear the walking very slowly uh from behind\nThey will take some calls eight hundred three\nTwo one zero seven ten is the number eight hundred three two one zero seven ten you know any time as a tax cuts usually Republicans Democrats don't really do tax cuts usually a Republican president does that you always hear the same thing tax cuts for the rich tax cuts for the rich you can take all the math and show it to him and trim it's not really the case\nUh but that doesn't matter they just keep saying that the the the can't help themselves it's the only thing they say all the time\nA tax cuts for the rich to ask is are the rich so\nThe president is going to do another tax cut this is his election a gimmick ... Democrats or send a caravan invasion here are the president's idea of an October surprise is to announce another round of tax cuts\nWhich he'll do later this week or next week and it'll be all middle class tax cuts ten percent\nAnd it's going to be very interesting for a fake\nNews Lester Holt Chuck Todd ... drive up the deficit mark well that they could try that but what do they do with their usual phrase tax cuts for the rich if you look at every Bush Reagan the Trump every tax cut not for the rich sometimes you can find a dollar amount where they do hire but also a member\nOf the rich pay all the taxes the top two percent pays a uh most of the tax in this country\nThe top ah forget all the numbers the top twenty five percent of some pays it all everything the bottom fifty percent pay no tax whatsoever talk about paying their fair share yeah exactly huh so it'll be strictly a middle class tax cut I don't know what they're going to say you're right they'll probably yell about the deficit\nA deficit whenever you do a tax cut\nDeficit always goes up in the short term and the way down in the long term not the deficit but a revenue of revenue in and actually in the last couple of quarters among please I think we set the all time record for revenue into the federal government so whenever you see the deficit that is not a result of tax cuts\nIt's a result of spending so whenever the deficit high it's high that's from spending you'll see Rachel Maddow every so often put up this fake chart will say look at the Reagan tax cuts the deficit went way up and then she'll put up another ... look at the Bush tax cuts\nThe deficit went way up what she's leaving out is it wasn't the revenue revenue actually increased when Reagan did this tax cuts revenue doubled into the federal government when Bush did his tax cuts he set the all time record for revenue into the federal government so it's a deficit went up it's actually against spending\nBut you'll never hear a Democrat bring that up\nBecause they don't argue against spending they like spending that's what they're there for so right now you got spending ... hey also nobody uh made the deficit go faster and higher than the ... I didn't hear any complaining then did you\nKnow it's fun you know we need to do because the economy wasn't a good death is yeah this is bad deficit [laughter] Democrats\nAre in a horrible\nPosition that Kavanaugh fake accusers stunt blew up in their face\nThis caravan invasion this invasion coming towards the border is going to blow up in their face and the president will announce a tax cut now a lot of people are worried Soros Schumer and company half time this invasion so that they'll probably hit the border or two days before the election\nAnd what are they hoping for big confrontation\nThat's right and that the president will look bad that the military will take on the caravan and people would guess is not the way America treats people [laughter] people seeking refuge and not be turned away by the military first of all\nMitch McConnell can now seek political asylum he's been persecuted for his political views\nChased out of a restaurant [laughter] Ted Cruz has been chased out of a restaurant harassed and how did he could seek asylum under their definition did you see that they always say the videos the guy yelling at McConnell yeah in the restaurant and McConnell looks half awake to begin with but did you see the video of his wife outside the restaurant\nNo screaming at the guy she got right in his face climbing in the\n... most of the other people in the restaurant told the guy that shut up yeah yeah\nBut outside it's a great shot of Elaine show with their finger right in the guy's face leave my husband alone is a tough one I yeah that's like that a member Wendy dangling that Murdoch a trial and oh yeah yeah she choked the woman that came after anyway let's take one calls go to Glen in Long Island N.Y Glen\nHey how are you I heard that uh that the caravan it's not due to reach the southern border so December\nNo no no if that's the case of believe me Soros will send golf carts whatever they need a\nWhat are you going to cause things the shopping mall cops right around on Segway yet though no don't worry if they if they need him here two days before the election or those sorts of get 'em all private jets whatever they need to get him here\nUh anyway when we come back Bill O'Reilly will be with his new book is riveting what a book it's number one a best seller and it will talk to him but that about the caravan about the whole thing coming up next on seven ten W O R let's get the latest news here's Joe Bartlett", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Simone", "city": "New York", "day": "23"}
