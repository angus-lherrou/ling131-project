spread of the cats you also MRI of the prostate [noise] when they did buy up she's the prostate twelve corps twelve areas showed cancer\nAnd the surgeon wanted to do surgery at this super appropriate

you could open up our prostate the book because if you don't have it in color office a two and two choices two and two choices well if you look at what happened this for a Gleason a PSA twenty six [noise]\nThe chance of success is only twenty three percent so why would the surgeon that that super duper plays wanted to take this man this otherwise happy man fifty eight year old man\nAnd operate on him with only a twenty three percent chance of success which means almost eighty percent chance that cancer is going to come back with surgery and then number two Ninety seven per se\nThen chances sexual life will be screwed up and eighty percent chances urinary life will be screwed up meaning wedding as pets why would anyone in their right mind go through\nSurgery if they knew that data well that's the trick most surgeons don't tell the patients have never ever actually had a surgeon properly informed their patients about the options\nWith that data and that's why we're so different you can come in our costs will marry this prostate Brooklyn which informs so much there's so much information\nSo why would he want to go for radical surgery robotic surgery or open surgery radical

want that that's why I came to us you can look at our data for police and said cancer our data on page nine\nShows that the vast majority of men treated with Greece and eight nine ten cancer cancer

prostate don't want to be impotent don't want to be incontinent they want better results so that's why so many\nMen come to us and that's why this man's going to take off from a time from his job to

said\nThis is the work we do every day to try to give men and women and children and the best possible results that we can possibly give a woman who is from Ghana she's fifty years old\nShe's divorced

this is the word that we do here at greatest Newark\nAnd just a few minutes ago I talked about the Gleason eight cats are well here's a man born in New York City he's sixty six years old he's an opera

Lederman we're back\nHey it is to me and I want to talk about a woman who suffered endured so much this is sixty four year old woman and she was born in New York City she lives in the neighboring state now she is marriage has two kids she has a loving husband\nAnd four years ago she had bad you know bleeding should vegetable bleeding shut the DNC of ads no bleeding is not normal to post menopausal woman so it's a big teaching point she had a DNC which is like a biopsy of the lining of the ... she was found out cancer\nAnd that are doctors removed the uterus and they gave her chemo which you know doesn't work very well for uterine cancers and they gave her ... radiation read\nFor China radiation\nAnd jet all our work or one of the biggest hospitals in a neighboring state to super duper poop or hospital\nAnd then a year ago her cancer marker welfare rely on cancer markers and she was getting a cancer marker the C a one to five\nWhich is often the elevators and got a collage of cancers doubled even though it was the normal range it's doubled [noise] and she had a CAT scan with a large mass on the pelvic side all those is huge massive cancer that grew back right in the pelvis where her\nUterus cancer was obviously the surgeon did not remove all the cancer\nAnd the chemo and radiation that that big place does not remove all the cancer\nAnd she had multiple cycles of chemo and the cancer just kept on growing growing and growing\nAnd then she started another chemo that didn't work either and she had fatigue and shit penned the bones after the chemo for weight was one twenty with a high five for three [noise] she just had a scan showing progression of the growth in the pelvic sidewalk so she had uterine cancer\nHad surgery radiation and chemo and within months to cancer grew back running the pelvic area\nThan the doctors gave her more and more chemotherapy it doesn't work\nShe came here and we used radio surgery on her mass and it went away and she was so happy\nAnd why are we talking about are well for good news and the other does the good news is that the mass which has gone away unfortunately when the surgeon operated on earth seems like he's spread the cancer that cancer seemed to spread\nAnd now she has a mess in the liver\nAnd her insurance company won't let her have the treatment that she wants which is radiation they want to give her more and more chemo even though she's had came on multiple occasions and it's never worked\nShed came out when she was diagnosed in the cancer came back with a cancer came back she had more chemo months and months of came out of work\nAnd they're saying and I got on the phone and talk to the insurance company and they say well that's the usual treatment and I say well what's the usual treatment that you approve came up for the rest of her life but you won't allow or to have the treatment the only treatment of his work is that only one treatment that word jihad standard British didn't work\nShe had surgery is a cancer came back she had came all the cancer kept on growing it was only one treatment that worked and you won't allow her to have it and I can tell you this patient was live within our staff was upset and finally the insurance company had a big committee meeting and finally after weeks and weeks of\nDiscussions with our staff and myself and others finally they allowed her to have radios surgery to the mass and deliver because it's a treatment that work and it's less expensive how much is\nCable every month the Maori month is on average ten thousand dollars a month she probably spent a hundred thousand dollars or more on chemo and probably more on\nSurgery and it doesn't work our treatment is economic all we know that independent cancer centers\nHave the lowest cost which is important and may be important to you and your insurance company to society lowest cost and effectiveness\nOur achievement was the only treatment that work that stopped or cancer still to this day whereas after surgery that cancer gr right back after chemo the cats are just kept on growing as if nothing happened why would they proven agree and encourage chemotherapy which has such a terrible track record\nEven if it works it only works temporarily and then this woman that didn't work at all it was only toxic it never worked why would the insurance company promote a treatment that wouldn't work that's expensive it doesn't make sense from an economic point it doesn't make sense to promote a treatment that's expensive and doesn't work\nFrom a medical pointed review it doesn't make sense to promote a treatment that doesn't work from a moral sense this is a woman who understands she's had surgery and she's had chemo and she's had\nStandard radiation she's had radio surgery and there's only one treatment that work and that is ours so what did she get to choose the treatment especially if it as the only one\nWith a success in this woman and the success overall in the overall success and the patients we treat thousands over decades yes\nThis is Dr Lederman we've created thousands of patients over decades\nWith most every kind of tumor in location size you could possibly imagine\nThat's why most doctors say it's better to go to the most experienced doctor and there's only one doctor who's most experience with stereo tactic potty radio surgeries in America triple board certified Harvard trained at thirty for Broadway\nYours truly and so this woman finally after months of fighting with insurance and others\nGot the approval and we are now fighting for her we're falling behind the scenes to get her approval and now we're fighting to the cancer for her to hopefully eradicate this cancer that has traveled to the liver\nWe've been successful so far should a mass of cancer and the pelvic sidewalk going up to the lymph nodes of the retro prior to the ... which is at all with success\nWith disappearance of the cancer that's what we do every day at the city for Broadway Broadway and thirtieth street in the heart of New York city where we see patients with cancer and suspected cancer\nWith a family [noise]\nA family that came in a man and his\nDaughter and the daughter's\nHusband so this family of three the man and his daughter and the daughter's husband what turned out that the daughter's husband is the man's best
