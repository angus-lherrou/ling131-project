jelly news knows well up you miss anything today we invite a check out our website seven ten W. O. L. dot com slash let them I could listen to this line up\nWe have the llama running wild in Brooklyn and we've got this Instagram model who's obviously not wearing much at all but you know what this large tattoos saying all over her body\nAnd she got the saying wrong [laughter] some famous Turkish say they wrote the wrong thing and we also have some serious pictures from a hurricane Michael trick it all out at seven ten W. R. dot com mark ... coming up next year as a writer from hell dot com joke control your next chance the thousand dollars is coming up after the news thanks for listening it's ten o'clock\nHere in New York is the most most of the Fox they rated number\nKick some other way around with a bunch of this you know first of all you have had a congressman shot Steve school lease right and you know there was this story yesterday he can get too much attention but uh in Rockland County there was a guy who made a bomb a homemade bomb and he was headed to Washington and set it off\nAnd that kind of climate you can't have Eric Holder calling for violence\nYou know this guy wasn't really part is he hated everything about the country he won't he wanted to have people elected by lottery\nYeah but uh I understand there are people just hate the system but usually it's a protest get assigned a but people are getting\nMore and more violent for holder and a time like that to talk about getting physical it's it's just crazy the last time Democrats did all this stuff was when Richard Nixon got elected they got so crazed by the idea of Nixon beating them that they started marching and protesting a member of the college campuses\nAnd then I I I I was a young kid I I'll tell you the truth I was scared about Nixon he's scared me that was just a little kid [laughter] scary but Nixon was just I just the whole image that was that that he was ... as he was portrayed well\nSee that's the problem they create these images like with Trump that he and money laundering use involved with the Russians are racist they create all these fantasies in their mind\nAnd then they get everybody to believe that it's Ann Coulter wrote a book about this a few books back about they did this and the French Revolution that create these ... these these fake narratives to get the mob riled up\nYeah but he he well he was scary to me so now I can understand what maybe some of these snowflakes are going through\nYeah but you look back at it Nixon was he had been a very responsible public official for years before that he be in the vice president for eight years he'd been in Congress and you look back at his record he was not a conservative by any stretch of the measure you know he\nWas probably the most liberal Republican ever he's the guy to put in wage and price controls he's the guy that created the EPA using very liberal guy but they created this whole big narrative about\nHim he doesn't even look like a woman you know I think that may have been there well\nHe didn't have a lot of personality that that didn't help his case but that was the period where the Democrats\nThey wanted to beat him so much I couldn't believe he won and we just like Trump won by here it just barely won so they took to the streets and they started chanting and protesting and turning over cars and breaking windows and on the college campuses they were seizing buildings and then it got more and more violent and then uh\nWhat was the result in Seventy two Nixon won by the greatest landslide ever oh why you went to this play out of the playbook it never works it backfires they did get impeached\nThough well that was a different matter though he resigned eating in a beach yeah uh but\nIf you think about it this play never works you've got to get the middle that you've got to get the independence you've got to win them over and normal people are totally turned off by mobs and violence and yelling and screaming and throwing things he\nSays like children they yell and scream and then if you don't listen to what they do they kick you here's Eric falls colder sank start kicking [noise] ridiculous it's [laughter] you know if you look back and what Nixon did Watergate\nCompared to today's world all Watergate was they broke into one guy's office and tried to tap this phone yeah Larry O'Brian oh and they also tried to look in his state book to see what his appointments were that was the big crime of Watergate but a hate today's the big day Kanye West having lunch at the White House\n[noise] what's that about\nThe guy wants to have lunch it looks good it sounds good actually uh they do have some stuff they want to talk to him about you know what there's actually a big piece of legislation that getting signed today it's the music protection something act\nThe problem is the copyrights royalties or the way it's paid on music it's not kept up with the modern technology was streaming and digital and all that so there's a new bills it'll take care of the uh the Jared Kushner will be at the lunch and I'm sure they have lots to talk about [laughter] Mideast peace or a Saudi Arabia\nIs angry on Monday a [noise] a\nA Saudi Arabia or this is becoming more and more of a story now this is a journalist that they they lured him apparently back to the Saudi counseling\nHe wanted to get married so we need to get divorced he needed a document of paper he had to go actually into the Saudi embassy where a death squads Fifteen Saudi a agents were waiting to kill him not just killing\nTorture him then dismembered him a they killed them as they totally dismembered him took him out and pieces\nPieces are now all over the place the body will never ever ever ever turn up anywhere\nAnd even President Trump was asked about it\nIs very sad situation is very sad situation and we want to get to the bottom of well I have to find out who\nPeople who go in and let's see I didn't see him come out as they understand this\nWho did it [laughter] he this journalist had started to ride faces vicious attack pieces on the new uh really awful evil Saudi leader so\nI don't think we have to try to find out who did I think we know that I think the Sopranos family in New Jersey wasn't concerned about your mouth because show I think we know who\nDid this is a bad situation we cannot let this happen\nReporters anybody\nNow it was a Jared Kushner who made the peace with the Saudi Arabia brilliantly according to a lot of people brilliantly negotiated everything and a staff it's just great relationship with the Saudis\nBut uh and Jerry's apparently a brilliant negotiator lifetime and the real estate world tough realistic world of New York the ... billion dollar deal is a great negotiator of people being\nDismembered in the basement of an embassy that's not really has special down a deal killer then I I think the ads later yeah okay well I Love them but we got to do business with is only one guy well what are you going to do about it you know take\nFor instance he had three big older guys three very wealthy guys and they're kind of the guys that put putting in power way back when but then they turned against putting in recent years and they had been speaking out against who may really even took them a to court in a couple of things\nThree guys three very wealthy all separate guys now all three happened to be dead suddenly one got strangled in his house\nOne again with the sushi with the plutonium Memphis but what are you going to do all three are dead what do you do not have a relationship with Russia\nAnd what are you going to do that you can condone it you can't get into it but then the other thing too is that those were Russian guys are putting killed this he was I guess he had a I guess out guy I understand but he I think he also had some sort of American citizenship\nYeah he well he had kind of flood there and he was over most recently working for the Washington Post but when you fleet because you're afraid of the evil dictator you don't go back\nEven if you need to pay for [laughter] fear [laughter] so but what are you gonna do let's say Russia can straighten out everything with North Korea's nuclear weapons that can help us that can help us on trade what are you gonna do kill anybody London what're you gonna do you're going to say oh we're not do enough talking to you because you killed ... what's his name and London ... you're not going to do it\nOkay I got you know what your standards are I Know I'm just saying these things happen in the hey I'm sure we've had to liquidate a few people here and there I'm sure we absolutely [laughter] I'm sure we have maybe not the way that we don't do it to journalists but the it remember after nine eleven\nA lot of people started dying all over the world very fast ... and all of a sudden for people got shot in an apartment in Paris and remember I think it was was it Yugoslavia somewhere those four guys were being released from prison that we were after and\nSome other guy release but when they walked out of the car came by and shut 'em all dead and I mean these things happen and they do well [laughter] I got my own troubles I Can't worry about this so uh but as lots going on a ... a\nFBI Director re uh was on a trial sort of in the U.S in the Congress about uh the investigation into Cavanaugh a Democrats\nNow arguing it wasn't a thorough investigation you want a thorough investigation wanted dead serious massive FBI investigation let's do it on her\nLet's see what's in her past let's see she's ever been lying about anything you want to do that\nIt's an interesting idea actually American hall if and when we got stuff like that you know you got the Kennedy Center honors you've got the Congressional Medal of honor you got all kinds of stuff was going to a teddy in Yonkers they teddy\nMorning yes you know this guy again it's this guy get worse color of the worst the worst oh okay\nI Am so bad I Can't get rid of your your keep listening how do we get rid of this guy [laughter]\nYou've never heard of a who's the guy and against me can I give her name Chris plant a Christmas that's what you want to try that [laughter] um hey\nUh this is fascinating about television how many people still watch network television viewing audience in prime time all the people are watching something I mean if you're watching cable TV or network TV I've see thirty five percent wow that's very close thirty one percent wow\nThat's shocking isn't it's only thirty one percent sixty one percent\nDreaming stuff Netflix or Hulu Amazon Prime sixty one percent it's double double network TV sixty\nOne percent are streaming does that include cable or\nNo just streaming or not they are you going on in their ... their online watching some sixty one percent well hey when you talk to somebody now and they said oh you got to watch this where we're at what are they always\nSay Netflix or Amazon its\nIts apple it's Hulu it's\nKinda tough or no one side of the time you know boys so we said oh you got to watch this show where's channel seven never hear that anymore [laughter] uh\nAnd these networks don't know what the hell do they are so desperate no clue what to do so desperate Sunday night is it this Sunday I think next Sunday starts the Alec Baldwin\nTalk show oh month can you imagine if you watch the entire

you ever hear forgive me twenty minutes of ... and the salad balls and he does uh he thinks he's convinced himself now that he's a brilliant talk show host have you ever seen or heard the one he does on NPR\nWent on NPR for years he makes the other NPR hosts sound exciting what's it called the\n... some weird name to it but he as he gets these big stars on and he talks like this it's like he puts on yeah I Know they talk to NPR but those who show like this so I don't know what he's going to do on\nTV and he's got Kim car dashing lined up with Robert De Niro for the first show and Chris Christie mine would be good that Alec Baldwin Chris Christie will be riveting television watching these two fat guy's Christie he'll do anything [laughter] well it's tough for\nChristie he's got a nice little job at ABC\nHave him fulltime as a talking head and he's off and on the Sunday show but outside of that he really didn't come up with a big job of many no no big corporate anything nothing like that so uh pay the price of stamps going up\nAnd then ten percent\nTo fifty five cents you remember when they used to raise the persistence ever get all upset and nobody cares anymore\nWho knew

straight reporting as well and keep nonpartisan I keep my opinions out of it but it's interesting Tucker Carlson has a book out called ship it fools\nAnd now it's number one in the New York times best seller list ended unseated Bob Woodward's book that was there for four weeks\nWoodward's book on the first day sold one copy more than one copy per second it's the high it's the best selling book in three years according to Barnes and noble side dug a little bit deeper to step in Eighteen mark and maybe you should write a book because his status incredible two thousand Eighteen book sales for political ... is up\nTo seven percent from two thousand Seventeen which was also a good a great year for selling political books so I think the bottom line is you write a book about politics these days you put the word Trump anywhere in there and you're going to make some money\nAnd I've been a good worker hey I think a lot of liberals stop reading the Woodward book after one chapter two or three 'cause if you start reading it a Ninety five percent of it is pretty favorable to trumpet makes him look pretty sure\nUh yeah look I think Bob Woodward recalls a a fair fight I think the sources that he went to\nWe're basing their stories on what they heard from their father's brothers nephews cousins former roommate so then the whole thing sounds a lot like ... the ... fire and fury book\nAwards everybody already kind of heard this already yeah the Trump White house the beginning had all these different characters like\nBannon Scaramucci for eleven days or you can run down the list of all these different guys that were in their ah that you know again it was chaotic like any administration is when they first go an office ... this one more so so I think everybody said yeah I think I've seen this movie already\nI don't think I really need to read anymore I get it and now the Trump White house is running quite smoothly for them part and\nThat's why you have an economy where the GDP is above ... percent unemployment is below four percent North Korea isn't firing missiles over Japan and threatening Guam and the United states anymore and Ninety eight percent of the caliphate in the area that they controlled and Syria Iraq has been eviscerated so people look at the big picture\nThey say things are running well right now what ever happened in the beginning

but I probably have somebody guarding him and he has moved to a new location so a death threats and obviously lawsuits forever but he is facing\nA four years in jail that's all well\nIt's one charge a commonly negligent homicide yeah once you have four years is good will take four years of ... at least yeah so uh he's thinking of a jail Muller\nRobert Mueller he's trying to stay very quiet right now in the four weeks before the election he's supposed to go very quiet and not interfere with the election but he did get a conviction yesterday now this has nothing to do with Trump no connection that Trump\nThere were some of those Facebook trolls during the election that we're putting a Facebook ads but nothing that could have affected anything the mounts of ads and views and money they spent was so minor or they spend a total of like a million dollars over a few months like Hillary Clinton spent a hundred million on Facebook at the same\nTime so the conviction they got in the sky was six months [laughter]\nWhich is actually pretty low under the guidelines so even the judge didn't take this that serious and it wasn't really even election stuff this guy got convicted for apparently what was he he was\nHe was selling a documents for fake identity to the Russian trolls\nNo other words I guess they wanted to open multiple accounts they need different documents to prove different identity so he was selling them some kind of paperwork so the smaller now it's almost two years it's almost thirty million he spent so far we got a good look in the Michael Cohen's taxi business in Queens in two thousand six\nWe really got to the bottom of Manafort's two thousand three consulting business\nAnd we're really getting a handle on this a document guy who works for Russian trolls in California I Can't wait till the midterm elections orders heads are going to roll mid term elections are over Lindsey ... a ... of Jeff Sessions will be gone new attorney general Lindsey Graham is desperately\nCampaigning for attorney general that's one reason you so I'm so helpful in the cabinet hearings\nThan you saw Lindsey Graham Sunday playing golf with the president he uh was McCain's\nClosest person on or if he was like a son that McCain there were so close and as a result Lindsey Graham was always attacking Trump and McCain is no longer with us and now Lindsey Graham\nFuller latching on to Donald Trump becoming his closest friend [laughter] these ... that those kind of southern politicians they can be so warm me [laughter] twisting into but from what I hear a President Trump is oil aware of this and he knows Lindsey Graham\nRuns hot and cold and as a weather vein whatever way the wind is blowing so I don't think he gets attorney general I don't know who will\nBut somebody will be attorney general and somebody will clean house Rod Rosenstein should be fired I I Would bet on that because they've now got plenty of good reason to fire him he's been in subordinate\nHe defied Congress he's refused to answer subpoenas these refused to testify that right there should be grounds for absolutely and you're going to get a legal action against McCain struck page they'll probably end up with some charges on him and I bet you roses thing\nGets dragged into that also you got to fire him for failing to supervise the Mueller investigation properly\nAt the time if people actually believe there was some Russian collusion\nOr something like that so at the time that was the point of the investigation but then Rosenstein wrote this extra letters saying you can also expand the anything else you'd think applies\nAnd then they were getting so far away from the election so far into other things like Manafort's old consulting business that Muller went back to Rosen's he got a third letter or\nProving that so that's just failure to supervise he should have focused Muller onto the election\nOnto only Donald Trump or an only Russian collusion should have been focused into that he's not he's all over the map\nAnd then even this Michael Cohen stuff if I if Michael Cohen did something wrong and his taxi cab business in Queens in two thousand four turn it over to the local authorities this is not something ... should be\nOn ... and a lot of people think he was really an ugly bully about this\nEspecially with Manafort if you want to arrest them and charge him with old things from a hundred years ago and try to squeeze in okay but you don't need to throw him in jail you don't need to throw 'em in solitary confinement you don't need to break into his house in the middle of the night and put a gun and his wife face ...\nIt's just stupid and you remember Mueller has a history of blowing investigations he's got a legendary history of getting the wrong guy best example Steven Hatfill the anthrax\n... probably maybe eighty I think oh OK eighty bucks now this means uh twelve years it said yes him uh Eighteen years it's aged so there's a new mckell and they've just gotten out mckell and sixty\nMillion a bottle [laughter] kidding [laughter]\nYeah one million of bottom ... sixty so if you're a ... point lead insane\nAnd like to show off your free one of those the hedge fund guys from billions you buy yourself a mckell and sixty it's got to taste better than the Eighteen or the twelve or us right I got a better idea went to photograph that label on your ... put it on the computer photo shop the\nTwelve into a sixty you don't want to status zero mckell and one twenty [laughter] and then you put the label back on the bottle who's going to know and I tell you the truth these idiots when they taste it and they are just not twelve is is Eighteen they can't tell the difference\nWho really knows I guess if you're calling us or you would you know let's say it was ... one still not going to get drunk it's still not going to do the trick it will still work\nA look at the real estate section today or in the New York post they have a pretty good real estate section a but the show you all the new ... new incredible skyscrapers luxury buildings and I notice every one of them is in Brooklyn when you read the caption\nOn what's the new trend that there's something about the the view or ...\nOh yeah now there was the other thing uh their whatever high rises in Queens or broken but now they're all over the past these new apartment you look in the look in the post the real estate section\nYou see like a forty fifty story beautiful gleaming modern high rise and you think well that must be a lower minutes Brooklyn they're all Brooklyn look at this one it's got a penthouse yeah that just went to contract for twenty million dollars really twenty million and this was in Brooklyn\nNow you owe all of this to Rudy Giuliani you cleaned up crime in New York it's totally safe in Brooklyn that's the other thing a lot of people point out if it ever got dangerous again a couple more years of the Blasio crime comes back\nAnd it
