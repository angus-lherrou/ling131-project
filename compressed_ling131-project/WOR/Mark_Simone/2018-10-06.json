Ah yes and no you can do it Ross conversion over the age of Seventy\nYou can also put money a lot of people who cannot do or off due to them you have to have a wages to do a contributory Ross a lot of people do not have wages they do a tax favored life insurance contract\nAnd they take their arm day they pay they met the tax they put that in a a a ten pay policy and that money builds tax deferred any can pull it out tax free so there's some great strategies\nFor you for R.

podcast which is simple if you have a phone you go to the podcast link and you can download old shows just search for my name is Josh ... go ahead Joseph you're on\nThe line Josh I'm Still looking at pay off my mortgage and asked the time so I have a mortgage right now twenty four years\nLess or is it better to\nPay off some of the principal each month off the principal or that one lump sum of the actual payment if the mortgage a year which is the best way for me to do that\nWell I Would I Would first question the even the idea first I Would not\nPre pay your mortgage if you do not have enough life insurance disability insurance or long term care\nBecause if you die get disabled or I have an end of life illness and you don't have those things you're going to be a lot worse position than if you had to pay it off mortgage so we'd want to make sure that you also have sufficient savings for retirement income\nSo that you could pension eyes your nest egg and actually get a pension every year for as long as you live then we could talk about what is the best way to pay off a mortgage\nOften times if you have a third of your mortgage it's better to just pre pay\nAs much as you can but I Would want to make sure you're taking advantage of the maximum ride all Seville to you four one K. I. or right before you pre pay your mortgage cars for example let's say you put twenty rainy or in your mortgage\nYou saved three percent interest right or four percent interest\nBut then you have the right off you got you really saving like two and a half to three percent by paying off your mortgage when you take your money and you put it in your four one K. you may be saving twenty two percent because that's your federal tax bracket you may be saving another seven for your state income tax so what's better ... twenty nine cents on every dollar\nFor three to four cents at every dollar you know what I'm saying Joseph such\nHere so I don't know I'm not saying it's a bad idea I'm just saying I Would map out we have this wealth simulation tool which is a powerful you sound like somebody I Know so I may be met you may come to the office but I have a very a familiar voice so have I ever met you\nKnow yeah there's\nNo no the ... so come on into the meeting a if you're in New York New Jersey Connecticut on an island Pennsylvania\nWe could meet with you in person we ... we have this mortgage choice calculator that can show you how to quickly pay off your mortgage if that's your goal or should you do something else\nAnd we would show you so sort of like when banks compete you when we will show you two or three different strategies\nAnd then you get to pick what your you know sort of like choose your own adventure to remember those choose your own adventure books it's like that\nSo I Hope that helped or any other comments that said thank you so much\nThank you next up we're going to go to the phone lines and we have Richard who was decrying the national debt go ahead\n[noise] uh yes good morning Josh you know I Am I I'm just amazed at the lack there is no discussion of bumps and the one I mean except for ... van\nWhat about me I let you go on every couple of weeks you say the same thing\nYou think I Love John ... so we talk about it so I just don't I I got to give me some praise to Richard\n[laughter] but how is it ... no one address sushi dish\nA very critical issue of the two hundred trillion dollars in unfunded liabilities on social\nWell let let's be clear here according to the U.S debt clock dot org\nYeah we we have to get I Want everyone to go to the U.S debt clock data work there is even an iPhone app called the U.S debt clock dot org this is bipartisan there is no there is no Republican or Democrat here we have an empire of debt\nWhat happens when China and other companies don't want to buy our bonds\nWe have\nTwenty seven trillion in under funded liabilities with Medicare Seventeen trillion unfunded liabilities with Social Security\nSo people talk about should we have universal health care we don't even have the money to fund Medicare and Social Security if the government called the debt\nIf the government attacked every citizen\nIt would require nine hundred and forty three thousand per taxpayer not all citizens pay taxes if it was every citizen would be four hundred and fifty three thousand\nWe're broke as a nation turn out the lights and we're not we're not dealing with this we've got to deal with this now all the economy's good because of its bad the skin to get\nFar far worse\nAnd this is also why and I do talk about this regularly why I Am concerned about people having all of their money in the four oh one case for three bees for fifty seven and I are raise because that is a deferred tax vehicle\nAnd if you think the likes of Kamala Harris and others if they do this with the Supreme Court what are they going to do with your four one K. you got half a million and a four on care Ira you got more than most people so we're gonna confiscate your money legally they can legally do it\nWith taxation Bernice called for this I I Want sixty percent tax Ninety percent taxes\nHow are they going to fund free college how are they going to fund free health care with your ... that's why sometimes where you store the money\nIs more important than even the rate of return you get on your money so if you're like Richard I'm concerned about the national debt and that very few people are talking about it now no one's talking about it a few people are talking about it\nOkay I have a a ... in New Jersey and I got cash in there and eat out\nOn a hat and unity of this cache there so I asked him ... to a non there yeah ... ... you know we can't do that we could only ... owner tier kicking a count calories\nThat explains it makes no sense I mean here's the deal I Would fill out a custodial transfer form\nSo you could do that through us and we'll see if we can get it out the proper way okay but\nI it's probably what you're saying you're probably saying can I take would draw a new door Ross but you need to solve the specialized form called the custodial transfer form so let's say you asked me a new energy we could have fidelity that's who uses are custodian\nAnd\nWe go we use the facility paperwork to do a custodial transfer from Roth irate a Roth IRA and you only take out the cash it's probably how you're\nAsking the question when you call the company does that make sense\nYeah let me ask you a question if they did to my uh kicking a calm and I write a check to the other route that county\nHow are they can't I don't know why you would I just told to do this do to transfer for white bring you can count into this [noise]\nCats are\nYeah now you're talking about that then there's this if if you still can't do this you might be able to do the whole check thing with the sixty they roll over rule but you're a loud only one roll over per year okay\nWell hey I think saying that it can't get that into my checking account yeah but and then I chatted Charlotte checking account tonight yeah okay yeah I think I Can't remember\nIt it may be but I Would first try to studio transfer you're allowed in the limited number of\nCustodial transfers then if you can't do that because there's some weird thing imbedded in your annuity contract you know what I mean yeah but but I think what's happening is whoever's filling out you have you done the custodial transfer form yet\nNo it's called up the company so my point is how much is in the in ...\nOh\nAbout a ...\nFourteen thousand and how much do you want to transfer into the new Roth IRA that you're creating yank are amount\nSo you would have a transfer form from roster off it should be simple you might have added charted by cashing the annuity out but\nYou know that's that's another thing a lot of people were calling us today to date on today Josh for our annuity review view of an annuity or some advisors all Jay and annuities right do you call us before you do it it it eight nine at eight five six seven

IRA or four one K.\nMany of you are wondering how you can take advantage of the Trump tax plan now\nThere are two ways one is you could figure out how the deferred taxes into better a tax deferred solutions\nFor example if you do normal four one K. you can write off up to Eighteen thousand five hundred if you're under fifty twenty four thousand five hundred if you're over fifty but if you structure a cash balanced plan for your company you may be able to write off of two hundred thousand\nOn your tax taxes hundred thousand I'll write off\nSo that's an example of saving your taxes to de potentially we also are having people say I want to worry about saving taxes tomorrow I've done a lot in the IRA like our ah one of our callers today\nA and I have all this money and I are I'm Myra

because of his meds and some other things and what and he was able to become more active and becoming more active he's able to get some of his meds because he was taking bounce of nature and it's all a big cycle\nBut as that those things happen then that was an unnatural graying and so when the body was able to do what it needed to do those things reverse\nAnd so there's a lot of lot of fun things\nFriends if you're interested in in a knowing more about balance of nature there's people standing by right now that want to talk to you and you can call them simply an eight hundred two four six eight seven fifty one you're going to get more information about promo codes and so forth coming up in our next break but to write that number down one eight hundred two four six eight seven fifty one\nDr Howard the reason you and I are talking is because a number of months ago maybe a little more than a year ago now [noise] ah I called you desperately on a weekend and I said Dr Howard I have the worst flu I've ever had I've never I've never felt this way I've never suffered this way\nYou ask some questions about my my nutritional background I struggled with chronic bronchitis growing up there were regular chest congestion issues and sinuses and ah allergies and so forth it I was dealing with for a long time in fact when I was a kid\nUm I Would get bronchitis nearly every time the weather changed or if it went from real cold to real warm in a fast short period of time in fact this spring here in New York we had one of those days and I could tell my buddy wanted to to go there didn't get there\nThis time but uh you you talk to me about the difference in the spark and a flame and the way infection works in the body and you said ... which is easier to put out the big roaring fire or little tiny spark and of course the answers to spark [noise]\nUm but you did I'm impressed you remember the you oh man he made such an impact or in in you you basically did say basically your flu is a big giant roaring fire right now you've gotta you've gotta get that doused but once you do or the balance of nature with the nutrition from the fruits and vegetables can put out those sparks much more quickly\nAnd I found that to be true because then the next year and a half or so since I've been on the product I have not had any a serious re occurrence of bronchitis and when I when I feel like something starting to go up the dosage take a few more fruits and vegetables for a few days under the directions you gave me\nAnd it has worked every single time including as recently as just a couple of weeks ago\nAnd the Dutch Howard or some some of your best success stories are people that have used it and and now they tell other people about it and we've got someone like that

founder of balance of nature\nI've gotten to know both of you as men and as individuals and as someone who's not on the microphone but off the air and we have private conversations and so forth\nAnd I've got to tell you there's something so significant about a company\nWhere not only the c._e._o. and the inventor and the founder\nUh takes care of his people and treats his employees as though they're extensions of his family and really believes in the you know harboring a quality environment in that but to see that spill over into the quality of the product and how does what it says it does and all of those other things\nThere's only a handful of people in all of America that sell things on a regular basis that can make the claim what I say my product does it actually does\nAnd balance of nature is is one of the very few that I've ever run across that actually does in one of the reasons why I'm so passionately an advocate for balance of nature I've seen it work in my life I've seen it work and other people's lives\nBut I Want you to talk a little bit about the uh the integrity of the process because there had been opportunities where people have come to you or\nMaybe they were trying to pull a short cut on you and they've they've tried to take shortcuts with your process and it's actually sometimes costs you a little time energy and money\nYou've been ... a a passionate about making sure that the process stays pure the product stays pure and that it does what you said an invasion from the beginning talk about\nThat and and when I started talking 'cause I'm an invite likes to come on the microphone was her because there are some experiences that I Want him to to share with us on this [noise]\nIt's interesting as you can imagine through the years we have had company up on company come in and talk with us and I had a dear friend actually come with his dad early on and they saw the the possibilities here and [noise]\nNot knowing is a presentation of I. M. G. Americans home for college sports [noise]\n\nHis game day on the Rutgers I M. G. sports network and this is just drive dot com Rutgers football pre game show\nPresented by the New Jersey motor vehicle commission the engine in BC once you put the phone down\nLearned more had just arrived dot com [noise] our regained gum ridges also sponsored by our W J barn and is now the official health care provider of Rutgers athletics\nLet's re healthy together coming up coach Chris ashes free game Thomas Howard keys to the game and more we're thirty minutes away from ... hears Martin Maloof is [noise]\nWelcome inside high points that stadium out over a cash Saturday morning here in the Garden State the first weekend here in the month of October ... this is the just drive Rutgers football pre game show the scarlet ... back\nIn action as they entertain the finding a lot of Illinois at a big tent match up Illinois it led by head coach loving Smith comes into this one two and two other season\nLast we saw them was a couple of weeks back in a lawsuit against Penn State may offer the scarlet I wanted for on the year and they've lost border row\nAfter an opening week victory and there are two thousand Eighteen campaign against Texas state let me welcome aboard my broadcast partner once again Julia ... mayor Julian there's a lot to get into into on kind of wine with this team for the scarlet I it's a let's first and foremost called you about them all offensively\nMuch more competitive effort last week at a loss against Indiana right here at high point dot com stadium what do you take away from that gamble offensively and defensively that Chris Ashton is staff can build upon going into today's match up against Illinois\nOr one of the first thing that I look at is the ability to spread the ball around to different receivers I mean we we we see here that do art art gotten about about seven different guide last week right and it was a good thing which is a great thing and and they didn't have a ton of yards each but when you're able to provide a a a defensive look where you don't understand exactly where they're going with the ball\nAnd he's still ambiguous for them and make some big a little bit more slow them down allows you to do some more things you want to get done\nAll right so that's not often spreading the football routes a cascade get a little bit more comfortable in the pocket the one thing if you want to be able to run the football with element or with three and blacks year\nYou've got to the office of line has got to take a step forward especially against Illinois this afternoon also protecting the cascade be as he got knocked around a lot took a lot of hits last week against Indiana\nFor sure you have to you have to run your face in the summer and I think what's going to help or against a team or like Illinois who struggle tackling last uh last game against Penn State is running the bar running of opening the ball and that's because of climate when somebody's getting into your face like that you can do a little play action pass it's going to get a little bit more time 'cause it's hard to transition to a pass\nRussian mostly actually pass on the defensive perspective but obviously\nYou know it it's very simple you got to run the ball and often divine has to has to ...\nAll right how 'bout defensively what you saw last week in Indiana to build upon\nThis week against Illinois the I Know obviously to start wasn't or what we wanted we scored burst into you know they they went up big in terms of score but you don't come back and put yourself in that game um alternatively if the defense isn't making stops a ... you know making stopped getting getting off the field and given officer chance so\nObviously deepens needs to do a lot better than coal ash booted to it in the post game conference on third down I mean we were doing great on first and second down a but when they're down we have to be aware of what the stakes are a little bit more to\nGo to the oh yeah of course of course and we spoke about that beforehand in terms of the rugby tackling simian coughing you have to come out with energy to tackle well you're not going to run through another man if you're not ready to\nMore mad at me\nReally swarming to the ball like a rock\nIs All right how 'bout Illinois I'm you know aspects of Illinois game that are that are positive for that and that could cause a challenge for the Rutgers saw Scarlett I just have\nTo look we talk about a Rutgers defense of mine who was relatively immature right we have to guide their two guys from last year playing on Sundays right now I'm In Illinois would like to do with reduction and that requires a ton of discipline discipline\nFrom a defensive line I mean getting off of blocks and making a I don't think of the noise the team who wants to throw the ball down down the field too much but they do trust when they're skilled players to make late so we have to tackling\nIs going to be used but also I discipline from a deep into the front the front seven\nAm I Do Illinois is make no bones about it you mentioned you know they've got an athletic quarterback likes to run\nThey want to run in a loving Smith has basically made it perfectly clear they want to run it so they want to win at the point of attack in the office a lot to be able to push the scarlet around\nYeah of course of course and then I look and you got to do it you know everybody has a plan right everybody has a plan but you know I ended the authors of the deepest divide that come out and make a statement a God like Trevor Moore can't get sucked up by the play action packed and and that starts with stopping the run initially and live in confidence and the guys around you but um but like like you were alluding to earlier\nMan you wouldn't want it any other way especially as a defensive lineman like book you come across it pushed me off the ball where the figure it out\nAll right do you think this is a competing groups going into Illinois got taken out in Illinois this afternoon\nI don't I don't I don't know if I Would say copyright it's like how I'm going to get together group I think is to get I think is a group who saw spark up oh okay like second at Indiana that we can build a pike yeah oh this is you\nKnow this is not as bad as we thought this could be right it's like you don't want to think like as a player but no I don't know how confident they are but I think they definitely got a taste of some of the things they can get done if they play together\nAll right so if you if you get that how difficult digital for Eighteen to look at that half Julian new being a former scarlet I say All right let's look at it I'd have to look look at a step is that half and a half and how difficult is it to replicate it at the start of the very next scared as its Treme\nDifficult extremely difficult 'cause there's a whole bunch of emotions in swings in the game that played into the fact that they were able to do that but nonetheless it's like you don't want to get hung up on like that you know we didn't get it done\nUm in in more in the back like okay we did the right way and we shot ourselves and to put 'em in our last defensive possession right but uh you know as a scholar now you have to come in and you have to figure out what you did positively not even look at the first half of that game and then come out and play ball and understand Illinois a teen you beat last year so they come in and thinking about\nWhy magic it's also a wave of emotion a a nobody wants to get a Paris nobody wants to lose you come in there everyone's got a competitive spirit everybody wants to win the match and that's the case of you look at that second half\nAnd maybe it was the wave of emotion and getting out played in half the number one where they played much\nBetter and a half number two but taking that emotion at the start of a game especially against Illinois today\nFor sure man I any we'd everything from a defensive perspective a guy like beyond the Roberts meaning that locker room a you know some of it can be mistaken for a majority a lot of time and sometimes it is\nBut you know in terms of coming out having fun dancing you know we're talking trash after a tackle\nThat's what gets the team going right like I have another guy right nearby when we made a bunch of guys in the mouth and visit Illinois a team of the you know let's let's not make any bones about a day coming in you're confident that they can be to Rutgers team has been a little shaky over the last few weeks so I think it's a great chance of regular soda or would you rather\nBe the seed coming off the by week or continuing their seats\nAnd whale by we continue that you didn't because it's different hitting a different color on the by week you're resting you're trying to get your body right so it's an Illinois\nYou could make the argument of fresher team coming in today no no I mean\nWe're four games again just to see the ... were ... game to five year old and you know it's like you know it is but it is and I think coming off of a game where you're going a little bit more confidence and you're a quarterback\nDefense you're finding your identity a little bit we're seeing a little better place from a a couple of different guys I'm not worried about it I'll tell you there's Julian is feeling confident decides whether he is at an all week last week was out in Arizona\nIs back in the fall of these that are really good this week is the Illinois is in town to take God or your scarlet I said the Rutgers pregame show is brought to you about just drive the NBC wants robot you maybe you're by the we'll put the phone and just try to get the facts and share thoughts of just drop dot com thanks for listening to the doctors pregame show brought to you by just\nDrive Julian will give us his keys to the game off ... defensively also up players to watch as well but ah earlier this week by the voice of the scarlet ice Chris garlic caught up with Rutgers head coach Chris ... thanks\nBark and the line I don't know what this thing this afternoon and coach take me through this week of practice it last week your team made some progress but I Know you're so frustrated with some of the mistakes that they were making\nYeah we we thought we had a lot of opportunities to a player best football and they have a chance to get a victory last Saturday but didn't work out when we just make too many mistakes especially critical ones on third down that costs as an opportunity you know so when we went back to work out we had good practices Sunday Tuesday Wednesday or Thursday\nOr just focus on her cell phone ... focus on our fundamentals are execution and we'll go out here again on Saturday ... whereabouts came\nTo us it looked like an art really took a big step forward resent the case\nYeah I think art or played more comfortable um I think he went through his progression of trust is for protection a lot more made some good throws a took some hits got up and and kept going and I think the game has slowed down for him after five games in the really happy to see that\nPart of you know progressive player development and I'm as that continues he continues to grow that'll continue to put an even more\nOn defense and struggling in that department however the guys who have had to play more especially on the defensive line handled the extra physical load [noise]\nWell it it's it's good to start what happens though is uh when you go through a game and you're pointing eighty snaps and the game you know for defensive lineman that's a lot and we don't asking him to do that but we don't have as many guys to rotate as we would like so you know they take it it takes a toll on them in the second half but especially in the past rush", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Simone", "city": "New York", "day": "06"}
