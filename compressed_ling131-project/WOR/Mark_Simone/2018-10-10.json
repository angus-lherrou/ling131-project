I mean this is a tough guy so uh this ... no relation to the old ... but this cause Yogi decides he'll ride vicious articles about this Saudi ruler\nNow is not good for your health is it if you are this guy's insurance company to say [laughter] the I have to pick on him so much it's like if I just started writing newspaper articles the most vicious articles about Newton\nDay after day after day after day I Would expect to be a getting some ah plutonium in my sushi villains yeah so [laughter] this ... I mean really vicious articles about this Saturday a ruler and then he's in Turkey wants to this show he wants to\nGet married it's very important to get married but he needs a certain paper to finalize this divorce so he goes into the Saudi embassy of Saudi counselor in Turkey and they have because it's accounts that they've got those video surveillance cameras everywhere obviously security reasons is surveillance you can see him go in but you could watch\nTen days of that surveillance tape and you don't see him come out [laughter] come out so or Saudis announced mo he left we saw we also I'm leave he left the building twenty minutes later but you can't see them at tapes\nA from Turkish intelligence our intelligence we hear that a death squad or Fifteen people was sent to take care of this and they were waiting for them in the counselor and in the embassy and believe it or not and most of those kind of embassies those kinds of countries in the basement they have the torture center\nIt's built in there they have a torture chamber in the basement so apparently they tortured this guy dismembered the guy one member of the team was even an autopsy a expert who knew how to dismembered prop\n... so a little here a little air yes so\nIf you do watch the surveillance ... see a lot of people leaving with briefcases trash bags\nShopping bags so that's how he left now this question is what is the president going to do about this he got so a chummy with the Saudis made such deals with the Saudis was going to do about this guy what can you do and what can you do if you can't prove anything and you will never find the body 'cause it doesn't exist\nWhen he was seen American citizen his Turkish but yeah I already had the eat\nWell he is the last ... citizenship and the U.S he might have because his last couple\nOf years he was basically working for the Washington Post yeah but you will never find the body there is no body it doesn't exist as we get they get away with it in his body is in pieces and now it's in the ashes and now it's in\nTwenty countries some of it was actually brought to New Jersey\nFor that a butcher shop the Sopranos Ron Paul walnuts for el you receive a real for the [laughter] ... or whatever it's called so you will never find the body you will never prove anything this guy will never turn up so I don't know what you can do about it

so good right then apple came out with the best looking device ever with the greatest speaker ever but not good at all apparently it really stinks the software is bad\nOr Amazon came out with that echo a long time ago the software is phenomenal you have to remember that's how Amazon when it's a software thing when they first showed up remember there was Barnes and noble online there was Amazon on line\nAnd Barnes and noble was a much bigger company Amazon had the\nBest software anybody ever saw you could to two clicks and you had the book\nBarnes and noble you had to be clicking clicking and typing and putting in all this Amazon had better software that's why one it's going to win this home pod stuff his the software is better it just works better but you know last year there were given away these elections as such cheap prices the prices were so cheap on these Alex's\nOr that the people now realize they were just they were trying to give them away they were taken a loss and every one they want it to just dominate this space\nSo how do you pay for a they raise the price now\nWell because if that's not it's not so much about raising prices will still take a loss on all these this is called the they're saying if the race for space they want to conquer space in the spaces indoor space and once you are\nThe ... more homes than anywhere else you can make all the deals 'cause it's going to eventually be you're going to partner with the appliance manufacturers the TV manufacturers to sync up with them so once you're in say eighty percent of the home you're going to

the average person no me either me had to be to get elected mayor but remember he wasn't getting elected mayor mark green was\nTen points ahead but in the final weekend he made a terrible mistake ran an awful commercial that\nHurt him and Rudy Giuliani had to jump in and campaign for Bloomberg Rudy Giuliani it was after nine eleven was\nA huge hero of the time he got um the without Giuliani\nBloomberg couldn't have one so I don't know about that\nOh absolutely go back and study that race he was ten points behind until Rudy went to work this is right after nine eleven you

running for president he's\nNow announced he's out he's not running but see I I think there's a segment of the country that\nWould welcome a boring businessman as opposed to you know this tweeting or insulting mocking\nGuy all go again here we go again the tweets are the key to winning [laughter] is this is what people you know I think they all don't get something\nThey everybody was sick of this system they were sick of the swamp there were sick of these globalized sing signing these trade deal sign everybody's jobs away a throwing a health care plan that's overpriced and called bloated and they would they just wanted this whole system busted up\nThey were looking for a bull in China which you well you could do this without being sold not you know you can't know you can Trump is right you got to go just go slap 'em right in the face you've got to be a noxious\n... about is what we've got [laughter] it's working or talk about winning you got the stock market very choppy right now but it's the all time highest stock market ever last week NASA that totally read done with Canada and Mexico\nUh not that much the Supreme Court now conservative five to four ... quite a winning weeks here\nHe has but yeah I Know how everybody as well you shouldn't do this you shouldn't do that they shouldn't do this you know it's like you ever watch Aaron Judge it's a weird swing yeah you know ever go to you know you shouldn't live there's a ... foot life at this time we just had fifty six homeruns leave the guy alone he knows what he's\nDoing Starbucks would you buy stock in ... bucks right now\nNo I think they're pretty saturated Maria and it looks like that uh Howard Schultz messed up the whole company\nHe wants to run for president to do for America what he did for Starbucks critic dumpy looking place where people just hang out and do work all day so I don't know enough because somebody turning around ... somebody said but I don't know a William act\nWhen he's one of these big hedge fund takeover guys he's now though it's all over television that he's buying store but he's in Starbucks he's a huge invest during Starbucks or just tell you some\nBut these guys like ... smart guy but usually when they're all over television what you know they're in it means they're about to get out and [laughter] looking for an exit they want you to buy it so they can put another product yeah they need something else a Dunkin donut everybody thinks that the hot one because\nIt's got nowhere to go but up like a lot of people think some company Coca Cola or somebody will step in and just by that and turn them into the finally the competitor for Starbucks you could clean up these Dunkin' Donuts they all look\nLike like a like a train wreck you what would you would you go there for salad yet they actually well you could you could fix that you can put great food in there you buy another company's good great food combined the two and a Dunkin' Donuts is better coffee than anybody\nI'll give you the coffee but I mean that their main draws a\nDonut not really people go there for coffee and first of all you can fix them up you know you walk in there they look horrible everybody you know lose all suicidal lady there waiting for the leaves and kill themselves look miserable it [laughter] you could fix this up so\nAnyway when we come back or Bernadette Castro will be with us he's always very interesting we'll talk to her about the judge Kavanaugh all the stuff that happened this past week but first of all by the way you have a chance to win a thousand dollars rather for news at eleven o'clock but first let's go lose lose your job or\nMark Florida governor Rick Scott says it's too late to leave he's telling everyone to hunker down wherever you are with hurricane Michael expected to hit the Florida Panhandle early this afternoon it's a category ... storm could be deadly with up to a hundred and forty mile an hour winds and the storm surge of Thirteen feet\nFormer Mayor Mike Bloomberg could be inching closer to run for president after more than a decade as an independent Bloomberg announced this morning he's registering again as a Democrat in\nThe family of limo driver at the center of the deadly upstate crash says it wasn't his fault family of Scotland is Nikki ... says he often complained about the vehicles that he drove for the company and there's word the limo failed inspection last month because of an issue with its breaks\nNext update at eleven breaking news one started today with Len Burman and Michael read all in the morning six to ten tomorrow I'm Joe Bartlett on seven ten wor\nHurricane Michael about two and make its way on shore in the Florida Panhandle as a major hurricane\nSometimes ... almost ... New Jersey or well you know what I mean\nYeah and that's why I was like Bloomberg I mean look I don't know\nWhat's going to shake out in New York here and a couple of weeks you know Cuomo's got a lot of money\nAnd mark ... is a great guy I'm Sorry he you know just doesn't have enough money to saturate TV but you know governor Cuomo's powerful he's probably going to win although who knows no one thought George Pataki would win either it was unbelievable upset that happened in the last\nTwo weeks of the campaign so it's not over till it's over but\nLet's say Marc Maron our does not win it for years\nI Want Mike Bloomberg to be governor of New York\nHe could win it we love him the state understand see him he can run under any party he wants I Would want him to run obviously selfishly as a Republican but he's a Democrat and now I don't know who can beat him in a race for the governorship\nHuh well but it just explain this again so a Mario Cuomo was very popular governor and what did you do in the last two weeks to turn the race around\nHe actually um went public that there was a conspiracy against him too when I'm led by\nYou know now my good friend and also governor Pataki threatened led by Rudy yeah and because Rudy had a fear that senator D'Amato would end up running the state which was not true and of course governor Pataki proves that and twelve years senator motto did not from Albany I was there I Know\nYeah by Rudy was a very big figure at the time so in order to turn that around you needed a Rudy type figure to jump in I don't think ... has been very like the\n[noise] um no really wasn't for attacking Rudy was against the tax oh [laughter] yeah he was for Cuomo\nYeah so that was a very complicated last two weeks that we would need a lot longer than three or four minutes to explain yeah\nBut nevertheless you know they talked about October surprises you know we're not to the end of October yet but it's a very difficult race from all an arrow mainly because his name id name because he can't raise the money you know I ran for the Senate in Ninety four and no one thought I could do it nobody would give me money and I got forty two percent of the vote\nAnd then senator moynahan resigned retired opening for Hillary so if people don't think you can when\nThey don't like to plunk their dollars down you know what I'm saying so it's a tough it's a tough go from all on our [noise] but you know people have to get out and vote you know they just can't sit on their hands if you can't give the guy money you got to go out and vote you can cross party lines and the general I don't care what you're\nRegistered as well you know in the general election doesn't matter what your registration as you go in and vote for you well\nYeah but you know the certain senators or whoever that may be ... Gruber politics but they do whatever you want if you write the checks and so those big donors give money even if they're on the other party they'll keep finding assume 'cause the guy will do whatever you want to\nYeah but that's a really then I find public servant okay so if you give big dollars to a candidate kennel will the candidate probably accept your phone call when he is elected\nWill his gatekeeper say you know I'm Mike Bloomberg is on the phone I think you should talk to him of course she'll talk to him Mike Bloomberg asked you to do something wrong which he would never do but let's say did you don't do it\nI don't care how much money you have you and you know when if you're that kind of public servant yeah there's nothing wrong with taking a lot of money\nBecause of television advertising the cost is ... on your mental men that's what drives these campaigns crazy with the money raising it sought to pay their staffs are for poles or even for the groundwork it's for the television and radio by the way you guys are not much\nBetter you pay your rates up you know we really we little retailers and big ones don't have a chance to buy during the election season\n... I don't know if you notice we have like a long commercial breaks as it is we don't have space beer commercials we've got to charge you more\nI Know it's it's crazy radios great I've always live radio\nAnd what's the judge Kevin wasn't it you got to say one thing but then with real boy he will stick to his guns and backup somebody in number ... ... if you want you\nAll here's what I think I think from the whole judge Kavanaugh experience that we all experience there are many life lessons\nThere are many bad decisions that teenagers make boys and girls and these were teenagers and you know I wrote to my five granddaughters after that and I said to them I don't want you to write me back I just want you to think about what I'm saying\nYou got to make good decisions and you have to understand\nWhat is it really one beer I didn't put this in their email but\nIf it was one beer that she had it's hard for me to believe that she didn't know what car she got into her who ... who was her great escape out of that house she remembers coming down the stairs who remembers the thumping on the wall and escaping out of the bathroom coming to such detail memory yeah\nBut you don't remember when you got to the front door what happened so it's based on facts\nI think she suffered something terrible\nAnd I think what happened to the protest every young woman the or older woman that was ever sexually molested and never reported it wanted judge Kavanaugh to be their victim in other words payback\nFor all those boys out there and I asked grandsons and I have told them you must respect when why do you go upstairs to a bedroom what are you going to do it they're play monopoly I don't think so\nYeah there's no reason to go upstairs these are kids and I think she had more than one beer ruined owes me stop Brett Kavanaugh go up the stairs\nI think you're right they wanted him to be the lightning rod for all this but I don't think it was him I don't think he was there I don't\nThink that was him either I Do believe him and there are not enough facts to substantiate her but it doesn't mean I'm not sympathetic\nAnd the other thing here's what all women have to do I don't care you got to be courageous and you've got to report it a minute if the day after the morning after the night of you cannot because you're afraid to tell mom and dad and that's what she said she didn't want our parents of the things she was out drinking or she was at a party not good enough\nYou can't wait Thirty years you need to get it on record immediately\n... good points a bird that ... that were out of time but always great talking to you\nUh same here mark you take care of it and\nI hear oh and in return on the Web page we got some great stuff up here today or this song ...

up even more he's like rattling their cage he wants to screaming like maniacs there's no way they can win when they're like that when they're angry mobs go back to Nineteen sixty eight you can see exactly the same pattern they hated Nixon kind of like they hated Trump he was just a repulsive figure for them\nSo they took to the streets they start screaming and people in restaurants they started to ... you know marching in front of buildings they were out in the streets they were really really radicalized really turned off most Americans it's not about Democrat or Republican most Americans find that behavior repulsive\nSo not only the push them towards Nixon Nixon won in the biggest landslide ever in his reelection\nAnd not only did it help mixing when violence but they got so radicalized so crazy they ended up nominating the most radical guy they could find George McGovern the guaranteed the Nixon landslide so you're going to see the same thing here\nThey are going to turn
