Miami surgery surgery the best has for Gleason they cancer this is figure three page for a book with only has a twenty three percent success rate for Gleason they lied to cancer so it's a big reason

hemisphere finding radio surgery you can also call Dr Lieberman at two inches killington for free and farm in Brooklyn and DVD hey Dr Lederman why\nWe are back let's talk about this gentleman is sixty seven years old he has two children and dwell kind of cancer right in the middle of his face about two years ago the cancer in the middle of the face he went\nTo a super duper big hospital they found this way most cancer and they cut on him and they cut like a big circle on those right side of the face and the entire right side of his faces deformed\nHis mouth is deformed as ours to form the faces deformed\nAnd why is he coming to me if you had that big surgery well the cancer returned\nRight where the surgeon caught in the middle of his right face and it was by obscene and it's the same cancers claim is cancer and he went back to the same doctors and they were ready to\nCut on him they were going to cut off the rest\nOf his face others right side they've already formed do the deformity is incredible and the sad difficult for the patient came to me and he heard about our ability to treat cancers without cutting out bleeding without that surgery without anesthesia invisible beams and I saw him\nAnd I try to practice what I preach and I said well\nWe need to stage you up we need to see if the cancer came back anywhere else as a little bit like in my home state of Iowa where they overrode tracks liberal tracks and they have a crossing and then all of a number of them but number one two three one two three is to tell you how many tracks that are are in case that one train goes away and you start going across the track\nAnd all of a sudden you get hit by a second train while the number of trucks is to warn you and just like the number of tracks to warn you in my home state of Iowa when you have one cancer coming back\nIs there a second cancer and so like I always say to get the staging up to see where the cancer is that we stayed jump this fence remember he saw the surgeon set a super duper big place are ready to cut\nOff his face even more than they did a couple of years ago we staged them up\nAnd what we found that the cancers already traveled to a lymph node under his chin so now is this cancer like a rock hard piece of cancer in the middle of the surgical field but now he has cancer has traveled to the limb but also the big the forming surgery\nNumber one didn't help him cancers fact number two the formed him\nAnd he'll never be the same he'll never be oh God made him and number three the cancerous traveled to all lymph allowed\nSo thank God he came to us we were able to stage 'em up before it was going to have a second to forming surgery we found that cancer the for his cancer we found the second cancer and he wishes to have us treat him for the ... cancer it's right in the middle of the surgical field this is the work we do\nOur success rate is very high unlike chemo which all the ... in general works temporarily our treatment generally works with a high degree of success permanently\nFor the rest of his life and that's what he wants and that sort of course we're going to work for to try to eradicate this cancer right in the middle of his right to face right in the middle where he had this to forming\nSurgery and this is the work we do this is why so many people with\nNew or recurrent answers come to us every day at\nThirteen before Broadway where we accept most insurances Medicare Medicaid I Want to talk about a gentleman who Seventy years old he's married he has a son and he was fine until about three years ago you had blood in the year under the ... that's just ask the teacher brings system does lead to work for bladder and ... in\nScope is the scope and his bladder\nAnd he had a non invasive cancer and then they get the second time we had a non invasive cancer and the third time and the doctors wanted to give them a chemicals to go with the bladder and he declined but then he started dating raw fruits and they felt better and\nHe's got a new tumor and well he thinks that the tumor came back because you stop eating raw foods well raw foods don't cause this kind of cancer and raw foods don't make this kind of cancer go away he's got a new cancer in the ...\nAnd he needs that remote we need to know if that's invasive cancer or superficial cancers basically two\nTypes of bladder cancer super ... show which is usually treated\nSuperficially and then the invasive were the surgeons you show I liked to cut out the bladder and that's what precipitate so many people to come to us because they don't want their bladder revoke that don't want their way of life for ... that's why you came that's why this man Seventy year old man with his son came to us and he's an\nEx smoker and we know the smokers have higher\nRates of bladder other cancers and\nRight hand he got a few treatments with us and we see many people with skin cancers and I showed this new patient the treatment of the last patient that we drew earlier on the year and his cancer is completely\nGone away and that's what usually happens with our patients who have pinpoint ... no ... no bleeding\nAbout what this man not want to have surgery well number one who didn't want to go through surgery near the mall was MOH us most surgery and a half sliced sliced sliced thinly sliced is going to cost them a thousand dollars and that I was covered by insurance and\nI was going to get all the way down to the bone then they're going to they want to take out a piece of skin from his chest and stick on this hand well most people don't want to have slices of their body cut off as a thousand dollars a slice like salami most over to not want to have a piece of their chest\nSkin color often stuck on the other hand like a patch\nMost people we see want to have non invasive treatment no coddling no bleeding no anesthesia and that's the work that we do and we treat were so many people with skin cancers space will sell since ... cells and care toy can comb with others anywhere in the body whether it's in the face the eyes is the\nMouth and nose or even the arms and legs back this is what we do every day and so for this man he's now learned and he didn't learn from the surgeon who is going to cut on them you think that the doctor would get tell them all the options something we're supposed to tell our patients is the rest of the benefits and the options while he was\nNever told of the options and this is what\nWe do every day and he's going to go home and think about that he saw the pictures you saw their patients and\nHe got our booklet his car broke with has pictures of patience with skin cancers this is the work we do every day at Thirteen eighty four Broadway whether skin cancers or brain
