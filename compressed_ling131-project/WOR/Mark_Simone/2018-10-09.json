I was one of the departments are so that has the story so far [laughter] [noise] so anyway I remember we did a story last week about ... be\nAnd she was arrested because she broke her this you know yeah our tribute something at a at a at a bar tender anyway so I'm at this um I just permits and the and the DJ at a DJ ... played the song\nWalking like I was walking down the talking while\nWe were playing out so I turned to the table that they all had all the old farts the back you know as far away from the D. J. ... said yet so I started in San jose\nOh that's Carty bees boy from that's off said he said\nI didn't feel like I dropped out of outer space [laughter]\nLarry offsets the boy and he's he goes to the ... days have landed at AT Kearney beat his people had no idea would be there about why cardiac arrest like how the heck\nLend bourbon do you know who these people are that's where they think it was a funny moment but that was the song you know obviously they played the clean version\nThen we have to ... the weekly we play the clean version Tehran so they're really in the heart socket like a bucket whatever it was before we go we just have to mention that Hitler's relatives among out as a nice warm Long Island story a the Hitler's relative ...\nOf Hitler's great nephews still alive and all three are living out on Long Island and they were discovered there by a German newspaper I'm One of them Alexander actually spoke to the newspaper and said we're Republicans but we're not crazy about but\nIt just looks bad the mailboxes to Hitler's\nOh they are they have the yeah the first thing they say that there was killer and that that wasn't so smart it'd be Hitler but now they have something very ... and they don't fly the swastika and they ... they apparently they have American flags on the one hey we're at a time Elvis anything today checkout sevens and W. O. R. dot com slash\nThat's a big step became right out and said it's a hoax the whole thing was a hoax and you know what I Believe it I was like him I thought maybe\nSomething had happened uh she got the you know mistaken identity thought it was him I think it was a total complete folks and I wish you I don't think you'll do it but I Wish she would call for an FBI background check on or let's find out her whole history I think the whole thing was a hoax ...\nHe think he was referring to a doctor for lying yeah\nI think she was going on now you can say well we can't talk like he can't say hey\nHe saw the FBI report [laughter] he saw the report I\nThink he saw something in a minute let me tell you something else you don't think it's peculiar it's almost a week later tomorrow will be one week you don't think it's peculiar nothing has leaked out from it FBI report\nIs a little strange is only one possible explanation you got the slimy is creatures on that committee they leak everything even leaked original letter how come the FBI report as an leak that only one explanation it's damaging to her [laughter]\nUh-huh [laughter]\nBelieve me if it was anything imaging about Gavin a New York times with having on the front page I got a hold of it they got old they stole Fred Trump's tax returns you don't steal this\nYeah absolutely the only possible explanation of why nothing this is the first time in the history of major thing like this has leaked out what twenty five senators involved only one explanation it's damaging to her\nNot him a\nI think they should be a more thorough investigation of her let's see what she's got this which he's really gotten her background now the problem is you might say well what Neil Gorsuch wasn't such a crazy commotion there didn't matter to them\nBecause he was replacing Scalia we've come to think of the seats as this is a conservative seat this was a liberal seat so he was simply replacing Scalia it made no change in the court in this case it was a liberal justice being replaced by conservative so it changes the\nBalance of the court now it's now five for conservative court until the next one [noise] I think they've all rain\nSomething these Democrats listen they arrange this fake accuser this whole hoax I think\nThey've got somebody made up to look exactly like Ruth Bader Ginsburg I think I'm Serious I think a Soros is financing and operation they have people in our house with her at all times if she dies they remove the body\n[laughter] and replace this other one I don't think you'll ever find out if she dies I'm Serious [laughter]\nI think that's perfect place here at the ceremony last night they were she was passing out again yes makes Hillary Clinton look real blessing didn't wasn't quite sure if he knew where he was a well she does it it we have it up on the Web page today by the way if you're not familiar with this she's passed out in public being drunk and admitted to it she admits she was\nDrunk on wine or passed out of the state of you have it up on the Web page today but the ... first of all it's just\nThe way it is now the court is majority conservative and these are young guys Kevin uh and uh uh Gorsuch so this this is for decades and if she goes uh seeing in we've all seen the list the other ten names they're young a ... it'll go for decades as a conservative\nCourt mention how ugly that will get this\nIs why they're so crazy right now this is why they're so insane this messes up the whole\nSalo Lenski thirty year plan they had that they were implementing they had all set for Thirty years what they were going to do a and by the way this is all organized we now know the protestors the Kevin protesters were paid\nThe names of the organizations you'll be reading them they're starting to leak out what organizations paid the protesters guess who's financing then it wouldn't be the million dollar question and who wants to be a millionaire it'd be the one dollar question so or investigate the hell out of this woman get to the\nBottom of it uh and you know another thing happened over the past week there's a huge faction of the Republicans that hates Trump it's mostly the Bush he is the Bush crowd the global is the are also a lot of these commentators you know the rich Lowry you\nKnow who they are all those a Republican or conservative commentators they ate Trump and never like Trump he won a lot of them over in the last week a lot of them are now coming over to his side they were very impressed\nWith how he stood by Kavanaugh and didn't blink didn't flinch through all of that the one thing I've always noticed that the Trump Organization\nEverybody that works there's been there Twenty years twenty five years ... anybody that works for trouble always tell you is the greatest boss he's the best employee takes care of his employees stands by people I think you saw it good demonstration of that in the last two weeks who else would you think Bush would have stood up one of those kind of fire or switch to another nominee\nOr they quietly would've ask Kevin withdraw yeah\nThat's true I mean 'cause ... it did get ugly it got\nReally ugly or so a lot of the never Trump or ... are really impressively he not only stood by cabinet but when he saw the cabinet was starting to lose the battle that's the night he went out and that rally and started imitating\nA well he didn't imitator at all but he mocks the testimony of Dr Ford\nOr any said later he said I could see it was slipping away I had to even the playing field for him so that was a big thing he did\nA the most presidents wouldn't go that far out on a limb for something like this [noise] now there's nine other names on the list of who he would appoint to the Supreme Court Soros in company and all of these people have funded massive opposition research efforts into these people who every picks up that list next they're ready to go with the smear campaign\n[laughter] a next will probably be the woman Amy Coney Barrett\nWill probably go with her that eliminates probably the meat to stuff but they've got all kinds of dirt on her on a Catholic stuff on her being part of a Catholic called and all this weird stuff so that's coming up next day the president flew with Rod Rosenstein uh yesterday ... what is is it looks like it looks like news coming in\n... a CNN is reporting Nikki Haley's resigned oh what's that all about\nWell I don't know a president expected to speak at ten thirty in the morning it says here Nikki Haley resides over Fox is now can confirming wow Nikki Haley resigns as UN ambassador\nUh I Would guess it's probably a result of that un traffic [laughter]\nWhere are you all round here you are in Manhattan\nJust so bad the traffic laws for two weeks ago she works at the un and she lives in the building a block away some mentioned the nightmare she went through for those two weeks trying to get any place I think that's the reason I don't know what the reason is\nLoan I don't know see I thought he was going to pick her as VP candidate now know that he would never pick her why she uh I Need to be good and it should be okay it was on again off again with her a couple of times she double cross to always remember is that stuff now a well we'll find out we'll we'll see uh\nShe hasn't officially resigned sources are saying this but uh she'll put out some sort of statement for president will speak at some point wow and let us know so there's a job open a for somebody up there we think Chris Christie is calling him [laughter]\nYeah right [laughter] imagine him as the UN ambassador [laughter] I I have\nNo idea what it could be I don't know what it could be an ... often it's the disagree with the president on some policy I don't know what that would be although he hasn't been great with the UN that makes it tougher for her\nBut on the other hand you shouldn't be great with the un it's the most horrible organization in the world they get nothing done look at the present working out this a trade stuff getting us a better deal with Europe giving us a better deal with China straightening out North Korea with nuclear weapons that's what the UN is supposed to do\nThe president shouldn't have to do any of the UN doesn't do anything you know but that's what they should be doing they should be settling North Korea or do we find out anymore\nNo we'll find out if you're on what's behind this ...\nIn a few minutes a has a limousine hey remember yes they played that Schumer clip\nYou weren't here Schumer was trying to cash in on this a limousine stuff when the terrible tragedy occurred he immediately said who is that how can we exploit this how could retire cells into this and get some political points out of the memory made this press conferences fake press because we talked about\nHe was going to start to put in some regulation on how many inches ... yeah what does that have to do anything and he told us states turnout something's wrong with the driver it's going to be a drinking thing there's something\n... and it has nothing to do with the science of all how many exits there are\nSo let's say it was twenty inches shorter that that that would have been better what was that this would have been the same outcome yes Schumer or his fake attempt to exploit this for political purposes\nFailed fizzled are now turns out everything you imagine the the driver was unlicensed do we we still don't know about the drivers a drink drinking or drugs or anything like\nThat and you know the toxicology report is not back um but you know he does have a checkered past in terms of arrest\nAnd yeah I mean there's no way the drivers should have been driving also the car didn't pass inspection one of the things that flunk Don Was breaking\nA breaks weren't good in the car it was coming down a hill\nAnd they say was going sixty miles an hour in Iran that stops at this is I'm just a regular street sixty miles that had to be the driver another car well yea for probably both bad driver breaks don't work well\nAnd one of the people in the limousine was texting their friend and end the tax complained about how shabby the limousine was right so if it was that shabby inside it's one of those um\nShe just wanted to get the hell out of there she could still at some point take a job in the administration or do something else maybe she wants to run for Congress or senator or something or a governor who knows but ah\nIt is a ... have you ever been in the un yes is it not only is it a horrible institution it's one of the most disgusting buildings ever it's still the same as when they built yeah you see that general assembly looks beautiful magnificent a place to speak\nOr every other into that building is a total dump a government buildings look I'm Better maintain them and holding its dilapidated decrepit uh so if the president speaks will uh will bring it to you\nHey Anthony wiener may be out early on good behavior they have that in the federal system or you can get fifty four days off for good behavior if this guy was capable\nOf good behavior you wouldn't be there if that's the whole problem with him he is incapable of good behavior but apparently if you take away his phone he can do it and he's done it so far uh this is a ... he would get out in the spring of two thousand Nineteen\nDon't think he's really employable they're you know I mean you think he can be a political commentator you think anybody would hire him for that ...\nThe only problem with him he could be good at that but he always loses his temper you know Sean Hannity used to have them on a lot and and he'd be good as the debate or he's you know you can come back he's fast but he'd always get angry and set losing his temper and get ugly and start saying stupid things and\nBut this is the era of me too I mean yeah you don't get employed after\nYou well he's not to me to guy\nOh he's an improvement in the early but it was all tax plan is to say they will [laughter] well he does have the under aged yeah go for it but I'm technically he's not cheated at all and his wife I don't know\nMany of the Supreme Court ruling on this if it's just digital if it's just texting is that cheating I guess it is but um [noise]\nUh if he gets out I I and the other problem I don't know if anybody want to hire him\nBecause one of these these one of these guys were at any moment or you could ever relapse and get arrested again you remember he got caught in Congress he was at Congress when he was a big famous congressman lost everything lost his job lost everything almost lost his wife wiped out completely you figure all that all sober up a guy and\nCure him and then he's running for mayor and\nGreat in the race so you think well now he'll never do this again and then he did his you're doing it that nightmare we gave the interview to people magazine it's all behind me and I got over it and I was doing it that night [noise] uh maybe learn something new in jail\nYou could say well jail concern\nHey there recidivism rate is huge so I don't think this guy could ever be cured once you do that you're always going to do that you\nThink when it gets out they'll say no cell phones for a while\nA that could be part of his uh ... you know if if we were smart that's what you do just never allowed if you'd have to get among senior citizen flip phones where you can't do anything on it [laughter] but I Would date of rice yeah yeah just a phone although but\nThen the wife leaving the wife has gone yeah and now he's free to actually date that's the only problem is now free to actually\nGo out with a woman so ah [laughter] if you're flipping through bumble and you see that face pretty soon [laughter] there you go so ah let's get a call ... who's got Michael good when we moved here from the president and we'll keep you up to date on the breaking news\nUh but we'll get to Michael good when he'll be with us next on seven ten W O R let's get the latest news your job\nOr are they mark Nikki Haley out as you and the bachelor no reason given President Trump just tweeted that he has a big announcement with Haley at ten thirty I Will bring that to you when it happens unclear what is going to be announced so investigators looking at the wreckage of an upstate

wrong and how would corrected\nYou ordered the ordered a year ago amid a large number of believes in cancellations next update at eleven breaking news once and so today we'd Len Burman Michael read all in the morning six to ten tomorrow I'm Joe Bartlett on seven ten W O R\nLots of clowns around here to the afternoon a sprinkler a shower or not out of the question at Seventy six more clouds expected tonight lows tonight near Seventy a morning sprinkler a shower tomorrow then clowns open the door for sunshine Seventy eight another round the rain and thunderstorms on Thursday with a cold front mid seventies for highs\nClubs this hour Seventy one at wor\n[noise] good to everyone I run in San on Wall street and mixed market this morning the stocks trying to recover from the sell off we've seen recently as higher interest rates have played Wall Street and also affecting global markets overseas markets were down sharply China trying to stimulate the economy while also supporting the value of its currency something that\nIs at odds from a policy perspective so we saw Asian markets move lower European markets come under pressure\nInterest rates backing off as the stock market has indicated the fall at the open the on the ten year treasury backed a three point to one percent after touching three and a quarter earlier this morning or some pressure on the stock market is higher interest rates drop money away from stocks and towards bonds\nAnd as a consequence we had a bit of a risk off open this morning\nThough the major averages have come off their lows in fact the NASDAQ turning positive of about twenty points it early trading meanwhile papa John's maybe getting a suitor try and a huge hedge fund looking to buy them out possibly amid all the management turmoil the pizza maker has seen over the last several years I run and sign up for New York seven ten W O R\nUh there is this still feeling that somehow they screwed up that of course the Russians did it but that\nHillary Clinton should have won that election uh and so she has been denied and so this is another chance for her and I think that is not an insignificant factor in twenty twenty\nBut don't you think most Democrats realize now that she's tired old bureaucrats she's crooked she's corrupt that people saw that that if they go on with anybody else they probably would have one\n[noise] um most Democrat she said do most Democrats feel that\nI I mean the lay of the politicians\n... the politicians are are different I mean I think they are you know\n... a you have so many democratic politicians running and twenty twenty that it it's hard to know where the center isn't and frankly\nThe ... the larger the field the better for her up it's somewhat like Donald Trump and twenty six teen and twenty Fifteen and twenty six team where he he didn't have a majority but he had the largest single block of voters\nAnd as the field shrunk that block grew\nOr something like that could happen to Hillary she could\nYou know maybe maybe Cory Booker and and Kamala Harris H. have five or ten percent of the crowd maybe Joe Biden has five or ten percent maybe Andrew Cuomo has two or three percent\nA bit of Hillary Clinton has thirty percent or thirty five percent or forty percent who is going to beat her and so I think that's going to be the challenge for all the others yes she's tired yeah she's corrupt yeah she lost an election she should have won and\nAnd she is not exact they call it herself the glory and the last two years as I wrote Sunday a nonetheless this is this is hard math you've got to beat her and I don't know who the terror one on one\nNow we're talking with Michael Goodman who's calling will be in tomorrow's New York post if you missed the Sunday Komen Hillary and all this\nOn line you go there and let me switch subjects mayor de Blasio besides turning Manhattan into a homeless camp now he wants to this thing where you'd you'd you when you're born on your ... you don't have to have a gender you can just put acts and you could a self evaluate what is wrong with this guy\nA lot [laughter] but [laughter]\nBut he's another one of those twenty two and a while to base\nA look I think that a mark when you add all of these things up you know the homeless issue uh the letting you know deep criminalizing a lot of crime so people don't get locked up trying to close Rikers Island\nUh getting rid of discipline and public schools now trying this racial quota scam and public schools\nThere's a lot of big changes are happening in New York City right now and many of them are experiments with the new social justice progressive policies\nAnd I it's hard to say that any of them are working a I mean do you look at the city and it is clearly declining I mean people are still coming here people are still you know that the economy is still strong thanks to Trump primarily thanks to the financial system a sector\nWhich are pumps a lot of money into New York\nBut when you look at what the Blasio is doing there is no evidence that anything he's doing in schools is working this homeless policies are clearly a failure the congestion issues that he created with a lot of these stupid bicycle lanes everywhere and and that sort of thing\nNothing is really working that he's doing but it keeps doing more and more of it because we're like guinea pigs here he's he's running this big experiment on social policies in New York City look at this case where the uh\nThe post features the ah the ACS case where the the the the\nOne child is dead another is a severely beaten up to the post reports that the cops are not sure whether the father or mother did at the father when he committed suicide but\nThe mother they've got attacked saying that she's got a she's kind of really beat the kid a the boy a but but then ... ... listeners paragraph\nUm um\nThe little girl died at the hospital had bruising in open lesions across her body as well as evidence of older and ... injured\nAt least one ACS administration for child services worker had visited the home two days before\nBut claimed the kids were fine well how\nIs that possible I mean that's the kind of government we have a huge government but you send it send a social worker to hell whole house and they say everything is fine how is that possible that's the kind of government but what's the Blasio doing about it nothing nothing doesn't care he's not involved a\nThat's the kind of government we have that kind of mayor we have you asked what's wrong with him that's why I say a lot well uh I\nGuess the good news is he doesn't really go to work very much maybe a couple of hours in the afternoon [laughter] uh\nYeah but you know what is it interesting that the homeless advocate cornered him and his gym with a camera and he and he ran away from her a this remember this ... this is the same party that likes to harass Republicans in restaurants and threaten them and all of\nThat but when it happens to him as a well an gauge he runs away from her and has as his bodyguard shield him from\n[laughter] a Grammy were great great well\nYou can read Michael good when every Sunday and
