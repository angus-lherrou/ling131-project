so\nWhat does the wacky doodle story All right so some people love Disney Parks so much\nThey want to stay there forever and when they die their loved ones take their ashes to Disneyland really and spread the to the point where they have a cleanup crew specific job is to sweep up ashes that are left all over the park\nNow do they how does a valium cleaners wait a second this is the ashes back yeah because apparently it's a very fine guess what I Do with that was the guy who put up with the ... when they planted in the\nFlower bed there's no they they throw it into the pond at the twenty thousand leagues under oh now the question I have for you is what right do you think gets the most ash a ride well the traction\nRight the attraction that I'm going to go with a small world because I think one one shot you can be all over the world oh that's an\nInteresting point which I saw him would drive me nuts even I Can't wait to get her out well where do you think ah go space mountain no you're\nBoth wrong the obvious answer is the number one attraction Disney part is the haunted mention ... where are you going to put your eye on land shit I Want to mention is wonderful\nI Know Joe six years old my first time in Disney World Disneyworld in Florida\nWe go into the haunted mansion and I freak out even before you get onto their I guess when you're going oh the ... with all the things on the ball is changing the skeleton yeah so that some Disney employee comes out of nowhere in sweeps me out with my grandfather to the secret toward that\nLed outside oh you were that they were that frightened so you missed the great and you got a victory for the\nWhite it so you missed that you miss when you leave that are on hurry bat\nWell several years later\nWhen I made my second trip to Disney World when I was probably about Thirteen that was the first round they wanted to go on but she says hurry back\nRight back to the shore to bring your death certificate\nI loved the hunted high made it looked like he was a ghost sitting next June that yeah oh yeah that was kind of Puerto Rico and hey a check at our podcast it's seven ten W. R. dot com slash Michael every day we put the whole show on podcast you can follow us and you never miss out got some great stuff that Michael found for the site today\nOh yeah we got the adorable video of the er the horse that's not feeling well in this tiny little cat puts out its pointed strokes\nAnd the horse feels better and I just want to shoot the most well been looking at one of the guys shooting the bear that doesn't get shot and goes after him still\nAll right we also have gr rock from the patriots hot girlfriend who's gonna be a Sports Illustrated you want to check that out to be disappointed so ... coming up next year next chance the thousand bucks is coming up after the news thanks for listening ten o'clock\nA a glove to fire the guns that way there's no fingerprints on the gun but way back when when you put the bullets in he didn't use a glove ... going to find a fingerprint sometimes on the the casing the bullet\nSo that kinda stuff they'll take the stance of very carefully or you don't lick stamps anymore they're usually peel off and you put them on but sometimes your fingers are on the stamps they'll go look for anything fingerprints on the stamps or sometimes there's DNA you never know on and on blow but we'll see so\nIt's going to be interesting because it does look pretty organized\nYeah it looks a very very organized again a very rare that there's a right wing bomber I mean the the ... bombers or left wing guys you know like a Obama's buddy their bill airs that is a tool of the left the bombings you can go way back to abortion clinics but that was a year to go back fifty years for that\nBut generally is left wing and why would they do it now it's not just the October surprise for the election over that could be part of it but if you've been watching ah MSNBC CNN New York times all this stuff last couple of weeks say we're in panic\nAbout this mob labeled it got stuck to Democrats for all their uh antifa and overturning cars and screaming in restaurants and breaking windows\nVandalizing the Manhattan Republican club that mob label really got to them and the president everybody picked it up they were using these slogans mobs versus job so they were trying to get that mob label off real fast\nAs the other thing is if this was a right wing person ... where's the motivation you would not if you supported President Trump sent bombs for the Democrats so that they could go out there and claim you did\nYeah there's no motivation and again a law enforcement guy said to me it was your bombers never miss\nThat obviously it's as if they put an enormous label a bomb and this package there were trying to get caught and you don't send six in one day easy\nYou know like the anthrax attacks you know that you spread it out a little more but it's amazing the fog of war yesterday a lot of false reports there was a false report it went to the White House not true governor's office false report\nTrue but that that can happen coma wanted one yeah that can happen\nBut are they speaking of fake news this New York times they just make up stories are they going to vote by the president is using his personal little iPhone\nAnd the Chinese and the Russians are listening to his call first of all I can tell you it's not true there is no personal little iPhone the president or if it's daytime or from the residents will usually call you\nFrom a land line when he does call he does have an iPhone it's not his iPhone it's a special iPhone similar to the one Obama used it's an iPhone made by the\n... that some kind of special iPhone the government an apple make together it can call you\nIt has a phone number and it can call you cannot receive a call it cannot receive a text it cannot receive anything into it it can just make the call\nThe store and like I actually I kind of believe it but the story says that he doesn't want a Kelly to know who he's talking to these are his private calls because anything that he makes officially is logging Kelly knows who he's talking to these he makes on the side so that I that is enough\nTo land on that iPhone a Kelly ... first of all the facts of fake story from ... unless they got this three months late\nAbout three months ago Kelly was completely neutered years have been sidelined marginalize a member at some point Kelly was going to go he is going to get fired and I don't know what goes on in the head of General Kelly but he decided he wanted to be there\nSo he caved in on everything Kelly does what he told doesn't get and then he's but he's way doesn't run anything he goes to the gym twice a day now he's often that he's got like a double ... schedule jelly are completely neutralized a couple of months ago he is not bothering anybody any more [laughter]\nSo ah and again Obama used the same exact um and in that same bone but the same kind of iPhone I Would assume\nIf the government went to all the trouble to make this special iPhone it's got some protection in it so the signal can't be detected or listen to or something like that but Obama used they yeah they I guess they ran out of space they forgot to mention Obama use the same lifestyle [laughter]\nMaybe they didn't have time they could you know ah I think somebody should follow the big class action lawsuit against the media CNN MSNBC especially in New York Times\nFor dereliction of duty they're not reporting things like this caravan for instance\nUh it's funded heavily funded you know it's five thousand people\nWalking twenty miles a day in the food and water medicine where it's all that come from well there are enormous\nTrucks loaded with food for five thousand medicine water and they're being re supplied every day\nAnd there are organizations paying for it and the president of Honduras yesterday put out a statement saying left wing groups he knows exactly what's going on our funding this caravan ... ferry expensive\nYou ever have a wedding for five hundred people what does that cost yeah try feeding five thousand people every day so not getting caviar in champagne hopefully might be alone you know they sort of out of Russia there might be a desert trucks so ah but where's the media on this why\nAren't there covering the amount they investigate\nAnd I asked someone about where they get in the food and the resources and the story I got was that they call they use a an app WhatsApp to contact the town that they're going to and then the people there mobilize and provide a donations\nFake news there are videos that have been shot you can see them on line of these beautiful state of the art trucks and medicine and that actually shadow the care of and they come right alongside they have the food already to go in packages and again president Honduras yesterday\nSaid he can confirm left wing groups are funding this there's several organizations in Honduras funding this\nUh in under ... during law you don't have to reveal your donors but he has some way of knowing and confirmed by the president Honduras what more do you want\n[noise] I'd like to see it on NBC un I Believe it\n[noise] speaking of not seeing something on NBC [laughter] last night it must have been I don't know eight o'clock I tweeted out that's it for Megan Kelly\nA looks like the end nobody's buying her apology tour I heard there was a staff revolt last night\nEverybody hates this woman now let me explain some people that you you you know I've picked on her indication of ... on occasion as some people have asked me this personal I have nothing to do with Megan Kelly or you know she used to come on the show here are a number of times and I was always very nice there are always very friendly with her in real life I don't think\nI'm trying to think I think I've spoken to her once or twice never\nMore than five seconds just Hi how are you that's it a way back when uh nothing personal with her I've never had any\nAny bad or anything from her personally so he's a but she's ... she's totally evil ask anybody that worked for did you ever have one of those people come to work I said man or woman suddenly come to work in your office usually in some site or executive and you can tell they're evil\n... or or sometimes it could be a ... in any position but they just cause problems everywhere they're out to screw up everybody get everybody step on everybody if you see them coming every once in a while you get one yeah yeah this is the ultimate one everybody would look at Fox when she was towards the under contract she decided\nTo leave shifts six six months left\nThey paid her like Seventeen million just go now to get out of the building is so bad for everybody so apparently there was a staff revolt yesterday at NBC she\nUh there was going to be a rerun today than they announced she would come in and do it live she's under a Trump under fire this week for her racist comments she made a bunch of racist comments the other day then tried to apologize for the apology didn't work\nThen it was going to be reruns today and tomorrow but because of the controversy and she was in so much trouble she decided she would do the show alive today to explain herself a policy number six but\nEr and they had the gas coming in all the guests were told to arrive a but for some reason that show is not on the air this morning rule was pulled the last minute there's now a rerun on\nSo she was prepared to go to the and live\nWhile the guest say they were called and told shows on come on in this so something happened and she is not on the air and I don't think she'll be back\nAnd several people I think even Roger Freeman reporting they're talking about somebody taking over on Monday [laughter] tonight I'll rogue are given back to show run\nYeah actually they had camera and hall you remember she was you know I resigned as you know she's not that well known she's okay but it had much better ratings and Megan Kelly like thirty five percent higher ratings than Megan Kelly\nProbably for one third the price of bring her back the reason she left she had a deal for a big syndicated show of her own by a major producers name was Harvey Weinstein\nThe ha ha [laughter] boy what did she get it [laughter] so uh that wasn't\nGood so we've been of course are we got in trouble is Dorrie the company is still going to handle it costs about a week later oil company was gone so I think she's available maybe she'll come back but I don't think you'll see Megan Kelly again there's going to be expensive\nAnd it was just like a Fox they have like Seventeen million or something left to go or tend to they will pay it just get out of the building here take the money just go it's worth it to get rid of her\nThey was right they are really a shooting range so ah\nYeah many many years ago and now it's just is it just it dispose of low level of slows is that the place they are\nAnd where are you in Connecticut now all it stands right now\nSo it went from a Bronx with like a like a Bronx Tale like sunny and a a\nBailout has it ... from the original area\nSo your wife are ... Stamford, Connecticut what a cultural shock it must have been\nPaid a lot of my way to slide totally retired and good health it happy\nOak Florida good you're going to get there just in time for the new governor and the huge tax it will be on you\nKnow I don't know that a little bit of a huge tax\nAlright well thanks for calling I don't know about this guy you know in a ... actually looks like it's close to the polls although I haven't checked these ... almost always the rig so that puts Republicans would attend point disadvantage they just use very little Republicans in the samples so uh but I have\nA feeling people will just you know you you talk about these estate with no tax to suddenly have taxes I have a film people turn out and get rid of this feeling Gillum has almost six point lead yeah but if the margin of error is a or the or the rigging his ten points now that means he's probably a little ahead Kennan Brooklyn what'd you say can\nHey long long time know talk to you you should look I called in to actually ask if you thought it was even possible because I didn't see it in any of the reporting cut the like the left or the gamut irresponsibility\nI I'm I Believe it was a a it's a left wing false flag operation law enforcement people some I've talked to believe that to a you know of course you're not going to see any reporting on it because the New York times Washington Post\nAh all the uh the Democratic controlled media you know they don't do their job they don't investigate anything uh hey I found law enforcement people tell me they think it's a left wing false flag operation I'm sure they could to they've never ... exam and you know they're very careful not reporting about the amount of explosive\nOr or what the package looked like they don't want to go into too much detail on that because you start to look at that package it's like screaming I'm a bomb open me [laughter] that's not usually the way it's done\nA and the one address the CNN was to John Brennan\nYou rented doesn't even work at CNN no I Know they actually works at a is it MSNBC\nAnd I think so yeah he has a contract that's where he works funny how I miss him and be seen as a mix them a little suspicious of none come on MSNBC didn't get one of these\nUh anyway we got lost to get you a check or we'll get to a um ... are coming up a hate just more on the Megan Kelly as I mentioned there was a a one of the reasons you could see she was leaving that it was over\nHuge staffer of all this has her own staff yesterday revolted\nThey went to NBC management said it's a toxic environment they're disgusted by her\nThey were assured by NBC that they are not her staff that they are the staff of the today show and that they won't be going anywhere are also I noticed a lot of the uh NBC people on Twitter as making Kelly was being attacked plenty of NBC people in their own name we're clicking like on it\nAnd Lester Holt did a hit piece on our on the nightly news last night on her a racist comment so\nIf Lester Holt and I'm sure he checked and she got the okay to do that hit piece she's gone a most likely by I picked by Monday\nI think well here's something before the end of the week coming up next Chris Matthews will be with us hey don't get mad I Know that crazy that MSNBC but I Love Chris Matthews he he's a good guy in real life okay in real life he just plays in not until you [laughter] but he's a great author got some great books and we'll talk about all of this stuff coming up next\nOn seven ten W O R let's get the latest news here's Joe Bartlett\nMarket

A. representing her so [laughter]\nThat tells you something I don't mean to laugh but she's so evil and it all goes back to I think we should put this up again on the Web page the moment where it ended her career at the beginning of the end of her career\nWas that first debate in the primaries\nThe very first primary debate was on Fox Megan Kelly was there a hot shot at the moment so they made her the debate moderator do you remember she opened the debate\nWith the ugliest attack on Donald Trump it was a kill shot right for his head you could argue that the questions were appropriate but they should have been toned down a little more a diplomatic and it should not have been the opening question\nOr in that whole exchange by the way that whole exchange uh probably did more to help Trump win than anything else because it was the roughest attack ever in a debate\nHe's a newcomer an amateur first debate ever I'll put the clip up again if you watch the way he battled around that the way he handled it it really impress people do it in fact you know that book or win big we\n... you know oh it's one of those big books like every executive reads how to there's a whole chapter breaking down with Trump did how he responded how perfect it was but from that moment on she lost everybody the ... she lost the right\nAnd people said you know when you do that you think the leftovers and embrace you they never do man without a country and that's her staff revolt last night so uh as they sit in the godfather who said it was the ... you won't be seeing him any more [laughter] it's I think it's one of those kind of deal I think you've seen the last of her [noise]\nSo ah no reports on any uh any other bomb anywhere deniro early this morning\nAnd then we're too in Delaware\nSend to well Biden ... now they think they were or they found no they did they did find ... yeah earlier there was the thought that he probably would be on the list and sure enough as soon as this started they were\nGoing through postal facilities intercepting them before they got anywhere near ah the house of false report yesterday about the White House it didn't go there false report about Governor Cuomo getting a bum never happen although\nUh there's now a report that he he said he got a device in the mail well he did he at the news conference he said yeah he said there was device they've they've now said what the device was was a thumb drive that somebody sent ... I I don't know I mean is there a thumb drive that looks big enough to be\nNo no I mean the world's smallest bomb but it was just a thumb drive I don't ask me I don't know why I said that uh deniro course or has not responded yet\nA building where the Tribeca Grill is great restaurants like a trip back a landmark and above it it's offices that's where Harvey Weinstein had his office that's where the Niro has his office so it was addressed to the nearest office you also lives in Tribeca so uh\nI I don't know I mean this and he's a great actor in real life not the brightest guy in the world very low IQ guy in real life a lot of people I've talked to several law enforcement people who believe this is a false flag operation\nDone by the left they were really in panic the last couple of weeks and if you've been watching MSNBC and CNN\nYou could see the panic they were doing hour after hour after hour trying to get that mob label off the Democrats had been labeled a mob\nFor all the chasing people out of restaurants overturning cars vandalizing the Republican club screaming in the streets and teeth and the president they picked it up and that was becoming a big slogan mobs versus jobs they were frantically trying to rip that mob label off themselves\nSo if it was a false flag operation this would be the reason just to undo that\nThat would be a huge mistake if they did that huge huge\nBut you gotta catch whoever was behind it first ah when you talk to law enforcement guy so they've set a couple of things to meet privately\nIf it was too weird the way it was done the ... were made to look as suspicious as possible usually a real bummer wouldn't do that I mean they got the brightest yellow envelope you could get\nThey printed the labels with an enormous uh letters or they made a way to uh the is the device had a legal explosive and it's not much\nJust enough to be detected but not enough to do much damage\nOr the device had wires hanging out it was trying too hard to look like a bomb also usually a bomber tries to terrorize you don't send six six in one day you send\nOne every day for six days that kind of thing so we'll see a it's at the Quantico, Virginia FBI lab right now we'll see if they can find anything on it some DNA some fingerprints\nYou never know it's it's possible to figure this out also it had to be delivered at some point to a\nPostal facility or a mailbox is something means checking surveillance cameras and all of that just got to be a picture of some of these deliveries well the deliveries from the post office to the buildings were by mail man or a New Yorkers by courier\nBut it's it's a figure out what mailbox it was put in actually so and get remembered certain places you know if you went up in the suburbs to a mailbox there's no surveillance camera in New York there's a surveillance camera on every street every block\nBut if you did it from the ... the return address on these was a Debbie Wasserman Schultz his address\nAnd believe it or not they may not have a post a post office markings on the novel up I didn't realize this but when you send really odd shape packages they can't put it through a ... or a machine\nAnd so it's not going to stamp a post office stamps all over it or markings and sometimes it's done by hand but sometimes it isn't it just gets sent with nothing\nMarked on it so they won't know the whole route of where it came from ... so I'm not going to find this person yeah hopefully they'll find it don't be surprised if it turns out it's a left wing operation false flag operation\nA oh they they have the debate last night for a Menendez and who can did anybody watch it no you live in New Jersey and you didn't want to go through this a debate by a by the end is and who who do we hear who won\nWas they both\nGot good shots and I think yeah Menendez a who's a sleazy sleazy guy a accusing ... of everything the how do you see them you can or you can you can\nUh let me see if we can find a clip or to a ... where was it on and that's the problem\nOr an M Jersey network or something that I think so nobody even in New Jersey nobody knows where you find a New Jersey network a ... minute is\nI'm running because we deserve better Bob Menendez has failed and embarrass us\nOkay sounds good sounds good last thing we need is a grainy drug companies see elbowing to solve healthcare and our nation [laughter]\nThat doesn't sound like a great comeback greedy drug companies CEO first of all every senator takes money from drug companies uh believe it or not the biggest lobbying in Washington

stop the corruption\nI mean the New Jersey you still have four hundred corrupt officials but it's one less [laughter] and that'll help they all of the transportation commissioner by for yeah as I said a good guy doing a good job he's now talking about they're going to try to do something about all the food\nThat people eat on the subway I Do see a lot\n... I Can't believe anybody could eat even when they drink coffee in the subway you remember that Seinfeld episode where George took a book into the bathroom at bottom level and read it and nobody would touch the book after that it was at a call your toilet book get it out and who could eat anything on the subway you know I understand yeah you said people do buy for himself\nSaid he saw one guy eating a roasted chicken and throwing the bones on the emotion that yeah well [laughter]\nThe big problem is in the subways are basically homeless camps homeless panhandling begging all over every subway every train every car all the time and so the food is a problem but I think they do something about the homeless first what do you do about the food from\nI'm so we'll keep waiting I mentioned this will go very fast and the next few days\nOr they may be able to track something down to find somebody [noise]\nHey only a in democratic left wing world could this happen you know a Nancy Pelosi has a daughter what's your name Alexandra policy I think or Alexander ... something like that and she does these documentary she's trying to be the new Ken Burns but political documentaries\nAnd she's got a new one coming up on HBO they're promoting the hell out of this and you've seen her on all the MSNBC and CNN shows talking about her documentary and or the Democrats are waiting to watch this it's fascinating\nShe goes out into America and talks to normal people about why they're voting for Trump or why this is natural normal people it's cold outside the bubble\nNow only elitist Democrats could need to watch a documentary\nTo find out what are they like these Americans out in the middle of the country you know normally if it's like ... and a jungle somewhere you'd watch the documentary to find out how do they live for what goes on with them\nFor Democrats elitist Democrats these a pin heads these Rachel Maddow intellectuals they have to go watch a documentary to see\nWhat do they look like these are actual Americans and how do they live in a anyway let's take some calls us go to Dave in Chicago hey Dave\nIt's MORNING lark I regard him making Kelly\nPersonally I think this was an orchestrated campaign that back by it I think she feeds on attention negative or positive she knew her ratings were low\nBut see here's the thing I think because of the fact that she's toxic nobody in the industry will hire her ... if they do it's not going to be for the salary of close to twenty million dollars a year what do you think\nWell I think she's just having just been around or I may have nothing personal against or they have never had much interaction with her she's evil just totally evil she's one of those people that just\nA ... puts us think all over your organization uh it all started that first debate in the primaries when she just went right after Donald Trump it was where people saw\nIt's one thing to ask those questions but they could see the ugliness in her eyes a real phenom cold ugliness enter a co workers all hate or there was a huge her own staff revolting last night\nUh at NBC I think she's gone I don't think you'll ever see her again on television and they put a showing the reruns now but even Monday I don't think she'll be back let's go to Craig and Connecticut Craig\n[noise] hey thanks for taking my call hey I like a puppy guy go ahead Greg said yes I I\n[noise] how many people thousands of people would do is Obama masks and then when O.
