they've discovered the the passing of serious weapons by\nIran so uh what ... obviously gonna have to do something or the best scenario would be to get rid of this crown prince he looked great like the reformer\nLoosening up the laws he came to America to visit all sorts of uh businesses in the movie business going by a by the way you know Hollywood is very quiet they take a ton of money from Saudi Arabia\nNobody takes more money from Saudi Arabia than Silicon Valley that's their number one investor there are huge venture capitalists and a lot of Hollywood movies taken Saudi money so what do they do or these studious going to send the money back\nSilicon Valley we send the money back Jeff Bezos has more billion dollar deals pending with Saudi Arabia he met with the crown prince about two months ago and this technically is his report that got killed and it tastes reporter\nHaven't you wondered why this is his reporter his employees got killed and he's been dead silent about this\nNow he's got a major massive deals brewing now with the Saudi Arabia and as I say just met with the the crown prince two months ago so what is he going to do is you're going to keep quiet a\nThe Bush family the Clinton family we understand them keeping quiet after all that money [laughter] but change tents you should keep quiet [laughter] at least you could do a\nSo I don't know the president's talked about a ... what were the words he uses severe severe consequences veer consequences I don't know exactly what that'll mean we have deals ending a hundred billion in airplanes in

and a\nVery severe fad fad south [noise] I thought well see what happens if\nYou know I'm going to get a like a recording of that wherever I speak just play that behind me the helicopter noise it makes you sound very important when you have helicopter noise behind you ought\nTo be very severe fad fad south [noise] I thought well see what happens if\nYou recall somebody and they try to pressure with how busy they are you know they pick up a phone call I got so busy I got so many things going on instead of putting on that I just play a helicopter noise behind it sounds like you really have somewhere to go when you hear that would\nMake it a safe at a very strong but we're waiting for the results of the fact that three different investigations and we can't be able to get to the bottom fairly serious\nYeah at some point they'll get to the bottom of this probably uh you know that Mike Pompeo says the and heard no audio of uh the attacker the interrogation is probably audio and video 'cause either we had that the embassy wired up or the Turks did but everybody has to pretend that they're waiting to get this from ...\nDo you believe ... didn't hear it or didn't get a transcript turkey to talk to these guys yeah well from moment after it happened\nWe seem to know all about it's a very often we bug these embassies and consulates we managed to get video surveillance in there as do the Turks or whoever the country is\nBut you have to pretend after it happened in your waiting to get this information you don't want to look like you have it all\nA wired up but I'm sure ah the Saudis are tearing the building apart looking for bugs cameras are everything in there now so we'll just wait to see what the what the report says uh midterms are Eighteen days away Eighteen days away that looked like the Democrats had a shot of taking the house back\nBut they are amazing it's growing themselves up\nReally amazing the cab nothing that was it that was going to take out Republicans once and for all it backfired it's seriously hurt Democrats people didn't like this are fake accuser showing up and making these false accusations and what could they do to screw themselves up even more\nThey have a caravan of thousands and thousands of what they call migrants but who knows who they really are they're probably all being paid by Soros [laughter]\nBut this caravan heading towards the border and every every time they keep showing it all over CNN and MSNBC supposed to make Trump look bad you look at this caravan heading towards our border to break into the country is is like one big Willie Horton ad that they're running and or even the president or\nThinks he knows this is going to be the best thing that ever happened to him he couldn't get lucky here with this caravan a and he'll defend the border if he has to send the military and close the southern border he'll do it and Democrats will push this thinking to make him look bad it makes them look great this is\nA big reminder is still white independence vote for Republicans a little more common sense law and order they enforce the laws Trump is doing a big rally in Montana last night\nYou know I'm willing to send the military to defend our southern border is\n[noise]\nAnd uh do you remember he was campaigning for that guy forget his name he was fourteen and what he was the guy that a reporter was given a hard time any body slammed he body slammed the reporter\n[laughter] which everybody would like to do everybody would love to body slam every New York times Gabe Sherman a kind of a reporter but but listen Trump campaign for the\nGuy by the way never wrestle him\n[noise] any body slammed me [noise] that\nThat is great because most normal people laugh they think that's funny it's a you know you're not supposed to make those jokes when you're president but it's funny you know the president with a sense of humor and the trolls the less the crazy a pompous left wing all starts yelling\nIt's insensitive its tone deaf after ... how can you make a joke like it has nothing to show again ah it's just funny but you said again he probably should not be making these comments as president\nWell you know it's like Justin Bieber you probably shouldn't be a crashing into trees in your car you probably shouldn't be throwing up\nDrunk in the street but the ... is is it hurting his career doing just fine and make some more interesting to hear these doing just fine how are you Justin Bieber or or you could be Ed Sheeran you could sit there and read\nBooks and be quiet [laughter] who's more interest including would we rather have run even went back to a Elizabeth Warren you got to admit now looking back on all those with war and what I'd done ... she's another Hillary a dumb bundler\nWho can't campaign who can bundle up anything all lying bundler and that kills or for the nomination\nSo Democrats will say to themselves we don't need another woman who's always lying and bundling Trump talking about are in the rally\nOnly good thing he did I think he probably disqualify 'cause she made a fool out of her stuff and the only good thing I Can't call her up to us all studying law\nUh yeah so\nNow that I cannot color of the study well but if you don't mind I'll continue your mind [noise]\n'cause they don't show everybody what a Saudi [laughter] she is finished or that the whole thing had been pretty much forgotten about uh hey there was\nA shouting match Bolton and the general Kelly or going edits screaming cursing did you see it all over the news yeah mhm do you hear Lester Holt open gym fake news Lester Holt open the NBC nightly news with it they were shouting at each other or having a fight about the border and the chairman but they were cursing\nA and\nWas the lead story on the NBC nightly news he opened by talking about this in ...\nShrunk down a couple of years ago you know the last big one I think was two thousand sixteen that's when\nA Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were the speakers but it's a and it used to be in the Waldorf it used to be the grandest a fan of all it's now in the\nShare it and yet it came down a little even Al Smith is not a part of it anymore he's a left it but uh it's still a great cause Catholic charities and last night the speaker was Nikki Haley\nNow what happens is supposed to be it's a very prestigious formal dinner but it becomes like a roast so and it was Donald Trump against Hillary Clinton he was really funny Obama was pretty funny at the George Bush was funny\nYou know they get a real serious joke writers to write the mom was Nikki Haley we love her but uh uh no threat to a Jimmy Fallon or Chris Rock goes to goes there at the dinner last night\nHe won it in any in\nThe wind and a half [noise]\nYeah it could could this so this is a joke in there somewhere but she didn't find it and ... is not the right delivery\nFor it Lenora ... it is that thrill out to dinner and without being harassed\nOr has it been pointing out the Al Smith dinner is not what it used to be it went from the ... the Waldorf is close that's where it's not there anymore but when you sit in the share it and it's not the same and literally Al Smith doesn't go anymore he hasn't been the last two years so uh his one way\nOr they called me this morning and gave me some really good and I get that from his pragmatic accomplished [laughter]\nReally\n[laughter] okay well we know now she she wasn't leaving the job is to start a TV career or anything so I looked at him yeah she looks very smart woman and she was a great public servant\nUh the interesting thing that was the bullying of a bill de Blasio well that's normal or he always gets food when he come whenever they when the when they start the ultimate dinner or the day is is all ... introduced each member of the day is one by one and the audience applaud and by the way the audience\nIs all top New York or business people CEOs community leaders when the Blasio gets introduced ... always\nBoom it's fascinating 'cause it's polite applause for everybody\nYou know they applaud their plaudits Ray Kelly people love him the sheer but the next case the CEO of the bank nobody knows who he is but they are in a polite land flooded the Blasio it's tremendous booming and then Governor Cuomo was introduced to tremendous Boeing\nAnd they set them one seat away on the day is I don't know what they were thinking yeah who came up with that idea you know I think uh they were thinking\nOf pictures that looks good a year of Trump and Hillary they were one seat away with the cardinal and be that's what I Am and while I was sitting right up front I took a picture\nOf they actually started to speak at one point to get a picture of them talking and I put it up on Twitter and about an hour later I found out of time magazine and picked it up by USA Today oil news sites because it was the first time they spoke during the campaign was before the debate\nSo I think they were hoping that something would happen that they would get a little argument or something it's it's good for those cameras there in a press there were hoping something happened but nothing happened ... would they say they didn't speak at all\nNot at all I don't even think they knowledge to want to know\nThey were one seat a away from each other which is like four feet away from each other and they never looked at each other\nAs you mentioned sitting ... closest somebody and not say anything\nOh yeah I've done it here [laughter] I guess you have [laughter] I Do it's constantly\nBecause if you start a whole conversation and then you're stuck but if you knew the person you wouldn't ignored them Oh yes yeah it depends who it is\nTo Bob and and this was sitting there when you ignore Angus or in fact it's just leading Democrats are avoiding Bob Menendez he's this a sleazy sort of character is running for Senate in New Jersey Boy it's amazing he could even run again I Know he didn't get convicted but the\nCourt said clearly everything he did was on moral and ethical does not technically illegal they look at the times endorsement of Governor Cuomo said he that was fascinating they wrote it sounded like an indictment they wrote a detailed account of how corrupt the is but at\nThe end they endorsed him you know the governor Phil Murphy will not even go near Menendez he won't campaign for him he's a former Goldman Sachs guy you\nTake a look at that even a Goldman Sachs guy doesn't want to be with Bob Menendez the love the pretending to be with pets are pretty bad when we come back during the important will be with us the great restaurant tour nobody owns more famous restaurants but everything you've ever wanted to know

of course in the oil business you want to have something going with them\nA so here's what could happen the king is really the ruler the king he's eighty a you know he may not want to get in such a huge fight with the prince and remove him but he could remove him\nThere's a brother to the prince he's in London everybody wants him back because they do if anything happens the prince he'll come

got to you you don't think it prints out we did either I mean things can happen so uh\nIt's a horrible thing and it shows you the sickness of this guy and it'd be one thing if could show he\nGot out of the car to go into that embassy and like in a James Bond movie guy wrote buying a motorcycle and shot him dead and then took off yeah that would be nor much better well the thing that's normal assassination\nBut a bone ... in this memory and the guy uh they knew he was brought out in bags we do know we've got all kinds of satellite imagery to vans with these\nKillers left in opposite

shredder and ... well it happened so they and they do dumped people in those things that's all Fargo\nOh I haven't Fargo yeah they would ... yeah they show you one of those are shoppers and ... up so anything could happen anything could happen so I don't think we'll ever find a trace of him or the president\nA very severe fad fad south [noise] I thought well see what happens\nSevere consequences he's not going to do the Obama Bush Clinton a typical presidential method which is where you make\nVery serious speeches denouncing speech after speech after speech after speech and then you don't really do much of anything maybe you cancel a contract or you impose sanctions you got to remember if you cancel the contract say a hundred billion dollars for fighter jets it just hurts us it puts Americans out of work\nHurts American companies so it actually is that they'll just to move the contract over to China or Russia or somewhere else or France though by the planes somewhere else\nSo it hurts us doesn't hurt them so ... what's the option I don't know but if you impose sanctions\nThat I Can't buy from us to buy from somebody else even if other countries put sanctions a self I'll buy it somewhere so I I don't know I don't know what the options are and once again I keep putting this out if you've ever been a supporter of the United nations\nEven during that week when they were all here disrupting traffic and you said Bob but it's an important organization they don't do a damn thing about anything\nNorth Korea nuclear test they're asleep or something like this big international incident where are they on this you have you heard anything from them not a peep not a peep from them they're useless organization if there's anything important going on they are hiding there not not to be found\nBush family hiding Clinton family hiding 'cause they're both owned by the or Saudis or Jeff Bezos shockingly quiet cause democracy so he was his guy his employee but as the basis as massive ... billion dollar deals pending with the Saudis\nAre they are the biggest venture capitalist in the world they're the biggest funders of Silicon Valley in Hollywood right now\nSo [laughter] all of the tech people very quiet about the gifts I can get away with it well very quiet about this so we'll see what happens is the president or a doing this rallies got one in Arizona tonight he is great in these rallies even talked about Biden last\nNight so yeah I mean as far as I say it will take him down so fast and they fought a statement may how he's talking about fighting a lot of faith is a good\nPoint it is fake news if he talks about the slapping somebody its front page news bite and talks about taking the woodshed that means violence and it's not a peep not anything\nYou know like when the every anybody does anything violent ... left wing mobs democratic mobs that are breaking windows and smashing cars and beating up people\nAre they trying to compare that to Trump in the rally where he said get him out\nOr what's the worst thing you sitting around but he wasn't talking about the people doing normal things he was saying what somebody trying to disrupt his rally right he was talking about somebody trying to stop the rally I'd be she needs to get them out or knock them down or whatever but that's somebody trying to disrupt your rally you don't say that to a normal audience member\n... we yeah I guess so it's different\nI really was hoping for something pretty great and I was very disappointed I'm I Am a huge sketchy cat um but this film didn't scare me at all um it's just a very run into the male slash\nPeople being killed every five minutes ... notes and um I never really was one scene where I was nervous the watching sort of my hand because I knew that you know it's all going to jump out and said boo but other than that\nUh each of the killings just happened so ...\nSo unimaginably that I thought it was a real disappointment\nJaded you've become people getting killed cut up once you're going\nWell but that's it I mean it's not frightening\nRight and he's a guy you see the guy he think about think about ... why joy scary because he didn't see the shock for the longest time right I mean yeah likewise needs to be a little bit more hidden before he comes out and just start packing\nPeople today it was just on imaginative and on the original and I go to add if nothing else on\nWell how about something good we can see this week\nOkay something very good is a new Melissa McCarthy film called can\nYou ever forgive me now she is not one of her comedy is not the ball so life is the policy I loved by and I loved 'em the heat but you know recently I haven't really enjoy have failed but this one is a drama with comedy\nUm but she's amazing in it wouldn't be surprised to see a ...\nHouse she thousands real life he writes a Lee Israel who back in the early nineties with a sort of struck English or New York city and realize that if the
