remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was that I don't know [noise]\nHe's basically just reading her testimony and it's a comedy routine what does that tell you [laughter] yeah sounds like he made up anything there or through in his own opinion or anything you just read her testimony the argument is that he was insensitive to sexual assault victim\nUh yeah that is if it's true but if this is not true again Schumer Blumenthal Booker you committed a major scam you trashed\nTerrorized victimized this poor guy you must all leave resign and may be facing massive lawsuit yourself if this is not true you realize what they did this poor guy wow so he's just repeating your testimony and it's getting laughs what\nWas it and I don't know where\n[noise] where was I don't know what that's the only thing I remember\nHe's just reading your testimony and it's getting huge laughs it's a comedy routine if you just read it\n... when the way he puts it you're right I mean she doesn't have anything to back up her story ... the you know they said he mocked her\nYeah did he say one word about from his own opinion he just repeated what she said how he did it in a a mocking way you're talking about the tone that don't have any say one word that wasn't a literal ... mountain were testimony no it was accurate\nWhat's covert again this is their exact testimony militias again he doesn't interject anything of his own opinion in there\nI had one [noise] well you think it was it was wasn't there\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was that I don't know [noise]\nThat's are actual testimony [laughter] how does it mean to if you read it it's just that recall but she's a sexual assault like I don't think\nSo what was it and I don't know where [noise] I'm says where was I don't know what that's the only thing I remember\nWhen you get this uh I don't think he's a slimy but this Jeff Flake\nWhat is Lou Dobbs call him this damn witted\nRhino senator against him within Jeff Flake is on the today show thing there's no place for this kind of talk [laughter]\nYou ever look at his face now looks like the victim you always look just faces all twisted in pain he looks like he was just a salted or\nThe ... one important thing he did say today is that um when the FBI investigation is done if there is no backup of the allegation then he's not he's going to vote for capital\nHe's going to do whatever is paid to do whatever special interest as his ear he changes his mind every second again with Lou Dobbs calm dim witted rhino senator uh but\nThese Democrats they destroyed before they want to destroy these really evil people\nIt's something that you have to think about when you vote now the Democrats it used to be about issues you know they stood for a higher taxes or health care what they did all these things they stood for now they stand for screaming and people in the street\nScreaming like maniacs chasing people out of restaurants trashing people with false allegations\nAbout a year ago President Trump more than that when he ran he put out a list here the end judges I Would probably a point to the Supreme Court\nCapital was on the list uh but I guarantee you that Soros and all that dirty money that funds all these sleazy ball attack organizations I bet your way back when they started working on these names\nThey've got all kinds of dirt that they've either put together or manufactured in all and names you know if it's not Kavanaugh will go to the next one was a guarantee that they've already got the dirty smear stuff ready to go on each one of these ten names\nWell they're pulling all out all stops because this even in the Kavanaugh nomination\nIt's going to submit to a conservative majority for a long time yeah I think that's what they're a fighting here I think they\nDidn't think this through [laughter] instinct is through the thought this would stop at a I think they fired up the Republican\nBase voters and a lot of independent voters to the problem is when you're the party in power when you hold the house and Senate and the White House you don't get much turn out that way in every mid term two years in you always lose the senator the house or something you always look\nBecause you're you're based takes everything for granted they fired up a Republican voters they will be out in full force this will cost them the midterms it's like ah you remember Reggie Jackson\nWhen the pitcher World Series would throw in his head [laughter] oh yeah yeah\nIt always throw a oh he's getting to back him off the plate they pro righted his head and Phil Reeves who does a a a big mistake [laughter] next bridge grand slam spinning so I think that's what you did hear\nYou you you you played this wrong you didn't think this through but this humor you know more and more people uh who weren't really that part is and the kind of like humor in that uh\nThey they Saddam's a guy who tried when he could be reasonable tried when he could to help New York at money for New York now he just looks like the dirtiest slimy a snake in the swamp the worst ugliest part is and he has just been awful\nHere do not want to judge\nOn the Supreme Court cannot tell the truth all the time and tell the whole truth\nAnd on issue after issue after issue\nJudge Kavanaugh has not done it\nThis slime ball is ah he's he's gonna see who's telling the truth this is like Bernie made off checking your numbers [laughter] that's why we better be telling the truth\nOr I should put this up tomorrow can remember that video had a Schumer flip flopping picking every side of every issue nobody is lighter and more people than this this Chuck Schumer\nMy Republican colleagues\nSeem to realize they don't have a stellar candidate so they keep diverting the issue\nFacing Democrats are delaying\nWe have no power to delay\n[noise] what is he talking about stellar candidate is not is still a candidate could you have a better record or resumes and judge Kavanaugh absolutely sterling record we're talking about that high school yearbook\nThis is what these Democrats have come to they are seriously asking the FBI to investigate a kid throwing an ice cube in a college bar this is not a joke\nMy kidding no no they are investigating allege that in a college bar young little a teenager Kavanaugh through an ice cube it's somebody they want the FBI to investigate [laughter]\nHow many times have you on an ice cube with somebody [noise] I've done it in the past week [laughter] it's not something that police were called for this [laughter]\nYeah it was it was a police were it was actually at Yale it was in New haven the police were called not over the ice cube but somewhere or in this whole thing of fight kind of broke up and somebody from a glass it's somebody this is not Kevin yeah but that's when the police were called somebody claims they had last thrown at them the police came\nA did a whole investigation had nothing to do with Kavanaugh he was not arrested he was let go immediately by the police they think at some point you might have thrown an ice cube but somebody [laughter]\nOh that's disqualifying right away then [laughter] you can't go into ... say well where's the ice cube of sorry melted Gerard [laughter]\nIt'd be like a like a\nKidney transplant thing where they have to keep it in the cooler bring the ice cube into court and show to everybody so this is ridiculous this is a uh the Democrats are just losing it you've got to go back to coming up with an issue something people can vote for they're not going to vote for you with all\nThis nonsense a and you see this a New York times\nBombshell about Trump's taxes I see these alerts coming New York times bombshell the bombshell is somehow and this should be looked at by the way somebody should get into this New York times stole Fred Trump's documents they've got a millions of his files there was a\nOne guy I think the guy died he was one guy who\nBred Trump trusted with the documents they were in his basement literally\nHundreds of thousands of documents financial stuff statements tax for all this stuff so they think that when this guy died somebody gave these documents than New York times but I don't think you have to check into the legality of it is the New York times is really even allowed to take that stuff and go through it\nUh the guy died who was trusted to hold these documents I don't know who gave them than to the New York times but they've gone through them and what it shows is that the real estate\nMogul at the time Fred Trump there were all these old real estate moguls long before Donald Trump the older generation these are the guys that owns all those huge complex is in Brooklyn and queens\nThen they came into Manhattan you know all the ... major real estate families one thing they all had in common they don't pay taxes that's and even today all the top\nBiggest names in real estate do not like to pay taxes because in the real estate business you really don't have to pay a lot of tax everything has depreciation since the ducks it's when you build a building\nYou don't pay about sex and the guy said handle the money of all these guys will tell you they so accustomed to pay tax that even when they make all the money you don't want to pay tax so they don't buy stocks that much they buy bonds not stocks they buy tax free bonds they just don't pay taxes when it comes to a state tax\nCole or FBI investigations on Mr Keith Ellison Robert Menendez was under Senate\nYeah yeah that's a good point uh we should bear in mind that Schumer Blumenthal Feinstein a Booker all these Democrats right now at this very moment their party the DNC is being run by Keith Ellison he's got multiple\nSexual assault accuses one of them says it was a violent sexual assault one of them has\nA police report video pictures\nAlice and he's the vice chair of the DNC all these Democrats should be forced to stop the Kavanaugh smear\nAnd do something about Alison take care of this matter and then we'll let you get to the other thing their vice chair of the DNC multiple a sexual assault accusations one as a police report pictures and video\nAnd the Democrats look the other way around it let's go to Michael in or not we have Michael\nMark your obsolete correctly settling earlier I'm a teach\nThese corrupt career a\nMorally bankrupt politicians onshore Blumenthal Booker and Feinstein is saying you're kind of knew that blast she Ford was lying to the people in this country for the past two and a half weeks they should all be ousted and that's all the good people that listen to you we got a call our congressmen say if we find out their line those ... those guys gotta go\nI Want to sound like a nice guy but let me explain reality don't ... don't call your congressman\nI don't mean to interrupt but the bottom line is it just it it's going to talk more but I Want to be talking with\nI'm Sorry but the thing is the bottom line is this on these guys they want to stay in power\nAnd using it all the known explain something you do not call your congressman when you call a congressman's office all they try to figure out real fast as as a donor is he going to write a check is it a lobbyist if it's just you just a citizen calling they always got some intern that's his job to pretend these listening to you\nAnd to write it down and then throw it away nobody talks of this intern care what you have to say no Chuck Schumer never goes around the office saying one of the calls like what people think of all he's worried about who's writing a check who is the biggest donor what lobbyist do we need to help out\nA and let me take the Schumer is a very honest man that's one thing even more peculiar about him he's the creepy is dirty is the lying is making the swamp\nAnd doesn't make a penny just does it just for the the dirty evil missiles at all he's\nNot the same thing with Blumenthal is a wealthy guy them and Blumenthal is a very wealthy man but same thing it's just about lying is just about ...\nA ... you know when they brought this a doctor for Dr Ford [laughter] I'm sure there was a meeting where they all said well does she have any evidence now [laughter]\nAnybody backer up now [laughter] does she have a real details them that real [laughter] All right let's go with it [laughter] well that's all they had at the end do you think they had meetings before they went and did this publicly where they looked over what you have of course\nDo they have an address do they know where it is ... ... you know [laughter] All right we'll go with it anyway ... or who knows maybe they said this is really iffy this testimony but Soros on the phone order to do with it anyway\nOr that's it you know this is dirty dirty stuff hopefully\nUh the FBI report will be out by the end of the day and then we have to decide what to do these people have to be forced out of office and she's got to be if not prosecuted if it's not criminal I think there's lying under oath right\nOh absolutely if she has one but I don't know if you can prevent yeah\nIf not this should be massive civil suits against her for destroying every thing going on in this country just turning the country upside down for two weeks anyway when we come back around a sheer will be with us we'll see what she has to say about all of the stuff coming up next

O.\nR. L. A. U. R. A. X. two eighty here in New York\nTo get through in the next day and by the way I Want to thank the Democrats and thank you all of you are on that\nCommittee Democrats because some times you come in and you say what are we talking about today we have a lot of great stuff and then you pull your crap\nAnd get the a nation so riled up turned upside down you just tear people apart and it gives us something to do for the day it's something to talk about the FBI report could be out by the end of the day to day I imagine\nThe president has been getting updates on it and that's why he was going after her last I wasn't going after it was just repeating her testimony and it was getting laughs when you're just literally repeat it will get to all of this and the next hour Ann Coulter will be with us\nAnd a lot more coming up you have a chance to win a thousand dollars right after the news do forget Russia noon showing the three right here on seven ten W O R\nThe a political people that worked for him Darryl convinced it will be Biden and they say they fear by the most Trump who's got better instincts than anybody of this stuff things by is the easiest to be because he's a total fake\nHe does this phony fake or every man routine\nThat he's been doing for years like a dollar diamonds popular you got to remember a simple fact twice he ran for president\nAnd never got one single vote outside of his home state twice he ran for president\nAnd fails we'll call it twice but there's a third time we're uh he ended up on the ticket with Obama but every time he's ever run can't get a single vote outside of his home state and he's the biggest liar on earth nobody's been caught in more lives than this could remember the\nVice presidential debate and he broke down and cheers telling the story\nAbout when he this diner he goes to every morning and the workers he sits with and he was crying\nWell they investigate they find that there is no such diner he doesn't go to every morning and then he talked about when he was in the Home Depot and his town and they find that there's no such a Home Depot he gets caught lying all the time\nNot to mention he's one of the worst ... of women are we've put that video up it's somewhere up on the Web page\nOf him groping women of all ages you see them trying to get away from him he's a Grover he's also been caught nobody has had more gas\nThan him saying stupid things my favorite remember um the paralyzed guy wheelchairs than they were honoring him and he sits stand up\nTake about [laughter] or he was speaking at a memorial for our fallen heroes and he said\nOh have you stand up [laughter] had explained to them that they're not knowing that here the dead of [laughter] he is he wouldn't be the perfect one so nothing would be better than a Biden Warren ticket Trump could wipe it out in\nThe second he's also he's talking a lot about twenty twenty now what is goal is total landslide\nWow total landslides by the way you will get a text from the president\nBut time to Eighteen to ... to Eighteen to twenty they chose to Eighteen right at two o'clock yeah so it's to Eighteen today is this just a regular text there's one of those things where you get that ... going to kind of ... and just going to beep okay you ever get these alerts\nI get one the number one day last week the Amber Alert you know this real ever goes and ...\nLike this awful sent 'em sit in the middle of some lunch and with a million people and I look floodwater yeah and that's one of the middle of Manhattan we don't have floods here that's for Connecticut\nAnd new flood warnings [laughter] but Park Avenue in fifty fifth there's no floods there that well maybe that was I knew where they know where you are\nI was at a Connecticut one yeah I don't think they I think that was like a tri-state\nWorn a guy so I think the the cells so to Eighteen wherever you are today is going to happen yes going to happen says don't be\nAlarmed you'll get an alarm from the president what this is a you know how on the radio it\nSays this is attached to the emergency broadcasting system and then we play those tones are at some point they wonder well lemonade that they want to actually\nI think stop that altogether and have the alerts now come on your phone so this'll be a test run today the only problem is the ... statistics that gave yesterday but\nI think it was only Ninety two percent of the public has a cell phone\nThat's a lot yeah but radios like Ninety six percent of the it's the most use medium Ninety six percent a radio so I don't know if you can eliminated altogether\nBut that'll be the test you'll get a text ... the the president normally does not text well this is I don't think it's coming from him was coming from FEMA no but you can't I'm just saying even if you were the closest friend you would never get an actual text from Donald Trump does not text anybody he has when he calls\nA there's two ways you can call he has an iPhone that he can call you on it's a special iPhone may just for him it cannot receive a call it cannot receive an email it cannot receive a text\nAnd can't be traced I assume right\nYeah well he can call you and you can see the number but there's nothing you do about it you can't call that phone it can't receive anything it can only make an outgoing called that's all it can do it also has things in it you can put his apps and it\nBut it can't receive anything in coming\nSo he doesn't a text to anybody individually and you never see them only thing he does his tweet to the nation you've never sent a text and his wife anybody now he has other phones\nThat he can talk on a\nBus to you know he does in fact uh he doesn't even when he sends an email it's not an email from him it's an email from somebody else and sometimes she'll write a note\nSometimes they'll send you a newspaper article and write a comment on it then that's photographed and turned into a PDF and attach the email sent from somebody else so he personally has never had an email account\nOf any kind that's not unusual for big CEO's alone and that's even before he was president yeah yeah never had any ... it's a lot of big CEOs are like that the secretary the assistant since you're the email that way in a court case or whatever they want your emails I don't have an email never had an email account\nThat's that's the way they do it a lot of big CEOs do that you can get your secretary's subpoenaed right you could but hey I didn't know what she was writing [laughter] I didn't tell the type that that that's the way it goes uh so uh last night President Trump is doing these rallies and as we get closer to the mid term\nOr in the final four weeks you'll probably do one of these every night\nUh but he ... the press said he mocked\nA doc doctor for it yes right with it how she a doctor she's a psychologist I think psychologist what\nKind of doctor if you went to a doctor and you walk them is that was her going which when you run out when you go to her for advice [laughter]\nNow mark she may have been sexually assaulted we can't I doubt and I ...\nI really doubt it I I really doubt it and uh also if she can't remember where when who what how she got that this is a doctor you want to go to for help so he did not mock or what he did was he quoted her\nTestimony her testimony if you just quoted as is is so hysterical you can get a crowd to laugh it's just quoting her testimony is a comedy routine I'm going to play it for you right now notice he doesn't inject any commentary he doesn't give us opinion he simply quotes what she said and it's hysterical\nI had one [noise] well you think it was it was wasn't there how did you get home\nI don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place and I don't remember how many years ago was that I don't know [noise]\nHe's not saying a word he has not said one thing he's adding tone I don't know about\nYeah sort of a disbelieving tone that's fine\nBut that's the point is just quoting or he's literally read near the transcript yes and it's a comedy routine\nWhat was it and I don't know [noise] I'm as well I don't know what I mean that's the only thing I remember\nHe's just reading a transcript and it's a comedy routine pretty amazing that you get to a Senate committee would nothing nothing now all he did there let's be honest all he did there was point out the holes in her testimony correct correct\nThat's the job of the press why didn't they do it you know the New York times attacking him why is he saying these things you were supposed to point out the holes in her testimony haven't you wondered why all these news organizations New York times Washington Post\nDidn't send dozens of reporters to this school why haven't they had dozens and dozens of reporters investigating this\nIs pretty amazing I mean while they're looking into income taxes that's what it was [laughter] you remember Watergate and all that stuff dozens of reporters from everywhere were dispatched to go look into this\nWhy isn't the New York times in twenty people to that school to go look into this why didn't NBC CBS ABC why didn't they have reporters all over the school tracking down to ... classmate\nFinding everybody was not going to do what do they do that because they know [laughter] it's not going to hold up everybody ordered to stand down do not investigate this isn't that interesting to this yeah\nThat was the job of the press to point out these holes and the testimony they deliberately didn't do their job and that was the job of the committee to vet this or if somehow it slipped through and got into the ... into the hearings that was their job in the hearings to ask her about these holes in her story in inner down on this\nSo we'll do them Democrats and do that no and when it's over when it's over you should all be forced to resign Schumer Feinstein Blumenthal\nThese creepy ... you know it's not like a when Steve Jobs left us or when if Tim Cook left do you think gee who's ... who could replace this guy how we can find somebody as good as Tim Cook Blumenthal I could go out in the hallway get five people better than him\nBlumenthal you'd go get a homeless guy out of a gutters probably more reliable than a looming there's nobody creepy or dirty or more dishonest than this Blumenthal this together lied about serving in\nVietnam and try it still hasn't been the Vietnam they think he would have gone on a vacation now just to say actually been there but ... you can't find anybody like Chuck Schumer well\nI'm sure there's plenty of people who could replace them\nThey should all be forced to resign if this turns out to be false they should all resigned she shouldn't be locked up and that's the only reason the president shouldn't be mocking her she may be locking her up and prosecuting her with his\nNew attorney general [laughter] ah Lindsey Graham wants to be attorney general that's why Lindsey Graham was on fire during a ha and Graham ah is campaigning for attorney general now the problem is what he a fire sessions right after the midterms Congress obviously the Democrats will not confirm anybody but a\nA couple of problems one first of all people take the cell phone and they record parts of the country and they posted online if you go on YouTube\nLike if you didn't see Billy Joel Madison Square garden friday if you didn't see this concert music on YouTube there it is twenty different people post the songs from it\nThere's a lotta bootleg in that's a big problem the other thing is if people are so busy taking pictures for their Instagram and Facebook and all that they're not listening they're not applauding when they're supposed to be the not paying attention\nThat's big I mean 'cause you you're reviewing the you're you're attending an event yeah yeah you view it through the eyepiece of your iPhone or your smartphone\nBut doesn't make sense no it doesn't but I you ever go to these concerts it's not five bucks it's two hundred bucks\nSo you what you say you don't want to bust out do whatever the hell why [laughter] I don't I don't know you just took two hundred bucks from this guy plus a twenty dollar ticket feed\nYour Neal's think the experience you just got two hundred bucks for this for a slob sitting there if he wants to inflict [laughter] he wants his money's worth\nFirst of all there's nothing you can do about it Madison Square garden how many people was that twenty thousand winning a check twenty thousand cell phones on the way in a\nWhile and then by the way we yeah ... where are they going to go what do you do with them\nYou know you'd have to check them like a coach check room you'd have to check the cell phone give them a ticket up people will never give up their phones like that now they might put then imagine getting out you got to wait in line while uh the ... person finds twenty thousand cell phones it's ridiculous\nAnd listen if they if that's important to people here's here's\nThe money I guess he taking a selfie but at the ... to view of the entire concert through your phone are\nYou missing something you know I don't know what's than I Do a speeches and things all the ... I spoke last night we had our big police athletic league gala dinner one of the more you're putting in a phone up to you\nThey were looking at the hay plaza hotel\nGrand ballroom it's a cardinal Dolan was around ... I'm about to speak I think everybody's waiting to hear what I have to say but as I'm walking around different tables you know what they're asking me how what's the wife I password in here [laughter]\nThey're not going to be listening as well [laughter]\n\nAnd when you look at their everybody's on their phone I used to it I guess so that by the way I Would check out my Instagram mark Simone NYC picture of me and the cardinal oh last night and get a special\nBlessing yes despite the fact I don't know why do this I always call them cardinal O'Connor oh gosh [laughter] it's a compliment\n'cause they'll kind of was a great guy but he was very nice about it I still like to cardinal [laughter]\n\nBut he would I barely thought it was funny when Ron introduced himself a billion dollar Conner looks pretty good for a guy to you [laughter]\nSo uh you can't be in cell phones\nAnd concerts first of all a that you know that that's what people want to do that's what they want to do yeah yeah it's like a\nWedding in your band Instagram feed although\nA Facebook and Google collect so much data on you something's got to be done and even Tim Cook yesterday in an interview said it's time to go after them\nEven Tim Cook said that the government has to step in and the ... first of all the collecting massive amounts of data on you selling it to everybody but also we don't know how secure that data is Facebook just got breached fifty million people\nYou know you worry about that might have your password or this or that of your information they could also have all your data everything you've ever looked at done one other yeah yeah So Tim cook is now the one reason Tim Cook and say this he's the one guy not in that business apple does not collect data\nApple sells hardware that's what they do so they're immune to this that's one reason he likes them going after Facebook and Google hey\nUh Les Moonves a here he's been talking to a criminal attorney sue the Les Moonves stuff could go criminal at some point you remember some of those stories are we're not just groping kissing but they sounded like rape ... Ileana Douglas oh yeah that's right yeah listener\nWhen staring asked me a lot of personal quest channels\nI was down ... not really like to say I am not a ... of course led to him yeah jumping on Capitol Hill putting his tongue out throughout\n[laughter] [noise] uh how they shouldn't laugh [laughter]\nYou know I don't get these guys this Les Moonves you ever see him in a boardroom he can walk into a room full of the topics and well he can sell them anything he can just make the Mel piece of incredible salesman but when it comes to a woman that's all he knows how to do jump on top of them can't they haven't credible salesmanship\nBut they can't lose somebody if they didn't jump on them and shove things down while\nAnyway uh when we come back and culture will be with us we'll see what
