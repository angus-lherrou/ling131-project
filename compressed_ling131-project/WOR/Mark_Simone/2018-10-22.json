I Want I Want to read the ... the two giant rabbits they're really hoping it will have a\nCigarette but anyway the Valerie Davis was quoted whoever she is\nOr the other problem is if you do anything really bad economically sanctions anything really bad with the Saudis can really hurt our economy which Democrats wouldn't mind doing right now 'cause that'll also hurt Trump we are really tangled up with the Saudis first of all gas prices obviously let's say this week sanctioned they do an embargo\nAnd gas prices shoot up is one thing but the other thing is our companies are tangled up with Saudi money nobody does more to fund the tech industry than the Saudis that is the biggest source of funding for our entire tech industry they are the biggest venture capitalists in the world\nWell why don't you just for the Saudi Government to come clean and say look at it was\nThe what is this guy Mohammed or been salaam the crown prince what is the credit how cat and the ... got to go\nYeah that would be the best solution these terrible he was terrible last year or in the year before when he was a locking up all the billionaires over their torturing them he's terrible he's got a brother in London everybody thinks that'd be the good choice the king would have to do it\nThe king unfortunately is eighty one feeble they don't know if he's all they're mentally so he may not have the strength to do it but ah somebody will have to develop to get rid of this guy at some point but you can't just throw 'em but you know even the big hedge funds\nAre in real trouble over this Steven Schwartzman Blackstone is one of the greatest biggest hedge funds has wants their new fund is a forty billion dollar fund twenty billion is Saudi money what are they supposed to give it to that\nHey cut show these important maybe it's not that here's another thing which are Democrats\nOr you don't know what's gonna happen in the midterms is close who knows what'll happen looks like Republicans have a slight edge but who knows they got a big edge in the Senate they'll pick up seats in the Senate in our second hour will have the top pollster of the world\nHere or to go over the numbers but ah who knows what'll happen\nBut Democrats will screw themselves up in the final Fifteen days they keep doing this show the story it was all over the Sunday shows they don't realize this is not an issue in any way\nTo any voters in America they remember they all live in the bubble and when they're all in Manhattan in Georgetown dinner parties this is all they're talking about his ...\nAnd they don't realize a normal American voter\nIt's not an issue of this a foreign national who was killed halfway around the world by some foreign government it's not on anybody's radar when I hear the story it just sounds terrible and they feel awful about the guy but it's not an issue in any way in the election nobody's going to vote based on it either way so I Would agree on that one\nOf the other thing the Democrats is to care of and this stupid caravan is back and heading towards the U.S every\nTime that care man has mentioned are seen on television that's one more vote for Republicans\nAnd independents go to Republicans it's a reminder of why they vote against Democrats Democrats believing this total lawless chaotic no border system where\nUh people just sneak into the country left and right you look at that care of and it's like one big Willie Horton ad and they just see that the incumbent and people aren't stupid\nYou know after a while they start to figure out that caravan is being funded it's being paid for that caravan has tremendous expense is how do you think you feed four thousand people every day\nIs suddenly there's lunch and dinner for four thousand people every day hidden lenient [laughter] what do you think pays for that [laughter]\nI already obvious or the other thing is as the caravan heads here or the president has told each country Honduras Guatemala whoever's in involvement chairman their foreign aid will be cut\nWhich is good to it'll save us of fortune I have no idea why we spend all this money you know there are some Democrats say the reason they're coming here is because of the horrible conditions are living in and we should be setting up programs and yeah\nExactly they're fleeing oppression mark and this is a great country we should welcome them\nNo we should we should tell these countries get rid of your socialism it doesn't work it's failed every time everywhere in the world try a different form of government know dictators no socialism have a real economy and turn things around\nEvery time you of socialism you end up with Cuba people in poverty you end up with Venezuela\nThey speaking of which check on my Twitter is a pretty good to meet him up there\nOr whoever he shows about income inequality and socialism Hollywood mhm who supports Bernie Sanders Ocasio Cortez Hollywood\nHollywood is the greatest example of socialism ever in history the star of the movie is getting twenty five million\nEverybody else in the movie gets a dollar fifty [laughter] all of a look at the Stevens Kobe or show the scene when he had protests and Sanders on how much he believed in them the greatest example of socialism an income equality Steven Kobe or show he gets about twenty two million a year everybody on the show is getting a dollar\nRadio present to the city yeah check it out now\nIn Florida and try ... level and you got one you know\nIt was the deal with this making millions nobody wanted to make billions\nNow nobody one no I thought when they first announced that there were thirty five winning tickets or something but well not the big one they mail you know there's minor prizes and nobody won correct so now it's one point six billion mhm\nAnd when is the next drawing to Wednesday Wednesday so I'm pretty sure it's one of the ones that I should get a ticket for where'd you get a ticket for those things\n[laughter] mind like a novel is going to treat me up Tuesday the drawing oh to like the others tomorrow night that's tomorrow right now and then I think Wednesday is the mega the Powerball lottery that's worth six hundred million\nSix hundred million yes muck and six hundred million\nOn ... I I take it you haven't bought a ticket yet\nNo I actually had a ticket for this other one but I went to a birthday party of somebody through ... and there was like as a you know just for fun they had things on the table one was ever really got a lot of nice nice yet but it was a birthday party where I'd say half the rumor multibillion there's no so they looked at those things and you know you could win five hundred and sixty million lump sum so they're\nNot worth ... [laughter] so uh\nWow how could nobody when I thought ah I I'm surprised they sell ... nobody so every number and every ticket no obviously not okay there's a lot of combinations because the the number of choices of grown I think it's up to Seventy one Seventy\nYou know there's all kinds of studies that are out of all the lottery winners of one fortunes like Ninety percent of them end up in tragedy it ruins their life they ended up\nGoing broke doing crazy things drinking all kinds of I think if I Want to be a right now\nIf you win this one point six billion first of all you'll find hundreds of relatives you never knew you had asked from Schumer ... brand will call you immediately they'll suddenly be your best friend [laughter] speaking of which Governor Cuomo has finally agreed to a debate\nHe put this off what do you think changed here or maybe the pressure from uh all the writers ... post put number chicken costume yeah undercover okay that could have been it so that debate\nIs ah\nIs it tomorrow well as I think it's going to be taped tomorrow and it'd be a leader the next day WCBS channel to know what is the reason for that they're going to pre tape it I I don't know I don't know what\nI mean obviously they won't edited it can't edited or it'll be on channel two it'll be Cuomo and mark mowing their all he doesn't accept you sue me will and then the Christian ... brand has refused to debate\nUh she doesn't really have an opponent it's like I I don't know why they just didn't put up a real candidate against as ridiculous ridiculous they just threw some housewife some amateur in there\nTo run again it's a combination of probably of two things one ... brand is very donor friendly so or on either side and they don't care if she's still there because you can do business with her\nAnd uh I think they figure it's a lost cause so why waste a real candidate against or just have some amateur going there and do something so uh I don't think it'd be watching that debate\nIt'll be on it will be taped a tomorrow ah and then we'll be on Sunday at eleven AM\n... the thing is it's thirty minute debate I mean what can you say and thirty minute nobody's going to watch the thirty mile almost true even the moderate is not going to be watching the whole thirty percent of what it is [laughter] it's ... brand and somebody you never heard of is going to debate nobody's watching [laughter]\nAnyway when we when we come back Michael good when the greatest smartest columnist in America he'll be with us next on seven ten W O R let's get the latest news your\nJob or not President Trump says he's going to start cutting off foreign aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador that's because of that migrant caravan that continues to make its way through Mexico headed to the U.S border president says you can blame the Democrats are not changing the country's pathetic immigration laws\nGovernor Cuomo and Republican Mark Montanaro will square off at a debate tomorrow but ... says that's not good enough he says upstate voters are being forgotten he's calling for two more debates with at least one of them in the buffalo area polls show Cuomo leading that raised by more than twenty points\nMTA says service is getting better new stats show the delays we're down twenty percent of September pushing the number down to a three year low Eighteen percent of the trains were late last month\nAnd other updated eleven breaking news once talked today would lend bourbon and Michael read all in the morning six to ten tomorrow I'm Joe Bartlett on seven ten W all our\nProblems within that little bit of sunshine here for the afternoon up to fifty one today clowns returns tonight is our loews dropped a forty six party cloudy tomorrow with a high near sixty and it makes a closet cooler temperatures Wednesday high fifty three Thursday finding these guys readings in the mid forties clubs this hour forty four W O R\nBut I think that's a long shot you know I think this I think the safest if you were going to bed on there she would say it's somebody we know it's somebody already and politics in one way or another it's not going to be a stranger\nIt's not going to be you know and the entertainer per se it's not going to be Oprah Oprah a Donald Trump has a heavyweight\nI mean he punches hard\nAnd you're going to you're going to have to stand up to that for two years the better part of two years\nI mean it's it's not going to be easy and that's why I think that someone like a Cory Booker he he'll be shredded it would just be torn apart\nBy Trump ... the Kamala Harris I think is such a light way ... brand Elizabeth Warren\nI mean I just think they're all paper thin I don't think they have the I don't think they have the stomach for the fight the Trump will bring to them and this is a this is a divided country but the Republicans are no longer silent they are fighters now Trump taught them how to fight\nLooking Lindsey Graham out their roaring you've never heard him do this before or that that's the environment you're going to go into I don't think it's for the faint of heart\n... very well so have you want to read a brilliant called go get the micro good ones come from yesterday you can get it on line that he's in the New York post every Sunday and every Wednesday Michael Goodman always great talking to you thanks for being with\nMy pleasure mark thank you a check on the Web page at some great stuff up there hey these uh TED Talks that some of them are great some of them not so great but watch this this is the perfect clarity of a Ted Talk\nAnd as you want to show you exactly the formula of every ten talk it's great and then take a look at this year's video and Hillary ten years from now watch this women tend to look at this the day before the iPhone came out first\nA control and lead the party should and Bill Clinton could do this he's a smart guy he could show it's not through screaming and vandalizing that you when it's through issues\nAnd coming up with a better plan but he and Hillary have never been leaders of the party there always out for themselves they it was one problem and Bill Clinton left office he completely screwed up the party of cost him the house the Senate everything a ... and help nobody screwed up Gore forever\nUh and just left are just so he and Hillary benefit they never help anybody else but they were fined them\nOh yeah ... ... what the party is in ruins you got to explain to this party that stopped talking about your mouth ...\nHorrible everybody cries when they hear the story it's not an issue don't bring it up nobody's voting based on your mouth 'cause showcase some foreign national got killed halfway around the world it's not an issue in anybody don't have a caravan heading towards the border that's not helping you\nNobody likes to see four thousand people invading the country\nThat's not going to get ... votes\nA smashing up the Republican club and riding in the streets in\nThe east side of Manhattan that's not going to get your votes screaming in an angry mob in a restaurant that doesn't get your votes he got to come up with the issues you gotta do get to have better ideas than Trump as\nWell he kind of ... with all the things that he's doing what he says and you get some sort of I think misguided\nWell yeah and the problem is people aren't stupid you know that's the Democratic problem there the very elite\nA Democratic Party they think of everybody is deplorable idiots you know they always say that but the Trump voter with their terrible uneducated angry uneducated people\nThat's not the case at all actually the middle class of America they are not stupid you might not hear him talk about politics all the time that's who they actually have jobs families and the\nBusy working and they don't talk about this stuff but they're not stupid they look at Trump they figure it out real fast the guy's a big mouth\nHe said you know the tough guy from queens who shoots off his mouth all the time\nYou know we shouldn't do that but he gets the job than he is very effective\nYeah he does need to tone it down but\nYou ever watch remember that show Boston Legal yeah he's Allen shore us back in reruns have been watching it Alan Schroeder was a James ... and he was the lawyer who would always say the worst things he would insult the judge\nHe would say terrible things and ... you would do all this the reason he was the lawyer he always won he won the case and sometimes the insulted the judge you disrupt the courtroom and in some strategic way to help them when the case so that's Trump people have figured this out they know he wins they like it\nWell he's definitely a launching smoke bombs all day\nYeah or you know I asked them once a long time ago why does stuff like that sometimes he says it's like the navy seals when they have to go into a building to get somebody they don't just go in the buildings at first\nThey set it on fire
