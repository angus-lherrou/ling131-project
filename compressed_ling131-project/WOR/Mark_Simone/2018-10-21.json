I. hock jewelry I'm Serious we did have to really believe in yourself through job to to do that\nJob to do when you believe in it and you know losing your your you know you're going to swing when you swing the bat you're going to hit ... go for a home run right\nYou're right you don't halfway said but by the way just a good story follow ladies' listening I got my joined back I Believe\nVery nice very nice very nice\nWell you know just relax and said I Want you\nTo write so now you build a hundred million dollar company\nAnd this is in the book and that's why I think it's important because people feel like I don't have the money how do I START I don't have the finances we took what we had and just kept reinvest thing into ourselves\nAnd then people are afraid to get their product out there you can't people do copy you and there are patent trolls and there is horrible things out there we just went through a lawsuit with a patent trolls who came up with a pattern in two thousand ten went abroad that I created in two thousand three\nOh wow are horrible you have to play the games and they have the petrol attorneys this is where there is a problem in our legal system you can't\nGo after them for legal fees or anything so you end up having to pay them off just to get rid of him\nYou know it's interesting because I was just on Fox News the other night and I just interviewed me regarding the trying to trying to trade wars and I said you know what it really is relevant the reality of it is we're going to get China to enforce our patent laws because they're stealing it reverse engineering our products\nOr you know killing us right back when my gosh well just jumped on me I created a abroad\nI I I ended up I'm really into branding and it's really important but I just did it one night on the air when I was on air the ... comfortable his incredible technology that it's seamless so it's not made the way conventional process you guys are boys but with books and I said it's ... it's very comfortable\nAnd so I called the the putting on a big sigh of relief opera\nAnd and that terminology became you know\nIn Beijing well no\nMy husband looked at the broad this is where his entrepreneurship and I'll partnership really work and said this could be an infomercial 'cause we live in a city said\nAs so Ryan and I'm like really I didn't have when I was it's a bra I'm used to seeing things that do something like it's a can opener in right right right right I Know it goes\nIt goes I I you have to have a universal product for an infomercial we live in a town we're so Anthony Sullivan toxic thing I sold\nYes or in the commercial world by the way you should have the money for your friend of mine he's great too\nYeah we'll talk about that well looked at him I Would love to have him on my show\nAnd we have partnerships with some things together but anyway the opera then it became an infomercial it blew everyone in the infomercial business away because the numbers it was doing most gets marshals or does it created so that leads people to the retail world direct infomercials over we made more money\nDuring the infomercial because my husband never ... how much it cost it was a sixty dollar you get three for sixty dollars 'cause that uh fifty nine Ninety nine because at the time that's what the problem was selling on ... than we didn't want to hurt our business when

M. H. D. to kill you are on\nW. A. X. count eight detail in New York\nWhere are you ready to number one\nIn June W a war of choice of New York and\nThere only born with two parts of the brain the back of the brain is called the ... and the colder appealing because it's the same brain the steak has it has no morality\nIt gravitates for pleasure and away from pain and then you're born on top of your head with your mammal brain and the same brain animals are\nIn animals live in a constant state of\nFear and anxiety\nAre they going to get food are they going to be food are they going to remain in the same status is it's so\nYou're you're learning from every single thing around you and very few people\nUse the brain that's wanted from about Eighteen to twenty eight which is called the frontal lobe you know or the homo sapiens brain\nI'm Einstein called ... brain she blames usually with these five percent of it [laughter] so what happens is that the ... I had your brain go from\nGo from the normal state of consciousness 'cause most people are literally locked into their mammal brain which is inherently OCD mhm it just goes over and over and over\nAnd of course you can be highly functional or for some people not functioning liberal because they can't get out of their own heads a\nA place for suggestions which you needed I have to say that\nIt just an excellent a client you know and I'm nail biting is serious to the extent that it's not you ... I mean\nI'm your in the business in the public high and it just doesn't fit the fact that you have such a great profile great communicator and people know you and ... and like you and you look better with the nails\n[laughter] I had my first a manicure and my whole life after I saw you know I Need it how cool is that you get a massage there too so it's very nice [laughter]\nSo what are what I wanted but I wanted to say is that when any new person comes in I think I probably did this I tell them they hear the three rules the one is that deserve to be happy ... to guilt as a waste of time in three that\nContrary to what so many people think you are what you eat you're not you are what you think you would you think\nThat the brain neural plasticity simply means that the brain is flexible and you can use your rational brain that has all these goals all these desires\nThat is hindered by the fact that the mammal brain all it wants to do is repeat behavior\nAnd all of them wants to do is get through the next day and that's why I Want people by the way to call this number you could ask Michael or me any question you want\nIs one eight hundred three two one zero seven then [laughter] actually I just read it that way it's really sounds pretty cool you know and get to get that number\nHe wanted it this is how I Do it every morning give us a call here one eight hundred three two one zero seven ten oh\nForget it [laughter] I don't know what role does it go and without looking at the number I've got it it's an implanted in my a frontal lobe there\nWell I bet you that that that ... says I only do it once a month\n[laughter] I'd be like something I had a question for yourself as far as habits go uh you know nail biting is not going to destroy your life\nBut you must have worked with and work with people who have more serious addictions alcohol correct drugs is it the same process you used on me or is it a more intense process when you have to get someone to kick a habit that as destructive to their\nLife is much more of an intense happened then that's an excellent question meaning in forty years way over a hundred thousand people\nUm there's nothing which you don't do\nThe the but the problem is that in the ... way with the drug the with the drug user an alcoholic\nIt has literally I'm not only does it affect the fact that the brain doesn't produce their own doping means alright okay or they're on serotonin so you really have to change their diet and the hypnosis is much different for each person\nGave that's why you know I don't I don't ... each person everything is different ... even if they're coming from the same thing and that's why the first session I I find out about their personality 'cause everyone processes differently\nSome people do go ... you know extremely under the one thing I always do is I keep people in a place of awareness\nSo that they realize that they're in control and they're not gonna clock like a glock or duck [laughter] okay you know um but yes if it's if it's something from the past most people most people's problems Michael are a symptom\nIt could be a symptom you know of poor parenting um my generation you know it was much different they paired the by beating the hell of a\nMess you know we're just ignoring that was that was that generation right you know it's it's it's it seems to have a I don't know if it's gotten better or worse it's just different\nI don't know I mean I'm not a I'm not a parent but uh my friends who are parents there is a what I Would say a little a little over ... net sales on I think that we'll have that will take its toll on this generation of kids who weren't told that they're the best and everything\nOh in the oval ... you know what kids don't know how to be alone they don't have to be independent be they literally have anxiety attacks over the phone so it's just it's you know but but because it covers everything if a person's coming for a retro dysfunction it's different\nIf their testosterone levels are absolutely normal and it's a hundred percent you know I'm In their head which is normally Ninety five Ninety seven percent of the people who come from reading the\nUm but then you also I also work with all their doctors to make sure that not pre diabetic to make sure that the testosterone levels are normal and adjustments need to make then we we we make them\nUm I think uh we have gotten on the phone go and talk to me\n\nHello Gordon Gordon you there\nI guess Michael did you have that wonderful show the American theater wing was hosting by you will you on that show\nYeah yes it was I was called a theater talk and it was on PBS for about a twenty\nTwenty twenty two years or so and uh I left it\nA year ago and I'm sad to say it it it it only lasted one more year now it's gone but that was the show yeah eight or talk we used to Susan Haskins and I we yeah we have an interview people like Elaine Stritch and Hugh Jackman and very Humphries Dame Edna Andrew Lloyd Webber all the Broadway people would come on how much I'm Glad you remember\nFrom a real point of knowledge and Michael ... is a doctor Gluck yes ... pre she ate a when I was in college I had a little role in the front page fell and not being an actor or the director said oh here's the part and it was the lead role so I figured if he\nThinks I can do it I can do it\nAnd I'd like to know Dr Gluck a little bit I'm also trained as a a little bit of a ... and also as a guardian and as a quarter evaluate are helping senior citizens and how would you and Michael you could ... a little self\nHelp notion is highly Shane we show ourselves hey we can do it what what are so\nOkay so so when we say self hypnosis ... it is very much different than self affirmation self affirmation is excellent\nWhich it means that you're aware of which part of the brain you're using you aware that if it's in the frontal lobe that a rational thought gives you peace it gives you focus it gives you energy\nAnd ... it's also the awareness subordinate by Ashville look at your fingers right right now\nUm who else has your fingerprints but you\nAre I'm not fighting my fingernails no no no\n[noise] who else has your fingerprints of no one else who has your DNA no one okay who has your iris print to your eyes\nOf the CIA FBI no I'm joking with no one\nNo one no and then on the list goes on and on and on so so yes um when you make a self affirmation\nLike I Am I Am able to do this I Am not going to embarrass myself I if I feel some anxiety I'm gonna let it pass it still going into your mammal brain and you are doing yourself some good so self affirmation is great\nHypnosis though is causing the front too low to literally take over the property of the mammal brain so that you're not using it because it at one point becomes a part that's not necessary to be successful\nSo what you are doing going is excellent um uh and it sounds like you help with a lot of people but we could we could add some things to it\nGarden can I ask you how was your performance in the front page\n[noise] well I I have to tell you it Oh thank you Michael for that uh it was absolutely wonderful it opens up the whole world to me [noise] and one of the things that you will appreciate a for those that don't know that station theater it's a high wire act any\nEnergy that you get from the your your cold of actors and actresses and the stage and I went on\nHe did more and more of that and did some extra work ... I don't know if I can say a Robert fall on a I was an extra with a marsh across on the December solstice\nHaving different sets of friends having hobbies working out like all these things that people want to do but don't do ... you know I'm\nThe idea of coaching you could go to a coach or a psychologist you know for years and you find that you have your mother you knew that the first date [laughter] Thirty years later and I know I'm not exactly a revelation\nYou have to be able to move past that and the first few weeks and see what you love and see what you really do like\nUm with with relationships especially in show business they really have to have some depth to it which means um that they are part of ... of the other person's world and you kind of share worlds\nAnd you really have the maturity to you don't always have to agree mhm okay you could have a successful Republican and Democrat that's really true I talked to believe but it's really true [noise]\nWe're Nick on the phone Nick talked to me\nUm is it possible for a person to um bring about a stroke without any risk factors like a forest stroke I mean what I'm saying is on that I Believe and I was told I'm not wired for happiness and I got became very happy and then I had a stroke [noise]\nHey Nick I Do not believe that there is any connection to the happiness and the stroke however all unhappiness does lower your immune system\nAnd you know an unhappy person is going to be less likely to be as healthy as a happy person but to put this on yourself to blame yourself is simply a waste of time and whoever told you that you will wide front and happiness\nActually told you half the story and wasn't in my eyes a very bright person the story is that lots of people come from very difficult places in their childhood or in their experiences of of of life itself maybe getting fired or cheated on the list goes on\nBeing disabled of physical conditions will also affect mental conditions but Nick listen to me you can be we're wired\nTo be an extremely happy person and in the ... the wiring your brain does have a significant part in your healing\nI Am not saying that you should not continue with whatever medical advice you been getting but to get your brain to a point where it's working with you your rational brain the front of your head is going to cause you to not only become a happy person and\nIt's going to cause your entire health picture to change\nSo give me a call Nick and Nick of as your question\nI also yes it did but I also believe that on my shelves because whenever I Would become happy in my earlier life the proverbial safe would fall out of the sky\nNick ... ... you brought up something that is the biggest misunderstanding that people have one you hear me really carefully happiness does not depend upon what happens to you it depends upon how you react to it some of the most happy\nPeople have gone through the most trauma in their entire life\nLosing children losing parents you know been in war and yet they're happy it's not the external Nick\n... shoes didn't drop what happened was your brain wasn't prepared to process the information so you have a chance Nick you have a chance to actually change your life now forget about the\nPast okay All right\nOkay well um the alright was literally a week but you know what\nIt's worth it how old are you shifted five fifty five\nYou do the right thing you've got another forty five years to be happy so let's try to do that [noise]\nUm good luck Nick already love to hear from it so the number to call this station is I just signed up the right way of saying it is one eight hundred three two one zero seven ten [laughter] then you got it [laughter]\nYou know in the neck was talking about the uh the safely out of this guy reminds me a very good short story by Henry James called the beast in the jungle and the uh the the protagonist in the story is a guy who lives his life\nConstantly thinking that some terrible thing is going to happen to him just around the corner\nOh I have athletes who come in and and then they are saying you know I got pain somebody just among and have a heart attack you know meeting but but the fear really comes from something Michael that's that's underneath and will sometimes what's underneath is that they aren't happy well\nIn the case of this a character in the story so he he it becomes a block in his life you can have a relationship he is alone because he has this fear that the calamity is going to happen and then the end the end of his life he realizes\nThe beast in the jungle was that fear exactly it was the fear that it's all going to go wrong at any minute that's what destroyed his life nothing specific I happened but in his mind\nBeing afraid of everything is what ruined him in the end\nThat is the very definition of the animal brain and the acronym for fear is false evidence that appears real\nInteresting it's false evidence therapy Israel says the animal brain is wired for fear gay I'm just the way when a person has been so many people in their life will at one point\nExperiencing anxiety attack you know what they worry for for the next part of their life\nIs it going to happen again yeah right yeah now and this is why I say you know what we could I could you know make it never happen again because ... attack is it goes from awareness to stress detention joins id to panic\nTo panic attack it builds up and and people don't know how to come out take it down to let me ask you a question in the in in in the showbiz world what do you find the\nMost successful relationships are and how long the relationships in general\n[noise] well I think uh I I think this applies to ah any profession really the the actors I Know who have the most satisfying experience have it when\nThere are in a play\nAnd they are working with another actor who is so good\nThat uh everybody else has to to raise their standards and ...\nTo match the person and and uh my friend Brian Dennehy a terrific actor he told me uh he was in a a production of long day's journey into night the great Eugene O'Neill play to talk about it on happy family and he was laying the opposite Vanessa ... one of the one of the great actresses\nAnd Brian had done the play before in Chicago so he thought well I've got this down I Know the lines I Know the character I've done it before now I'm just doing it on Broadway but he told me the very first rehearsal where they just sat around the table reading the script he said Vanessa was doing things with the character\nThat he'd never seen before and he thought everything that I thought I knew about my character in this play I have to throw out the window and start again if I'm going to be able to match her performance and he said it was the most exhilarating professional experience of his life\nMichael before we take Maria I wanted to comment about the fact of the matter is is you have to improvise ... and the rational brain improvise mhm okay life is not good to always be a fast ball down the middle mhm that's right I Know you have to you have to realize that failure doesn't exist\nGum Edison's famous quote he says I Know a thousand and two ways not to make a like boom [laughter] you know failures just just knowing something that you you need to do different organ another relationship pressure view but first Murray talked to me\nHe got ... Gluck didn't want to want it to\nTell you that they could experience I had\nA with a dentist who ah she well as a child and into my early thirties I had been terrified at getting kiss\nMy cake for in bad shape my ... bad shape I asked for a dentist recommendation that somebody put me to sleep except my own now to me on my way into this\nGift and he had hit and the dental chair sandwich streaming through that window\nOut my hand and he spoke to me it's such a short calming voice that I found myself very attracted to the movement of now\nI don't even remember what he said can they get that at the end I didn't fall asleep I thought I heard every word but I don't know any we say in the end\nI let it get an age of pictures that my dad and he said come back another day and we'll start work if you say you will never be afraid to go to a game just to get\nMy way home and I was very sleepy I went home and I lay down and it took an afternoon nap went back to the dentist but not afraid", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Simone", "city": "New York", "day": "21"}
