something that's so unique to this company will be getting into that as Well hi Suzy Hi Laura good to be back it's great to hear your voice it's become quite familiar to\nPeople all over the country in terms of ah encouraging people to take their fruits and veggies everyday\nDr Howard this is really revolutionary and yet it seems like the most simple concept in the entire world where did you come up with putting fruits and vegetables into a capsule of my\nBook actually years years of study you know it's interesting other companies now are starting to think they can catch a fad we're not a fad\nOr something that for many years of study and research and figuring out how to do this has made it happened and I always ... me when I hear other companies now they're starting to say oh we have more fruits and veggies in ours and blah blah blah we have fifty instead of thirty one and I'm like\nThey don't get it is not how many per se it's how they interact with each other and we're not just a business it's trying to get on the shelf and convince people were about results\nAnd that's why we offer like you said that the hell is that well that's why we offer that is to help people accelerate their results there's no extra fees there's no extra charge for it\nInfects business management companies have said oh you need to get rid of that department it just costs and your money no that is what we are about results\nSo people say to me off and oh I take vitamins um I don't think I Need to take you know balance of nature because I keep I I'm such an advocate now because I've seen and I'm One of those that actually feels the difference when I don't take my balance of nature I Am so sluggish and\nFuzzy and when I take it and this is literally on a daily basis I can literally feel my body pick up at night and my thinking gets clearer me so I'm One of those people and I my parents are as well because they tell me about that fact but when people say to me\nOh no I take the vitamins I don't need to take balance of nature I'm telling them you you need ten till eleven servings of fruits and vegetables per day in their most potent nutritious like Ninety nine point nine hundred percent of ... like a raw vegetable almost\nAre you getting that a and B\nThey are not a vitamin and in fact you can it's just not true Dr Howard you Ken forego some of those multi vitamins big companies put out here and just substitute it with nothing but the fruits and vegetables is that correct\nYes in fact I'm going to reverse a little bit you you don't you don't substitute vitamins just they're they're all of its there plus hundreds of thousands of other chemicals that buffer and assist those chemicals to make them work hundred fold and that's what's important about it\nWhat the reason people take vitamins is because they know that their diet is substandard if they were sitting down every day and eating more than ten servings and in variety of thirty one different fruits and vegetables do you think they would even think about taking vitamins no\nI think they would though because that's why I'm already marketed as\nTrue and let me tell you every time you extract a chemical or every time you you consume an isolated chemical there is a side effect is one of the first things you're you're taught and pharmacology in medical school is there's a side effect every chemical\nBut in a fruit and vegetable or fruit or vegetable then there's hundreds of thousands of chemicals that counteract those negative side effects consistently and there is a side effect of fruits and vegetables good helped\n[laughter] so part a lot of the so called lifestyle diseases I've I've heard you mentioned before and I've read on your literature that ... a lot of the life style diseases that we know today can be prevented from the taking of the fruits and veggies\nOn a daily basis how and why is this\nWhat I Want to go back to one of the thing really fast is because sometimes on on the vitamin aspect sometimes there's even a point where we're help coach will be working with somebody and they just aren't getting the progress that they would like to be happening and then they find out the person is taking\nA whole bunch of vitamins on top of it the somehow they missed that hopefully not but [noise]\nAnd then we'll talk to them and so you know what let's start taking off some of this other chemistry so the ... the chemistry from real fruits and vegetables can start doing his job and they start seeing the results that were really wanting to to progress with\nThe reason being is the chemistry from the fruits and vegetables has to go in and counteract some of the chemistry that they're using the ... the extracts and so they have to use some of the chemistry from the fruits and vegetables to counteract some of the effects of those vitamins that aren't\nIs this area in the body so it actually most of the time works better without that now there's not a danger you can continue to take your vitamins if you want but frequently and most of the time you'll get a better result if you drop the multi vitamin\nAnd I just ask myself let's see which one smarter God or a scientist ...\nFor those that are just tuning in I'm Talking with Dr Douglas Howard to formulate or of balance of nature's fruits and veggies and fiber in space\nAnd I'm just amazed
