R. dot com slash Lenin Michael all the videos are there all the fun stuff and a bonus I meant and don't forget Chris Matthews will be ... gas and that is coming up but first let's get the news is now ten o'clock\nNew York's most most of the box they rated number one seven ten W O o voice of New York and\nBut people went back and found the Harvard a thing where they they had put in their big the brochure or at or whatever it was or annual report that they now have the first woman of color as a professor yes believe it or not the woman of color is Elizabeth Warren that's who they were claiming it was the woman of color\nThat looks like granting on the Beverly Hillbillies and see the woman that had sweetie pie that's what a lizard with Warren looks like a member of the cartoons\nYes Elizabeth Warren so she'll be\nPerfect for the Democrats yeah but now they realize she really bungled this up and the\nTiming was ridiculous it's three weeks before the midterm why screw anything up now yeah she's not running for anything\nI mean you know best side from her own job so she she why do this now this is obviously a presidential a move even the world's dumbest guy Stephen cold beer this bird brain listen to him last\nNight we heard them right this past ... deals with a hypothesis that Elizabeth Warren is running for president [noise]\nWhy would you would denounce that three weeks before mid term where you're not running for president now rent why do this so now they're really question whether they would trust her with a presidential campaign\nShe's a real ... a messes everything up and uh what is she up why was she doing this now what does she does she want to casino license when this out what it is\nYou know if you think about it she is not American indian she has no American indian DNA that test of one one thousand that's against Peruvian\nSpanish Colombian or in the end or whatever that was Donald Trump I think you could argue is more Indian and her\nHe said four casinos [laughter]\nHe's literally more Indian than she is so uh he goes back to calling her Pocahontas and uh he was all over\nThat gave me a million dollars\nIf you take a test that if you're in\nAll right that's the original statement but he ... they never put it in the first party so if we're in a debate this is well of course you'd have to debate him first second most you'd have to take it from a legitimate DNA company\nNot your friend doing a homemade test and you'd have to be tested against Cherokee DNA not Colombian a Peruvian once you think that's fair\nYeah ... ... there was another line to she said her parents had to a low because uh one of her parents was a Cherokee\nWell that's the other thing she clearly has been lying I I don't have the video here but uh this test shows maybe six ten generations ago somebody had to drop them in that that is that what her story was she this video for telling the story about her\nGrandparents their grandmother wanted to marry this is two generations ago yeah and uh because he was in India and they wouldn't let him and she starts crying you know the the the word love and they wouldn't let Mary because she's an Indian and they had to look [laughter]\nIt's just a big lie or just a ridiculous liar and what do you want from her she used to be a lawyer representing tobacco companies [noise]\nShe had a business flipping houses and was that Oklahoma uh at one point and to flip the house you had to buy it and then throw the people out and it turned out half the time it was veterans coming back from a war she'd be a perfect candidate [laughter] so she can never run for anything and the other big story\nWhich are funny is that getting any coverage Stormy Daniels you remember was Stormy Daniels sued President Trump you remember that week she was on TV every second\nAnd so was the lawyer ... every time you turn on CNN or MSNBC there they were every time you watch Lester all the open with Stormy Daniels and Michael ... suddenly she's not on the news they bury the story because the story yesterday\nBroke that a judge just tossed not only toss the case out\nThe Stormy Daniels lawsuit against Trump not only did he tested out he's ordered her to pay his legal fees and that's something which could be a million dollars or more so are those that are the idiots out there who gave to her go fund me account the money's going to Donald Trump\n[laughter]\nThe money's Senate is going to Donald Trump idea like that so I Want a you know will you admit now that he does when\nHe wins he remember he said you get tired of winning he wins he's won so far every round with North Korea it looks like he's won a little victory here with us Saudi Arabia he's gotten them to admit\nIt looks like they're about to admit to killing a Jamal can remedy um\nUh he's won with NAFTA he keeps winning look at this when he has gotten this is unheard of he'd gotten a prostitute to pay a politician that's pretty amazing a prostitute will write a check to a politician how do you like that that doesn't happen you ever think you'd live to see that let's see went in to\nTry that [laughter] so this is pretty good about uh when\nIt's a story broke and it was big news that the stormy Daniels' case was thrown out and she was she was ordered to pay Donald Trump or New York times website guess where the story was you had to go twenty five stories down to get to twenty five stories down\nThat was a way back when she filed the lawsuit it was not only the number one story you got an alert on your phone and everything [noise] twenty five stories down lion Lester Holt in well you won't even see it on the news maybe they'll stick it in at the end hey all the CNN MSNBC always kind of shows\nIt was like forty minutes into this hour that they got to it it wasn't\nElizabeth Warren she's a cracker ... woman a crazy crack there but a\nWritten while you on test this is why you shouldn't legalize marijuana look at this guy ten thirty are not aligned with what's happened to him thinking of marijuana that piece typewriter ...\nYou don't give up your like Alec Baldwin using I'll Try another episode\n[laughter] but the reason\nWhy the many Native Americans alarm ... but ... it was Asian global ... people\nAnd it was missing anything but uh I got some here killing thirty seconds anyway our\nAge and so that's why they use\nThat word Joe Bartlett you got a new iPhone yeah you've got the eight or traded up he turned in his two I got three so the aid is a good phone\nWell I could have gone up to the uh the ten with you or they X or whatever they call that thing now\nA but wait a minute two weeks ago you're one of those people you know these people give his speech I'm happy with my this I don't need a new well\nYou know what happened I honor I Will no I did a software update and next thing you know my touch functioned didn't work\nProperly oh\nWell that's the other problem when you say there you know everybody says I don't need a new phone I'm happy with this but when they keep doing these updates\nIt takes up more and more room on your hard drive there and at some point you're going to have to get the new phone has much more capacity so I think they sabotage the lower levels once they do the sabotage it they update it with more stuff in there\nYou don't say people say well when they change member they had the old plug you plugged in and then switched to the lightning plug them and all of a sudden you're plugs didn't work they say they do that so you have to buy new cables to the reason they do that they do that because the new plug it was like one six the size of the old plug which freeze up room in there to put in more parts\nThat don't you think it's strange that as soon as you do an upgrade your phone starts acting strangely\nDon't you think it's strange that you got in your hand a little thing that has a TV set the thousand books it's got five thousand CDs and it it's got a a camera it's got video and then you say oh we have to get a new one every couple of years\nI I Will tell you the one thing it happened over the weekend and I was out of town it's\nIt's very hard not to have a phone oh that's right you don't have it as like oh my well I Know people who go out without their phone at night up on purpose Brian gumbo of talking to them as you said after six o'clock never take my phone with me like\nI mean what how could you do [laughter] well I mean he probably end up talking to people\nYeah well that's great was sitting in a restaurant I said I don't have to ... see now he's got no phone to go look at who's going to have to listen to it and he's saying let's go to Vinnie and massive ... have any\nIdea I'm off a poor Pocahontas ... she's forty Skeeter bight away from losing her entire\n[laughter] that's true that's funny uh you know a ... you all these attacks are when President Trump made insensitive racial comment he called her Pocahontas it's a joke and you know who made that up how a car that's right\nYeah yeah for years he was calling her Pocahontas suffered a President Trump got it from but it I Love how a lesser all\nOr he made a terrible insensitive a racist joke about to lose if it weren't but never tell you what it was because if he says\nPocahontas everybody knows it's a joke and now we know who she is I mean you say ... there's there's no explanation needed\nYeah no explanation needed she bungled this all up and with that fake video that she put out with the pose a professor of runners on that stage there was very staged when you look at the actual results she was never tested for Cherokee DNA ever\nThey tested against Peruvians Spanish I think a lot of people think she took ... real de de ... like the professional companies\nShe probably took two or three of them to see if she could pass knew she couldn't that's what she did a homemade private one with this professor and they that's why they didn't use Cherokee DNA says he couldn't get any but I Know there's a reason they didn't use it anyway when we come back Chris Matthews I Know you you have to MSNBC we love Chris Matthews he'll be with us next\nOn seven tangible you or let's get the latest news here's Joe Bartlett\nTurkish officials said journalist ... is dead they tell the Associated Press there's evidence inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul that

morning lark I saw a special on the secret service or last night and they said one of the hardest jobs for them was protecting President Bush when he made a surprise visit to troops in Iraq I Thanksgiving Day two thousand three yeah\nAnd it was just amazing because normally the only time you hear about the secret services when there's an incident about that and let somebody jumps over the White House fence service or whatever but it's just incredible how many people have to coordinate and then when you have to coordinate with foreign countries\nAnd they said they have to be successful one hundred percent of the time\nThey're they have a good point you know if you if you walk around Trump Tower right now go see the secret service all over the place or plainclothes end uniform Secret Service you see the work they do I've talked to a million Secret Service guys who years about what was the most difficult thing they ever had to deal with a B C assassination censorship but they've told me the most difficult moment\nFor the secret service was bill and Hillary Clinton were in the White House\nI'm not kidding Hillary Clinton used to hit\nBill Clinton she would punch him slap him she threw a lamp Adam that kind of stuff went on and at one point at the highest level of the secret service they had a meeting 'cause these agents went to them and said that some ... there are times where she's really punching him it's our job to protect the president from an attack what do we do in this case\nDo we stop her do we grab her and stop or if he's hitting the president what are we to do\n[laughter] uh it was decided not\nTo do anything that he he's the president he'll tell you if he wants to stop so they said that was the most tricky moment they ever went through a check on the Web pages a lot of good stuff up there a Joe Biden it looks like he's the front runner now Elizabeth Warren has screwed up any hope of ever getting the nomination with this bungled up fake DNA test\nSo it looks like it's Joe Biden but he has a history of groping women even teenage girls literally groping them kissing them you can see them cringing\nA watch the video we have a lot of video many different incidents where he's doing this and we have that up on the Web page and no tell real you won't believe it it's it's it's hard to watch but it's real and then a Trump protesters here's a

times stole his tax returns\nAnd there was showing how he didn't pay any taxes you use the deductions and depreciation every real estate guy does it all the top real estate families in the world that's how they transfer their money\nThey didn't make that clear in the article that this is very consistent with what everybody else has done it in that business is one reason these real estate guys get so rich they don't have to pay any tax\nYou you get on a billion dollar building but this depreciation stuff allows you to always show a loss best friend so that didn't work that bombshell so this past week they tried Jared Kushner looking as he is highly paid any federal tax in years\nThe real estate business saved precision that Doug Jones a thought it was more interesting to kids like a Seventeen years old these were three hundred and fifty million that was pretty good\nGood started yeah a little launching pad their\nYeah that's pretty good ah so you're doing pretty well so the but they never point out any of this stuff and a Stormy Daniels look at her she sues the president all over the television you can't get away from her she's on twenty four seven she in the creepy ... lawyer ...\nYesterday the judge throws the case that borders her to pay Trump kick it on TV she's probably calling them hey it's a big story don't you want me I don't know [laughter] ah speaking of Chris Matthews we love them\nBut ah he didn't get to that story until forty minutes into the show [laughter] I study the lead story New York times that was the front page Stormy Daniels she lost she has to pay Trump it was if you went to the Times' website it was the number twenty five story you know far down and you had to grow up to that\nWhat a bunch of fake phone these these these immediate people they buried at so deep it look at this ... you know the Pentagon or has to have a cloud\nThis is the big business you know and you wonder are these companies like Microsoft how do they make all these why are they still making so much when the clouds stuff even Amazon they supply the cloud which is where the business stores everything\nYeah I understand this cloud thing I mean I Know it goes somewhere in yeah like\nIn the old days if you were a company you had files you had millions of files were so massive these files you couldn't fit them in your building so you'd have to buy another building the store the files it now this was all digital and it's stored on a cloud you have to buy cloud space\nSo this is a huge business one of the biggest contracts in the world is the Pentagon needs a cloud\nCan you imagine how much stuff they're keeping yeah so that is a huge business Google says we will not do business with the Pentagon for ethical reasons [laughter]\nThey don't like the Pentagon [laughter] they preferred to not have a Pentagon talk of the kind of crazy\nThese left wing nuts or the military we hate\nLet's Neal and the flags flying less let's refused to do their cloud services this is a U.S military how could you ate them\nNo wonder Blumenthal gets elected so Amazon and Microsoft said we'll all be happy to do this every they want the contract about trying to get it to a multibillion dollar contract but this stupid Google without good deal of some unless\nI don't know anything about this but maybe deep down it's not as good a cloud maybe Amazon Microsoft much better services maybe grew and those are not going to win the bidding uh-huh yeah so maybe they've dropped out for that reason\n[noise] hey ah Gretchen Carlson you know this grumpy Gretchen Carlson just cold grumpy woman she has been running the Miss America pageant a past year and destroyed it uh it just made a mess of things she even eliminated the\nBathing suit competition should eliminate everything else should just do that it would be a better pageant they'd get better ratings so it was such a disaster this year they assume she would leave a and they were all going after attacking us they stopped like the last month 'cause I figure she's leaving now\nNow they're starting again because apparently she not leaving she won't go anywhere she wants to run it again for the next year or and they're all upset and then a lot of people there saying what she's really up to she wants to run for office that's a real plan\nWhat would you run for Senate\nAh knowing her with her ego I Would think president of place you go for that or she wants to be a vice presidential candidate\nBut they think that's the real reason they can't get rid of this woman so you may have a screwed up pageant\nFor a second year hey we did the story last that we don't usually like to repeat stories but this is very important Alec Baldwin is talk show debuted Sunday night lowest ratings in history he set a new record for low ratings\nEven Univision beat him [laughter] oh wow you had about two million viewers for ABC primetime network TV that is pretty bad for the bad Alec Baldwin\nTotal disaster or what made him think this would work a talk show\nWell there's plenty of talk shows out there\nYeah but uh most of these guys are funny or their performers or he's just a big fat guy sitting in a chair mumbling and when he does a talk show he talks like this he took his voice [noise]\nImagine for the show like this for two hours and you try to listen to this and then he has his first guest deniro ever talked to how much they ask him anything he just goes ... ... ... [laughter] so hosted talk like this and then to narrow ...\n[laughter] oh boy and I wonder what you got the lowest ratings in history so I don't know what they do they'll probably uh\nKeep it on another week or two or they'll order him to make some big changes like bringing a co host of bringing something or turning more into a\nVariety show and make it more of a game show [laughter] or do something or they'll tell them you know if you're not going to do impressions are due sketches we can't have it on any more they just sit there and talks to people yeah just a big fat guy sitting in a chair they have these big big fat chairs these big puffy chairs\nI guess that's to make him look smaller [laughter] but it's not working hey you know but uh what what is going on with mayor de Blasio's wife ... McCray when you're talking about a traveling yeah everybody starting to look at the Shirley and McCray is running up enormous bills traveling leaving the city traveling all over the country find first class I\nSay let's pay it if it gets out of the city [laughter] I think a lot of what could have a goal fund me Babe Ruth keeps their way you speak yeah some nice woman she is all very nice person very nice woman but when she gets up to speak\nDeadly deadly\nHe's pretty good he's not a bad speaker but when she talks a drones and wouldn't just to say a low it was like twenty minutes so [laughter] she apparently wants to run for something she may thirtieth trips these are like campaign trips right now she's clearly campaigning she wants to run for office so I don't know if she wants to\nRun for Senate or Congress or something like that or a lot of people think when he's term limited out but she will run for mayor so maybe chefs you probably know she's not a great speaker because I've seen her in certain situations you get sort of speaks and half the people leave\nSo maybe she's doing these thirty trips you get it's a good thing to do you go around the country speak and other places where nobody sees it\nOr get a couple of years of practice you can you can become a great speaker\nMario Cuomo was the worst speaker I ever saw\nWhen he was a secretary of state uh\nYeah I thought he was always a pretty good speaker no he was he stunk and then he started to trained himself and within two or three years he was the greatest order in American politics\nHe was brilliant at turning himself around learning how to do everything he was great so she could do that I don't know she's not Mario Cuomo\nNot exactly the charismatic either well a nice woman she has a very nice woman\nA promise you got to have something to say I don't know what she has to say uh the mayor very excited that that we had a weekend where there were no shootings\nYou know crime has been ever since Rudy Giuliani cleaned up crime in New York it's been great we've had a Ray Kelly what you think about the police commercials you had like ... you have guys like that\nUh they're so good that they lock in whatever it is they're doing into the system it's baked in there so even the next bunch of guys you know Neal is great a bill Bratton was great even you know no matter what the mayor tries to do it's a big baked into the system so you have a great crime numbers and no shootings\nIs last weekend Friday Saturday and Sunday there was not a single shooting and all of New York city\nAnd God Bless him for pretending that he has something to do with this when you\nThink about the history we came from and the challenges that has to be overcome by this NYPD it's absolutely extraordinary but I Want to emphasize a city of eight point six million people not a single shooting for three days\nA when you think about what we had to do Rudy Giuliani Ray Kelly bill brat and what they had to do Howard safer to take back the streets and here he is to stand there took credit you have\nTo give him credit because the crime has gone down since he became mayor\nHe's kept a low\nYou don't know if he has I think uh all the stuff those guys well paid into the system has been brilliantly managed by O'Neill James O'Neill great commission\n... the ... but he has transitioned away from like the stop and frisk policies he's going to community policing that's his deal community policing and it's been effective and that's what he said um you know he gets most of the credit for that gunshot free weekend uh yeah\nBut on the other hand remember you don't live in Manhattan you know walking around here at night it is a homeless camp well All right I'll give you that it is a homeless camp all over the place there's more menacing ... homeless yep all over the place and he has done what other mayors have told me they think is the single\nRock love your show uh it's funny a Bill O'Reilly and split up it's not it's a what a shout out of high school like Bill O'Reilly I Want the Holy Cross college just like it's not so it's pretty pretty funny but anyhow yeah the reason I the reason I called which I hang out with a lot of liberal friends and uh\nAre they can't wait to win the house so they\nStarted teaching and I tell them bringing on because\nThat will be the worst mistake ever update me illegal from age but it'll backfire like all these other tricks do and I want them I told him I tell all your friends on Twitter not root for that is who is to just moving on planet tests on central policy because it'll totally backed by and by the way I Would love it\nYeah no actually Trump is in a good position if the Democrats win a couple of reasons one they will do impeachment they'll do a Russia investigation but the thing is when you do it in the house it's televised all day long MSNBC and CNN will televise it\nSo when you hear about Mueller in this Russia investigation you wonder what do we find but when it suddenly on television and you're watching these witnesses all day long you start to realize there's nothing to this they don't have anything\nEven the impeachment are investigating Trump's taxes as a you watch this on TV the actual testimony you start to see it really is nothing there that just fishing around looking for something here's the problem if the Democrats win the house I don't know if anybody's really thought about this if they win the house\nChairman of the banking committee Maxine Waters have you thought about that I'm not kidding she becomes chairman of the banking committee a chairman of the oversight committee will become Jerry Adler kooky little ah Jerry\n... who is always a crazed left wing a fanatic\nUh of course pillow so you'll probably become speaker again but you got some really bad people running these committees it's something to think about also if the Democrats open hearings on Russia\nThey'll look insane I think every normal person ... says there's no Russia collusion ball is a pretty good uh investigators spent thirty million\nHe's got a top investigating guys two years later they couldn't find a damn thing so I mean you as Trump's what did I say yesterday to Leslie stall kept me a break all Russians said can you help me get us go to Carl in Alexandria, Virginia hate Carl\nHey can you ask the Raleigh one question for me I Want to know when is he going to write killing Hoffa\nOh good suggestion and you know you know the guy is going to make one of those dumped suggestions that are pretty\nSmart so\nWhy not right and it's coming up next among do it when we actually write this down 'cause no chance I'll Remember this in two minutes but yeah that's a good idea I'm sure you've thought about it for all but we'll ask them to go to Mary in New Jersey have Mary\n... Mary ... [noise]\nI guess whenever I can now about the situation with ... [noise] a wine\nElizabeth Warren wind ...\nDid come across on the news call ... ... ...\nYeah but it wasn't played up Lester Holt actually opened with a DNA test proves she's in India and he didn't mention it was a fake DNA test we forgot to mention they never tested or for charity DNA\n[laughter] I just want to keep you on all this you sound like a sweet woman this Mary hosts sweet I'm going to get get get an issue here with her husband took out the garbage say yes I'm ...\nI'm On the wall to wall uh-huh we got into trouble for us when we started local news and K.C Cole and [noise]\nWell we got into trouble actually I think for the elaboration\nDon't agree I think if they made it more the problem is with an ... MSNBC and CNN they stop making the entertainment they got dead serious\nYou remember one thing about O'Reilly is it wasn't just like angry news he used to have the actors Ani do funds segments he still does and it keeps it a nice mix of and well we'll talk to him next he's got a great book out Bill O'Reilly coming up next on seven ten W O R let's get the latest news here's Joe Bartlett\nMarket evidence now that journalist ... she'll be dead Turkish officials are telling the Associated Press that they've uncovered evidence inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul that kind of show he was killed there this after CNN is reporting the Saudis may had been she'll be died during an interrogation that went wrong\nPresident Trump calling Senator Elizabeth Warren a complete and total fraud she took a DNA test revealing some Native American heritage but Trump calls it a bogus DNA test\nPresident says Warren should apologize for perpetrating fraud against the American public Garfield high school is closed", "show_name": "Mark Simone", "year": "2018", "city": "New York", "day": "16"}
