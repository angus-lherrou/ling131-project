I\nI think General Mattis knows what NATO is all about\nUh you may know about the military side of a executing the things but as far as the agreement the contract I don't think I wouldn't get what'd you send Madison Trump to negotiate a contract for you\nCan always send Trump today I got you to contract well I think he said when he says NATO he means the agreement where we pay everybody's military expenses\nAnd when he says I Know what it's about what he's always saying privately if all these things NATO Paris climate of course he's right he says all these things have basically a shakedown operation skimming money out of the U.S\nThey are all these agreements where we pay everybody's expenses that's basically all they are have mad asleep it really is a good guy very good secretary defend it doesn't mean a thing a Obama head for instance for secretaries of defense it's not unusual two years is a long time for a secretary of defense and if he leaves I Would guess\nFirst choice General Jack Keane\nHe was the first choice originally he was Trump's choice but he uh he wanted to make some money for a couple of years he had a lot of his wife had been very sick and you need to make some money and uh\nHe's the guy when he ... he just turned it down and he said but I have somebody should get taken he's the guy the recommended Mattis so if Madison relieved General Jack Keane is probably the first one to go back to uh what else to talk about Russia or you know we stop and think about it he's right that Russia charge is the most ridiculous thing in the world\nYou really think I called Russia to help me with a lecture give me a break they wouldn't be able to help me at all\nIn Russia so ridiculous\nWho's right what the hell including critic but let's say ... Russians it helped me when what would they do they wouldn't help of course not but what could they do let's say they tried to elude within what could they do for him\nWhat it could give them a ton of money but he didn't have a ton of money and spend any money really compare to Hillary spread nothing so it wasn't about money what could they do for fifty thousand campaign workers who didn't have any campaign workers ... let's say a Russian wanted to ... ... what could they have actually done for those those twelve Facebook ads to make any difference\nYeah Facebook botch [laughter] they they showed at one point that a a throughout the campaign these phony Russian Facebook ads are almost a hundred thousand of they forget to mention the same sentence\nThere were two billion pro democratic Facebook ad so I I don't know what they could have done um what else was obviously a Jamal ... came up actually I'm the president is flying to Florida as we speak he's headed down there right now to inspect the hurricane recovery\nAnd ah he talked about that on the way to the helicopter he spoke with the king of Saudi Arabia\nOr they had a long conversation I spoke with the king which is great unfortunately king has nothing to do with this this would be the prince\nThe new prince who took over the king is who we spoke to a lot of people think if it turns out this prints did this and he's a bad guy and he's got to go the king has to remove him but the king is like a hundred and eighty and no one knows if he's got the strength of the will to get the battle with the prince but he did speak to the president\nReport ... sorry from\nNo knowledge of it that is very strongly\nNo okay well you're going to say\nThat he didn't really know lazy\nDon't want to get his side\nTo me like maybe they\nGetting hit the bottom of it\nIt could be these road kill his you know he might want to team up with O. J. on this hunt for the real killers may maybe they could combine the manpower both\nI think it's pretty clear this guy did not come out of the constantly writing in one piece let's say\nThey apparently have surveillance video of the front of the back if there was any time he came out front or back they would have released a video that he did come out but I think in a several trash bags and brief ... they think\nThey really think that he was chopped up a bit maybe not in there but probably in there and that he came out and went to the airport in diplomatic pouches which are not inspected and they have large\nDiplomatic pouches you can hide bodies in the in fact some investors have his kid living people in those diplomatic pouches\nThis way they do that when I have to sneak somebody out of the country they put them in a diplomatic pouch they have what's called an air box\nThat's hooked up to them so they can breathe in the diplomatic pouch just respected so uh\nUh ... chopped up to a private jet Saudi private jets were waiting at the airport those guys got on a minute left so I imagine a Jamal 'cause she'll get was probably in them and maybe dumped in the ocean or something\nOr maybe ground up into powder or who knows so you you as a U.S what's his name said the godfather you won't be seeing him any more [laughter]\nI hate to say it [laughter]\nNot funny you know and that poor guy if he's trying to get married but Clyde he knew what\nA position he was in with the Saudi prince in this new Saudi princes tortured people killed people you're writing vicious articles about him you know pick pick on somebody you're gonna make it your life's mission and your journalism to ruthlessly attack somebody hey pick a\nBernie made off what's he gonna do [laughter] the Saudi princes are you going to go after and then if I were doing that I certainly wouldn't be going into the Saturday a counselor in in Turkey of all places\nYou know I think he could have been a better choice\nHe left the country and moved to the United states just because he thought it'd be safer but if that's the case don't go into any Saudi council that anywhere uh they said that um\nThey'll allow inspections of the Saudi council but I'm sure everything's been hosed down they say five months after this yeah so there's kind of like Iran deal we can expect with one wants to notice [laughter]\nAh but it was we got left to get to a a a God Bless Senator Schumer whenever this something he can exploit for his own purposes\nHe's all over the limousine crashed a horrible limousine crash you remember the first time you try to exploited\nHe does these fake press conferences every Sunday in right after the crash she said let's find some way I can exploit this and they announced regulations on how long the limousine can be ... remember that now and then the report came out if it had nothing to do with the size of the car\nHad to do with the inspections or repairs it had to do with the the drivers condition so now what does he she said that everybody said and I find it another way to tie me into this limousine thing I Want to exploit this some more so here he was yesterday uh ... what does it come up with one\nHere are gay the layering [noise]\nIn regulating scratch limit\nWhat the hell is he talking if\nYou all are leaving\nCrash Harry county taking the lives of twenty people Eighteen\nNow you might say well\nIt sounds like why would he do all these regulations if he didn't care uh he doesn't do any of these whenever the Sunday press conference they write up a script you know she reads it because he doesn't even know what it says he just puts on those Ben Franklin glasses and reads it and then a frozen the wastebasket ticket in the car with them when they leave frozen the wastebasket there\nSo I'm going to ask the authorities\nThe NTSB when there is a stretch limo\nSo they so that\nYou know that problem solve very big whenever afterward again call any level company you're fine a Chuck Schumer is on it\nI Am hopeful within six months we can get recommendations\nThere's a need for legislation\nHugo lightning speed six months from now they might get some recommendations tend to look at him and he said if there is indeed\nThen maybe of legislation so I Won two years three years tops they'll have to solve for years at the most just he's a he's on it uh hey Elizabeth Warren took a DNA test mhm although some people are questioning this DNA test\nOr she didn't go to a noted DNA company she went to a professor at Stanford a winter for a little uh academia buddies\nOr she says is a DNA expert and he did the test although he's not a recognized DNA company and he won't show the a test yourself wouldn't you think to make this really legitimate she would let an independent person do it and take the sample\nA publicly\nYeah small I mean her ... Indian heritage has got to be a ... minute\nYeah and people have gone over his work say there's something very fishy about it because at one point he says uh she's probably one thirty second Indian\nBut then in later party says she could be won five hundred and twelve Indian [laughter] why doesn't seem to have anything down in there so let's figure it's in the middle one ah three hundred [laughter] but again it's\nGlued their door late probably about ten thousand dollars in damage to the building and it's a beautiful building I live for a year and a half before I even recognize that it was the metropolitan Republican club at that nondescript\nYeah it's really a nice elegant building and again it does cause there's no problem on the block I had to go there once for a speech but uh I couldn't even find that you're right you don't even know which door it is it's very nondescript it's not bothering anybody and ah so how does a neighborhood feel they're probably a little worried about\nYou know there was about a hundred and fifty the antifa protesters out there they're all well that young kids and uh they're out there you know\nRaising her rockets the entire night the cops are that that a phenomenal job they they were out there or waiting for him at barricades set out they kept them separated but there's going to give her separated from their was maybe ten people in the neighborhood that came out or being kept the weight by these clowns and they were yelling and screaming about the KKK and not see them just ruthless Arab mob and they back\nUp and down the street or they're littering all over the place or climb on top of people's park cars climb on the barricades the police just stood by and didn't really do much they kind of contain them by\nYou know I said a lot of 'em up and throw them in jail\nAlright Anthony thanks it's horrible uses after a whole week of ah MSNBC and CNN broadcasting constantly there's no such thing as democratic mobs they aren't really mobs this was a mob it was disgusting now who's the guy the cause of this controversy as speaker there\nYeah I got any McGinnis he's the head of the Proud Boys organization\nSo he's considered a far right wing guy now there's something totally sleaze ball totally illegitimate organization called the Southern Poverty Law Center it is funded by the worst people it's like one of these fake fact checking organizations it's a far left wing crazy group at southern\nA Southern Poverty Law Center but the fake news media has appointed them the ruler on who's a hate group who isn't I don't know anything about these Proud Boys maybe they are and who knows but I wouldn't take the Southern Poverty Law Center is worse for word for it they're like a\nLike a notch above media matters that's about it\nIs pretty good these are ah like white supremacist it is there anything immigrant anti Muslim they\nCould be don't ever trust the Southern Poverty Law Center anything so uh uh ... and they could be a bad group but even if they were uh you can't be vandalizing and they get angry mobs\nAre causing mayhem and everything Governor Cuomo though is on top of this he's like right there with like Chuck Schumer and him these are like\nThem to whenever there's something to explain they are sliding down that fire poll jumping on the trucks going to work Governor Cuomo all over\nThe we will not tolerate hate speech it is not pretend\nAdmitted he's making hate speech all the time and nobody sent more hateful things in him about Republicans about Trump remember he's talking about Republicans are they better get the hell out of his state and ... you know probably the most intolerant rival acted\nA it is illegal we will investigate it to be foolish\nOkay\nBut there's another club we don't have it here but we're talking about sending in the state police to investigate trying he wants to state police and the FBI to investigate us of all the FBI investigate he he just kept on telling 'cause you can't trust the FBI the investigation of Kevin does no good\nA second of all state police great guys are doing wonderful job but there are no match for the NYPD detectives NYPD or get to the bottom of this we don't need a guys with Smokey the bear hats on\nWell making fun of them are not making fun of them but in New York City there like McLeod running around here they are I mean who knows the streets of New York better than true I mean if you really needed to get to the bottom of some\nYou want to NYPD Blue you want to end the civil rights you don't want to smoke in the band and from upstate New York\nAnyway when we come back a Michael good one will be with us the smartest best columnist in America\nHe wrote a column yesterday about this whole Kanye West of things will get to that and more coming up on seven ten W. or let's get the latest news here's Joe Bartlett\nPresident Trump says he has talked to the king of Saudi Arabia and he denies any knowledge of the parents that journalist ...

I agree with you mark it strikes me that this is a lot of winning thing that that people will will be turned off by that but I'm not certain of that I I mean I think the country is changing dramatically\nI mean you mentioned the the violence at the Manhattan Republican headquarters in either mayor de Blasio Governor Cuomo condemned it uh neither did a Senator Schumer nor job rent\nOr an or Hillary Clinton or Eric Holder Maxine Waters Cory Booker none of them can then condemn explicit political violence now that tells me\nThat they're reading poles and it's their own gut reaction that tells them if they did condemn it they themselves would be at risk of losing support from the Democratic base so that tells me\nThat they see the Democratic base as approving of this kind of political violence so you know you and I may be wrong it ... it may actually be good politics which is incredibly frightening when you think of the implications of that\nWhen it comes to carefully reading those polls I don't think Hillary Clinton [laughter] track record on that I think Governor Cuomo did condemn it yesterday but um\nNo I don't know if he did I missed it I think what he condemned was the was the street fighting yeah a\nBuddy only condemned the uh the the the conservative guys who were involved but but as far as I can tell it's only the antifa types who were arrested\nSo it's a very strange situation that we have here in Manhattan and ... with this vandalism and then the street fight uh I I don't really know the police said they have not gotten any\nComplaints of crimes which strikes me as bizarre so the whole thing is a bit of history but I say but I have not seen any Democrat condemn the original vandalism\nYeah and it's a you have you been to the Manhattan Republican clubs nice quiet place to start a and this\nYou are not many people go there it's quite\nNice building and here's somebody should do an expert in the Southern Poverty Law Center declared them a hate group that's how the fake news just anointed this of sleazy Southern Poverty Law Center is some kind of arbitrator of everything\nYeah yeah they I mean it used to have a better reputation but the more you look at them the more you realize there are just a front there just a propaganda group for radical Democrats are and they're sitting on hundreds of millions of dollars apparently and foreign bank accounts or a offshore bank accounts how's that\nYeah and um she made a list of obvious names where that money came from you'd probably be right so\nThat's right you couldn't you can right here we can do it right now [laughter]\nWell if you missed Michael good ones column yesterday go online you can get it and you should read them every Sunday and every Wednesday in the New York post great job as always and Michael Goodman thanks for being with us\nMy pleasure mark thank you pick\nYour own every a check on the Web page got some great stuff up there have you just love New York city here some amazing history this is high quality HD video of New York city a hundred and seven years ago like right down the streets of Manhattan is really interesting\nAnd then who has the biggest house in the world well here's the top Thirteen biggest houses on earth it's all up on the Web page go to seven ten W.

or the facts shooting and do this a Sunday Morning show looks like she's running Bloomberg is running he re registered as a Democrat which he always was a he pretended to be a Republican 'cause that's the only side that was open when he wanted to run for mayor a lot of people pretend the Republican or a smaller is\nA Democrat all his life but when he wanted to be in the Bush administration he had to go register as a Republican who's that idiot and the uh New York times David Brooks him\nHe he registers as a Republican so we can claim that he's a conservative he's the most liberal guy in the world he was the first guy to really back Obama push Obama for president very liberal guy to get this one on the\nCNN on a Navarro the most far left she but she registers as a Republican so she can say she's a Republican and uh so Bloomberg you know he's always been a Democrat he registers Republican just for a political purposes back then but he's now back to being a Democrat guess where he was this week in New Hampshire\nUh-huh he's running oh wow New Hampshire has never been to New Hampshire and his allies multibillion with Seventy billion never said themselves I like to go to New Hampshire he's fair pretending he likes New Hampshire why because he's running for president will look at the guys got enough\nMoney [laughter]\nBut he's not exactly a man of the people he's thirst and now the third he looks he makes John Kerry looked like a blue collar guy remember Kerry did that too with his blue jeans and his overall trying to look like a hunting with him he's really didn't\nLook at the um the the list of Democrats are running I mean Bloomberg has a decent chance zero\nNone when he talks in that first and how the third accent and then people find that he ... tried to pass a law on how much soda he'll allow you to drink well that's good for Democrats Democrats that stuff and I think so there's Elizabeth Warren\nA she took a DNA test although nobody trusts this test\nIt was in a actual recognized DNA companies ... professor buddy of hers who she says is an expert in DNA meantime if you'd go through his findings\nVery questionable one part of the report she could be one thirty second Indian than another port she's won five hundred and twelve Indian and they won't show anybody in the details for that to be real remember President Trump offered a million bucks\nI gave me a million dollars\nIf you take a test your\nOkay but I think he means you'd have to take the we'd have to get the sample from you it had happened to be done independently a buddy of yours can't run it right to be done by a real company the swab has to be taking we have to see it's your DNA and there has to go to a real company and be done\nAnd then I think he would give it a million dollars but it must be a charity a President Trump's choice\nBecause she'll choose something insane like the Southern Poverty Law Center or some I think he said it's her choice yeah he did but we'd have to switch that he'll pick something good like veterans or something like that she will pick some really weird oh thing so so it's\nBut she's got an Indian in there somewhere right\nWell we don't know because we'd have to get a real DNA test from a legitimate independent company uh but the fact that she would do this I mean she's running I think that she's never done it before so she's running Bloomberg is running if\nYou take all the latest polls among Democrats Biden is by far in the lead\nWay in the lead by this guy that ah and everybody in the Republicans wants to fight and 'cause he's the easiest to beat all you gotta do is run clips of him nobody has said more crazy racist things than by and he's been the biggest ... of women ever the video of him groping women and sometimes young girls\nChildren or I should put that up again tomorrow that video by groping\nAnd not to mention he said the dumbest things ever said I mean the craziest gaps ever so you could just run these commercials all day and night also has anybody been caught lying more than\nBiden right even in the vice presidential debate where everybody is watching when he he started to cry telling the story about the diner he goes to every morning in\nThe working people sit within the stories they tell him he talked about this diner and tears coming down his base where they check the next day there is no such dying [laughter] yes [laughter]\nSounded good [laughter]\nAnd he talked about the Home Depot he went to right near his house and he told the whole story then they find that there's no Home Depot anywhere near his house [laughter] so ah he'd be perfect they definitely definitely want to run against him Biden Warren perfect ticket for Republicans\nA have a President Trump is a answering some of the smaller questions apparently it's a they've begun the process Muller has written questions one thing that's leaking out from some sources is none of the questions have anything to do with obstruction of justice apparently Muller is not looking at obstruction of justice\nWhich left or the Russians\nHave well I don't think you can look at obstruction of justice for 'cause there's no nothing there to look at\nAnd if you tried to say the Kony firing which is not obstruction because that's perfectly within his job description can fire anybody anytime he wants so uh but Jonathan Turley one of the great legal scholars points out if there ever were an investigation of the comedy firing\nAbsolutely Rod Rosenstein has to recuse himself\nBecause he wrote a memo explaining\nWhy Comey had to be fired so he's chief witness so he cannot supervise anything where he's the witness so he absolutely have to recuse himself and Turley points out mother would have to recuse himself since he's quote ... best friend\nHe worked with call me for years and when Comey was fired Comey took ... to a job interview with Trump to get the job Mahler actually wanted the FBI directed job and went to be interviewed I think was made twenty six two thousand Seventeen\nBeen in earlier that mark there's an actual date worry and Kobe admits that he went with mother for his job interview or where they may or can we waited outside mother went and met with Trump or the job of FBI Director didn't get it so he'd have to recuse himself\nShe [laughter] if you never thought it was really a swap look at that mothers the special counsel ... he's been his best friend for Twenty years that go on vacations together they work together a when can we get fired mullet tried to get the job is FBI Director and call me went with them to the job interview well\nThis is a swap a and a Rosenstein has been involved with these two guys for ever so there's no way they can investigate the call me firing they don't have to recuse themselves Governor Cuomo he's running for reelection\nThere yeah yeah I'm a fan of Bloomberg I think the only but we'll see how the Democrats get some um you know I tend to be right of center but um yeah they're going to be cycle Hillary by and I hope to get some new blood and hope their platform is more than simply don't like Trump\nYeah All right my good call it a Bloomberg has a lot of stuff in his past there\nOr a million women I mean a million women in his past\nBut uh I don't think anybody was that I'm happy with them they all seem to uh gotten along fine so and and if he's running against Trump or obviously that's not an issue I'm Single yeah he was single at the time when you're single around the time I imagine he was kind of a rough boss but uh you\nDon't really hear many stories about him well there was a sexual harassment suit against Bloomberg yeah but the U.S and when you're worth sixty billion ... believe me those suits go away really fast [laughter] you know ah it's when you were sixty billion is not Michael Cohen with oh here's a hundred thousand or we'll give you five million to keep quiet people keep quiet real fast so\nI you know when he ran this and I knew him long before he ran for mayor and I knew there was a lot of stuff there\nA love life all that stuff when he ran for mayor or all that disappeared real for you made that all go away but of course when you're running for mayor who's investigating the daily news [laughter] to run for president is different they're going to really dig into your but it's not like he's running oh oh wait he is running against the Clintons\nThe primary he will be against Hillary so she is not going to run the camera and believe me Perkins Cooley fusion GPS they're already being told to work on Bloomberg\nDaddy or anything they're Hillary stand up so look at Hillary when they can't find anything they make it up they'll make up a Russian collusion thing one of those things [laughter] she\nIt's rather than just a no chance to tell her that uh the big question is Michael Moore why does everything you touch bomb now was every movie a bomb last couple of movies nobody will go see him guy was so popular I'm Talking about Democrats why don't they even go see him anymore\nI don't know well it's been analyzed there are a couple of reasons uh years ago like Fahrenheit nine eleven that was two thousand and two or whatever that was it\nWas a different world if you watch the late night shows it was Jay Leno\nDavid Letterman or Conan O'Brien they were not political they make a couple of political jokes they'd make fun of the Democrats and they'd make fun of the Republican so it was not a vicious joke so there's two components what Michael Moore does it's comedy he really makes fun and ridicules\nThe conservative and then he gets into the weird conspiracy stuff he's the one that goes into that weird Halliburton stuff or a secret plane took the bin Laden family\nThat so well now a days late night is change there's nobody more partisan than Steven cold beer\nOr Kimball are all those guys so the comedy part of Michael Moore is useless now it's all over you can see it every night and cold beer no reason to go see Michael Moore and when it comes to those weird conspiracy theories like\nHalliburton or a Russian collusion or they're all over the New York times Washington Post CNN all the mainstream media is picking up all that stuff\nSo whatever Michael Moore comes up with nothing compared to the mainstream media the New York times has more ridiculous conspiracy theories everyday cold beer has more jokes than Michael Moore could ever make\nA career is over careers over there's no you know you kind of stuff that he used to do it's considered a unbelievable it some of the front cover the Huffington Post every day so there's no he's no longer a voice in the wilderness he's just a voice that nobody needs anymore he's just one of a million let's go to Kate in Bergen County Kate\nHow are you good thing I heard you talking about it than there are only getting Roseanne up all weekend long TV Land way casting Roseanne Barr show\nYeah I noticed that they they killed all the reruns when her controversy came up so she's back in the new one\nI was surprised by that I mean it wasn't just want to watch it so it was a marathon\nYeah so I guess they think it's OK to run her that's like uh the canary in the coal mine maybe she'll come back to ABC to the ... most likely bomb\nAnd then\nWho knows maybe fifth sixth episode they make a comeback surprise appearance well you never know you never know you could see her again you will not see Charlie Rose again I don't think and I don't think I've ever seen that by Oregon but you could see her again hey when we come back oh the great comedian how we Mandela will be with us\nComing up next and don't forget you have a chance to win a thousand dollars right if the
