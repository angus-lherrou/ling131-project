children she was fine until a few years ago showed an abnormal chest X ray she did not feel fine after the chest X ray she had a CAT scan showed a biopsy of one of the hospitals in New York area\nGeneral is transferred by her doctor and had chemotherapy and radiation standard chemo instead of radiation and for a while she would work and then the cancer came rip roaring back within a

saw her she came to me because of the cancers wasn't going away\nShe had a PET scan showing the cancer in the long that was persistent and increasing in size and picking up the radioactive sugar as a measurement for that called SUV says a size measurement it was three by three centimeters as an SUV of twenty [noise]\nAnd so we repeated the test and found that she had\nOnly cancer in the long remember she's getting years of chemotherapy for cancer it was only in\nThe long while the chemo Dr must have known that Dr\nLederman exist that Dr Lederman is able to treat a three by three centimeter mass along with ... percent success rate just with a few ten minute treatments\nSo why do the giver years of chemo therapy when we could treat this woman in a few ten minute sessions with a Ninety degree success rate\nThat as a permanent success most commonly\nHe knows the chemo even if it works for this kind of lung cancer even if it works and it doesn't work but even if it works works temporarily so I was giving her years of chemotherapy knowing it was at best temporary and at worst about even working\nWith side effects and furthermore she's been short of breath should in short of

woman\nYears of chemo for lung cancer did it work came to us we treated her like treated her two years ago and she's been in remission ever since no new cancer no spread of the cancer no more treatment just a few ten minute treatments to her lungs\nSir she's been in remission ever since good by the chemotherapy goodbye immunotherapy the chemo doctor wanted to give her chemo for the rest of her life remember to keep us on average about ten thousand dollars a month and the nation our nation\nHas almost doubled spending on chemotherapy used to be just a few years ago twenty five billion dollars a year\nAnd now it's almost forty five billion dollars a year or so you can see this is not petty cash is is huge amounts of money it's a huge industry and that's probably another reason why these drug companies are giving money to the chemo doctors and putting on the board and making them consultants and [noise]\nAll these scandals that we're reading about every day every day in including the New York times you can read about yourself if you have any doubt pick up the New York times and go through a last month and you'll see plenty of scandals about all the drug company money

six\nIs more aggressive will hit a Gleason eight so it was an aggressive cancer\nAnd went ... under the prostate usually twelve needles are put in very quickly like a spring loaded gun\nAnd seven of those twelve showed cancer and other doctors did the vibe she remember the doctor who does prostate biopsies is also the doctor generally that does the surgery not always but usually\nAnd this doctor pushed to to do robotic surgery [laughter] well luckily the patient declined snow you declined probably because he heard that if he had robotic surgery or any kind of open surgery opened our
