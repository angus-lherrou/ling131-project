back it's great to hear your voice it's become quite familiar to\nPeople all over the country in terms of ah encouraging people to take their fruits and veggies everyday\nDr Howard this is really revolutionary and yet it seems like the most simple concept in the entire world where did you come up with putting fruits and vegetables into a capsule and why ...\nYears years of study you know it's interesting the other companies now are starting to think they can catch a fad we're not a fad\nOr something that for many years of study and research and figuring out how to do this has made it happened and I always ... me when I hear other companies now they're starting to say oh we have more fruits and veggies in ours\nBlah blah blah we have fifty instead of thirty one and I'm like\nThey don't get it it's not how many per se it's how they interact with each other and we're not just a business it's trying to get on the shelf and convince people we're about results\nAnd that's why we offer like you said at the health coaching for example that's why we offer that is to help people accelerate the results there's no extra fee there's no extra charge for it infects business management companies have said oh you need to get rid of that department it just costs you money no that is what we are about results\nSo people say to me off and oh I take vitamins um I don't think I Need to take in a balance of nature because I keep I I'm such an advocate now because I've seen and I'm One of those that actually feels the difference when I don't take my balance of nature I Am so sluggish and\nFuzzy and when I take it and this is literally on a daily basis I can literally feel my body pick up at night and my thinking gets clearer me so I'm One of those people and I my parents are as well because they tell me about that fact but when people say to me\nOh no I take vitamins I don't need to take balance of nature I'm telling them you you need tend to eleven servings of fruits and vegetables per day and they are most potent nutritious like Ninety nine point nine hundred percent of ... like a raw vegetable almost\nAre you getting that a and B\nThey are not a vitamin and in fact you can it's just not true Dr Howard you can forego some of those multi vitamins big companies put out here and just substitute it with nothing but the fruits and vegetables is that correct yes\nIn fact I'm going to reverse a little bit you you don't you don't substitute vitamins just they're they're all of its there plus hundreds of thousands of other chemicals that buffer and assist those chemicals to make them work hundred fold and that's what's important about it\nWhat the reason people take vitamins is because they know that their diet is substandard if they were sitting down every day and eating more than ten servings and then friday of thirty one different fruits and vegetables do you think they would even think about taking vitamins\nNo I think they would though because that's why I'm already marketed yes it is\nTrue well and let me tell you every time you extract a chemical or every time you you\nConsume an isolated chemical there is a side effect it's one of the first things you're you're taught and pharmacology in medical school is there's a side effect every chemical\nBut in a fruit and vegetables and fruit or vegetable then there's hundreds of thousands of chemicals that counteract those negative side effects consistently and there is a side effect of fruits and vegetables good helped\n[laughter] so part a lot of the so called lifestyle diseases I've I've heard you mentioned before and I've read on your literature that ... a lot of the life style diseases that we know today can be prevented from the taking of the fruits and veggies\nOn a daily basis how and why and says\nWell I Want to go back to one of the thing really fast is because sometimes on on the vitamin aspect sometimes there's even a point where we're help coach will be working with somebody and they just aren't getting the progress that they would like to be happening and then they find out the person is taking\nA whole bunch of vitamins on top of it that somehow they missed that hopefully not but [noise]\nAnd then we'll talk to them and say you know what let's start taking off some of this other chemistry so that the ... the chemistry from real fruits and vegetables can start doing his job and they start seeing the results that were really wanting to to progress with\nThe reason being is the chemistry from the fruits and vegetables has to go in and counteract some of the chemistry that they're using the ... the extracts and so they have to use some of the chemistry from the fruits and vegetables to counteract some of the effects of those vitamins that aren't necessary in the body\nSo it actually most of the time works better without that now there is not a danger you can continue to take your vitamins if you want but frequently and most of the time you get a better result if you drop the multi vitamin and I just ask myself let's see which one smarter God or a scientist ...\nFor those that are just tuning in I'm Talking with Dr

still searching for that identity but you know if you don't have an idea and then at least you can put forth you're emotional effort in uh that's what we're seeing it at a young guy I Know that he's inspiring the guys around him\nWell what do you think where do you think this team is the scarlet I team is getting ready for game may wanted six on the year I mean I think\nLike like I Do to to a little bit earlier I think they have to start being ... in a way right to be a catalyst to the last as\nA kind of ignore the outside the outside noise and they'll come out and just have fought and I mean there's nothing else you know you can really do a you know when you've had some of the the negative things go on like you had in the program but you know none of the lesser of the team is another team come out here and play we have a team that were winning the series begins right so I'm hedging my bet to the scarlet now I\nGot ya I understand I mean it can be this is where as we've discussed in easier leaders on your team to get the young kids who remain focus right I mean because if they're not stepping up\nCan certainly see you know you you step into a college program your one in six it's late October uh you got five games to go certainly Eighteen year old kid doesn't have the guidance a young man doesn't have the guidance is certainly they may lose their way of loser focused out\nAnd then that's the absolute truth and all and I'll say something like that in the beginning of the season but you know one of the best advice I got as a leader was hey you want to lead this team you need to play better right people follow people who are going and it's like well if if my captains are are taken wrong and goes missing tackles not really making plays in the leaders are becoming my freshman it's like well\nYou know we can't you know to see on your chest doesn't mean as much if you're not make out here making place so you know they want if they want to lead you need to show it by being emotional show it by making plays and let you play talked for you but uh you know we haven't seen too much of that and I would like to see a lot more out of the captains and the guys who were who were chosen chosen as older leaders\nAnd certainly if they are to pull up the upset this afternoon against north western a truly and they're going to need a tremendous ... good quarterback play better than what they got a week ago against Maryland a where the quarterbacks when you look at\nOr eight yards and five interception ... uh that is so that a story that is a tough a stat lied to rip through but that's exactly what they're quarterbacks where we could go they've got to be a lot better today and it doesn't necessarily mean they have to throw for three hundred yards into ... going to get their starts doesn't mean the three hundred yards past or play playing football game\nFor sure ... here in in in the interest do you know the officers punching at air right\nI'm Indian and another thing to focus on her to look at it it's a rotational no line right we CEO line that was two senior leaders in captains to recall and Jonah Jackson wear out last week and we had freshmen playing different positions like we have a guy like Alonzo flank guard and playing tackled out\nYou know hopefully getting Jonah Jackson back this game will bring a little stability to that you ended up front but uh you know there hasn't been much help and I think they need to find an identity and start getting ready with guys man\nOr what about defensively what what are in terms of the match up to date going up against north western\nYou know it's no secret that they're going to pass the ball there's no secret that they're going to pass the ball I mean we have some we have some experience average what Seventy ... around Seventy are the game on the ground but\nYou know and that could be a little bit deceiving too it's like well it's a it's a it's a Rutgers deepest has been less desirable and run defenses you're also so you know I don't think that ah you know had to do is going to come out and you know try to toss it to be I think we're going to they're going to test the run game and Rutgers has to hold up in that initial tests\nAnd then after that when they start airing it out you have to bring pressure they want to get the ball out of this guy's hand keep 'em in the pocket and I think we struggled struggled last week when we couldn't keep the ball and the uh keep the ball in the pocket from the quarterback perspective\nUm inlet receivers run around in a secondary you know what his homecoming made huge APO\nOwn come in and ... it just reminds me of the great that came before me man you know another reminder that this program is beginning you we just saw a guy like me who could come up here um and seeing the talent and in the great things and great people that have come before me and this program and uh it's nice not all gloom like you know a thing as of late or try to make it seem in a while\nIt is a special day around campus the barbecues are going even though it's you know ... in October for Saturday the barbecues are going all the law in town former players are in town you know former classmates or in town and it seems like everybody comes back in enjoyed every weekend here ...\nIf if we gave it gives me a reason to come back and be in college for for for a day or night right now you\nKnow but you know going to Julius Irving later on oh you're based grab a bully just only right now I mean uh you know it just reminds you agree times and great people and and\nBeing in an environment where you were able to grow right through the bosses do the wins a community that you know in the end is a bunch of people who really care about you know where they're from and where they go to school\nSo suddenly all sometimes when I say it's football broadcast of his is available on June ... dot com and your local radio station games are also available on Syria sex have satellite radio\nNo reason to miss your favorite team I gained days no matter where you are\nSo be sure to listen J. P. O. will rejoin me and a little bit or get his keys to the game player to watch often simply defensively\nWhat are the scarlet night to need to do to pull off the upset her whole this afternoon against the wall cats at Northwestern and a big tent match up let's get the thoughts now of Rutgers head coach Chris Carlin is the voice of the scarlet ... Carlin caught up with him earlier this week\nMark homecoming weekend here at Rutgers this girl at nights hosting northwestern in the head coach is with us so coming always a special weekend and I know the the crowd is always a big part of that as well and you want to get them involved as much as you can early today\nAbsolutely a homecoming is a great weekend it's great opportunity for alumni and former players to come back and watch a football team and well we need to go out and play um [noise] a good football game and we need their support and do we need the environment and the state of Iraq and to help us out\nAll right let's talk a little bit about uh last week and trying to build off of what happened down in Maryland when you went back and took a look at the tape and you're evaluating what happened where do you feel like things can improve the most\nUh we really need to improve up front on the opposite side of the ball um you know when you can't run the ball consistently and you can't protect quarterback you're going to struggle and we asked majors banged up a little bit but we've got to play better up\nFront for aren't when he has a game like that as a coach how do you monitor where his confidence level is because we all know there are going to be bumps along the road for especially for a freshman quarterback\nYeah it it's a good question and I don't think there's any magic or answer you know a two two that he is a very common and kids nowadays are mature kid or he understands when he goes well and whining understands we makes mistakes why and um he works really hard to get them fixed he made a couple of poor decisions\nThere were a couple of of uh interceptions that weren't necessarily you know all his fall receiver fell down a one one ball got tip\nAnd unfortunately that went into the hands of the um opponent but he's got to play better but the others around them gotta play better we talked about that a lot\nOh let's talk about facing a team like northwestern very physical football team what challenges do they\nPresent or just that the you know there are smart tough dependable football team or if they're well coach a player with good fundamentals I play hard they don't beat themselves off and so we throw the ball around exceptionally well one of the best of passing teams in the league and defensively there's a good solid hard nose football team\nAnd their group with pets but Sheryl where you can see over the years how it's built up stuck to it consistent plan and it's really starting to pay off for them yeah he's\nBeen there for a long time I'm In the football team's been insane football team ever since he's been there on the office of legal back ten years ago when they're doing the same thing defensively the same thing you look at the coaching staff you guys have been eleven ten nine years\nSo there's been a lot of continuity a lot of uh two systems seeing what they do how they recruit how they develop in what they do see medically there's a lot of the bill they very competitive football team All right ... thank you this is head coach crash and you're listening to Rutgers but", "show_name": "Mark Simone", "year": "2018", "city": "New York", "day": "20"}
