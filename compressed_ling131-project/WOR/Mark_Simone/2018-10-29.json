New Jersey have Perry\n[noise] cable or a morning I'm just a couple of points that we have to\nTake a look at All right real fast what you want to say very I was I was listening to the Berkeley you know no Perry right to the point\nIs propped up was propped up the enemy of the Russian people when a news organization age spilling ally they'd be club the enemy of the\nUs and it might be an exaggerated term enemy of the people but it's exactly what it is it's ridiculous you know you don't have an active news media right now again uh most people don't know\nThat there was a WMD attack against the president a month ago he was mailed rice and ah it also went to the secretary of defense Mattis\nThis was WMDs sent to the White House and to the Pentagon do you remember hearing about this oh it was in the back of the paper or Lester Holt put the little ten seconds Nineteen Minutes into the newscast\nBut they made very little of it and that was actually a as deadly as these bombs last week so it's the enemy in the sense that it's not giving you a fair coverage\nThey've ah commandeer the fact checking sites you know when you see these sites insist two hundred and Nineteen allies by the president United States it's really about twenty a hundred and fifty of them are totally spun and aren't lies by any stretch of the imagination [laughter]\nUh but anyway we got lots to get to today eight hundred three two one zero seven ten is the number also get the Halloween there's a lot of concern now it's\nA fairy PC World a lot of concern about offensive Halloween costumes are also a home box office you know they have a new job no home box office they've hired a several of these\nUh for ... for shows it's an intimacy coordinator now\nWhat this is a lotta shows have sex scenes in them\nOr with the ... act during the actress actually have to pretend to be having sex or doing something her kissing or groping\nSo they did this with a show called the do they brought in an intimacy coordinator and what that is it's like they have a stunt coordinator whenever there's going to be a stunt you know a car crash falling off a building the stunt coordinator goes over everything make sure everything's done right to make sure the stunt man won't get hurt so the intimacy coordinator\nUh apparently is going to be one of the worst seasons ever for foliage leaves the fall foliage uh the problem is\nThe summer the weather was very turbulent way too hot a drought upstate and then to wet and humid in September these are the worst things for the uh foliage leave patterns across the state just give me one of the worst\nThere is ever you can already see it and that um that nor'easter on Saturday didn't help took a lot of leaves off the trees\nSo if this is your big Sunday activity driving up to God Knows where to look at least it's not going to be a great year so it's back to a pumpkin picking oh wait a minute that's not good either apparently a there's a big problem because of the wet summer and the bad weather in the summer\nIt ruined a lot of the pumpkin crops there's actually a pumpkin shortage ah on the east coast\nAnd in fact some growers say that there'll be a huge price increase blood of inflation and pumpkin prices do uh to the ah wipe out of the crops and you know get pumpkins from somewhere else but it's more expensive to bring it in let's go to Gail in red hook Gayle\nThank you for taking my call like a per person go ahead\nAnd try to wean out and kill effort thinking all the show that supposedly offensive and God Knows you know it's a local ... model extra mark convenience store yeah no decorations our lab no no no no\nNo it's okay we're not NATO who needs is Halloween and let me ask you a question [noise]\nEvery so often happens all the time you see a woman she works in your office which is a friend of yours nice conservative woman then you see on Halloween they with us lobbyists costume what\nIs all about you don't need a guy but one that has sort of try to help are they telling you something or\nYou know it's all about that dollar you know I mean I you know nobody wants to care or ... you know care for each other all life nobody had any more he can't do anything you know you got to quantify qualifier\nWhen you're talking about everybody has alive we got a better life than ever\nI mean I Know you've seen in one respect me respect oh well we can't do that because you know we're sending this guy\nWell that's true you know you got the more access to stuff digitally and the technology was but a more PC than ever let's go to Greg and China may Greg\nHi Mark a comment on a Soros and and as they will attempt by the media portrays Trump is an anti Semite\nSide bullets Soros is an eight years he was born to parents that we're not backing the Jews he has nothing to deal with the religious Judaism and then\nYou were getting in the weeds or what it really is a Soros is a bad guy he's a convicted felon\nHe's the guy who funds all that crap but rioting that of noxious stuff going on in the streets uh they keep telling you had nothing to do with funding the caravan president Honduras says left wing groups are funding\nThe caravan a guarantee you when they trace all the donations have got to those left wing group some of them will traced back to sort of one of the reasons for doing this whole thing about Soros all day yesterday about its anti Semitic to attack him he's a huge funder hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars\nThey're trying to protect him they don't want that funding to stop\nA same thing with the nutty Tom's dire a President Trump for the first time Washington interview with him and he said the guy what do you come stumbling lunatic which he is basically a but that's why they went after Trump saying how dare you attack somebody who had a makeshift bombs send\nIt to protect these donors they do not want to shut that force it off of hundreds of millions of dollars he by the way every great political consulting in the world\nWho's worked with Tom style you know all these guys these political consultants moved from Canada to Kennedy every single one of them told me ... a total wacko a weirdo in fact if you try to show you how they see Trump doesn't read not true but star apparently cannot read anything you can give them a document a breathing won't read it won't look at it can't be bothered\nHe's somebody pointed out because you're talking about this is your are your column yesterday about the kitchen table issues it's not all this other stuff if Democrats weren't allowed to yell racist ... what would they be campaigning on\nWell that's that is there a problem uh they they don't have a message other than it's anti Trump and mark I think if we if we just take ten thousand steps back\nAnd look what is what is the Democratic platform it has it is today what it was on the day after last year's election and the same as it was all during the two thousand sixteen election anti Trump that's all it was Trump is Hitler Trump is awful Trump is awful trumped as awful as Russia Russia\nRussia all of these things they have an advanced right nothing's changed this is still the context of everything\nThey're not they don't have any ideas what are they going to raise taxes really that's a good idea right I mean who is your leader Hillary Clinton Barak Obama's oh boy that worked so I just think that's the problem for Democrats they're stuck they're stuck\nIn this hatred in this victory all and this this demonization and and this sense of the Trump supporters are all deplorable an era deem mobile they haven't advanced in the last two and a half years\nI think you're right the public is smarter and they realized Trump is he's ... you know the manager who yelled and screamed called ... bought the ... but me telling me one it was a winner\nYeah there there is something to that look I mean I think there are times when I when I wished when Trump says things I Wish I had and er he tweeted again this morning about\nThe press being the enemy of the people look either you can make I think fake news is is a sufficient the\nDesignation to get the point across at the press is not to be trusted you can't believe what you read unfortunately that's true uh so I don't think he needs to go that extra step to say enemy of the people are just as one block Obama told a\nHispanic ... young people that Republicans where their enemy uh I I think\nThe word enemy is not something we should use in our politics unless we're talking about you know a real foreign foe\nMost good point well he's a great column you can read Michael good ones come online and the New York post you can read his column every Sunday and every Wednesday in the New
