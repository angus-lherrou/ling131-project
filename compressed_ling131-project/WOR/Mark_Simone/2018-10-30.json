O. R. dot com slash let them Michael\nHere's a serious story a lend a there is legal action pending against they Connecticut university where a twenty year old college student show\nDeath during a pancake eating contact us tomorrow we had this habit of Sacred Heart University in Fairfield I'm Caitlin Nelson's families following the lawsuit blaming the university for death because they hosted\nThis a pancake eating contest Donald you've ever done a pancake I have not I've never done any eating cuts as well I'm the one thing about pancakes as they tend to clog up\nNot like a hot dog kinda slides down and you know these professionals they kind of wet the bums and put it in and um it it makes it like I pay well that's what happened and there was a big clumps of the ... who they suing the university fairly a Sacred Heart really\nFunctioned yeah ... what was happening\nSo um you know she started choking on the pancake and they try to clear it but they said that it was so compacted with ... that it was unable to they wouldn't have a clue and you know sadly died\nThat there's massive food trucks and medical supply trucks water trucks shadowing the care of and so they don't they're not so malnourished you try walking a thousand miles\nTry walking twenty miles a day for a couple of weeks the if you can do it uh now the other thing is this anchor baby stuff or you're not supposed to say anchor baby is not supposed to use a term\nHey the fact that you find the term uh uh offensive means there's something wrong with it there's no other country in the world where just snuck into the country you're broke into the country\nAre and then you have to have a baby the baby's automatically a citizen it makes no sense logically and probably not constitutionally\nAre under the law it was always the way they interpreted was if you were here legally documented with papers green cards or whatever and then you had a baby that that might be citizenship but that would mean you have to been here for a while you have to be here legally fully documented imagine this kind of logic\nSneak in your break in\nBut if you happened to give birth automatically a citizen of somebody broke into your house\nAnd just gave birth in your living room it's their house they're legally attendant of of this house makes no sense at all [laughter] so I'm the president will go to Pittsburgh today it'll be interesting to see uh some of the people in Pittsburgh some officials have to ask them to stay out to be but he'll be there today\nI was just going to pay my respects I'm also going to the hospital to see the officers and [noise] ah some of the people there were so badly hurt so that I really look forward to going I would've done it even sooner but I didn't want to disrupt any more than they already had disruption\nYeah so I'm now a lot of a fake news trying to cash in on this trying to somehow tied all of this to President Trump's you've seen that the last two days that it's his rhetoric the way he talks the way he tweets it's riling up people it's causing angry it's causing rage now the\nLatest fake news media would never ever for a second I think the fact that they do it twenty four seven that would never cause rage the fact that they try to rile up the public every second every day with anything he does\nAnything he does is twisted into a into a bad story into ... whatever little thing he does is destroying America they never would never occur to them that that might be causing some rage that might be riling people up never occurs to them\nA ... member it Chris Matthews on the other day was explaining that he said the\nThese kind of liberals these kind of fake news liberal Democrats or believe they're smarter than everybody else they believe they're always write\nA there it's very elitist what did you say they're busy with their Carole King concerts [laughter] that's a big thing by the way whenever the zillionaire a Democrats have a fundraiser in their house Carole King comes\nAnd sings as she does this all the time and people's apartments in people's homes it's a way you know when they have these fundraisers really raised two million in somebody's living room and everybody puts in a hundred thousand is one of the things they actually do they have Carole King come with a little trio and do a twenty minute concert for them\nSo but to criticize the president for anything everything if he after the shooting in Pittsburgh if he held a rally criticized if he doesn't hold a rally he's criticized we had a great rally\nIn Illinois for some people\nI think that's probably the way it should be ... about your life you can't let these people disrupt any more than they already have which is disgraceful what he did his disgraceful\nOkay now who jumps into all of this because you're ... remember the ... midterms is just one week away it's a week from today that you vote but then the day after that\nIt was hard to believe but the day after that the twenty twenty presidential race begins so it'll be President Trump beginning his reelection run a week from tomorrow and then you know Hillary\nWas interviewed yesterday and then she uh she was asked are you a candidate and twenty twenty she's no no no and but then she did throw in but I'd like to be president\nShe said I'd like to be president so it's still in there the fires still burning a member Terry McAuliffe who worked for the Clintons and then be went on to be a governor himself he wants to run he was one of these uh fixers for the Clintons but he wants to run so he wants her out of the picture\nAnd he said er buddy Terry McAuliffe said her name will never appear on a ballot again now he's not the only one all the Democrats\nWill do anything to keep this story Clinton away from the race she is poison to them uh she screws up the Democrats at every turn so they will chase her out of the race immediately know who's the guy\nWho's really trying to get it in Elizabeth Warren looked like she had a shot she's totally out of it now because uh she has demonstrated in the last month for Democrats that she's a ... a klutz she's got a terrible problem with this fake Indian routine she tried to overcome and it was a big mistake to do it when she did it\nAnd it was a big mistake to do a phony fake DNA test it wasn't a real test she didn't use a professional DNA company she got some professor\nBuddy of hers to do some sort of a homemade testing his lab which doesn't count as a DNA test also he never used any Cherokee Indian DNA to compare to use Peruvian Colombian so it was the test was meaningless\nAnd even with a fake test from her friend\nStill came out one one thousand Indian which is probably everybody has that so it meant absolutely nothing who jumps into the fray who's the Democrat that could lead the way\nWell he's been all over the place especially it'll last week or so he's been speaking every night he's been showing up at events affairs jumping in speaking now in the age of a Democrats all riled up offended by Trump's tone is tweets\nOh the terrible things Trump says who jumps in here nice soft Joe Biden\nSometimes these days the anger the hatred the viciousness seem like they're going to overwhelms [noise]\nAnd it's on our leaders to set the tone to dial down the temperatures restore some dignity\nIt's not real it's a parity but what is the it's like if Democrats did the most honest as they could do it's very funny it's up on the Web page go to seven ten W.

New York oh\nWell we got a lot coming up in the next hour Bill O'Reilly will be with us and we'll get to the election you while you're in some of the elections around the tri state area some of them are pretty close and they're going to be pretty interesting also have you talked about this thing in Florida they got a ballot the one of those ballot issues you can they want to legalize a felons voting\nShow that today then there'll be a in the eye it's hard to believe today's Tuesday one week from today the election it's one week from today so in this coming week the president would be doing rallies all over the place if you look at the schedule\nA it looks like he's going to states where he can help the Senate candidate some people think that means he's a given up on the house I I don't think that I think he just knows where you can do the most good and where he could do the most harm so he's ... the Republicans are expected actually pick up seats in the Senate\nHave an even bigger majority in the Senate the house it's just too close to call it could go either way right now a\nThere's a lot of races there really got people worried especially in Florida you know every everybody knows the dozens of people they all moved to Florida\nNot just the weather it used to be for the weather but then they brag about it's tax free there's no state tax they love this in Florida with no state tax but a lot of people move there just to get rid of state tax law to people from New Jersey New York\nThat's the reason they move there so now you've got to this race where are the far left guy Andrew Gillum wants to put in a massive state tax and I don't know what that would do to Florida for all these people that moved down there just to get away from the taxes\nOr it would cause a massive exodus from Florida but this Gillum uh he kind of guy didn't buy a fluke it was the Democratic primary and he's the far left guy but there were two moderate Democrats so they split up the moderate vote\nAnd in these three party races you can win with just by here and that's how this Gillum got the nomination then he's up against a Santa suit was expected to easily beat Gillum the Republican tax cutting guy\nBut the saddest turns out to be the worst most bumbling candidates screws up in the debate screws up on the campaign trail [noise] so this one's tough Trump is trying to help out he's called Guillain but these\nAre the census was pointing out that this far left candidate Gillum excepted stuff there was an undercover sting operation from the FBI to see if this Gillum the Democrat would accept gifts and he did\nHe took a vacation he took some ... Hamilton tickets\nNow Gillum response by saying I was just a couple of tickets to Broadway show they were thousand dollar tickets you know Hamilton was very expensive and these were the super VIP seats so it was a thousand dollar set of tickets it was a thousand dollar vacation this two thousand and bribes\nIt's a lot of money now of course let's be honest I just think about it somebody had to sit through Hamilton\nFor two hours is that a gift [laughter] I don't know [laughter] if they're going to get me something for a Christmas to find something else or having to sit through Hamilton for two hours and then by the of a president that the [noise] so the Florida ethics commission or\nHere's the other thing when he got this stuff you know he's now saying oh it's nothing it's just a couple of theater tickets but when they are investigating the Florida ethics commission or the text and email he sent showed he denied all this\nHe tried to make it sound like something else so if he denied it obviously he knows it's bad so interesting race in Florida or New Jersey I don't know it's close this guy you can\nUh you got to get rid of this Menendez this leaves the swamp character Menendez has got to go ... an ex marine looks pretty good they're trying to make it look like he's corrupt I don't I I don't get that but\nYou can is close he could be an end is hope he does but then there's just so bad even some Democrats are staying away from him including the governor doesn't want to go anywhere near this guy the\nNewark Star Ledger you know the newspaper the Newark Star Ledger they still print that thing I guess so they came up with an endorsement\nA form and then this but in them in the door Smith\nLike pretty much admitted Menendez is one sleazy slimy character but they said you got to get past those ethics and vote for him they said the main issue is Donald Trump so they're admitting this went in to a swine me dirty ... ball but vote for him anyway just to her Trump the\nThat's one reason never to buy the Newark Star Ledger a ever again hey then you've got Connecticut this is a really important race Connecticut was this a nice peaceful quiet state for years and they had a great economy you know there was almost no state tax in Connecticut is one reason people move there\nAnd one of the reasons you had low taxes you had these big corporations all over Connecticut all the top insurance companies weren't Hartford and then all over Connecticut a lot of businesses moved to Connecticut was soak corporate friendly tax friendly that's where of course General Electric was\nThen eight years ago the elected this Dannel Malloy nice guy but a real crazy tax and spend liberal start taxing the companies like crazy and one by one they'll start moving out\nAnd then he tax them even more\nAnd even General Electric moved out whoever thought General Electric would lead kinetic so he didn't over the last eight years the economy a Connecticut has been destroyed it's almost bankrupt or if there's taxes like crazy personal tax state taxes out of control people are fleeing Connecticut so it's very important to stop that\nUh the Democratic nominee is a guy who will not only continue that will probably increase the taxes and kill the state altogether so the Republican is a guy named Bob Stephane ... uh that's the guy to vote for he's got a great tax plan he the over eight years will take the state back\nThe guy look at him as a woman that we have it up on the Web page hideous working as a woman going to fire him know that give them a raise\nBut remember Megan Kelly was fired because they've been trying to get rid of this woman for a year she was like a virus in a company they've just been trying to eliminate or this was a good excuse Pam in Long Island a Pam\nHi like it's a pleasure to talk to you thanks I have a question I wanted to make comments on um Florida allowing felons to vote yes and he said that they would vote Democrat Party is the party as you're not the innocent presumed guilty before innocent so if I found that the last party I Would vote for\nYeah but let's face it criminals love Democrats are you going to uh the worst prison you won't see a lot of mega hats on and they're\nNow I Know but if he got out and it doesn't matter what it can be guilty there's no prevention innocence\nOn oh no no that's only for cabinet otherwise uh go the other way everybody's in a you know this for a hundred years\nEverybody in prison is innocent until Kevin then to look at this Kerry Kennedy have you ever seen anything dumber than this whack job Kerry Kennedy with her charity they're raising millions of dollars and what they're doing is paying the bill to free everybody from Rikers Island\nUh there's already a couple that she's now that are horrible criminals who have done damage\nA listen once in a while there's somebody in there should be bailed out but uh most of the time it's not and this is Kerry Kennedy only a Kennedy could come up with a crazy cause like this we're going to bail everybody out of Rikers Island let's go to Jane in Long Island who Jane\nYeah Hi Mark I'm a big fan of you I think there's one thing that I really upset at that and that is getting up on voting against Christians yell at her and I don't think that we should just give her up and say that\nWhat we already gave her the past they should have put up a real candidate against her I think she's vulnerable I think there should have been a real candidate running against and that's some amateur they do this all the time in New York they may find some stiff for some amateur to run they basically can see the ...\nShe is a real anti satellite she's hugging land as such so she\nWell let me defend her here I don't think she has any actual feelings on anything she's basically ... they pay for play politician member she was the lawyer for the tobacco companies member she was the most pro gun person in the world to pay not to be then all of a sudden she's anti gun remember her father was old political fixer she's the same thing\nShe's totally slimy but that's no\nWhatever way the wind is blowing the checks are going from a lobbyist that's whatever she stands for but I started with her because they didn't put up a real candidate let's go to Kevin in New Jersey Kevin\nHey mark how're you doing good I'm a big Donald Trump Stan and ah you know Hillary Clinton gets away with a lot with this ah Donald Trump saying you know friends with ... David Duke he's a white nationalist [laughter]\nShe makes fun because you know what she ... she went to a church and locked African Americans had they talked she supported Confederate day when she was first lady of Arkansas she ... best friends with Robert Byrd\nSite you you just found out she's unethical in line all the time and I understand it's for the news bulletin ah yeah but then on the show\nSo he's horrible Donald Trump has nothing to do with David Duke doesn't know David I should put that up again tomorrow so hysterical video shows over three years\nThem asking them a million times students David Duke and one million times he denounces David Duke\nAnd then I guess one day he said let me try something else so the ten million for the time he said I'm not denouncing I'm not playing this game anymore and they use that clip all over the news what does he will not denounce David Duke ignoring the fact that he just had for years let's go to Wendy in these Northport hey Wendy\n... morning you're swimming um well I just went and say how insensitive it was a blast to how to dress up as I'm Scott her name\nIs Susan Boyle a listener was stupidity if you're going to be an anchor men don't dress up as Susan Boyle with her dad was\nThat you know that's the that's the kind of people they are and one other phone that's Halloween how you how\nI was still there's certain things you don't do okay but why so how proud I Am of our president ... law and order to this country and um you know I was telling your screener that there was a problem I think about like ten or Fifteen Years ago where they will ... will come to America just", "show_name": "Mark Simone", "year": "2018", "city": "New York", "day": "30"}
