[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] I'm a ... I don't expect ... Tylenol and top are ... or or model total how responsible so\nNow that she's a victim and he keeps saying you can't attack of sexual assault victims you can accuse him of language or they'd be nice to her from now and no I don't know I have a friend of hers for years I didn't know that she never said anything it was startling one of them and I don't know who the guys hey but knowing the guy's dead so\n[laughter] I don't know I I guess [laughter] uh are you going to be nice\nTo her you Sunday Morning a host hey this uh Jeff Flake what does that look on his face he looks constipated he looks\nLike he's in a hemorrhage commercials what is the one of those or even knows what to do\nIs ah so he was talking about the nation's\nDivider Senator Flake you've announced that you're not running for reelection and I wonder could you\nDown now it's you know he he can't get one vote in his home state he's the most hated snake in the swamp piece the dirtiest swamp senator he couldn't get a single vote that's why you know if he's not running\nAgain who have done this\nIf you were running [laughter] no not a chat and not a chance\nBecause politics has become too sharp to Portland there's no value to reaching across the aisle there's no currency for that anymore there's no incentive\nYeah you know a lot of people pointed out who was it was Lindsey Graham he voted for ... and now it back then all of them Democrat Republican judges they would get past Ninety to enter something Ninety nine the one that and all the time\nBut didn't look into their high school drinking practices\nWell but that was a different world there was as long as the person was qualified you said now of course they don't agree with me there too liberal yeah because he voted and we'd long as they were qualified it's a different world this idiot flake said the country\nIs being torn apart by this it was still it's being divided by this where we see three weeks ago before this wasn't divided then [laughter] uh\nThis Brian's filter you ever watch him on Sunday Morning yeah this is the most biased weasel around the world is Brian ... shelter he opens the show they're going to look at the Kavanaugh hearings and the you know you do a little opening teas and he said or\nHas the media taken aside on this will take a look at it\nSo I was going to go out but I cancelled everything because I was waiting for the answer to that one is fine wonder what the answer was linked to find out to the media taking sides on this so uh [noise]\n... there's no backup plan they don't have anybody else in line they haven't uh gotten another judge ready so they're assuming in the White House that the cabinet makes it I think he will you get the FBI report I think there'll be nothing against cabinet and it\nIt they could if they got the right agents on really honest dig up some dirt on her just some lying about things\nOh that'll be interesting yeah and they could get these other students saying there's absolutely no buddy\nYou could go through the whole class if there's nobody that saw such a party or anything like that where she went upstairs but\nThe issue now is not necessarily what the doctor for it had to say it's his temperament\nWell there's no problem there that I Know they keep saying that his temperament leads still he's too angry to be a judge for the last twelve years he's been on the highest court in the land and his temperament has been perfect in fact there are agencies that actually\nRate that there's actual data and metrics one is the federal defenders association those are all the attorneys and they rate each judge one of the categories is temperament\nAnd he got the highest mark for temperament\nSo we we don't have to worry about that is temperament on the bench has been fined we've had a\nTwelve year old but he's going to be an angry judge if he ever on the Supreme Court ah I don't know ah\nThat Ruth Bader Ginsburg is twice as angry as him she's made the ugliest political vicious comments against Donald Trump should step down from the court\nThat's the other thing he looks that he looked the part is and he looked political nobody has made more vicious political comments about Trump the Ruth Bader Ginsburg should she stepped down because of her temperament hey the other thing is they said he attacked the Clintons\nHe never ever attacked the Clintons never\nSay anything bad about the Clintons when he was listing why they were coming after him he gave a list of motives one of them obviously was part is in his conservative beliefs the other one was a revenge on behalf of the Clintons so all he's saying is part of your motive was because you lost the election\nTo Donald Trump and Hillary last I think that's a valid point isn't it\nThat is part of the ... absolutely get so he lives with this\nBut in fact the Clintons he never said one thing about the Clintons or anything bad about it he was talking about the senators he said this is partly because you're trying to get revenge for Hillary losing that's all he said mhm\nSo it's like when they claimed the attack the or a gold star family\nNever did it there's no ask anybody to produce a video him attacking the gold star family it never happened all they said about the family and he was on the show and they played this family saying the worst things about him the most of fishes things for five minutes then they came to him so what do you think and he said\nThey're on they're wrong\nAnd he said and by the way we'll walk them she didn't speak that's all he said uh-huh that was an attack ... said would you say that they're wrong he said they don't know me there on that the attack he never attacked the Clintons air Trump never attacked the gold star family\nAnd a professor what's her name professor for Dr for Dr Ford Dr Ford if you're listening\nA because people say why would somebody do this if it didn't happen\nYeah\nYou do know that there are thousands of false rape accusations every year\nIt's a it's it's not a high percentage I think I looked it up rape accusations only about ten to Fifteen Percent turnout to be false but there are thousands of false rape accusations every year so when you say why would somebody ever put themselves through this apparently people do in great numbers so it's ... she is one\nThought I was a question that the prosecutor asked that she writes ... testimony by south that's an important question that she said yes that was an ultimate lie\nIt sounded like she got plenty of help she made sure she wrote down what ... they made sure she said he almost ... that killed a\nYeah I Know you know when but that's a start technically ally when she says she wrote the testimony yourself they told or what it was and she wrote it down so technically she wrote it by herself let's go to Joel in Virginia who Joel\nGood morning mark when a judge Kavanaugh was named was your stay close\nTo the Supreme Court by President Trump with itch wedding and it's a ... Schumer made very clear public statement which you said that the Democrats will never allow a conservative Supreme Court ... ever again\nYou know this is a Schumer is he used to be a sort of a normal guy he is like the dirtiest swamp creature of all a ... you can't have a conserve it that's the whole idea of the court to have some balance to have some conservatives\nAnd to have some liberals now you might say well how come it wasn't such a fight about Gorsuch well that's because he was replacing Scalia it was a conservative seat or this is not the way you're supposed to look at it but they come to think of the seats as once a conservative seat one's a liberal seats\nSo this could change the balance of the court the Democratic plan is\nTo block all of this through the election they're hoping to take the house and take the Senate if they did I don't think that they may have a slight shot at the house they've got zero chance of taking the Senate if they were able to do that because then block every judge forever\nAnd that's their plan they'll just not allow any judge or by Trump to go on the court\nIf they were able to take the Senate and house in that way would be a four four court it'd be a deadlock court all the time better than having to buy for conservative and then the Trump plan if um\nIf they were ... I don't think they'll ever take us in the Trump plan is if they do to not appoint anybody just give up and use it as a twenty twenty election issue to take the court back it would be a great issue if a cabinet for any reason\nDoesn't make it and the Republicans keep the Senate and the house which they most likely will they'll go to the next person on the list it's probably Amy Coney Barrett who's a woman what a what would they come up with against or how would they smear a woman\nWell she is um anti abortion I guess\n'cause she's Catholic yeah the only problem with her she's much more conservative much more conservative camera believe it or not the reason they went with Kevin or he was the most moderate of the conservatives doing with him because they figure these the safest to see easiest\nBut they weren't counting on these Democrats will come up with something he uh let's see gang rape is do we haven't tried that you know gang rape that sounds plausible will try that

New York\nWell we got a big our coming up a lot to get to in the next hour we'll get to a judge Kavanaugh will get to a a test for we'll get to CBS Les Moonves\nIt may be going criminals will get to that coming up and a SNL and the oh New Jersey and the crazy governor or get rushed coming up at noon Sean Hannity at a three no more baseball\nWhat do we do now oh it's a sport so and of course tonight at six and I'm here every day tend to noon and you should be to know who else got pod cast you can hear the show anytime you want seven ten W. O. R. dot com back right after the news on seven ten W O R\nNew York's most most of these oxidation feels rated number\nOne seven ten W O o voice of New York and high hard\nSo low\nThis is seen as a victory for President Trump did then you do the story about the fast food places they can't get workers anymore it's correct because the employment market is so good so many jobs have been created they don't need to work at fast food places anymore\nSo Duncan McDonald's they're all having trouble now finding a place that's correct and you know what happens when that occurs wages go up\nWages go up that happened a while back in Pennsylvania they brought in fracking in a part of Pennsylvania the economy was booming so much so many jobs are created McDonald's started offering twenty five dollars an hour to work there that's how you uh increase minimum wage growth\nAnd a booming economy and that's why in New Jersey where it's a disaster there what is your governors named Phil Murphy Murphy yes\nOr when does that today that he's going to do this ... has a speech on how he's going to fix the economy he admits in his us but we can statements the economy is a mess it stagnant it's dead he's going to fix it\nWhich is great news except these one of these crazy Democrats so his fix will be high taxes more regulations on this\nAh interact yeah he'll cause another hundred companies to leave the state another hundred wealthy guys to leave the state will reduce the taxes and revenue and screw it up even more white Catholic Murphy or these kind of crazies\nDon't they ever just look at history and ... every time you cut taxes cut regulations economies boomed there's never been an exception\nOn one thing is going to do to his take away tax incentives for companies\nOh perfect [laughter] about Marts facts [laughter] we will give you any benefits to operating in New Jersey [laughter] so what is the point that\nI Know that you know maybe his plan is legalized marijuana ... going to generate a lot of money\nMm and that's it generates a little money it's one and where's the marijuana made\nIn New Jersey I don't know I Would think so\nI don't think I'm being who wants to New Jersey marijuana you wouldn't get it from somewhere else maybe can important people in New Jersey you talk about these things to Jersey tomatoes\nThey're okay they're not that great what's that hand me all like they're a corporal or do they were called ... it's okay it's not that great you convince yourself with the you have these great delicacies coming out of New Jersey\nThe same thing with this Jersey a marijuana is not going to be the same boat who have legalized gambling in New Jersey to legalize pot I I Know but that Atlanta city legalized gambling remember they said that would turn Atlantic City around\nIt's a bigger slum now than when they started but it's generating a lot of money but where's the money going I mean if you go well that's a good question go two blocks from the boardwalk and everything looks terrible it's\nThat the I'm just saying you got to do what always works what's worked every time cut taxes especially on businesses cut regulations you I'm obviously want to have some regulations you want to have safety in a very thing done properly but don't over regulate and you'll get business\nTo move back and you think he's going to announce a tax cuts today now he's going to it's a tax increase he's going to announce everything that never works\nAnd is always always failed it the other thing that President Trump did or North Korea this I didn't understand it all this stuff [laughter] yeah well he got along with the Kim Jong un and they had a good meeting but I think went too far and this statement\nI was really be tough and so it was always a back\nAnd forth [noise] and then we fell in love\n[noise] we\nNight it sounds crazy but this guy is the best in the world at this stuff this kind of negotiating and the way it works is carrot stick carrot stick you go back and forth\nAnd he's always said you get to the absolute top guy don't negotiate with middle management even senior management get to the top guy the guy in charge work with him develop a relationship with him part of that is flattering him threatening them flattering them threatening him\nSo when he says these kinds of things it's not meant for us it's meant for Kim Jong owned you hear\nA shack up together one\nNow he just knows he can feel it he knows exactly how to play it you know it's like a great hitter he knows when to lean in when they get back in the batter's box when to move forward with a little wacky statement it sounds wacky to us but it works you remember one time this is how he one of the way she got the meeting and got the good relationship remember way back a\nYear and a half in the beginning we made this little statement about how he understood this guy he understood what he's been through it was a weird thing to say to us he said\nThis kid is really smart and tough you don't realize he took power twenty five years old he said those generals were killers they tried to stop them you don't realize how tough yet he was talking just to Kim jung\nSo that when Kim Jong un read that he just wow this guy understands me like no one else so\nI don't know it will say this I don't know where this one is going to do\nIs just developing over ... you can get it all done with the top guy that's his philosophy is trying to uh just trying to soften\nHim up for whatever you want to come over for a weekend that if you want to you know I'm the one guy in the stands you and then it's a make a deal with\nMe because I'm not going to be here forever I'll be gone and six years and then you're gonna have a problem get this done with me before you have to deal with somebody else so and and then it works so are they talked of course about judge Kavanaugh\nI Will tell you he has suffered [noise] then the moon is the anger\nYeah you know\nWhen they tell you who is temperament why is it getting so mad it drag this uh honorable guy with a unbelievable track record not a blemish on it you drag 'em into a public hearing in front of a hundred million people and telling me is a gang rape is wise you get mad [laughter]\n\nIf he wasn't screaming at you they'd be something wrong with his temperament\nWell he probably should have called adjusts the little guy I Know it's a tough spot\nIf they said you know you were going sixty five and he says I was only going fifty five then you shouldn't get crazy but when they drag you in front of the whole world to call you a gang rape is I think you should start yelling back what about her temperament\nShe was calm\nShe wasn't calm she's [laughter] ... yeah I got an email from a doctor saying ah he was watching for one hour with all that sniffing and sobbing and cheering he said it's impossible that you didn't need a Kleenex in an hour of that so he doesn't think it was real\nOh that could have all\nIt was that statement about uh they should be over trying to be overly nice to what you need anything can we catch anything ah and she said after my opening statement I'll need some caffeine what does that mean\nShe needed caffeine so they gave her a ...\nHey I'm not used to being up at ten in the morning believe it or not I need caffeine to get to the show but I don't do the whole opening and then say now I Need some caffeine you get the caffeine before you start you get a big cup of coffee and you drink it before you go on the air waves she needs caffeine why would she have taken that before the opening statement\nGood point it's too theatrical everything with her too theatrical if you really couldn't do this without a big cup of coffee or a big bottle of coke\nYou got Nineteen people are that are helping you handlers lawyers you wouldn't save them before you go in can I get a cup of coffee went for this or I Need some coke you wouldn't have said that beforehand\nYeah yeah you would think you would yeah that that's fair I mean if you need is [laughter] I see a whole bottle of water there right you don't wait until you're on the air and say I need a bottle of wine before you go why did she do that every move is too theatrical and then if she needed a\nCoca Cola why didn't they put it in the glass instead they put that big coke bottle right on the table next or\nThink coke is contributing to the Gulf on me\nYou know in these Democrats are probably getting a ... Coca Cola but are more than that I think they put the big coke bottled in front of her to make her look more child like\nThat is something a kid would do have this big coke bottle next to them well you really think and there was so thrilled to theatrical that's what these lawyers do\nTrust me these lawyers tried twenty five different pairs of glasses on her to see which ones make her look the most vulnerable they didn't come or hair deliberately believe me these lawyers tested every outfit in front of focus groups what she was going to wear what classes she would have that's what these lawyers do chefs right she did not\nAnd ... for that no in fact she got messed up for that or you look at any defend that when they come into a courtroom vicious criminal suddenly they're wearing the soup that doesn't fit still got the price tags hanging off and that's always the that's what these lawyers do uh oh Elizabeth Warren says she's running now [laughter]\nOr what you running for president I don't know if it's going to be this country [laughter]\nI got some great sound clips I Can't hear on this ...\nThis is now considered a conservative [noise] and the Democratic\nGod sellers about why she\nYou know they always tell you he made a racial comments about Indians that's not an attack on Indians that's an attack on those Elizabeth Warren it's not an anti Indian comment because she's not an Indian that's the point [noise]\nUh how much is how we ... you know how we correspond upbringing upping the offer I think it's like a million dollars for her to take a the DNA test wow he's been doing this for years how we car uh got it all set he's got the kid oh she has to do this given the sample and he'll tested to see if she's an Indian\nUh oh here's a ...
