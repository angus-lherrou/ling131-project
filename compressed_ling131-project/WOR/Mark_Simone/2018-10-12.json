O. L. dot com slash Michael this happened in Hackensack at a gas station or they forgot to take the gas the\nNozzle out of the you know out of the whole way they stick to the gas so ah the guy pulls away poles over the whole gas ... do my fire burst into flames no one's hurt though right now nobody got hurt but crazy just pulls away and boom and it's been fired\nSay never thought you would yank the home machine gun with you I Know there was some way that ... yeah that machines pretty strong I mean that's all gas tank right around the world over how can you pull over a gas tank 'cause you have to watch it the aid comes humbling down like break but first of all the planes\nOh yeah and then he goes on fire crazy oh that's a whole new anything else [laughter] he announced it will come out and now we just bought the nozzle here's my\nThings things that make you go ... yeah so they discovered this drug tunnel that was being built from under ... from Mexico they found a house there was just two hundred and Twenty one feet south\nOf the boundary okay so there's not all that they're using putting drugs through whether they wanted they they'd never completed the tunnel but this tunnel was so involved have thirty one it was thirty one feet deep\nIt was a six hundred and twenty feet in length half of it was already in the United states mhm uh they never broke the surface into the U.S they found that the tunnel had a rail system running the entire land ventilation system and it was all powered\nBy solar power away how do you how do you empower an underground tunnel while yes solar power so I mean that's how smart these drug dealers are real\nWell let me do they put the solar panels above ground and then the solar panels are attached to the thing was in the tunnel to make it work\nMust have been cut out that's what the ... took care of the ventilation the electrical the lighting but how about that a solar panel for a drug tunnel the underground that's while a wall is not going to help your Michael there you go right there\nYou'd be for that wall if it use clean air clean energy of ash trees [laughter] good point [laughter] I remember that the painting the girl with a balloon that the ... the guy who did it and that just when it sold from one point four million dollars it's subtle be\nIt shredded itself you see that one yeah oh sure so it was a whole trick that Banksy now nobody knows he's an anonymous guy he's ... now he's a street artist he's somebody knows nobody not um and nobody knows what he looks like anyway he put a shredder machine in the frame of the painting shredded his own painting\nGuy bought it for one pulling for a million dollars well the guy who bought it he's decided to keep it and that is a shrewd move because the shredded painting along with the frame and the shredder it's going to be worth a lot more than one point four million dollars that's something you really think so oh sure no question it's hard\nIt's weird art but it's art how come nobody can find out who this guy is it's been around\nWow yes he has yeah yeah but he keeps a low profile okay I thought that was a brilliant move though oh that was really very clever that was really funny so early you know at the top of the hour we like to play various ah soundbites from the TV morning talk shows\nSo we found a diamond and so now we have not put them on our show yet I think they should become regulars so they're the ones who go on a Fox and friends and Fox News and they're very big supporters of the president so here's a little bit I what I Love is how the other\nWhoever's talking the other guy or other woman so supportive in the background I Love is the\nIdea of what a good thing is he\nAnd stigma and make it look like that he needs sleep\nHe says he he he has no right to speak so there's a lot of\nThinking in the black community and it's going to be reveal how old is your job on me and I think\nYeah I don't know the death productive but you you you are not really doing a lot of good meeting if it's televised 'cause everybody's going to be guarded\nWell that could be but uh the ideas not to make it productive ideas get a direct line to the people it's the only thing you can do and all the news is ridiculously slanted and all the coverage is biased and fake you can just put on a live camera and let the people see you know for instance he supposedly\nWe don't notice for sure but it's a word is going to be on sixty minutes Sunday night and it used to be years ago certain politicians wouldn't go on sixty minutes unless they can do it live\nBecause they know sixty minutes we'll doctor up the you know you sure edited it in a fraudulent way they've done that before a Michael Moore's the king a vet fraudulent doctoring up you remember the movie Fahrenheit nine one one when they tested the congressmen he said a ... you know they don't serve in Iraq you know their kids\nOr see grab the kinds of canoes why are your sons serving in Iraq\nAnd he said well a ... and they cut it right there [laughter] well if you'd watch the whole sentence the guy said well uh my nephew was serving my brother is serving his kids are serving a name like twenty this family's every so I I don't know what the sixty minutes and it's something like that could be live who knows\nYeah 'cause there's been no talk about it so maybe you know you'd normally they released some yeah excerpts\nNormally in front of the release of Mexico you may I don't know this but they may have made a deal where he's got to do it live so they can't Dr ... you'll see more and more live television with the president he thinks one of the finest moments ever and I agree with him was about a year ago your memory at a meeting about energy or something and then\nWith the all the members of Congress there were there to hash out some policy meant for the first hour the meeting he let the cameras in to watch the everybody was saying\nActually pretty interesting and there should be more of that now that we've got to bust up the swamp let's have a live cameras watch everything they do\nVery interesting tactic well when you got a swamp and all these snakes hey that's what you do with criminals you put in surveillance cameras and watch [laughter] speaking of which are Jamal ...\nWho nobody heard of two weeks ago now a except in the Georgetown dinner parties circumvent the now the public is aware of and he's this journalist who was\nKilled tortured dismembered by the Saudis the Turks say they've got audio of it because it was the Turks that first said he went into the embassy and never came out a nobody trusts the Turkish anything government anything so you got to take it with a grain of salt but uh and and somebody will point out\nWe've seen the surveillance from the front there's surveillance cameras on the back in France if that counts but how can we can see that\nMaybe he went out that way or how can we can't see the uh the Saudi Fifteen man or a murder team death squad come in there or see them come out carrying a Fifteen twenty trash bags\nAre so we don't know the Turks have some audio people have heard it they say on the order you can hear a vicious interrogation you can hear a beating\nTaking place but who knows what that audio is so a lot of talk about the sanctions we should sanction Saudi Arabia immediately we can't 'cause a we don't know anything\nFor absolute sure we don't we can't trust the Turks on this also a Saturday spent about a hundred billion dollars with us on planes and all sorts of stuff or you could cut that off you can impose sanctions but they'll just go to China and Russia right in the president was asked about\nThat is that to us there are other things we can do this I Would not be in favor of staff they a country from spending a hundred and ... and they in dollars which is an all time record and letting Russia have that money and letting China have that money\nThat's a good point that's a good point yeah so we're going to wait till we we we know more and let's be honest let's say they did do this\nWe're going to screw up everything over this\nYeah he's only one guy was telling\nThe truth is it is only one I I I mean this is terrible what happened but if he decided to make it his work over the last few years to write the most vicious columns about this new Saturday leader who we know imprisoned people you remember when he first took over and he took all the Saturday billionaires like prince outlaw a weed and lock\nThem up in a tortured them and I mean for me I wouldn't be writing [laughter] is this guy effect if he's listening I think you're doing a\nGreat job [laughter] keep up the good work [laughter]\nBut seriously you see you got a job as a columnist in London newspaper what'd you say you know what it be damning right the most in fishes come about Vladimir putting accused him of being a criminal and expose everything he does [noise]\nYeah and that probably wouldn't end well that's great if you're never going to leave the house you want to live in a vault is [laughter] feeling a walk into a council that's\nIn embassies and walk around turkey I that was that was a bad decision to go there and apparently they lured him there he's training he wants to get married\n[noise] so uh\nApparently needed a final paper to finalize the divorce what is it with this guy just getting divorced he wants to get married again these like rushing everything so if this that happened he would have gotten the document got married so either way it doesn't end well for this for\n[laughter] uh [laughter] but apparently they lured him\nInto that council it now some of these buildings some of these places around the world from some of these countries are known to have\nRight in the basement torture chambers like dungeons where they tortured people so that probably the reason that alert them to that building to get that paper had to know that\nIt's another thing I mean I don't want to pick on the poor guy but uh yeah not the sharpest journalists to go walk in there thinking that that's the only place you can go get that document\nWell it may be but ... you know yeah because I Want to risk your life for that\nYeah I I I Know so\nTerrible situation is I heard a report to the United states was aware that these are the hit squad was out looking for him and I'm ... should have said something\n[noise] ... what are you going to say the guy this Saudi ruler locked up or they're most prominent billionaires in the Ritz Carlton of all places in\nHas he had people that you didn't trust\nWorking for him [noise] did you let him know and what are you do [noise] All right thank you for they don't ...\nYou know hey I'm telling you she's very smart\nShe's a maze sing at reading people\nUh and I remember when he was dating her or I could tell right away that this woman was different she had real radar sonar built into him she could really read people well so and that was kind of like the Nancy Reagan role that was kind of Nancy Reagan so she could look at these people she could see where you could trust who you couldn't just to tip off the president's sometimes\nAnd in that way she had a lot of influence and the president and Trump trust or a lot\nOn these people that saw some people are going now here's the part causing some controversy\nI could say I'm the most believe some on the usage you the most bullied for so long enough that if you have the right people fall in the pool\nOkay the only thing wrong with that comment is Donald Trump is the single most bullied person in the history of the world would anybody dispute that I mean based on numbers metrics data has anybody been picked on more than Donald Trump ever in history does a pretty good job fighting back\nYeah oh no he's great at it but uh would condemn somebody it's been picked on more who said more negative things said about him and been insulted more had been called more names that had more bad articles written about a more\nVicious or imitations of him ridiculed more name anybody in history bullied more than Donald Trump\nNo you can't do it in history\nIn history [laughter] even\nDuring World War two there were a couple of movies made about Hitler ... a chaplain made the great dictator there are a couple of satirical movies about him and every so often it'd be a lot of jokes made about Hitler but I'm Talking about\nEvery second of all day every night you ever watch just cold beer every show the whole show the whole monologue\nYou remember Johnny Carson or Jay Leno twenty five jokes five about politics the rest about other stuff called their hundred and fifty joke monologue every joke about the president\nTrue every pick up the paper Washington Post New York times front page at free article is an op ed page forgot bath is an attack on a\n... why does he have the image of being a bully then\nOh you could argue that he is a bull yeah of course you could argue that but he's also the single most bullied person in the history of the world maim anybody who's been attacked ridiculed called more names and more vicious stuff written about him than him just name somebody who's had more\nThan I Would have thought Obama but I wasn't oh it wasn't as intense as a this is Obama\nWas nothing first of all he had all the media on his side they did do that or that the birth certificates that born in Kenya stuff but even that was like once in a while you know if you watched a\nConservative shows it would be one segment or every four days it was it that you know I Know it's not as intense you're right it's not as intense and who's that guy says he's the most interesting man in the world\nYou know the commercial yeah that you have to argue it's Trump love him or hate him\nPeople are obviously fascinated by it there's no never been to anybody else CNN MSNBC would devote every segment twenty where they do even if it's of through hatred still would make them the most interesting man ever\nAnother good point Marc\nLook at a even these shows he calls in a Fox and friends yesterday they kept him on forty seven minutes [laughter] that's it I mean that's what qualifies use the most interesting mineral what guest name any other guess hey I've done that when he's been on this show\nWhere you just drop the commercials you don't stop [laughter] remember the last time he was on he actually said hey I got to go with it [laughter] I got half [laughter] but name any other guests where once there talking forget the commercial breaks you keep talking well\nNow Fox is not covering his rallies as they used to they're not going live to them anymore\nBut only because they do get a little repetitive some time here and it also disrupts your programming\nAnd they were ... they would just go to the rally in cover the whole thing now they just do it or they have somebody watch it and make clips and they show the clips the other reason they're doing that is if you do the rally for the whole forty five minutes you gotta dropped three commercial breaks it gets very costly uh right now he's doing rallies every night either up three breaks the night\nSlot revenue so hey when we come back Roger Freeman will be with us we're talking about Taylor and the Kanye and uh uh there's a lot to get to get to the ills movie and more

getting getting back more than three hundred points of what was lost in the last two days a total of Thirteen hundred points\nBut I've come off the highs of dial up about two hundred and fifty points in early trading this morning as Asian stocks stabilized overnight and European stocks were mixed\nThrough much of the morning but at least generally speaking trading higher we're getting earnings reports from the big banks they are mixed banks doctor up just a little bit not really powering the market higher instead we've seen the market just route rally back\nFrom what many call an oversold condition in the short run given how far the market has fallen and how quickly it happened Wall Street was due for a bit of a balance as October now is on pace to be one of the worst months we've seen\nSince two thousand eleven so the bounce back in ... it's not as strong as it was at the opening bell so keeping a close eye on this market to see if it can maintain its momentum oil prices a

I think\nUh I remember talking to Bloomberg once about something that was trying to get done and everybody was going to go to Mary ... and I remember he said don't use my name you'll never get in your mind so this is about two years ago three years ago he knew that he was hated by mayor de Blasio I'm trying to remember the only thing I remember is when\nThe Blasio one do you remember that Bloomberg brought him down to city hall one day\nAnd wanted him to sit there for a few hours and he would tell Bloomberg would tell him everything he knew that the blogs you should not yeah and something went wrong in that meeting at the blacks who wasn't listening are paying attention or he thought that would just take some pictures of him sitting together at the desk\nHe really wanted to spend a couple of hours explaining things coming to blows your wasn't interested so they had a problem with that meeting and a Bloomberg is now wants to uh so desperate to run for president he was always a Democrat\nBut he pretended to be a Republican in two thousand and one 'cause that was the only side open to run for mayor on your mark green had the Democratic side locked up so he had to pretend to be Republican to run for mayor and now he's back to being a Democrat listen to the ...\nI just don't think Democrats are going to uh you know be attracted to someone who left our party Twenty years ago and now just come back\nA now remember he is going to try to wipe out Bloomberg because he wants to run for president the Blasio wants to run for president\nHe probably figures the they're not going to put up with two former New York city mayors\nNo and the ones that got us with one has sixty four billion dollars then you don't [laughter] yeah you don't want to run against that guy so he needs to get him out of the race and the Blasio has quite a good shot at being president when he shows how he turned New York into a homeless camp\nOr when he shows how he only goes to work like an hour in the afternoon I think the best thing he can run on is bring the press from all around the country in New York said look at this I put a homeless shelter in every neighborhood\nI put a homeless shelter next to Carnegie Hall I completely screwed up Park Avenue by putting a homeless shelter at sixty eighth street look I've got menacing homeless panhandlers everywhere now look what I did I took great platform it's a great slap you talk to mayors\nFrom other cities who are Democrats who think he's nuts thing uh I mean he's a nice guy in real life but they think that putting the homeless shelters in the nicest neighborhoods and putting them next to kind of go they think that is of they've told me that is the craziest\nThing they've ever seen a mayor do ever I mean I Know he did it just to be a you know nasty to everybody but they think that was absolutely insane\nSo I ... and remember when Bloomberg was in charge it was a much cleaner New York yeah so obviously if Bloomberg runs the blood who's got no case 'cause uh Bloomberg had a much much cleaner much more efficient New York but he hates Bloomberg\nI think more and more Americans understand that you know a lot of millionaires and billionaires have laughed all the way the bank and I doubt they want to elect another billionaire after the experience they've just had\nFirst of all that's unfair because I've known them Michael Bloomberg for years and he was never left\nEver about anything [laughter] it's almost no sense of humor [laughter] that's an unfair attack that left at least I Do not think he fits what Democrats are looking right now looking for right now but I don't want a guy who did a great job as mayor of New York for twelve years who the hell would want that exactly\nThat's the only problem with Bloomberg he can't win nationally 'cause outside of New York nobody would vote for a a billionaire Upper East side sort of like one thing about Donald Trump blue collar billionaire he's a guy from queens funny guy TV personality a lot of personal Bloomberg's zero personality\nA total a you know upper crust a thirst and how the third sort of a guy that doesn't play well in Iowa or anywhere else\nAnd he does have some things on his record that will freak people out or he tried to he wanted to pass a law he did pass a law and how much soda you're allowed to drink\n... well I don't know that I've got so but but\nHe did try to try and yes he actually wanted to make a law on how much soda you're allowed to drink [laughter] what size soda you're allowed to order magic that tell it to somebody you know higher that he started [laughter] anyhow I Want to have a law and how much salt you're allowed to use [laughter]\nThat's right yeah [laughter] so in a restaurant you don't have to order anymore you just sit there will tell you what's your advice [laughter]\nNow Governor Cuomo [laughter]\nYou know it's New York with how we get these people ... ... ... ...\nThat's the political system we have that is what comes out of it you don't you ever watch CNBC they have Fox Business when they invite all these CEOs to come on you don't know who they are they're major CEOs but the one guy is smarter than the other when you watch these interviews you don't know who they are but they're brilliant when they started talking we ended up with the ... [laughter]\n... you know talent we have in the middle of Manhattan that could run things so uh uh give us a Governor Cuomo credit for something a mark ... is the opposing candidate the Republican\nUh he's getting no place and the governor Cuomo's totally avoiding any debate with him he's not going to have a debate it's how how long does it for weeks right\nWho could ask for more in a relationship it's perfect she speaks five languages the kid's speaks three languages or you know we we tell ya Donald Trump he hates immigrants hates immigrants guy ever accused of aiding immigrants while I'm married to an immigrant you've been married to immigrants let's go to will in Brooklyn who will\n[noise] hey how you doing that good a\nConcern over the New York state governors ... already a libertarian candidate named Larry sharp regarding\nNobody here already well upstate nobody cares about you but he's actually in the poll he pulled\nThat on his own house he won't win the election oh come on from queens that helps out a well that's different than if he was from queens okay oh when we come back the smartest political consultant the best political analyst ...\nEd Rollins we'll talk to him next now he nobody better at a working on the midterms we'll see what is going to happen in four weeks who's gonna win will get to all of that coming up on seven ten W O R let's get the latest news here's Joe Bartlett okay\nMark a Turkish court has ordered the release of an American pastor who's been detained in that country for the past two years North Carolina pastor Andrew Brunson was convicted of committing crimes on behalf of a terror group which he denied he's now on his way home age of twenty people killed in that upstate level crashed going to be remembered today\nAwake will be held for the victims killed last Saturday when that vehicle sped through a stop sign the owner of prestige lemoult ...
