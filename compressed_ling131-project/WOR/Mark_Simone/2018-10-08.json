picture up of his feet are I don't forget that marks a mode is coming up at ten o'clock and your next chance to win is after the news at ten o'clock and it is now ten o'clock\n[noise] New York and this is talk of meals rated number\nOne seven ten W O R voice of New York and\nMocking Kavanaugh like crazy day after day after day who said that was the real reason to do the little routine just to even the playing field and soon after that everything kinda straighten out a little for Kavanaugh but there's always strategy to everything Donald Trump does\nWhen you say to yourself what is what does he have to tweak that why does he make these comments a lot of times it's just a troll Democrats to just get the more unhinged to get them crazier and crazier look at what he set up now going into the midterms\nNormally in a case like this the party in power loses the house in the mid terms\nBut in this case Democrats are just screwing this up completely you they could have been on their way to an easy victory in the house but by acting on hinged by acting nuts it just turns off all the independent voters who didn't need\nSo if you were thinking of voting Democrat what what what would cause that maybe said well they have a better a better plan for health care\nUh I like their stance on this better but now you can't vote they're just an angry mob seizing building screaming in the streets yelling in restaurants chasing public officials at a restaurant they just look nuts and it was part of Trump's doing\nGetting them to look more and more and more unhinged now there are other plot was this whole uh Christine Blasey Ford mess I don't know if you think this is a coincidence\nBut every time there's one of these elections they do what's called an October surprise when Trump was running for president Billy Bush tape when was that October Anita Hill when was that October eleventh there's always this October surprise so this was really the October surprise and they think this puts in the air\nWhole issue of women in uh me too and all that and but they've tried this before against Trump and Democrats and it never works nobody's buying if nobody's believe in it so it should be a pretty good mid term for a for Republicans would probably do very well here\nAlso a lot of people have a first of all they're totally suspicious of forward you know this is not a he said she said it's not that simple\nHe's a very well known public official he's been there Thirty years these past seven FBI background checks with flying colors she's totally unknown we don't know anything about it she's never been investigated\nSo there's a big question mark on her and not on him and then you've got the ... the accuser who turns out to be totally lying and she's ... minute she's completely backed off for a story\nEverything she said about him spiking the punch bowl the gang rapes this she is now said I withdraw it all I didn't see any of that I saw nothing like that and there are certain uh a legal scholars even Alan Dershowitz demanding that she be prosecuted\nBut she actually be dragged into a courtroom and a half to answer for this then you also had the that other accuser came from a New Yorker magazine story that story turns out to be a total mess even the source they use in the story says it doesn't know anything about it didn't so that\nStory fell apart by the way ... is now radioactive two Democrats they don't want to go anywhere near him a ever again\nSo I think you\nCan see the ... the Republicans in a good spot right now the momentum will only go in their favor people are starting to notice that are\nNot only are Democrats unhinged the media is under hinged academia is on the ... or even the comedians are just so I mean do you even watch Saturday Night live anymore there's no suspense to wonder what the joke is what the what side they're going to take this was the opening skit saddening I left\nThe opening sketch a take off on the cabinet victory how it's like a locker room to pouring champagne over each other that kind of stuff\nWe now go live to data bass who's with Senate Republicans\nThe far [laughter]\n\n\nIt was this sort of an okay opening sketch obviously it's sad that left they're going to go after cabinet that from that moment on the show was just on watch it but it's basically I don't even know where they bother just do the opening sketch from now and put her on YouTube we don't need to sit through this hour and a half and nothing\nThey will get back to a cabinet and the Trump and all of that is just so you know this Facebook thing when you're on Facebook\nYou probably got a all sorts of people right and you're saying I got another friend request with you looks like your account has been hacked none of this is true it's all a hoax\nNobody sent a friend request on your behalf it's all a hoax it's a chain letter that is somehow automatically going out to everybody and what it tells you to do it says it looks like your account was hacked so push a here and do this and click on the don't do any of that Facebook says just ignore it if you want to change your passwords you can\nYou don't have to but it's all a hoax or if you ever worried about somebody hacking your account if you ever think that's the case you know you can go into settings just go into settings\nThen go into security and\nSecurity you can see log ins you can check to see if anybody anywhere his logged into your account except you so that's always the smart thing to do this or this limousine crash boy that is a it's the worst crash in Twenty years we still have no\nReal clues to what happened the driver of this limousine twenty people killed Eighteen in the car\nAnd then to others who happened to be outside the here but it looks like the driver was going down a hill going very fast on a regular street who's going to sixty miles an hour in a limousine went through a stop sign hit a parked SUV twenty people dead Eighteen and the car\nYou know they're not wearing seatbelts you don't or in the I think the law is you have to wear a seatbelt in the front seat and that's about it in the limousine so we don't know exactly what happened with the driver was drunk or what but it was in the daytime horrible\nHorrible crash the as I say the worst in in Twenty years the Transportation Safety board is they're investigating it'll take them a few days to come up with something a\nBut thank goodness for Chuck Schumer the sleazy bureaucrat crash people dead he's up all night how can we cash in on this what can we do you know you always is this fake Sunday press conference where he proposes some silly thing that be frozen the wastebasket as soon as he's done it's just an excuse to get on television if you do anything on a Sunday\nThey have no stories for the Sunday paper you know for that night for the news for TV so they'll do whatever you that's why he does a Sunday press conference if he did a Monday press conference nobody noticed but here he was trying to exploit this whole situation\nEvery inch you stretch limo makes it more dangerous\nAnd yet there are no rules regulating them so I've asked the NTSB to implement rules\n[laughter] yes I Am the character he was on the phone as soon as here about the question what can we do to exploit this how can this helped me in some way so this is his solution what was he talking about regulations on what on length every and [noise]\nYou stretch limo makes it more dangerous\nAnd yet there are no rules the hell is he talking about that and make it more dangerous I don't know why they came up with this you know uh\nYou would think he'd say uh that all limousine drivers must be drug tested alcohol tested must be ...\nI I think that's the problem you want to make sure the drivers driving very safely and not drunk or anything but\nWe don't know what happened here I mean they could finish the investigation find that there was no alcohol drugs could've been a heart attack who knows what it could have been so he's going to think of is legislation on how many inches your limousine can be [laughter]\nNothing stops the slimy guy from exploding things hey Megan Kelly a word\nIs she may be out now she's a total disaster as soon as she went\nTo a NBC complete disaster remember ... year and a half ago they hired her first thing to say what should we do a Sunday show up against sixty minutes\nAnd this will be in the summer\nWhen sixty minutes isn't reruns so she would do a big brand new blockbuster show every Sunday seven o'clock against sixty minutes first week she came in last place third place among the network's next week\nFourth place [laughter] and remember she was doing these shows that got tons of publicity a member of the one about the Newtown shooting and then there was one with that Alex Jones owned it was the exclusive interview with ... and they got mad\nNominee period yeah they're they're really in trouble well\nHe does have accomplishments you see those two gorgeous blondes he was on that plane list\nTry looking like him and getting them to go somewhere with you\nAnd flying down a Don Webb with those young ladies go where Bill Clinton fly to Ghana that island\nOh yeah that underage girl or what they call a pedophile island or whatever that was\nThat other person was it was a guy when it was supposed to stay away from\nA Jeffrey abstain exactly\nBut you know because I made it on on Sunday Morning I made the unfortunate mistake scanning through the channels that I I saw George still Lewis and then I saw Robert Menendez head and the only thing it said I didn't support Trump's nominee\nGive them yeah it's amazing how there's nobody slimy or then this Menendez who's all tangled up with this a big donor this I Dr he's got these bimbos on private jets this Menendez is so slimy but they dragged in the courtroom for a long time a couple of times I think\nAnd even though it was totally unethical totally immoral the court said it's not technically illegal when he did a but still slimy the fact that this guy is a nerve even run again is amazing ah Chris and arts they hid Chris\nYes hey mark how are you good luck mark I haven't heard anything about Christine Blasey Ford since ... confirmed he can't get everyone felt so sorry for they were going to miss it right\nAre you know the way it works for Democrats they will check the polling properly Tuesday or Wednesday if it's not hurting Trump\nWill throw her out of a moving car right to the side of the road just like the ... Sydney sins and Cindy ... Rob Porter they just toss them out a here's the other\nThing that I I first I thought I was one of these view about the something happened to Dr Ford somewhere and she's confused with cabinet nothing she was out no line I just believe she was totally lying now I think she knows\nA first of all the whole gaping holes in her story are also the crying sobbing sniffing every doctor I've spoken to even eye ear nose and throat doctors told me they watched that you can't sniffing sob looked at for an hour and never need a Kleenex\nIt's impossible and putting the big coke bottle there that was subliminal that was to remind you of Anita Hill a as a whole things to stage and there's too many lives already we've discovered on her she lied about our polygraph history she lied about uh never being told\nThat she could testify private if she wanted to she lied about the fear of flying she's got frequent flyer awards from five different airlines this too many lives I think she ends up I Know people are ... are demanding\nThat Julie sweating to be prosecuted you never know somebody might authorize an FBI background check into\nDr Ford who knows you know the\nQuestion is if her\nPerjury trial reaches the Supreme Court will cabinet I have to recuse himself that's the big question anyway when we come back Lionel will be whether that is a legal mind you know using attorney was a prosecutor and we'll get to the bottom of this with him and the other matters coming up next on seven ten W O R let's get the latest news is Jeff McKinney\nMark thank you demand policing gun down his ex girlfriend and Brooklyn last night as surrender to police police have been looking for twenty six year old Gabriel Rivera and the death of ...

whenever you hear all these senators Thursday Friday I don't know what I'm going to do I just don't know how I'm going to vote that's the signal that they're waiting for the bribe\nOr that's what goes on and most of these cases it's a bribe no they're not personally ... stuffing money in their pocket but they want to be bribed so if you're a Senator Mitch McConnell to come to you and say what do you need well\nI Need an appropriation for a new airport in my state I Need a new bridge I Need a fifty million for a new highway and that's that's what they do for you or if it's the White House they
