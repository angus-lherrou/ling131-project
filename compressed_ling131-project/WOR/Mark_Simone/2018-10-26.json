I Wonder if he was on the list of the highest paid actors in the Nineteen seventies and you know this crazy and those numbers would upheld bike oh God yeah all I ... I remember at one point Peter\nFalk was the highest paid actor on TV 'cause he was getting five hundred thousand an episode per Colombo in the seventies and that was a huge amount of money seventies yeah I'm not quite what the big bang theory money is like now is unbelievable\nAnd the Modern Family oh yeah hey here's a story from Trenton and here we go again so apparently a New Jersey\nSoccer coach called the cops because parents you know I Wish it were shouting at kids playing soccer speak English this is America there was there was a junior varsity game going on there's a trend Trenton Central High school and hope well valleys Central High school it was recorded and Jay dot com\nSo they called the police the police arrived they got the parents to settle down there ...\nThat um some of the parents were set off when they heard it threatened player using a Spanish curse word against a referee\nSo I mean what are you going to speak English they what are the cursing the referee egg wishing we don't curse it are referees would spatter down America we want to use good old fashioned English expletives [laughter]\nI Know that that is funny [laughter] oh yeah yeah people should just be have\nThey really should should all get along the way we get along every week day morning it's wonderful if you missed and if you're on the show we have the podcast every day you can listen to the entire show yeah you can hear me losing my temper will enter the first segment you just lost you went off the rails like off the rails renal failure\nWell if you work with lend you lose your sooner or later to try to write this what's this great video cameras adelies are the good video real came up with another video he wants to be able to come to south yeah he's really saw into\nI like animal videos where you want from you know I found this video and there's this dog out in California and uh with the apartment complex where the dog with it's got a wall around you know well the dog has figured out a way\nTo climb up on the wall well holding a ball in his paws you know he dropped the ball over the wall so people will pick it up and then play with them and toss it back to them\nSo it's a dog who actually kind of care that kind of funny he was he just wants to meet the people the pastor buys their show he drops the ball on them they pick it up they throw back at him and his little issues with them they move on oh man did he video it's skewed is is it the dog is adorable\nLike a golden retriever I think the the first time that he figured out a way to scale wall well he's holding the ball in his paws\nAnd he drew opposite and then people stop and play with him\nThat lend would just like throw the ball the other\nSide of the road and see if the dog runs on the street [laughter] you do get hit by a car quote your favorite president there you go there you know struck me as being a pet guideline you really\n[noise] boy no one wants her\nIt was nothing to do with it but no no no she was going to go to UTA another great huge talent agency or they said no not interest is\n[laughter] so uh I don't mean to laugh but she's such an evil person a\nNow she'll act like she did nothing wrong right now that's going to be the contention yes you know in fact she's already started that others have done where she did nothing wrong you can hear all this I did nothing wrong it did nothing but let's go back to days\n[noise] ... and that wind again with the war and I'm Sorry\nOh wait a minute she says she's going to say she did nothing wrong remember this\nEither as long as it was a respectful and part of the Halloween costume full ... ... I was wrong I Am sorry\nThis is the real Megan Kelly you gonna get to know over the next few weeks I was wrong\nWatch a week from now she's doing the interview I did nothing wrong and uh she's going to\nCause such a stink for NBC she gets somebody once said about her I forget who sends a long time ago the problem with her she looks like everybody's ex wife in court so the problem with her you are going to see her get so ugly or she's going to go nuclear on NBC she's already said they're going to have some sort of negotiation\nA sixty nine million dollar contract what would that be thirty three million a year\n\nA twenty three million a year I'm not really very good at math is three years of fires you twenty three million a year okay just twenty three million years she worked at a year and a half so they would oh her about thirty five million or something like that that\nThey would have to pay her away now over at Fox she still had a months left I think the older Seventeen million but they paid it they just it just just go just get out of the building you step infecting our staff and\nShe gets paid more for not working most people can get paid for work\nYeah she's like one of those a member of those are the east coast green mailing and the the\nBig corporate greedy eighties with a guy would for a horrible guy would pretend he was gonna buy your company and they pay you to go away and she's got one of these kinds of deals going to get in there and then they'll pay millions to get out\nNobody can stand there uh the whole staff eight so there was a staff revolt and NBC this week so they could or thirty something million dollars now that has to be negotiated\nBetween her lawyers and NBC she's hired this uh Brian what's his name there he's one of the top top top entertainment lawyers or does a great job by Brian Friedman he's he's the lawyer for her now she has said she wants Ronan Farrow in the room\n[laughter] what's that about that's about her being got\nJust a complete phony with a cheap publicity stunt just trying to haunt NBC they know that that Andy lacking company list is the reporter that they hate the most fear the most\nObviously there's no way on earth in any corporation\nAs you negotiate your settlement with the lawyers they're going to have a reporter in the room that's never going to happen anywhere it's impossible it's like if I was negotiating my contract and I said I'd like Emily Smith paid six to be a witness [laughter] what he's going to agree to that you can't have anybody in the room except people with the company or your lawyers\nSo she's doing it just to be as\nThe trickle as possible as ugly as possible Ronan Farrow says he knows nothing about it uh he's got a problem now because he doesn't want to be tied to Megan Kelly that doesn't look good when all\nThat stuff happened over at Fox from what I Know she was not really much of a\n... involved in the sexual harassment report did she go to work trying to kill Roger ales the guy that made her the guy to put her on the map the guy that made her a star she even though she hadn't much to say she was running around town finding of victims and dragging them kicking and screaming to the law for making sure they testify against ales\nNobody worked harder just screw up the guy that made her than Megan Kelly so she will go nuclear on NBC Andy lack is the guy that brought her in there she will try to destroy this guy and I think he knows it\nI think that's why he wanted to just get her out of the building like you realize you know he's going to have to have an Normandy invasion right now and settle this thing there's no other way\nSo she is going to probably make all kinds of accusations\nAgainst NBC you might hear a start talking about this unbelievable me two things that are going on no one knows about their unbelievable cover ups you might start hinting at that\nTo force a settlement uh uh ...\nI mean that's why she said I Want Ronan Farrow in the room she's trying to get him to just hand or knowing her she's trying to get it and are more than she is owed a like a ...\nThe example of a false flags to throw brick for your own window act like the victim and there are people that think these bombs\nWho are there may be a false flag operation that might be Democrats trying you know they were very very upset about that mob label that had stuck to them\nThey really became known as the party of mobs nut jobs or antifa the rioting in the streets all that kind of stuff vandalizing the Manhattan Republican club chasing people out of restaurants they didn't like that ... somebody on the left\nMay have decided on this and dumb this send send out these ... of mock bombs nobody knows if there's any real explosive power in them they may not have even been real bombs and the packaging everything was designed to scream suspicious package\nAnd usually a real bummer doesn't send out ten in one day it's usually\nA one every day for ten days that way create more terror but uh this look like it was just for publicity just for attention and we'll go to line one uh wherever you are hello hello\nHello hello yes point yes ... says that seven bombs and none of them go on\nWell that's the thing they weren't uh for the most part real bombs that were made to just looks suspicious get a lot of attention uh I think there was one that was actually said to have some explosives in some had no explosive in it and when you open up the wires everything hanging out so it could turn out somebody on the left\nWas actually behind this hey we had the the debate last night ... brand or the Republican Party very weak in New York state they often can't find candidates right now there's six congressional races where they put up no candidate [laughter]\nNo candidate at all so ah and the you know the case of the blog you'll reelection it couldn't really find anybody so they sent the\nUh what's your name nice woman but very we couldn't talk\nA bit and then sometimes it gets to ... get a total amateurs what they've done against your brand\nThey couldn't get a candidate so they've got this she's a very nice woman Michelle Farley very nice woman smart a successful but something in the financial world but not a professional not a not a candidate who can really talk or do anything a job ran one thing about her she may be\nA a pay for play sleazy politicians but she looks good on TV she sounds good\nTo have access to the kinds of well I Can't really laugh and they don't have very little anyway because they kept away from\nThis is true but it sounds good this is the debate when we go see this debate would they tape the yesterday Sunday I think it's Sunday night were playing some clips from the taping yesterday this is this a woman show Farley\nCandidate ran in exchange for her vote could have gotten that ... and a cat I Would definitely look like taxes went up by the offer\nMiranda and sex and the city I think so yeah it was the voice Raymond around to the very bad deliver you need a professional to do this that they give you the lines and you'd memorized them\nIn jail in France in exchange for her vote could have gotten to that and ... and the cat Cynthia Nixon kidding I Would definitely do I look like taxes went up for that you know for so many New Yorkers shaded finally ... for a living and filed out\nYeah okay All right but again delivery way too fast not emphasizing the words not getting it across\nPakistan has on race as a as an act immigrant telephone via as hell\nIt's the way the campaign hey just buzz words words don't say anything I say this is a professional just buzzwords\nPakistan has gone way than a anti Muslim anti immigrant homophobia as hell\nI got my vote [laughter] you go [laughter] here's the response so far like\nClients that senator Gillibrand wants to abolish ice which is really that actually is primarily responsible for for ... we can't allow that to happen\nAgain she's a very nice woman but this is you sound like the telemarketing phone call yeah you may have won the weekend at our resource [laughter] let's go to a Lewis Lewis in the broad St Louis\nLast night all buddy good though what about Bob ... thoughts and your class they showed the hand that all this actually\nSo desperate they're trying to blow up each other I Know he's a loose and we don't know if they're bombs or even the law enforcement not actually calling them bumps just calling him devices they don't know if they were actually bombs in most cases a soda Wilbur in Texas said Wilbur\nYeah that was completely or the ... to lose her job over PC political correctness is worth taking those is er and\nShe's not losing her job over that she's just a horrible years no no no using she's not losing your job over that she's horrible woman everybody hates are over there they were trying to get rid of her for so long\nLook at this the other day the whole staff went to speak with human resources are and said they they can't work with her she's toxic they don't like her a staffers at NBC were informed that they are members of the today show stuff and not her staff\nAnd that after she's gone there will be saved they've been dying to get rid of her for a long\nTime toxic horrible to be around low ratings total disaster uh they've been trying to get rid of a perfect she finally gave them an excuse well when we come back how he car will be with us we'll talk to him next\nOn seven ten W. or have you have a chance to win a thousand dollars a after the top of the hour and let's get all the latest news right now here's Joe Bartlett\nAlready mind mark and others suspected mail bomb discovered it a postal facility in midtown at fifty second street between eighth and ninth avenue that device\nAnd they were the marathon bombers at a time how are you are the Elizabeth Warren expert where does she stay in now he she uh she's had nothing to help herself with that DNA stunt\nNo no she's a she's stumbling towards the finish line she's she's still favorite\nBut she's a she she's really damaged herself nationally and she's damaged herself here she had to terrible debates last week the first which particularly she was hysterical she uh you know she's not originally from here and uh she she referred to the town of or and you probably heard of it yeah\nBut the case is the ... that's one of the two big wages as everybody knows\nBorn she called it burn [laughter]\nIn a debate burn a it was it helped me it's just it's just ridiculous and and uh she's she she's just a you know she's trying to run against bottle trumpet and she just screaming and yelling and uh she it's it's it's a lot of good luck I don't think I I don't think she's um I I I think she's a probably a\n... very much damaged her raw or her front runner status but New York magazine such as the front runner up on a month ago I got it pretty embarrassed by that that story in retrospect\nYeah and I think with a Democrat say we can't have her she's a accident prone gaffe prone to another Hillary\nShe's in you know they you know they they keep talk at the Boston Globe keeps trying to portray her as a smart person but [noise]\nIt's not very good on our feet you know she's she's which the first time she ran she had to have the ball Patrick a governor who now wants to run for president she had to have a company or so we can answer the question\nIs you know he's not the sharpest knife in the drawer either three tries to pass the bar exam at our but so\nI mean you know you gotta just just watch word check out one of these debates if you get a chance part just see she made it you know screaming and yelling in hysteria and blaming everything on Donald Trump it's just it's not a good law last year you know outside her favorite cheese shop at Harvard\nSquare I don't even think it's a good look at north ferrets way\nTo say we're out of time but everybody get how he cars book if you want the best book on the Trump campaign's called what really happened he was there for the campaign and get the book Kennedy Babylon and when does volume two available\nIt will be well you could have pre order now Marco to our car show dot com and you could create order it will be out next month a line all edits this weekend\nI'll I'll make sure you wind up like get copies of very suit there yet so we got a lot of lot of pictures of it it's I think it's just going to get along one that's got all I I tried to wrap up all their what maybe scandals\nBike riding more and more every day ... Kerry Kennedy stuff that's going on in New York or the criminals out of prison if you do what do you every every day it seems like there's a new scandal for me to write and for the for the second volume\nWell we'll get a volume three that means that's all I\nCan be more mark that's why I'm cut that off all your\nWherever you go to our car show dot com get his books they're great how he car thanks for being with us okay thanks bark like here ... chicken look at the Web page with some great stuff up there to you first hear some of Meghan Kelly's most cringe worthy moments\nThe ten names and just what person Google Search all of these names and their addresses that would lead you to the guy some may maybe they did that I don't know\nHow much Google cooperates with the government and all of that but it could have been that could have been DNA fingerprints off something on the device could have been surveillance at the postal facility where he brought the novels but one guy in custody law enforcement confirming one person has been arrested\nAnd we should know more by the end of the day will also ah hopefully ah I think our car may be right if it turns out it's a Democrat\nThat may become a cold case we may never hear thing about it they may hush it up if it is a Trump supporter you're will know all about it and an hour [laughter] but if it's a Democrat who was doing this for political purposes to help the Democrats\nOr we may not hear about it they may cover that up\nAt eight and what I was talking about Google they've had some real bad meat to stuff going oh yeah a forced to perform oral sex on them you know those kinds of executives are and apparently that Google not only covered it up paid these guys a fortune kept them there gave them their bonuses one of them got\nNinety million imagine and firing at Ninety million dollars to walk out the door even Megan Kelly doesn't get a deal at Ninety million\nBut they were all kinds of bad me two guys Google covering it up you know one thing about these tech giants in as well as they do as well as they do Amazon and Google and uh\nUh all these companies you gotta remember they don't have to deal with the normal stuff a business is the deal if they don't have unions are then they don't have to worry about any meat to sift through like their own little world there\nOr if that was a meat to thing at NBC or CBS of course you'd get caught and you hear about it a Google and I just cover it up\nThey just do it they know they can get away with stuff out there they're like from another planet these tech companies are like off in their secret little world nobody knows anything about what they do\nWell if I had like what they said forty eight people yeah now yeah\nAfter a big stink about it you\nSee this Netflix stuff these employees have come forward fifty different Netflix and plus it's a horrible horrible vicious in environment they're brutalized them threatened that looks all the time but again it's like a you know when you think NBC\nIt's like a real thing you walk by Rockefeller Center and is a big uh NBC entrance and there's the ... picture Jimmy founding of that's NBC it's right there it's like a real thing you know who runs it but Netflix does anybody know where it is or what it is it's\nIt's like some mysterious thing that's just on your computer\nThose a lot of TV shows there I mean obviously that good but it got it from someplace the\nTourists come to New York I suspect the NBC tour you ever hear of a Netflix tour where is it I guess it's in Silicon valley somewhere yeah that's another thing it's like during the witness protection these tech companies they're not in normal place either like out in this Silicon Valley somewhere it's like a witness protection in the city where they all live\nAlthough if you go down the meatpacking district isn't that what they call silicon alley Google is there\nA Twitter is there but nobody knows where it's just the one of those buildings [laughter] it was the last time you walk by the Twitter building it's fair I'm sure you have it you just don't know it it's like a it's like a secret safe house that they all work out so uh the caravan is still headed this way we know the\nCaravan is funded by left wing groups the Honduran president has confirmed this\nThere's a Honduran organization or to paying for everything is is a very expensive care of and there are big trucks that shadow it with the food medicine and water for five thousand people every day\nBut it's all being funded paid for as again the Honduran president says left wing groups are funding it the caravan is heading here General Mattis is drawing up battle plans for the border\nHe will send troops there they will defend the border do whatever they have to do to stop those people from coming in now the big problem is if they get to the port of entry\nAnd declare themselves they are seeking political asylum under a law we're supposed to accept them into the facility we\nDon't have to let him into the country but we have to hold them for what is the long periods like a\n... a year or something to go through the asylum application process yeah yeah right so we're stuck with them right they get there and now the president is going to probably\nIn the next few days sign an executive order ending any asylum program for the Mexican us border you can do it through executive order he will shut down the whole system so that we don't have to even let them into the facility well\nI don't know how you stop him a again you've got Soros left wing type stuff\nBacking this financing this I'm sure they have a battle plan of their own who knows what it is maybe as they get to the board of a caravan all disperse is over hundreds of miles and then tries to cross maybe they come as a caravan into one spot that will be easier for the army did not stop\nOn but I didn't think the army was supposed to interact with those migrants there were just sort of there's a support role\nOur regulations of the U.S army cannot uh go into any kind of combat us soil but apparently in the regulations as a total exception for defending the border if they're defending the border they can do whatever they have to do\nSo basically we're going to declare this an invasion well no it is an invasion what else would it be [laughter] well I mean some people say they're these are people seeking asylum they're not trying to lead the country they're asking the United states for help if you see it\nUh it's not been a confirmed whether any of them really were exposed to so I think one was said to have actual explosive minute somewhere mock ups a but these twelve devices all seem to come from Florida a suspect\nHas been arrested as soon as we know more will bring it to you know let's go to Josephine in New Jersey a Josephine\nHad like ... and Kelly looking for a job just to the expression not [noise] I'm calling about the ah ah the silence\nThey curse all the pictures I said in the air with a handful of when they're looking for asylum because they want to get rid of all of the horrendous conditions in their countries why it they have all the women and children behind\nWell it's a good point that a lot of people have brought up whenever you see these pictures it seems to be a surprisingly male it's like eighty nine percent men uh especially in their twenties sometimes than some pictures Ninety five percent men let's go to Walter in Staten Island they Walter\n[noise] hey Mark I'm on a love your show or do you think that maybe it is this a male bombers turns out to be a disgruntled Democrat Senate warning shots to these people that are destroying their party\nWell first of all all Democrats are disgruntled [laughter] just part of being a Democrat junior Chris Matthews on the show yesterday\nYeah he was pretty good talking about how Democrats have totally forgotten about the uh\nThe middle class of America the working man the people that were supposed to be for they've abandoned these he was great he said all these Democrats have become just these\nAlito snobs who think they're smarter than everybody think they know where we moved in with their Carole King concerts [laughter] it's a big thing all the big fundraising have Carole King perform and let's go to mark in Hackensack mark\nHey thank you mark for telling it like it is and Senator Rand Paul mended important point when he said unstable people are being influenced by the fake news media is anger\nHatred in lies against for example or police like the lie hands up don't shoot and the five police that were murdered in Dallas that to New York city police Rafael Ramos when Jim Lewis says\nYeah now the fake news really has been a lot to uh\nCause all of these problems Rand Paul you know using Rand Paul and interviews or when he talks\nTo brilliant guy very articulate if he didn't look so wacky same thing with a father you know they all look even just a little cookie that you couldn't take it too seriously but when you listen to Rand Paul a brilliant guy the fake news has done two things that I don't think anybody I Know you're gonna blame the president but nobody's done more to gin up this ...\nThis lack of civility than uh\nThe fake news and the other thing is the dereliction of duty\nPicked the caravan for instance where are they on this it's\nObviously heavily funded massive trucks in vehicles are shattering the care of and with food medicine water for five thousand people or who's paying for that we've got the president of Honduras telling us it's left wing group where where's the media investigating the origin of the caravan who's funding it they just go to sleep on that\nUh the only investigate when it's a Republican when it's Trump they investigate otherwise total dereliction of duty\nBut you wrote a great comeback this Monica Crowley about this or lack of civility who started who's to blame these mobs and the Democrats the new uh instead of the donkey for their symbol be angry mob is now the symbol but she wrote a great comeback we'll talk to her next", "show_name": "Mark
