that you know people look at the media looks the other way on where's the fake news on this where's the New York times Washington Post on this that's what I call them up and\nGet on this where are you on the Harvard why aren't you going after Harvard where they're anti Asian and what's the deal with the Asian students they being discriminated against they're suing Harvard\nYeah well they lowered the SAT scores for non Asians\nYeah see that Haitians have to score a little higher while they you know have a problem with these ... these Asians if it's a one to a hundred they scored like a hundred and five these Asians or anything or what his calculus ... hundred and five [laughter] oh it is with these Asian I Know what it is they work hard I work hard they work hard\nOr an Asian if you've got a Ninety nine you'd be crying it'd be afraid to show to your parents [laughter]\nHey I was a proud D student once in a while as little see there\nAt the end you graduated right some has barely got out of there but uh these Asians\nStraight a pluses always they get a hundred on every test so they're discriminating out some of the Harvard now the reason ah so what's the deal if you're a\nOther ethnic groups you you need less\nIn the yeah right they don't have the scores high on the SAT\nSo for other groups uh Seventy is like an Asian one hundred [laughter] so there's a court case\nHarvard is in court saying the reason they're doing this is for diversity and they argue that the most important thing is diversity nothing more important for students then diversity so how come every professor at Harvard is one hundred percent far left wing Democrat\nWhere's the diversity where we're only talking about ethnic diversity as a whole lyrical diverse ... how about diversity of thought that's therefore thinking every professor at Harvard hundred percent far left Democrat so there's absolutely no diversity I Hope they bring that up in the trial yeah I'm sure that's going to come up well it's a\nGood argument you obviously have done nothing about diversity in the most important area while you're pushing it so much here hey are you getting crazy to get more junk mail email you get more spin email every day by the thousands and you can start\nGoing to the way the bottom where it's just click here to unsubscribe mhm by the way don't do that just delete it all you start clicking the unsubscribe just suddenly get ten times as much [laughter] I thought so [laughter] I was in Florida and you just get more junk mail than ever bought\nA people are saying you got to accept this now\nBecause this these are the catalogs of two thousand Eighteen mom used to get Fifteen catalogs and coupons and still getting well you're still getting but less than what we used to get those coupons flyers every day in your mailbox ...\nUh they're just all one by one all those companies are converting over to this big going on line that going digital it'll never stop do you get all these things from Lincoln\nYeah and and they're not really from linked in it's like so and so trying to connect with you and linked in but like I have like twelve different email address is only one is uh on my linked in\nBut I'm getting on a model twelve so obviously just sent it to every huh and the ... the songs or wants to connect with you but somebody I'm already connected to so it it's just junk mail a and it never stops you know what I miss though the peanuts enlargement I used to get those all the time\nThey have disappeared ... day period yeah what happened to that [laughter] oh they must know that everything's okay [laughter] I Know everything about you or maybe it's just me maybe they said well we found out he doesn't I don't know but that's one that went away or less and less vitamin ones now they're all different ones now\nAnd they are well I usually have the credit card ones yeah you always get those and all that stuff uh hey what percentage of children are are born where the parents are not married\nYet I notice when it was\nNineteen Seventy was ten percent which sounds high ten percent parents aren't married what does it today it's like fifty sixty percent forty percent ... percent forty percent and an unbelievable yes are not married\nOr you know it used to be a million years ago if the parents were divorced it was tough on the kid especially in school they make fun of them but now I talked to especially in the suburbs everybody's divorced everybody's divorced in the suburbs at the kid if he if his parents are married\nThey're all living together that kid gets picked on [laughter] not fun [laughter] so unusual so it's a matter with your family so nowadays it's very common\nUnmarried parents I'm you know the women do this all the time uh the the one sperm from some guy they want to have a baby they're not married they don't intend to get married so it's very very common now\nWell they this study is that a lot of it it's not so much single mothers as people just didn't get married\nYou know that happens to you know they just don't get married is no reason to get married anymore and I think that makes sense yeah right what how many people get divorced everybody gets divorced\nOn every body well you know normal people some people I Know plenty of force no if I Know like two people are still married ... how many people you know been married forever\nWell a lot of my friends do but you hang out with in the morning people I Know nice up there with the you know the city every buddies divorced every buddy uh\nI Know but you think or somebody driving by is going to go huh yoga and I always got to sign a guest house to vote for 'em you think it really does anything no not at all [laughter]\nI just like of course talking I said well it's\nOkay well then it's worth it [laughter] you know and when you drive out in the suburbs\nYou see the signs this like forty of men every corner and thirty nine of you'd never heard of these names they're like little local races vote for Collins' vote for who to vote for him was among sign [laughter] I just see the signs everywhere and is this\nAnnoying uh hey the weekend\nBe a two days but the singer or the uh he's going to be a movie star now he's doing a movie Seuss is uh I thought about this\nStar is born huge hit lady Gaga lots of talk about an Oscar she's going to end up getting the Oscar for this thing so all these other singers music figures are going to want to get in on this because it's very important\nYou get yourself an Oscar you are you have a certain cache to you so the weekend is next a look for Drake look for all these go there all your everybody get me to get me scripts you start looking to move well it's a big thing you know you go back to the\nGolden age of a show business the fifties sixties whoever was the biggest star was also the biggest movie star like Frank Sinatra major recording star major you there's nothing like that today I think about that a guy like Sinatra in the fifties or sixties number one movie star\nNumber one a concert attraction number one in everything number one recording star\nYou imagine being that dominant a big TV star and TV specials all that stuff there's nothing like you can point to anything like that today nobody that big no no thinking about Drake how big ideas but he's not the biggest in movies he's not the biggest in television these imagine back then you could be the biggest in all everything it was total dominance\nSo a pay by Joe Biden is a I think he's definitely running definitely running he is all over the place how old is he now Seventy two\n... and early seventies\nEarly seventies so it'd be mid seventies by the time it rolls her but he is all over the place talking about ...
