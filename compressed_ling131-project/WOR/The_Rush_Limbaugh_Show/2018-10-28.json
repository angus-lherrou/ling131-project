you can also call Dr Lieberman at you and your killington for a free informative ... on DVD hey Dr Lederman what by\nOur back on what to say about sixty two year old man he is a man with four children and came to me for prostate cancers PSA that's a blood test custody specific antigen many men wish to have a PSA it helps to find the risk of having cancer so it's used as a screening device number one number two it's used for a way of\nFollowing men with prostate cancer because as PSA was elevated at eight he had a biopsy usually more than four is considered suspicious he had a biopsy showing cancer\nAnd he had an act of prostate cancer he had a CAT scan and bones scattered negative I should say is a black man and we know in the black community the risk of prostate cancer is higher one in six black women will get prostate cancer one twenty three will die of prostate\nCancer so we're talking a lot about that why because if we can find them in early like this gentleman who Gleason six PSA prostate cancer stage T. one see then we have a higher chance of successful treatment of the goals prostate cancer treatment is to number one cure the man\nNumber to avoid radical surgery number three a void robotic surgery number\nFour keep the sex life number five keep the year and every life and how do we know a man is successfully treated or we treat the man for prostate cancer like sixty two year old man for children Gleason six PSA cancer well we follow that man and\nHis ... now zero so this is four years after treatment\nHe was treated here at thirty for Broadway recruited him all with outpatient therapy\nHad no radical surgery know robotic surgery is PSA is zero he's fully functional sex life works is urinary life works in these very\nHappy and that's the work that we do here at Radio City New York\nFor like about another man who is sixty two years old he's married with two children and he came he saw his primary doctor he saw his urologist and he saw another urologist who told him not to do anything so yeah the elevator PSA of eight and a half he has\nYour nation is frequent your nation nighttime examined dead was prostate is in large and\nWell why would someone tell it man not a treatment well okay you can say the treatment is so terrible like radical surgery robotic surgery were so many men have complications from\nRadical robotic surgery that's why we don't do radical robotic surgery that's why we do outpatient therapy was focused treatment\nOn the prostate and this man came with us this man his urologist told not to have treatment maybe they're all just as my favorite because if he had done surgery on this man most likely the surgeon would've taken away has sex life and urine or your life whereas with us\nMost likely he will be cancer free and most likely he will\nHave good sexual function and urinary function and that's the work we do so it makes a big difference where a person has\nTheir treatment this fan came to us and he's now in remission doing well pleased with therapy though is to go to interesting woman who's Ninety three years old she's widow she has one son she came with her son she had a cancer and the Sikh up\nShe had abdominal pain she had a CAT scan her doctors are too afraid to do colonoscopy because of her age or a medical condition she's a knee and make this cancer the colon was causing her to lose bloodshed abdominal

terror\nAnd she has this cancer in the terminal\nUm well we treated her and we treat many people as many people that we treat that can't get treatment elsewhere she went to a super duper hospital they told her to go home to you know what because they couldn't do surgery well there's other treatments besides surgery besides chemotherapy there's plenty of people who\nCan't have surgery or don't want to have surgery and chemotherapy\nBy itself would not offer this woman very much she's Ninety three years old chemotherapy might work for a few months and the cancer will come rip roaring back\nSurgery most likely she wouldn't survive\nSurgery that's why the surgeons refused to operate on her that's while he's at our home to or you know why they sent her home\nDiagnosing the people on the phone so are the radio so I just tell you what the options are to to get a real consultation\nNeeded to come in here why us versus proton beams because number one proton beams been around for

we have a lot more data afternoon thousands of people with skin cancer people want the best data proton beam do although the physics aren't really worked out of it and a\nProton beam I remember the whole reason for proton beams to spare the skin right is to avoid X. it does tend to how to put the dos and I'm In my view there's not much reason to approach on being for any reason\nFor any patient

the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting that left eleven dead yesterday ABC there and get turkey has more\nA hair saliva or by energetic scans\nBlood work a also personalization with DNA to make sure you're able to keep it off a so it's it's it's completely for you which for each individual and that's that's why you know we got these some tremendous results twenty five to forty five pounds a and and that's what we typically see\n[noise] um it it it's very interesting because we've had so many um we we kind of go in waves in terms of like the\nProfessions that we see in the office which is really weird I Know it sounds weird but it kind of makes sense now that I Know more information about it so this week we had\nJust won a year off the cops so now it's ... yeah I Do a lot of the ... well you know you can remember I set up front right I\nI'm generally at our reception desk all day long so I hear and see so many different things and I really try to tune in and listen to what a lot of our patients are saying when they think nobody's actually listening to them right\nAnd so this week we had um a number of commercial drivers and our um you know\nFront desk waiting area and so some of them were current patients some of them were new patients that were just about to get started some of them were just new patients that had just heard the goal over we're about to get into a consultation\nUm and what was interesting was that I didn't realize that commercial drivers have a whole set of rules about you know that the health that they have to actually uh being or achieve\nShirt with our job driving a big old my strong right it's like if you you know you would think ... or policemen\nI I don't know like a\nA doctor should have certain standards that they're you know\nTough guys are driving by a giant truck craze so there for hours and hours on end and it takes a ton of a door and\nRight but you usually don't think of that right so what was interesting is that one of our patients who was saying these checkups right so one of the patients that was sitting in our waiting room I'm struck up a conversation with somebody who had\nJust been in the consultation is actually signing up and the gentleman said to him you know does this program work and um the other gentleman said you\nKnow yes actually it does and um\nYou know a new patient started asking him some questions and I'm\nThe existing patient said um you know the reason I came here is because I had this a checkup that my job prescribed and I was basically told that if I didn't lose the weight because I was borderline diabetic borderline you know very high blood pressure cholesterol issues\nOr if I didn't lose the weight and if my health and improve I was basically out of a job\nFor and no it's not and so what I found to be amazing is that the potential patient turned him and said oh my God he said that's what I Do for a living as well\nAnd they exist to Haitians looked at him and he said\nAnd you haven't had that check up yet and the guy said no I haven't but I'm sure glad I'm Talking to you about it [laughter] so yeah so I\nDidn't realize this but you know lo and behold um our existing patient his name is Paul he said I don't recall the new patients name So Paul said to him you know this diet does work and it really is amazing it's really easy to follow\n'em and it's really easy to follow the blow while I'm On the road when she never thought that he'd be able to actually do a diet because of that because you know these guys are always on the road down the road for hours and hours there's not a lot of stops of places to eat it and if there are\nThey usually extremely unhealthy job so he says that he's actually been able to find really healthy options and all of these places that he used to stop and now he's eating according to the islands of the program he's almost done with the program by the way I think he's down close to like\nThirty seven pounds of forty days we are that's all he really had to lose\n'em and under some tremendous amount of he's taller guy so he carries it well but clearly the health issues where are the more concerning others um and you know just going back to my original point of the beginning of the show is that really what we're doing is we're changing people's lives in terms of\nHealth and that's kind of the most important thing here I'm right because with all that fat laws come so many different benefits as far as\nGetting you better feeling a better so\nTalking about the commercial drivers a cake or who you actually saw this week is done with his two sixty day rounds and he is down a hundred and twenty pounds I'm also commercial driver [noise] um\nAnd he says that you know he he always meet up with some of his friends along the way along his route that he does and he says people don't recognize them anymore and I was like well listen a hundred and twenty pounds is you know\nIt isn't just Enron case six year olds that are ... to to you to succeed a round of the program\nWould he be the he would be the big you know he would end up now for the for the guy who was first before you already area beat him while we had somebody who lost sixty nine and six they also I Know that but I'm saying for the week yeah ... he's pretty high up there for\nA hundred and twenty you know basically a hundred and twenty pounds and a hundred and twenty days left right it is up in the middle east up in the middle reset\nAnd he'd already I caught up what's really cool about his story is you know\nThe great between their grounds you didn't put anything on because now you give them the tools that your weight goes up by two pounds here's what you do here's how you knock it off he's got the DNA test he's got the blood work to help keep his body balance he's got the personal I supplements and he's not going to you're not going to put it back or\nHe he couldn't figure out how to get enough calories to eat while he was on break from the two six today round\nHe couldn't eat enough food sickly\nAh that's kind of where that was that but the interesting thing about his story is that what he said to me was his doctor kept track of his blood work the whole entire time that he was on the program and he said that each and every time that he did blood it just kept getting better and better and better and and he\nWas saying that before he started the program he was basically a\nPre diabetic they wanted him to start taking seven hundred milligrams of met foreman and just\nYou know it's really luckier than his weight I Know you really are at a not a very lucky is very very lucky\nBut he told me that I'm at the end of the day all of the medications that they wanted to put him on would have cost him out of pocket seven hundred dollars a month well okay let's calculate that I Believe\nThis gentleman is in his late fifties I'm not a hundred percent certain of his age levels him he weighs he lives until he's eighty so let's let's give them another twenty five years ... says twenty five years times twelve times seven hundred knows ... and that's out\nOf pocket that's insurance not covering answer and you know what we don't even know if these medications are going to be able to control whatever he had going on so that was actually what he focused on since you understand how much\nMoney I'm saying I'm like I Do I I that's just mind boggling numbers hundred and twenty pounds a hundred and twenty days and we've saved a potential seven hundred dollars a month for the rest of the line who wants\nTo take those medications even if there were for granted if the insurance covered all over the who wants to go on and you know most of these things that people are taking the medications for for for obesity they're really you know every doctor or a ...\nIt's ... it's almost soldiers are curable because they're all affected from what I'd rather is that all told her all the result of of of being overweight and that's and that's really tremendous so\nThese are these are typical result twenty five to thirty five pounds for women as what we see thirty five to forty five ... pounds per month when that's only in forty days it's without ... without hormones without surgery it's all natural solutions supplements that are personalized each individual\nFrom uh from blood work for Harris saliva by our buyer energetic scams\nDNA testing as well a beginning and end and and really you know that's what makes a girl with the personalization of how to how to balance each how to help out each person's body when they come in and so you can call one eight five five five and Jay diet when I started five five six five\nThirty four thirty eight for that to the schedule an appointment and one of our offices and we're all excited about ... about prince and opening a lot of people coming up\nFrom South Jersey starting when he can open when are you gonna open so we're finally opened up a place down there were I see patients there and it's really great so twenty five to forty five pounds is typically what we see a little bit more on the men's side sometimes and a twenty five five five injury diet and like when you're calling and make a phone call when you're calling please remember the people on the phone [noise]\nThey're just there to schedule the appointment they really don't have the answer to your questions most of them are just turned ...\nYou just shrink and you look great because you were making sure staying hydrated and increasing your water and your how your body's absorbing water [noise] so she says she lost twenty twenty two pressures I Swear I I look I I Am wearing I can get into clothing now that I I couldn't get in when I was thirty thirty five pounds\nLighter a and so she's just she says she came in she's super thrilled I'm going on a monster shopping spree she says this is her husband is going to kill her as you go on a shopping spree and put what's great you know she came and she had a bunch of the history of of major digestive issues\nWhen she was coming in and you know every time she ate she says within like\nTwenty minutes to a half an hour she's gassy she's bloated a she and she feels that way for hours this was this was beforehand and we you know she came in\nTo the ... weather obviously a we looked at a bunch of different things\nUh we did the hair saliva or with the energetic a buyer and drug testing we took a look at some blood work that she brought in we were able to do a a will give her we gave her a toxicity support a digestive support or minerals and vitamins support and so boom twenty to twenty two pounds\nI'm In forty days which is fantastic a little bit below what we typically see but still you know like she said she looks like she's thirty pounds\nShe looks like she's thirty pounds a lighter she looks and feels that she's thirty pounds lighter and\nYou know she's going to go spend some money on it get you know get the help the economy a little bit of a shopping the shot shot in the arms of the economy a little bit get herself shopping at a bind some clothing and uh it's always good right she looks like she's thirty pounds a lighter she looks and feels that she's thirty pounds lighter and\nYou know she couldn't go spend some money on somebody to get you know get the help the economy a little bit inaccurate shopping the shot shot in the arms of the economy a little bit get herself shopping get are buying some clothing and that's always good right\nOutta all good I you know I think that there is nothing that feels or um that feels better than\nI'm buying yourself a pair of jeans at our size or to size or smaller than you were only like hello twenty thirty forty days ago or so in my opinion it's like you know for a man who is tightening has dealt thought All right and and you get to see that mark\nAnd that he's had there for like whatever eight years and now that markets you know now that belt is on a different a whole and I think that that's I think that's really special and I think um\n[noise] and I think what really matters is the fact that\nYou know every single day you're accountable to yourself now and you know what you're doing and you know and\nYou kinda feel comfortable in your own skin now you're no longer afraid of the snack attack you're no longer you know having these cravings and we had Stella call the office this week so she's been off the program for three years by the way\nI'm and she I think she lost about thirty seven pounds three years ago and she is sixty four now so she was sixty one I'm\nThree years ago obviously she called because she wanted to know about the DNA testing 'cause that was really interesting to her and also because she gets the complimentary hands saliva evaluation every three months she comes in and she does\nThat and she gets the appropriate ... by told her about that too but so one of the things that she said to me that really changed her after the program was that she's no longer\nAfraid to walk into a supermarket she's no longer afraid to go sit down at a restaurant because she knows exactly where she's at is you know the ... she's completely content in control your ... and she said that this wasn't the situation three years ago she had completely lost control\nAnd that's a scary place to be at and I'm really proud of her that three years later and she said to me\nShe goes you know it's a daily thing for me now she says I wake up in the morning and I think about what my days going to look like and then my second thought is what my days going to look like food wise\nAnd it's an interesting thing right we wake up in the morning we think about what we have to do during the day but why not think about what it is that we're going to eat during the day or ... you know that's what fuels our body that's what determines how much energy we had that really\nDetermines how we're going to feel for the next morning right but a lot of people don't think of it that way but she says\nYou know it completely shifted her paradigm a sink like she's completely on a different wavelength in terms of what happens to her every single morning she has a routine\nYou know she knows what she's going to eat she knows what she's gonna do that day and that really helps her in three years later all the way to sell off and she's doing great you\nKnow it's great it's great and then that's what you do you empower people when you have control your empowered and you you can handle it and you know what to do and and so each person is given\nTen different ways to get the weight off her each person has a weight set point reset each person or ... is given a DNA test that tells them all these different things for over forty different metabolic factors and so that's what it's all about without any shots and hormones in surgery we typically see twenty five\nTo thirty five pounds in women are we typically see thirty five to forty five\nPlus pounds with men and that's mostly fat that's without shots without hormones without\nSurgery or without hungrier eating natural food uh you're you're you're not hungry in the program because your body is burning so much toxic side for fuel\nThat were just basically rerouting what your body's using for fuel and then we were out back and and so it's really monitor you every every day you have my personal cell phone number my email address so nobody's ever\nAlone a on this process\nIt's really easy you just got A N J died ... to get started going to end J died dot com normally Ninety nine dollars but as a radio listener a right now you go online is twenty seven dollars for a full body composition analysis [noise]\nUh where we take over and take a look at a bunch of different things we do a full consultation body composition analysis we look at not only weight\nBut we're also looking at a visceral fat we're also looking at your basic metabolic rate and so we're also looking at daily caloric intake and so the difference in those two numbers is important because\nYou know if you if your if your body's functioning your basic metabolic rate let's say you're burning off Seventeen hundred calories a day but your body's function like you're taken in thirty five twenty five hundred calories a three thousand calories a day and you're wondering why you can't lose weight that might give you an answer\nAnd so we take a look at metabolic Lee high your body is working and so then we we then do hair and saliva we then do\nThe buyer and genetic testing uh when you started to go forward with the program we didn't take a look at blood work that people bring in\nTo see what supplementation to support them with and we look at it a functional level uh we just tighten up those parameters a little bit so it or you know if you keep the parameters within a functional level you have to worry less about being diagnosed with big without the ... by those problems getting worse and being ... God Forbid diagnosed with something so\nWho want to keep it in a healthy range and keep your body balance and if we're able to do that and there's less chance you know upstream downstream if you if upstream you're able to keep the body balance then you have to worry about less disease downstream kind so that's n J died dot com\nOr for twenty seven dollars for a a only twenty seven dollars for a full body composition now so send us an accomplice session with us where we can get started\nGets you going on the way to help you if you want to call you can ah ... the number is one of eight five

area\nOr New Jersey New York city queens Brooklyn Long Island and now west Chester\nHuh that's great and so you can come in scheduled appointment or you can make a phone call just remember when you are calling that the folks on the phone are only there to schedule appointments\nOr they're not there to put you on the weight loss program or get mad at the grade no no that yeah they they get mad at

we'll give you all the answers about the program and so forth um\nSo bill came in this week and it's really you know it's amazing when you when you\nHave a lot of extra fat in general and a lot of visceral fat that's decide on the organs\nTry levels of this real fat really cause inflammation in the body inflammation in the body will cause is one of the causes to all the different chronic\nNo systemic sort of aches and pains so it's not just one area that hurts the systematic shoulders and elbows in choosing the joints and that's why\nAre people that are obese we're more more up for ... susceptible to arthritis and things like that and just generalize information the body and so\nYou know bill comes in and you got all these different aches and pains\nA huge as place got high blood pressure or he's one of these guys you know the typical belly you know the body stores fat in different areas to protect their is because of different hormonal disruptions generally in those areas so\nIf you get somebody with like that you know floppy overhanging belly fat you're looking at a dream knows if you're looking at that that apple shape you're looking at a thyroid if you're looking at\nA um a pear shape are you looking at reproductive Oregon imbalances so bill Scott does belly you know he's got one of these one of these skinny guys with a big old belly like everything's in the belly\nHis hormones are off his body is off nothing's working the right way\nAnd when he came in and he says you know I just got his friend did the program it's just I just got to get the same results I got to do something there's no way I can live like this and so they gave him you know did did all the personalization processes here gave them a train all support game reproductive a reconstructed Oregon support all natural type of supplementation\nA personalized for him and so boom forty eight pounds got 'em going fifty days look vetoes back no more crashing in the middle of the day is barely even thinks about coffee anymore just has like a little cup in the morning\nAnd and he's rock rock and roll and and and so they are sort of it's all about so [laughter]\nYou know thirty five to forty five plus as what we see with men typically and only forty days twenty five to thirty five\nWith women typically a ... and only forty days and they all natural there's no everything is either\nA base mineral based ... supplements that are personalized for each individual based on either by energetic testing or or blood work or DNA as well uh and so without any shots without hormones last surgery\nPeople are hungry in the program because their body would just turn their body into fat burning machine so we we're out what your body is using for fuel you're going to burn at least\nTwo thousand calories of your own facts for fuel you can't be hungry and and so uh it only forty days twenty five to forty five plus pounds across the board\nAnd so that's an J died dot com right now it's normally Ninety nine dollars as a radio list are only twenty seven dollars gets your body composition analysis\nBut an appointment with us uh where we take a look at not only your weight and you could give us out on the phone I mean we look at your way we look at body fat percentage really look at body water percentage we look at this real fat rating I'm against folks if your if your your your body is water is lawyer visceral fat as high\nYou know when you get high visceral fat that facade on the organs and makes you more insulin resistant when your body becomes more insulin resistant away your body metabolize is a sugar for fuel is instead of bringing into the cell and burning it your body is taking in turning into fat and storing it\nAnd that's going to make your metabolism work much slower on top of that if you've done a ton of weight yo yo dieting losing a ton of water too quickly\nA like a lot of times with women that we see your water levels are going to be off if your water levels are often you got high visceral fat you're ... you're in you're forty years old you're metabolisms function like a seven year old you're not going to\nBe able to lose weight and there's no way to do it\nSo we're gonna have to take a look at all those things and and then and then personalized these the solutions that supplements are the the for each individual get your body and the fat burning that's one of the things that we look at it as mineral balance metabolic gauge daily caloric intake ah and so\nIt you know that's that's how we do it on the front end and then and then we

quadruple bypass eight years ago I remember everybody I Know that I'm just saying you know I just think if you don't want to remind you sell Jared and had a quadruple bypass eight years ago and\nClearly not the most ideal situation and really and instead as and working and you know getting fatter and working at\nAnd you know exercising more and feeling life like someone up there again on a second chance on life he went and they completely other way and started to eat really unhealthy he really felt it was so unfair that this happened to him and he had this quite triple bypass\nThese are the things and so he kind of really started to um go downhill and um so he had a checkup with his cardiologist and he basically told him that um [noise] you know a piece heading down a not such a good road and so\nYeah so he gets decided his girlfriend I think finally told him that you know beat you kind of either need to get with the program or sort of you know get out because you know she wasn't going to go through this again what happened eight years ago and and so he came in and [noise]\nYou know this was a guy who was getting every one of his meals and snacks um\nTake out you know so he was basically running in wherever eating whatever um and um\n[noise] you know he used to be a runner he used to be you know all these things to do a kind of sports so anyway lo and behold a forty days later\nHe lost a forty nine pounds swell and uh we are back to running we are back to having known any pain no ankle pain or we are no longer getting every meal out which is really really cool because he says he\nIs my favorite part he gets to spend more money and buying clothes and buying clothes first girlfriend presents for her so you know\nIt's always my favorite part shopping is kid health thing and you know he ... and the best part is is that he's no longer depressed because he actually started to feel so much better once the weight started to come up that he realized\nThat his life wasn't over you know the heart was fixed you know the bypass worked eight years ago so you know here we go it's like a second chance in life so he really thankful he cooks now um you know he says I Can't believe how much money I'm saving by not\nEating out every meal and you know\nYou're getting it sounds like somebody who's sponsoring like a woman's group is sponsoring you have the one\nThat somebody may you had you had the one woman on you you want to get her ... her Medicare to every day they massage their day\nThis woman's support groups or the I'm sure there is this when you're talking about the fact that she uh what she's spending money on her getting ... money and you're running on her yes but\nWhy there should be you know we should listen I I you know it's all good I mean I\nDo I feel like there should be like malls that are sponsoring may with the amount of things were telling people to do in terms of getting more clothing now I mean how that all the mail nations we\nGot three may I Am sure the guys are all three of its great little less than what about you don't have to get there so you made the switch or expensive you know you're twenty five thirty forty fifty pounds man you you need a new\nShirts new tighten ties maybe not new shorts new pants delta everything they're more expensive than female clothing you know about that I'm I'm tell me you know well maybe not nobody ever heard of a sudden it's all good but you know what speaking of new clothing Bob ... yeah\nSo this very important because he came to me to tell me that\nHe went from a thirty six inch waist to thirty two inch waist and forty days Seventeen point five what how much he went from a thirty six inch waist to uh thirty two inch waist in forty days\nHis neck size went too far from Seventeen point five to Fifteen point five and he says that these were his sizes Twenty years ago and what's really funny is that for how has he puts on his old dress shirts and he says they look like how stresses now\nHe makes fun of himself at every couple of days he'll put on one of the shirts and he'll like our on our on our out yeah of\nCourse they did they said he keeps one because it keeps on and there's it's a mental thing he he puts it says\nI look like I'm wearing ... with that I might with our rights motivation now I Know I Know that so anyway and J died dot\nCom for only

you know I heard about ... number your phone number but I got a hold of it and I called up immediately after I left the hospital and uh I was\nGoing on over an independent cancer treatment at thirty eighth on Broadway with the other hospital charged much more of an action is super sections of chaos how they're coaching six I think when you come into our office does everyone low you name\nIt quite so I'm just about\nThat I that matter of fact that we strange Christmas gifts from some of us [laughter] but uh they are are there are a fantastic staff\nSo tell us what it's like so you play to

Donald tremendous tremendous best Iran is where you're at you and and that he wants right because you you\nAnd you use new wicked recommended some care for me and we went along with it at work\nAnd I'm I'm urinating only and\nSo what it's like let people know what is it like to get radio surgery\nFor bladder cancer\nIs only walk into the pleasant office [noise] uh it's very very uh medical and very very subtle and are there are people here are mostly a accommodating and\nThe ... if some of the all of our have I'm hanging from the highest yard arm and the British have it you\nKnow the the the the ... or the or the patients that she will show all the other two very ...\nVery congenial and subsequently immediate building went Lederman and Amy skilled structure your treatment and they go into the fray she measured up for your for your for your ... but they're\nA threat is surgery\nYou yes we should get your your your um [noise] he'll frame frame made up\nCall you and me to tell people was alive because a pain for certain ... nothing ... nothing\nTouches you at all and it's like getting in the best way I can describe it as like getting an X ray [laughter] ha if you've ever had in the next day and I'm sure everyone did some point in their life\nI already but some people have I Can't believe that that would tell people is a pain but not nothing\nLife and so he sent this Broadway actor to us for treatment and we talked about all the options of course you talked about surgery and radical surgery and robotic surgery and proton beam and he saw our data actually you can call her office and get a booklet\nYourself if you'd call our office at the two one two choices to two to four six four to three seven go see the comparison data well this man saw the comparison data his surgeon sell them\nTo us ... when he saw the day that he was persuaded that each of our treatment and we started treating him and it was going very well everything was going very well then one day last year he came into our office and he says hide\nAnd then these collapsed in my arms it's a two hundred and twenty pound man collapsed in my arms and a cardiac arrest and well as you know or or a boutique cancer treatments center and everyone pretty much does everyone else and so we resuscitated they may have immediately and nine\nOne one came and he had a complete recovery it was really very dramatic and whenever\nI see him we talk about this collapse and his wife was right by them and she was speechless as you can imagine when her mainstay and our man and her husband and a lover collapsed in my arms and were ... and he is now suddenly back to normal after that cardiac arrest but\nHe had his radiation treatment that is PSA is zero he's in complete remission cancers gone the cardiac\nArrest as ancient history as happy as healthy as fully activities doing everything that he ever did\nThis so I'm sure he'll always remember\nUs not only for the successful tree what it was prostate cancer which ... says now's zero he had remembered Cleese and six PSA a prostate cancer within months ... says go down to zero and he'll remember most likely for that cardiac\nArrest the might not remember all the talk of other put his wife surely will and that's the kind of work that we do here at radio surgery New York talking about a woman who was eighty years old she is married with five children\nJust fine until two thousand twelve ... chest X ray she had a CAT scan shit a biopsy Paul on Long Island and then she was transferred than she had\nChemo and radiation for lung cancer and it worked for a while and then the cancer came back and she had more and more came ... years of chemo and the cancer kept growing the way it was a hundred and forty pounds she gained twenty pound shit pelvic fracture she was just a week from the chemo and shut hip pain from that and well she came to\nUs for treatment and she had this lung cancer which was for current after chemo the chemo was working the chemo was toxic she had a PET scan which showed a large mess with an SUV SUVs educational point\nWhich shows how much radioactive sugars picked up by like cancer or the pet scan showed a three by three centimeter mass so more than an inch about an inch and a quarter of an inch and a quarter and so she came to us she came to us because she her that she didn't need to\nHave chemo for the rest of her life and we talked about those little bit earlier in the show that people don't necessarily need chemo for the rest of their life a visceral when that came on the cancer was progressing in wasn't tolerated and so for so many reasons so many reasons\nWe were treating her for her cancer with five treatments outpatient therapy all pinpoint all non invasive well tell her to treatment and plus you came to us last year and she's now\nIn permission she's doing well a year later and that's the work that we do here at ... New York so it's another example of a lung cancer were chemo didn't work chemo wasn't tolerated and radio surgery work five shots ten minutes each call out patient know caught any no bleeding they'll cost a phobia of this\nIs the work that we do here at radio surgery new\nYork at thirty for Broadway or accept most insurance is Medicare\nMedicaid they were talking about a gentleman with prostate\nCancer is forty nine so younger than average average man with prostate cancer America's about sixty seven so he's Twenty years younger he's a black man I can tell you that there is more prostate cancer the black community one in six black men will get\nProstate cancer and one and twenty three will die of prostate cancer well he is a black man forty nine with\nProstate cancer two children he had a PSA that went up to five point seven six and a Gleason seven cancer and he came for treatment became for human because he did not want surgery he knows that with surgery for Gleason seven cancers success rate is sixty\nPercent with us it's Ninety percent he knows with us most likely he'll keep his sex life and his urinary life and that's indeed what happened\nHe came to us more than two years ago he is now cancer free his PSA is zero his sex life works is urinary life works and he is very happy so some other successful story of cancer treatment is ran\nBy young men with prostate cancer Gleason seven ... seven is how the cancer looks under the microscope his PSA which is a blood test prosthetic specific antigens has descended to zero he's working full time no side effects sex life for\nA year in her life works and he's happy and he's satisfied don't talk about a man who Seventy three years old who was Indian born he is divorce with two kids and he had a PSA of nine point nine five and seven and he went to another hospital he didn't come\nTo us he went to another hospital and he had the treatment which doesn't work and the cancer just kept on spreading and spreading and that's such a difference\nAnd why do I tell you the story with number one it's true story and number two it's sort of point to understand that all treatment is not the same there's differences in treatment even places that say they do the same work as a way to look on page two of our prostate booklet and you'll see that\nThe results are different our results are superior\nWhy well it's just like an artist at a paintbrush\nOr a sculptor each\nDoctor does different work and if you compare our work to other big hospitals in New York City you'll see better results that's better results compared us versus robotic surgery us versus open surgery versus standard radiation us versus the human season radiation you'll see the difference\nThat's why urged people have a cancer to give us a call or two and two choices and see the different just man is now come to us because\nThe cancers traveled as soon as opposed to because his first treatment wasn't successful so it's very important\nTo get the best possible treatment first and that's why so many people come to Thirteen any for Broadway Broadway on thirtieth street in Manhattan where take a short break we'll be right

... the surge and the ... and told him he had a radical surgery and the surge and put them in the hospital they open them up and didn't radical surgery with robotic and his PSA was twelve and they could have known that most likely the surgery would fail\nThat's open surgeon robotic surgery fail so commonly and this would happen to him he had radical surgeries since the surgery he's been leaking ... surgeries been wearing a diverse since the surgeries and put a nice thought has another action since that surgery and now\nThe TSA the measurement of the cancer is rising so the cancer is back he's had complications with sexual impotence with urinary incontinence nothing worked the radical was a disaster at one of the biggest hospitals and why are we talking about it well so many men think\nMaybe they have they ever hear about the treatment options maybe they're just go to the surgeon ... says you have to have a cut out and they believe it but you don't have\nTo believe it you can come to Thirteen any for Broadway and get a second opinion we're not afraid about talking about surgery or robotic surgery or radical surgery or even give you the day that will give you their data and

inferior\nThe complication rates are higher why would anyone do that I just don't understand it I Would urge people to lease to talk about the options and I know it's very hard for\nCertain things to talk about non invasive options are afraid to talk about non invasive options without big operations without robotic surgery patients will run away plus what happens anyway that's why so many people come to Thirteen Eddie for Broadway where we accept insurance is most insurances Medicare Medicaid this is the work that\nWe do with thousands of men treated that's why so many men come to Thirteen eighty four Broadway for prostate cancer because they don't want to be like this man\nWho was left impotence directions leaking you're wearing a diaper for years and now with the cancer coming back I was talking about a\nGentleman who had radiation I treated myself Twenty years ago this is a man born in Uzbekistan he is sixty six years old I treated them Twenty years ago with our particular
