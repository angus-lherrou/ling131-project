exaggeration to make a point I really do believe that we're talking about mainstream mental and psychological disorders becoming standard operating procedure politics the American but there's no other way to explain this\n[noise]\nNow folks to show you how deranged this is I have and the stack today I have um two maybe three what I Would call teachable moment things they are opinion pieces that appear in the mainstream media both today and over the weekend\nThey are related to cap and all but they\nThe pieces attempt to say what all of this means for America and of course for the for the Democrats\nAnd much of it is I mean I just saw dead wrong in the simple\nRecitation of the facts of all this does it stuns me\nThat people on the left cannot even face the facts of this and react to them they continue to react to what they think\nHas gone on based on how they feel and these are some of the standard bearers of American journalism on the left\nOne of them is or isn't John Harris at Politico one of the founders Democrats fear of there are a wet rag party you know what this piece was about this piece was about how the Democrats get their rear end handed to them every time because no\nThe Democrats are a bunch of cowards the Democrats have no guts the Democrats are a bunch of paper tigers and Democrats let Republicans walk all over\nNow how many of you think it's the exact opposite this is pretty common to there are a lot of people on both sides who think their own side as a bunch of war says\nBut I don't know how anybody paying attention on the left can think that

happy\nNow when the baby mix and best of itself from the diaper yeah there's anger but you get my you get my point here the natural state of a human being is not rage an anger the natural state of humanity is not that as a ... by the Democratic party get that has become the Democrat Party I firmly believe and I said this Friday\nAnd even if it makes me sound naive I'm going to say it again in a same world\nIn a decent and just country the actions of the American left just in the past two years would result in the biggest landslide electoral defeat of the Democratic party's lifetime\n\nThere is not a single thing in a decent and just country that the American left at the Democratic party has done by virtue of its behavior that warrants\nA stamp of approval of winning elections yet they win them within their closely contained bases districts and states there on claims\nWhich is actually a very small portion of this country in terms of square mileage\nPopulation centers of the big cities on the coast and then the great lakes\nHere's the\nIt's not a dirty little secret but it's something don't always keep in mind\nAnd frankly I was happy watching the news over the weekend to hear a number of people on our side making this point because it's a point that's been true for as long as I have been doing this program and longer we say constantly to the left uses the courts\nTo act as insurance policies against losing elections that the left cannot\nSucceed in implementing his agenda nationwide except to be the courts and that's why the courts are so important and that's why the courts a liberal Democrat presidents have stacked as many of the federal courts federal appellate courts as they can with leftist activist judges not just\nPlain old civil judges rule of law\nAnd there is a dirty little secret behind this folks\n\nThe Democrats simply do not have the numbers in the country to pass their agenda in Congress they do not have the numbers\nImplemented and pass their agenda legislatively in other words they cannot get their beliefs their ideas past as the laws in America they have to rely on activists jobs just to do it\nNow you might miss it was Russia or Jews or before nothing new there well there's nothing new about it but particularly its its relevance its power\nAnd it's important has been magnified in this current Kevin a fight and explains in one reason why why this is so important to them they are in their minds on the verge of losing the highest court in the land\nThere on the verge of losing the ability to have the highest court in the land a rubber stamp their policies if you go down and look at leftist issue by leftist issue\nThat these issues that have royals our culture turned our culture upside down you won't find any of them that have been passed into law by the elected representatives of the people except for Obamacare\n\nAbortion the American people haven't decided that\nThat was forced on the American people by a leftist activist judge and a majority on the Supreme Court\nAnd any other number of cultural issues which are designed to strike out at this white power structure that the left so despise isn't so hates that they cannot beat they cannot win they cannot do this legislatively\nThey need\nActivist judges dominating courts in order for what they want to be forced on every that this is the point what they believe in the idea is they have must be forced on the rest of the bus if they are to happen\n\nThey cannot withstand legislative tests\nIt's the same reason why every Democrat president up to and including Obama never tells the truth about their agenda they would not win the presidency if they were honest about that which they intended to do\n\nIf Obama had been honest about the way Obamacare was going to end up and how much it was going to cost you and how much you deserve to pay for it because you've been getting a free ride all these years if Obama had been anywhere near honest about that or what climate change was going to cost you anything he would have never been elected\nAnd no Democrat ever wouldn't be they routinely soft sell what they really believe they do not come out an advocate socialism or communism in presidential campaigns they will do it as as a case of a Alexandria or gifts so Cortez\nWho's lunacy on display in a left his district of New York is harmless but you put her on a national ticket somewhere and she kills it\nWe have not lost this country and we have not lost that which can be traced directly back to our founding but the left once everybody to believe that that sounding and everything traceable back to it is unjust unfair\nThat it is also racist and sexist and besides you they're sticking all these other things that are despicable we must do away with it\nThey don't have the ability to to win any of these issues legislatively are you left\nUs you can get mad at me all you want out there but you cannot reveal\nThis every thing they want\nEverything they have achieved outside of Obamacare has been forced\nOn the country the country has been bludgeon into accepting it\n\nThe country has been bludgeoned into looking the other way and if you don't look the other way and if you find it then what do they do they sue you\nThey try to ruin you or they bully you or they harass you or what have you this is not the behavior that does when things legislatively and yet the Democrats firmly believe that all of this\nIs going to lead to this giant ... blue wave and I don't care even today\nThere are links all over the Drudge Report where if you click on them you're going to find a story saying yeah it's over Democrats when and when big and even the Republicans think so\nA P has them Reuters has some\nNew York times CNN doesn't matter where you go there's always going to be a story where Republicans angry as over the Republican is deathly afraid Republican scared to death no way they can resist the coming blue wave\nSorry don't buy it\nMay happen I don't buy it\nI don't trust anything I say on the news anymore and I certainly don't trust the bunch of polling data\nGiven what\nFallacies existed in both the news and

capital a Kevin are being on the court simply because of the shift in the courts that it's represents\n\nBuddies undeniable folks it's factual it's right in front of us they have not been able\nTo succeed\nImplementing the leftist socialist communist agenda via the United States Congress\nThey can do it in their state legislatures I give you some places like California and so forth they haven't

the left is asking everybody [noise] to believe [noise]\nFolks I I'm I'm telling you these kids that have now become adults but maintain this\nAdolescent degree of range psychological disorders and

exaggerating this is what they're teaching and this is what these young people believe\n\nThe audio soundbites we've talked about this woman before Rebecca Traister she was on C. span two on Saturday\nSaturday show called afterwards what does this she was running for attorney general or is an attorney general and she said something outrageously stupid that we've highlighted here and I forgot what it is but it's in the Alexandria Ocasio Cortez\nFame and it just it it just after nine stupid I Wish I could remember it it's in our show archives but this is the first I think maybe we've had a soundbite heard before but this is\nAn appearance about a book that she has written called good and mad the revolutionary power of women's anger\nAnd the host of the CSPAN afterwards show is Rutgers University women's in gender studies professor Brittany Cooper\nQuestion if the devastating to me that if a white women cannot have a public life private life professional life or even protest in what are we to do\nLet me read that question again it feels devastating to me\nThat if white women cannot have a public life for private life professional life or in protest then what are we to do\nAnd here is\nThe brilliant answer from Rebecca Traister\nAre we angry that it has to be white women before we take they started seriously or\nI think it's an can we also acknowledge that we need to wake the white women and if their power their products no power can be useful in revealing the degree to which women are still oppressed\nThen in fact this strategically necessary and this goes back to the question do we need white women question at every candidate\nIt's an electoral question every candidate needs to ask do we need white women [noise]\nNow this wouldn't be happening if it hadn't been for the realization that a lot of white women supported Kavanaugh and I don't know if it was so much that white women supporting Kavanaugh is that they were ... it it it scared to death at what they saw being set up\nAgainst men\nThey have sons they have brothers and anybody with half a brain watching what went on the last two weeks would have to have been blind to see the Democratic party had a line itself in such a way\nThat men were all told Matt Dick clay guilty simply because they exist\nSimply because they are capable\nIn fact [noise] let's see there's actually a story with that exact point made the here and I think I moved to the bottom of the stack\nBut it is it is a woman making the point that Kavanaugh is as good as guilty because he could have done it\nAnd he could have done it because he's a man\nHe could have done it because he has male\nGenitalia that's all this woman in this story requires to believe ball Z forward that Kevin ... could have done it well if you're old woman with the sons and a husband that you love and some brothers and you're watching this you wouldn't miss\nTo the railing the nomination anyway\nDerek and hazel in Pennsylvania you are up right to habeas are high\nA rush to begin to your show you are you at a record will question about the does the Democrats really believe in this this new tactic with the mob and amend the Democrats learning the urgency they become a political uncertainty and as you know when I started to learn to feed\nIt they just change tactics\nThe new tactic um you know they employed with a judge Kavanaugh with Christine balls before they had a two for they had someone that not only educates argued\nThat someone that was going to put on a suicide vest for him so I just think that this is the new battlefront and thankfully we have Trump who cannot has put some ... on the spine of Republicans\nA ... true true but maybe I'm maybe I'm Still a for trying to force this issue but let me just ask you point blank right since\nYou have talked to is willing to address the issue do you think that this insurgency as you've described it which is this behavior but just that we've seen the last two weeks do you think that kind of behavior which was\nWidely publicized well Democrats loved it the media loved it they tried to make heros out of these people they didn't try to hold them back\nWhere they want to disrupt the Senate vote they disrupted the Senate vote when they wanted to get in the halls of the Senate Russell office building they did so\nThey got an elevators they shouted these people down to the Democrats have not once called out that activity they've never once told outside their side to stand down do you think the American public watching that\nIs going to be turned off by it and want to vote against it or do you think the American public\nDoesn't care one way or the other end doesn't even really notice it [noise]\nI think it's largely going to be turned off but like you said they they've completely changed their base now they've given up on the working blue color class and they're now they're now trying their hand and see if they can somehow\nUm increase the numbers with women on this type of issues but I think largely that that the American people are going to be turned off\nAnd I I think it's all going to come down to a who who is able to get ... get out the vote in a month but that had\nWell my point twenty twenty\nLet me okay this is my I don't think given what we've seen the last two weeks among people in the public who watched it I don't think the Republicans need to do when he got out the vote this one is that\nIn my scene and just world the Democrats are just succeeded in getting Republican turnout larger than it's ever been for a mid term I Know I'm probably wrong about that but\nThat's how I look at it that's how it ought to be and I'm a king a book's title the way things ought to be an automated people were outraged by this it ought to be that people can't wait to punish this month just come for the way they have treated in this country the past two weeks alone\nThe Republicans are not have to spend the time getting out the vote based on this but I Know that's not the reality kind of frustrating to me but that's the case [noise] Democrats think they were going to have turned out here that dwarfs anything the Republicans have to show up on election Democrats think the whole country is except they really\nDon't they know they don't have enough Americans to win legislative battles but they think that\nThey're going to be able to put together enough people to dwarf whatever Republican turnout\nThere is and they've got new stories predicting that very thing so people are going to be reading it people going to be reading Republicans don't have a chance\nYou may replied\nNo I I agree and um I think they energy I think they energize the base and they did exactly what needed to be done and I think ... says the issue that you were speaking of a month or so ago that the the event\nHappy and the twenty nine days when it happened\nA true yeah that when I'm when I said the events that were going to shape the midterms hadn't happened uh thirty days ago I was exactly right and there are some people saying that this is going to be forgotten by the time the election comes around\nLot of people I saw him on Fox say a lot of learning pungent commentators oh this was going to be so old by then actually heard a couple of people say the things that people are going to vote on probably haven't happened yet I just have to chuckle\nUm\nSo I can I can see with the passage just be you cannot maintain this\nRiver passion for long nobody can welded but we're talking about I'm Talking about reasonable people I'm I'm I'm saying it's it's understandable to me that some passion on our side is going to fade there's still a month ago\nThe other side they had been shot but it's a bit since election night two thousand
