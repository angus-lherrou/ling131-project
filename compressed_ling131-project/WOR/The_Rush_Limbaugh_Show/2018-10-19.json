before that even so ah but hey I've got a theory about this caravan\nNo last two years there's only one\nThing that the Democrats have won on and that's the wall and it as a Trump supporter every time the the issue of the law comes up I get aggravated that it's something that they want on income Trump is caved on\nAnd I think that they've done that fit this time just to put an exclamation point on and to emphasize the Trump is not the winner that he says he is [noise]\nYou know that's an interesting thought ah that\nThat the idea to flood the border to demonstrate that Trump does not have the wall can't get a phone call maybe isn't going to get the wall so maybe people should abandon from do you think that would work\nWell it's not going to work on me but let me tell you as that as a Trump supporter that is the big thing that aggravates me every time he finds one of these uh one of these things to keep the government going that's got nothing in it\nBurns me up at all the time so are you are you a little concerned that Trump is not really trying hard enough for the wall\nNow I I mean I've got a political theories as to why it hasn't happened yet maybe\nKnow Trump Trump I trust in Trump I I think he knows what he's doing a ... it could be that if he wants to do their next year right before the election to get everybody energized you know I don't know if he's a ... I all I can say these are smarter man than I Am\nA maybe but but I uh [noise]\nThey they seem to your theory is really quite insightful but it requires ... for the Democrats to pull it off\nA lot of Trump voters would have to believe he's not trying not trying hard to and for for the Democrats to capitalize on flooding was known with four thousand people that get into the country just to demonstrate the Trump pass a bill but Waldor Trump really can't stop these people that Trump therefore as ineffective\nThose people in order to abandon Trump would then have to conclude he's not really trying very hard I I don't even think they would have banned it in this soon yet over\nOh I don't I agree I I Know I'm not and I don't think most of them well but my question is what else do they got\nWell they've got my behavior a lunatic insane range\nRight but I mean on on Trump they got they got nothing they can they can put up the Trump hasn't been that he's promised and that's the that's the uh well that's exactly\nRight and right there that was four in the Trump supporters\nThat we haven't got the wall and we want it's not even you know that they aren't even begin to foundation yet and I think even started so it really aggravates me personally but this is something that they just keep the continuing resolution then leave things to keep the\nOh hey yeah I'm with you all up you're talking about all of the spending bills we've had new budget deals we've had continuing resolutions\nUm we Democrats can't stop anything in the house they can in the Senate what what here's what Trump's up against and I'm ... before you go to I don't want to get your thoughts on the Trump is still up against the fact that the leaders in both parties do not want that ball\n\nIt's not just the Democrats are opposing Trump on this it's all so there are a lot of Republicans don't want that wall because of Republican donors the Trump is still pretty much fighting the establishment the swamp on that\n[laughter] they they didn't want tax cuts either no they didn't and there's\nA lot of other things that they didn't want that he's he's a a that he's come through and he's twisted I'm a into doing what he wants\nOut many of them are in the ... I think many of the Republicans have blocked the idea that Trump was not to be gone or a before and now\nI I they\nAre so convinced the media will get rid of whoever the media targets I I think the first is certainly the first six to eight months of two thousand Seventeen Trump's first year I think the Republicans didn't do anything to help them because they didn't think he was going to survive\nAnd it it that's one of the reasons that the Obamacare repeal and replace didn't go anywhere because the Republicans just bought into the notion that most of the country actually hated Trump despite the fact that he had been elected\nAnd it's been a slow reversal than a slow realization on a part of the Republicans the Trump is the guy\nAnd the Trump is immensely popular particularly on the Republican side well we'll see if this story on the caravan turning around ... is there a palm pale left Saudi Arabia after having met when king Solomon and Mohammed bin saw him on the crown

way the Saudis are running Islam\n[noise] there's so much more to this then the drive by is are\nSuggesting because the drug by just want to use this to get Trump to show Trump's ineffectiveness or to show Trump puzzle lined with tyrants or whatever I by the way I was thinking there is one\nIssue that the media and Democrats you have to say had some success and that was the\nAllegation that the Trump Administration was separating children from their parents do border\nThat one had some legs that wouldn't work and that might be what this caravan\nAs about as a as well\nUh even though it was totally manufactured and made up it required the ignorance of a lot of people for it to a I don't mean stupidity\nIgnorance of a lot of people on the policy for that technique allegations separating families at the border to work to work so up next\nWhat I promised I was going to do in the first\nOne to ... ...\n... navy and we've transformed children's lives for Fifteen Years we build confidence develop critical thinking and Bush mass graves in scores whether\nNeeds to catch up or get ahead\nMagnesium methods provide the rock solid math foundation they need for today and for their future where\nThe story and math education and try more than half a million parents magnesium\nWe're changing lives through math schedule you know operation first visit to one of our nine hundred centers today at ... dot com and\nYour brain is an amazing thing but as you get older naturally begin to change causing a lack of sharp is or even trouble with recall thankfully the breakthrough in President how your brain and actually improve memory the secret is an ingredient originally discovered in jellyfish\nIs to demonstrate that Trump has not kept the promise on the wall is to demonstrate to Trump voters that despite all the talk he hasn't done a thing to stop illegal immigration\nAnd I think that's a pretty good theory\nAnd then you add in the chaos that will happen then you throw in the possibilities if they do get to the border and do cross but they wouldn't be separated and that's the one of all those issues and I went through the last hour that came and went and didn't have any glue or have any legs that went dead\n\nI'll never forget I was out in California I I I got so frustrated I was playing golf with a friend of mine was one of us\n\nAnd it was during the time to drive ... and the Democrats are making all this noise about how Trump separating families children from their mothers ads\nAnd this guy who's up to speed on this stuff's as Russia's pictures look past come on you know the pictures are made up this is ... the pictures look bad it looks really bad you don't you're not really fallen for just rushed the pictures look bad we've got to do something pictures but I thought oh my gosh\nI I was on the guy was smart enough to know that he was calling for a media\nTrick but at the pictures look what he was telling me was I Can't defend this I have people complained\nTo me about Trump's separating ... I can defend the pictures rushed the pictures\nSo that's the one thing that has had legs okay so the audio sound as if you're on hold if you're on the phone just be patient were coming to you ill quick oh this is the sound bite the hand of the interview last night uh that Fox has been playing all day long to get people's reaction\nI still say that I think there are things that have yet to happen that are going to determine\nOutcomes in some races the we don't know so it's still very hard to predict Kavanaugh feedback reaction was one hundred percent positive for Republicans or Democrats really blew that\nBut there's one or two three five of these things I don't know I just rely on hold which is again naive I don't have survey data I don't trust the it hasn't been the rights\nConsistently enough for me the people doing these surveys desperately want Trump goal and I don't know how they can take that out of their work I don't believe in pure objectivity is like this ... if I put on the spot production but we hold the house and we increase the Senate because I think that's just I think that's just I think the Democratic party deserves to lose\nIn the single biggest electoral landslide defeat in my lifetime meals they actions they've taken just in the last month\nOkay so that bite and bite\nLit up the Fox news channel the day our first stop is America's Newsroom bill hammer uh Anton ... Julie ... is co host out there talking to fame to Republicans strategic wrist Ed Rollins about my comment\nDams deserve to lose like he's bar act on that front half right on the other front I think will lead some Senate ... I think the house was very very much in jeopardy\nWhere you are not buying into his or her scenarios they'll hold it Rush Limbaugh said they ... they don't count votes like I Do I ran a congressional committee I've been doing it a long time\nThere are Fifteen states that are now gone nine of those are the open seats there's another twenty five to thirty that our our seats that are in play only about two or three Democrats ... totally on the defense everything has to go our way to basically break even\nLet me run through them I say this is the stuff that I'm going to be honest with you I I Do not get into this stuff this is this is wrong or stuff\nAnd to me this is totally abs and um the Emmy Emmy what what's the word personality or I mean there's just raw numbers are based on data that is the result of\nPolling and I know as well as anybody the polling sometimes is right sometimes it's wrong and and I just like I said in the bite\nI'm just suspicious of of polling units because I think I don't think these people can take their\nPassion and their desired out come out of their work and we know that they know we look in the presidential polls in two thousand six days I mean that those people were literally caught short there was no way Donald Trump is going to win it was just not possible Hillary was going to win an old landslide maybe not the biggest ever but Trump didn't have a prayer\nAnd there was one maybe two polls that showed that he was really in it and couldn't win at Rasmussen was one neighbor ignored\nAnd we've got a replay here's what informs me what makes me make these kind of productions is reality and as I also\nMentioned last night since rock Obama was elected in two thousand eight starting in two thousand ten including the midterms in two thousand twelve\nAnd the midterms in two thousand fourteen ... election of two thousand sixty and the Democratic party has lost twelve hundred seats\nThe trend is people voting out Democrats\nAnd that was happening while the Democrats were in the White House with Obama's there that could be a factor\nObama's gone so maybe the anti Democrat ... is not as high as it used to be when he was there because I Do believe he was a drag on the Democratic party but\nThen I asked myself what has happened in the last two years to make\nPeople all of a sudden want to elect Democrats again\n\nAs everybody's telling us is going to happen house is gone rushed the Senate yeah we're probably pick up a couple of houses gone [noise]\nAnd then they say because rush these house races have nothing to do with any of the way you're looking at this these are really local races and they are have have to deal with things that are not on any national radar will not true if these races are being nationalized by the various candidates\nHim [noise] but anyway what has happened to make people all of a sudden stop rejecting Democrats or the Democrats have they done at one eighty are made now performing and executing and behaving in ways that many people love them again\nWell no not in a just an insane world the Democrats aren't doing anything that would grow\nSupport their promoting rage and anger there promoting insanity and the lunatic behavior so then okay maybe as a Trump\nIs there's this much opposition to Trump from people who didn't care one way or the other two years ago has the media succeeded in creating a bunch of anti Trump sentiment\nIn a mid term turnout profile of voters well that would have to be what it is because the Democrats are not the Democrats say the\nJustice associated with the Democrats are doing as landslide defeat the Democrats are not responsible for anything good happening in this country\nAnd they're not even trying to be associated they don't even trying to claim credit for the economy they did for a couple of weeks they tried on Obama out rumor Obama's trying to say the economy was his well that went on for like a lead balloon\nAnd they died with it so they abandoned map and outside of that there hasn't been one attempt by the Democrats to associate themselves with anything good happening in America\nThey have in ... dad\nContinued to try and portray America as this unfair on just on deserve\nExceptional superpower\nThat discriminates that violates that ... that [noise] it's all negative so I'm just so where is this body of evidence that suggest\nThe trend of voting against Democrats is reversed again I acknowledge house races are\nNot the same as the presidential race with a national issues of national turnout on balance Shannon dream last night Fox News at night with Shannon Bram a wonders what my strategy was in predicting what I predict\nAlmost no polling shows that the Republicans are going to hold on to the house so where do you think that they're coming from with Rush Limbaugh what's the status\nI tend to agree with him um and I think what we could be saying is again the phenomenon that the Pony Express called the spiral of silence the shy from voted to the shy breakfast votes is the kind of people who know that it's not a dumb thing necessarily to support a particular view but secretly in the polling booth that's what they do\nThat Steve killed and who has a weekend show on Fox and he was instrumental in the Brexit vote in the u._k. and so a reason\nWhy one was Limbaugh getting this I mean there's not a single pulled out for the shows this happening precisely my\nPoint it's not a single poll not a single poll shows\nAnd so for this where to conclude and these people live and die by polls I'm telling you folks nine out of ten of people in D.C live and die by\nTheir gospel and I really think um if I Lived in Washington\nEach and every I I don't I couldn't I I wouldn't it be ostracized after not too

rare Michael I'm I was calling I just wanted to make a show that you actually um\nThat you did years and years ago that I thought it was just great it was probably one that shows that you ever had and was really simple and you basically had a roll call and people just called in with their you know start a business here you know small businesses and talk about\nHow they're doing you know when we're there are\nSo yeah yeah you don't we don't want that was you know you hear what you remember there was a a it was it was a period of time it was the early nineties folks\nAnd white collar employees were being laid off executives and magazines and newspapers like USA Today we're happy\nThey were running stories how wonderful it was that if people are getting laid off it's finally executives it's finally white collar\nPeople and not blue collar people [laughter] and so I decided we did three days of this we took calls\nA ... as as best we can manage it from people who had been laid off in their forties white collar managerial people laid off in their forties or earlier and asked what they were doing about it\nAnd that's what you remember hearing was all these people calling saying\nOne version or another of this is maybe the best thing that ever happened to me because I'm finally focused on doing things I Love I finally have because of necessity I'm I'm I'm looking at at the kind of job I've always wanted to have ...\nPutting a business or what have you and they were they were\nAmazingly upbeat and positive about what had happened to them not depressed and down the dumps or angry or anything about\nRight now it was it was just it was just I mean with my my second year in business\nSo I remember I remember it well 'cause there was working in January one or or or at least one maybe with another a rip off from that other three day things that that are right I just I just think it'd be a good a good thing to try you know what I mean just maybe on a friday instead of doing you know\nRepublican good Democrat bad stuff I mean which people the people would want buy 'em\nWell don't don't downplay the Republican or Democrat bad thing because there's still\nA whole slew of people who don't get how bad the Democrats are but let me ask you something do you think that people need to hear business people calling in describing how great the economy as before\nThey'll believe it is that why you want them to hear it so that they'll believe it or you ask what are you thinking some people don't believe it or doubt it\nNo I just I just think it's a Brotherhood and I think that it's a way to support one another that run and operated our own businesses and I don't think that we get enough credit for what we do because you know like most people I work a lot of hours and I'm and I'm grateful for what I make and what I can provide for my family but\nUm it's just it's a good inspiration for the people who do it and we're the people that make this country work\nYou know so that's all I mean it's it's it's a it's a simple as that way I see it\nWell small business small business there's no question that small business is uh the the vast majority of of employment in the country in some concerning the backbone\nWell okay I I Do remember that we've we've done a couple of instances of this and it is inspiring to listen to individual stories of people describe how they started their businesses and why and how they're working and why\nThey they are working so I appreciate the suggestion I really do\nOther hosts would maybe get a complex and think GMI failing if the audience is telling me what I but I'm not\nThat week and I'm not I don't have any self doubt so I can take any kind of criticism from any one and not take it personally\nSo don't ever fear folks telling me how you think I ought to do this because everybody else does too here is George thinking this is Lloyd in in in\n... mosque in Wisconsin It's your turn Hi\nHow're you doing their young man why not just fine thank you\nAnyway and I was listening to a guy named Donald Trump he was in Iowa discussing how he has done over three billion dollars on the wall so they have been breaking the law you had a caller earlier that did not know that\nWell yeah but there's not a brick it's been all aimed at stopping anybody crossing is the point his his point was that the Democrats may be trying to illustrate the Trump hasn't gotten that done isn't going to get it done\nMaybe doesn't really care about getting it I remember these people are focused on trying to demonstrate that Trump has a phony is not who he says he is\nAnd they want to distance Trump's voters from them and that's all the callers theory was\nHell I don't think that could happen and he's done too much into a little time\nOh I don't either get either leaders but it was it was his theory as to what the purpose of this caravan is\nUh I I Know that there have been a little incremental appropriations aimed at building the
