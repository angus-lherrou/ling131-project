Congress began and it went all through the year Democrat advantage in the generic ballot was twelve five seven and the Republicans pulled even in a couple of them the Democrats once again broke away\nAnd all during it I your host have been doing this a long time said it doesn't matter\nIt doesn't mean anything let me remind you\nOf a motivation technique utilized by the coach of the New England patriots won bill that will check\nPrior to one of the super bowl the patriots were empty might do it frequently I but I Know one time\nHe gathered the players for a team meeting and so we're gonna have more fun we're going to watch a horse race he had videotape of a horse race that nobody had seen it was not a big race they don't allow the players to make friends leave that Senate Wayne Drew's on who was gonna win\nSo the players made their bets and Donald ... starts to tape of the race and stops at at the first term it's OK layer about somebody who's gonna win players go nuts making their choices\nTape resumes that much ... stops in it the halfway point anybody want to change their bed anybody want to double down players go into gear making their bets\nHas the final turn ... stops the tape but the horse race again asks the players if they want to make an additional beds or get out of ones they've made\nPlayers do what they do that much ... resumes taped to the finish line makes the point it didn't matter at any point in this race when I stopped the tape\nThere is no way anybody could have known as the first term at the halfway point or at the final turn who is going to when you look what you're doing you're making ... guessing somebody you're probably were certain a bottom line is finish\nYou never know before it's over who's going to win no matter what any kind of expert tells you\nIt was a motivational technique designed to get the players to realize first quarter half time third quarter finish doing your job\nSame thing here polls in January\nIn front of the ... election doesn't mean anything polls in June July don't mean anything\nThey're interesting for the media which is trying to shape public opinion with these polls but the polls do not give any indication the final outcome appalled in July or August would not a contained any of the Kavanaugh\nNews so how relevant could've been answered none zilch zero not up [noise]\nAnd so now here we are on October second CNN is panicking\nRacist or type thing in the house this wasn't supposed to happen why they had all their pre election polls they had the generic ballot\nThey've had this in in in the in the camp has been in the bank since last December in their minds it's been over it's just a matter of letting the calendar play out\nNow all of a sudden house races per tightening and there could be a blue wave in the Senate but wave red wave and the Republicans\nCould come out I didn't know where at about fine old in and take over\nWell\nWe don't know if the Republicans were ever really far behind we don't want anything because there wasn't a vote back in December or January or July or August\nWe don't want anything and we don't know anything now and we won't know until the day after\nElection day or maybe later that night [noise] now one other brief observation here once again do you notice Mr engines knock it in there\n\nI think you know there's a lot of talk Brett Kavanaugh this whole confirmation messed that in fact might hurt Republicans it doesn't seem to be so [noise]\nLadies and gentlemen I Am the reason he saying this and everybody else because of my viral prediction of last week that if the Republicans don't confirm Kavanaugh as the Democrats are going to win everything\nThat predicts you to mind one by blood drive by loved it\nThey love it when the leader of the G O P and their minds me starts ripping the Republicans when I start predicting Louis that's when I become totally credible that's when they run the sound bites me predicting an all

a has a a veiled you the opportunity talking about this again\nNobody is talking about this but I'm here to tell you that gutting NAFTA when you go inside the beltway when you get into the heart of the swamp when you get into the bowels of the Washington establishment gossiping NAFTA is killing them\nNAFTA if you go back to Nineteen Ninety One Ninety two when NAFTA was put together the entirety of the Washington establishment I mean\nIntelligence foreign policy of the state department Commerce Department marketing department said everybody was in on it it was a huge deal it mattered to the swamp because it was the one of the first early steps toward the ... the concept of globalism\nIt wasn't it wasn't a direct assault on sovereignty of the United states but it took us down that road stab wished international tribunals to which the United states wouldn't be subordinate to\nSuch as the world Trade Organization and and and the Washington establishment the exact people Trump ran against the exact people Trump defeated NAFTA was their baby they conceived it\nThey ... they raised it they stood by it they loved it and it's gone it took them years to get NAFTA written it took them months to get it passed\nP. A. S. S. E. D.\nAnd as I say it was a it was a serious and important step toward globalism and subordinate in the United states to world tribunals like the world Trade Organization uh and the international criminal court in this kind of thing it was not making America great again it was not putting America First\nNAFTA and deals like it is the kind of thing that\nEstablishment types see as their purpose and their expertise this kinda thing these kinds of\nTrade deals and promoting globalism gigantic world structure a world order that McCain often spoke about this is why they are in there\nAnd has gone\nFar I'm telling you foreign policy wonks is not getting any coverage is Kevin O's morphing everything but I'm here to tell you that all these invisible swamp dwellers who live and die by such things as NAFTA are beside themselves that Trump got this done\n[noise] it is a huge middle finger to them\n\nNow to Bill Burton is just trade Limbaugh British show talking about training I'm Kevin Kevin I was not an inspiring anybody how can anybody listen this program and think that\nCreating NAFTA took these people years Trump guts it\nKeep replaces it in months and do an insult to injury that Mexicans and the Canadians want to be part of it they ask to be part of it their noses we're not out of joint they're not crying and moaning about them also NAFTA they want in on this new Trump deal and that is also\nProfoundly insulting to the swamp dwellers they can't see straight this is just more hatred for Trump this is just it's blinding them\nAnd now there was a companion story didn't have a chance to get through it yesterday the child comes\nAre getting ready to lower their trade barriers on us exports because of Trump's tariffs it's all working\nThis is something these guys never even tried to do\nTo straighten out the trade imbalance with the ... the swamp smugglers never even tried to do that that was just\nAnother circumstance we had to accept in the modern world and watch what's gonna happen next I'll tell you right here and now Iran is going to come to the table you watch when that happens\nThis is all falling into place for Trump exactly as he said exactly as he is making happen\n\nI don't know how many of you do wire transfers but there is a form of wire transfer called swift and if you're goes ahead and puts on a replacement for swift Trump is liable to freeze the Iranians out of using it meaning it may have trouble moving money around [noise]\n[noise] that's why I brought it up because it is such a huge deal\nIn so many ways it's a huge deal and turning the swamp upside down on the inside out and it is a huge deal for Trump\nMaking America great again putting America First and following through on a deeply deeply committed in highly touted campaign promise trade deals were among Trump's top three campaign issues\nIt's not an accident that Ninety thousand people tried to get into the Trump in Johnson county Tennessee Johnson City Tennessee after the NAFTA deal is done in the ... the the people in Washington the drive by media are totally missing this it's not sexy told them it ... it's not a big deal NAFTA trade deal yeah\nScrew Trump for doing it but they they don't have any ability to see its connection and its relevance and its importance in Trump's supporters remaining revved up\nAnd loyal and then there's this\nOne more soundbite featuring your host CNN this happened and just before the conclusion of the previous hour I said ten minutes to one CNN aired this\nThere are some Republicans have have it all went down if he was defeated or he was forced to withdraw that that would just chin up Republican turnout because the quarter is there a holy grail and they would come rushing out his Rush Limbaugh saying don't bet on it\nIt's very easy to sit here to stay in the midst of all the Democrat trickery that it's going to fire people up on the Republican side are going to be so ticked off in Seoul man are going to show up and vote like they've never voted before\nBut his that's going to be the attitude if he's not sworn in because if that happens take that moment where Kavanaugh is not sworn in meaning he is not confirmed in the Senate you think it's going to be easy for the Republicans who say\nYou see what happened to Kevin all were in the majority that we couldn't get a good ... you need to come out in\n... how does that work how does that work pretty good point I Do think that that's an important point that if Kavanaugh goes down it will be because moderate Republicans decided not to vote for him and that could depressed turn out in some ways that could lead to a number of people saying what's the point\nThe point I was making is and I I've been hearing this from a lot of people that have capital goes down it's just going to fire up troops because Republicans are saying and trying to make it happen and if if it goes up here I\n... I understand the thinking but it just flies in the face of human nature and beyond that why don't we have\nTo use in order to win I never understood that why do we have to lose\nKavanaugh in order to gin up turning out I I [noise] depending on how it would happen I'm not sure when Jenna turnout anyway you got the majority party saying they couldn't get their nominee confirmed and I go to the voters say we're in a majority and we tried we tried but we couldn't get him confirmed you\nNeed to vote for us and you need to give us more Republicans in it and there's a disconnect there [noise]\nAnybody ever heard the name of Chris theme watcher named Christine fair Dr Carroll Christine fair anybody heard of her\n[noise] let me tell you who she is she is an associate professor in the security studies program at Georgetown Georgetown's not an insignificant university Georgetown has the\nGeorgetown University was the nucleus the center of the movement to give a women as much contraceptive help that was passed birth control pills as far as the eye can see Georgetown was the center of that movement\nAnd this ...

watching on the digital camera I Want to show you something for those of you not watching on the digital camera going to post what I'm going to show there's going to camp at Rush Limbaugh dot com you'll be able to see it there\nAre but first before I assure you that there's two cartoons I Want to show you Scott grabbed the cartoon of the firemen carrying the baby and put it into sweater let's let's use that one first go ahead and take that with live\nA this cartoon ladies and gentlemen was drawn shortly after the Oklahoma City bombing\nAfter President Clinton a set of angry voices on the right speaking out against ... there was\nOnly one voice on the right Nineteen Ninety two I was at some local talk shows but CNN's they only cable out there is no Fox knows there's no black sphere and there's no new alternative media uh aren't really conservative websites or start everything's starting to to to to block it at that point but but this program nationally was still in four years after\nOur founding and Clinton have blamed it angry voices on the right for Timothy McVeigh blowing up the uh building in Oklahoma City the federal building and of course\nUh I I was living there was not going to accept that would challenge the White House automation a correction claiming though we were talking about the Michigan Militia shortwave radio\nMichigan Militia short wave radio Timothy McVeigh was listening to the Michigan Militia shortwave radio this is by the way there's more evidence of of why you should have no doubt I Know what I'm Talking about here I haven't been subjected to this\nLiberal machine and the way it operates a number of times I Know them I Know I Know how they lie and make things up and strategize\nI Know their their techniques their strategies and everything better than they do\nSo a cartoonist by the name of Chris Brecht that was his name\nGrew up a cartoon of a fireman carrying a dead baby there was actually a cover of time magazine this picture of a fireman carrying a dead baby from the rubble was a cover on time magazine gutted the artist that his cartoonish\nInterpretation of it and the fireman is thinking as he is carrying the dead baby damn right wing radio\nWell one of the local host of the time John Carlson on the radio in Seattle got hold of that fireman had him on the air wanted to know if that's what he was thinking as he was performing rescue duties\nAt the Oklahoma City bombing the fireman said no no no no we all love Rush Limbaugh we listen to Rush Limbaugh in the firehouse\nWell that cartoonist is back\nYou remember during the hearings Brett Kavanaugh said that his ten year old daughter was praying suggested the family pray for the woman meaning Dr Ford\nAnd judge Kavanaugh I'm starting to break down and tear up at that point talking about the wisdom of the ten year old daughter same cartoonist is back [noise] some public at the Illinois something Illinois journal or some such thing\nBut the cartoons now gone viral all over the Web but of course on Twitter in parts of Facebook they love it switched that show this to the people watching on the digital camera this is the cartoon\nIt has Kevin O's daughter praying at her bedside the description the upper left hand corner Kavanaugh's daughter says another prayer\nAnd in the speech bubble in the cartoon Kevin ... daughter says dear God forgive my angry lying alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr forward\n\nNow as I say if you're not watching the program on the digital camera which you can do as a member at Rush Limbaugh dot com will have the cartoon eventually at Rush Limbaugh dot com or if you don't have to remember you'll be able to see if I'm not doing this was like come on for membership I'm I'm just we have the ability to show these things rather than to describe them\nSame cartoonist Nineteen Ninety two two today it's just vile\nIt's filthy it's dirty it's disgusting it's despicable ended sick\nAnd of course it has accomplished it's subjective it's gone viral and people would say that people are reacting to it and I weigh whether or not to give it the attention that anything talked about by me ultimately gets an I decided to go ahead and do it\nIn my never ending quest to have people understand who liberals are how thick and given men did did\nThey are\nThis is what passes for humor on the left this is what passes for comedy this is the kind of stuff that makes them laugh cabinet his daughter says another prayer\nDear God forgive my angry lying alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr Ford\n[noise] [noise] not a single element of that speech bubble has been established as anywhere near true [noise] and it's just it flies in the face of of decency\nYou know you run out of descriptive adjectives\nWhen trying to describe this kind of thing that's why I have settled on the fact that we're really dealing with a bunch of people who at some point in their lives have suffered psychological and some of the events that have led the psychological disorders and they found themselves now as the mainstream of the Democratic party\nBecause in their minds what ought to be happening is people shouldn't be telling Trump to drop Kavanaugh if the media were succeeding here people at these rallies will be urging Trump to drop Kavanaugh for the sake of the party and the second term presidents that was the exact opposite\nSo don't dumped me on this on to what these people in the media have so much invested in their\nPower\nIn their self esteem related to their power and that when they see evidence that people are ignoring what they say it hurt some to the quick it disturbs them\nAny time you can demonstrate to them that what they're trying to make you think isn't working you will succeed in upsetting them and you might even get lucky enough to hear him talk about as high just did\nOn CNN and NBC News\nDesperately trying to convict Kavanaugh at the same time they've been trying to convince Trump colluding with Russia NBC News this had to admit that they are unable to independently corroborate the claims of Julie's sweat\n\nOn cable to independently corroborate what next claims and has not spoken with anybody who says they saw sweat Nick at parties with capital they can't find anybody can place or there\nBut she says she was at ten parties where capital and his buddies were running a rape trains gang rape trains they can't find anybody who saw what sweating it was a college student when Kevin on his buddies were high school students everybody's asking what's a college student female hanging around with a high school a party for and\nWhy keep going back to gang rapes if that's what's happened to these parties or lawyers center that\nHer lawyer said that she was doing research yeah Julie sweat and they kept going to these gang rape parties\nTo gather evidence to do research but NBC and believe me there looking NBC can't find anybody\nWho says they saw swept Nick at parties with capital Capitol Hill said he doesn't know sweat Nick and has called her claims a farce ex boyfriend\nSays what next threatened to kill here's an unborn baby was exaggerating everything look Julie sweat next is incredible just like Christine foreign isn't credible meaning to insult anybody urban\nThrough it a thousand times for nobody she says was there says they were she doesn't know where when\nShe doesn't know what she said afterwards or how she got home she doesn't know anything other than capital there's no credibility in either to sweat like sweating isn't credible Ford is a leader Feinstein is not credible the Democratic party is not credible the media is not credible\nThere is no credibility on the allegations side of this entire Kavanaugh story\n\nLast night uh Laura Ingraham show on Fox News\nJulie you sweat next ex boyfriend or Richard Venice the details why are they for Kavanaugh accuser is unreliable ministry says that swept Nick never mentioned having been sexually assaulted am\nEx boyfriend is Julie sweat Nick at third woman to make on collaborated lurid allegations against capital told Fox News is that she had threatened to kill his unborn child and the times even bizarrely ask him to hit her\nRight after I broke up whether she basically called me many times and at one point she basically said you will never ever see your unborn child alive\nRichard fantasy ex boyfriend said that last night on the ... ankle according to Venice the sweat and they told him at the time I'm just going to go over there and kill you guys\nSo I think is represented by Michael ... who didn't immediately respond to Fox News requests for comment but in an interview on CNN Monday Night he cast doubt on the boyfriends credibility and characterize them as an a strange ... ex\nBoyfriends\nThan be see again we can't corroborate any of the claims made by Julie sweating it can also her claims have now shifted\nSweat ... said she saw boys congregating

but Dianne Feinstein all of a sudden this afternoon bringing up the fact that we need to start looking again of his roe versus Wade decision or women's reproductive health and is assault weapons are thinking on why that's been that long ago and you didn't have anything to oppose them they're just so\nYou imagine how they feel about this I mean they're fools to believe this was real in the first place but they're so damned desperate [noise] uh [noise] one let me I Need to go back I Need to find Sheldon wife here it is number nine Sheldon Whitehouse this guy's money this is a Democrat who\nOn friday morning the morning and about held up one of the enlarged pages of Kavanaugh's ... said that he had figured out how to translate it and the date in ... he figured this could be the gate where the incident Dr foreign described happened\nAnd he is thought to try to translate some of the nicknames and phrases that capital used on his calendar\nOf course in incriminating ways a toward Kavanaugh\nSo under Morning America today George Stephanopoulos of the Clinton war room is talking to Sheldon Whitehouse is a Democrat and Rhode Island are you satisfied with the scope of the FBI inquiry can they finish this by friday\nI think I'm satisfied and we don't know how all the details yet but clearly if they haven't been given free rein to interview whomever they want and that's a very good sign the last thing we want as a sham investigation\nI also think that there is a fairly small universe of witnesses here on a very big FBI so yes I think they probably should be able to ah get this done by friday if they really\nPut the effort into it now wait a minute [noise] that just makes too much sense that just doesn't fit\nWith Chuck Schumer today on the floor of the Senate who we have we have audio soundbite number eight this is Chuck you he went to the floor right after the turtle did\nAnd basically made the uh the case that\nWe're nowhere near ending this FBI investigation as the turtles said the Schumer and the Democrats are moving the goalposts\nWe are looking at what judge Kavanaugh says at age fifty three not what he did at age Eighteen\nWe're looking at his credibility now is grown adult\nAnd if you believe Dr Ford\nThing judge Kavanaugh\nNBC News recorded that either judge Kavanaugh people close to the judge Moore in communication with his classmates to get them robot allegations by Deborah Ramirez it seems that judge Kavanaugh was at least very misleading to the Judiciary Committee about ... story\nSo now it's about capital lying if Kavanaugh\nPerjuring yourself and that means he's not caught on what they got to make up their minds first he's a serial gang rape is nasty throws ice on people at a bar Denise negative falling down drunk and now\nIs a a liar their flailing\nBut Sheldon Whitehouse totally out of character with his majority minority leader in the Senate Chuck Schumer\nYeah I think probably just fine yeah there's not too many people to talk through here FBI's got a lot of shore or we can get this done that's just to central maybe White Houses out their truck in the spirit here to be the public face of a reasonable Democrat Party while everybody else stays insane\nBut they they are moving the goalposts but\nAnd yes for a delay but they're also trying to move the goalposts as a target or they can catch Kevin in anything\nUh there's one more that I Want to play and I'm looking for it and I just found it I Want you to go to audio soundbite number twelve [noise]\nThe question of who leak Dr Ford's letter\nOr to Dianne Feinstein you know this this is of leaking this\nLetter my memory on this is kind of fuzzy but I remember Feinstein during a press conference or either on the foreigners to the gym judicial committed I remember her showing the letter holding it up or\nTalking about it I remember I don't know if that was the week but she clearly talked about him and said that she'd had it since July and that she told us all about it\nThat whoever Senate didn't want to be named and didn't want to go forward and she didn't want to do with it she's holding this thing I don't know what I
