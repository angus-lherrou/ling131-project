their\nIntroduction\nWhile I was in you you know it's a you know it's well deserved I mean your resume is absolutely amazing it's a you know I honestly I could take the entire hour show talking about what you've done credits credits yet for I run\nA very good thank you that\nCongratulations really ate out real quick I just wanted to say the one thing that I Would want to I Know from the eighties our biggest moment Rhonda I was a big fan of I think it was the friday\nNights usa the movie a up all night I'll be correct yeah of course she does that very well I remember Friday nights Rhonda ...\nDid you ... we well listen we're gonna we're going to get into all these things and I want to get into I Want to get into the head of run the because\nIt's I Want to I Want to I Want to let the listeners know how somebody who has such an amazing career and as an actress and and has been successful all of a sudden turns entrepreneur because that's what our shows about round it's about teaching people how to do it\nBy that I think your your concept first show is so important now for so many people and and nowadays it I mean I actually just both in front of a University in Tampa and there's actually they didn't have when I was growing up but I'm a ... there's ... major and entrepreneurship which I think it's great\nWell it's interesting you say that because my daughter my daughter is in high point University in North Carolina school I loved near and dear to my heart and she her major is entrepreneurship and\nBelieve a yeah it's an amazing\nBecause you know you know you go to school and it's like a fine arts and then what do you do with it right right which is one of the reasons are saying you know to have more of occasional schools um for people that don't want to go to college or or or or can't and I think that's so important because what do you do\nUm you know after school and and not everybody has the drive to to\nTo figure that out so um\nI think it's fabulous yeah no it was and I think it's amazing and you know when I started I I you know I I never went to college and I started I started my company out of high school my first company and you know and and no one knew what the word entrepreneur meant an entrepreneur they looked at you like you were crazy what's an entrepreneur\nSound like you're a loser you don't get that means you don't know what you're going to do\nRight exactly exactly it's exactly what it meant so I just you know I didn't know anything about it either I just put my head down and I just figure it out you know I like a running back a football game you get out there they ... they hinder the ball and you got to find where the whole is and your goals scored a touchdown there you\nGo that is the best way of putting I've heard all these fancy stitches but that is exactly what it\nIs and you know I listen to tackle what do you do you go back to the huddle you call you get your regroup you know you call a new play you clean your mouth piece out you get back in the game and you said you had your dog and you try and get a touch them [laughter]\nRadically true yeah I Can't get that's it you can't you can't get upset about it you know keep going and so many of us have ups and downs and sideways and and my career all the things you said it's very eclectic\nAnd a lot of people that act it wouldn't have done all those things but it was because I was searching I didn't have\nAny ... any mentors I really didn't have anyone before me I didn't have relatives in LA so I just had to find my own way and um and keep going and I did I ended up with my own theories yes or no on up on a on a night\nAll day long I out all night and I may have a\nVery upset so up at\nAll of those things and and what I always preached to people and tell people is all the things in life even some of the jobs are routes that you take along the way that you may not love they all ... and you use it in the end result\nEverything as a lesson everything is a lesson and its experience mhm\nIf it's exactly it's experience so how did you get into acting\nWell acting you know I I started off I'm really young and and loved dancing school so I was like a Little Dancer and\nFell in love with that and wanting to do choreography in my teens that was like I wanted to go to college major choreography that was like what am I my my first goals and plans as a young person and then also um\nI ... and because I wanted to do that I entered pageants\nI wanted to you know just to have the ... my mother never pushed me although she was very supportive\nSo everyone said oh your mother was a pageant mother well yeah she fell in love with it because you know once you start winning and you you come home with trophies and cram your mother loves that of course you know she created so of course you gotta love her baby winning for whatever beauty talent whatever so um\nBut those things gave me drive and they gave me the competitive edge and that's what I think that upsets me now is that you're not supposed to be competitive\nAnd you know there's this whole concept andme every child gets a trophy and there's no competition and you can't lose I I think it's so damaging the children\nIt's so damaging 'cause we're so much more resilient than you think\nI mean his kids we are we pick up and and we keep going there's a few kids along the way that may not be but for the most part you know my mother taught me good sportsmanship I mean second I entered patch and she pulled me aside and she goes look you can do these pathogens\nBut if you're going to go up the upset or if you're going to not like the girls that you're competing with that's not good they have to be your friend you have to go over congratulate them if you don't win but it taught me so much and then it ... competition became fun [noise]\nIt just became competition against myself not so much about who is in the pageant\nBut of course of course we're not talking about those pageants I actually had run that I mean to interrupt you have somebody annoying that wants to call in but we're not take a commercial break we're going to be back in a

I'm In Louisiana called miss dance of Louisiana actually it's all over the country to this day they still have it and so my dream was to win this dance Louisiana but why the by the way I never did [laughter] my life in different\nDirections course when a whole different dimension you wouldn't Miss USA [laughter]\nWell you know it didn't win miss Miss USA I was a runner up\nLike well that was a when I got to win didn't\nWin three different miss Louisiana title and the place so I it because it was such a drive and that was like the earliest thing I could do and then what's really interesting about the patch and says that was done with them like at Nineteen years old but\nWhen I moved to Hollywood to pursue my acting career I didn't know\nAnyone out there so what I did was I went back and entered pageants because I knew the doors for me and sure enough I I ended up and up up top special I ended up meeting my first agents I ended up winning ms Hollywood which led to miss um California pageant\nWow it takes a lot of nerve why isn't\nThe biggest thing that I wanted which was a really cool title that ended up getting me introduced to more people than anything\nWas miss Los Angeles press club which rep you know they've pageants were big just go and that era and so because it was you know I represent a depressed they had me on so many dances and they had any representing them it's so many events I sat on a day as with Sammy Davis\nJunior how are you ready to sell whoa whoa sell out oh my God that's great I Do have a really funny me to mow moment\nWe want to hear him and we want to hear only it's actually really funny 'cause here they were I mean my gosh it was such an ... they were actually roasting and you're ready for the roast while it was Mohammed Ali\nOn line one Eighteen years old I met all those people may as well um and and ended up working with so many behind that these people that I met that night but next Howard Cosell and I know you ... you often probably do the accent I can yeah is is sliding his rump can you remember the big room keys\nRight use like the ... they want to know how the end but like this big big play ... is sliding it towards me well and I'm really thrilled sliding it to me and me and my room later and I didn't fly to get back\nTo our enemies sliding it to me and I was actually giggling 'cause you're young you're yeah right exactly I mean he didn't try anything but the fact that he was working me that's what we're facing an audience and he was funny\nThat this was all that you know you go to jail for that is not going to go back to die at great but I learned how to handle all that to\nActually well isn't it makes it makes you it makes you street savvy it makes you stronger makes you ... you know all these experiences and I always say you know you got to get out there and you've got to do it and you you said something that's so important to entrepreneur is out there they need to listen to this\nPeople that are out there trying to start trying to get started trying to get out there on their own\nYou know and do things because people want to build wealth they work for companies and and they get a paycheck every week it at the end of the week\nAt the end of the year to by the time they pay their taxes they look nothing left and you know and and you said something that's so important you said\nThe most important pageant that you were at was this one in Hollywood which were you networked\nAbsolutely networking is without a doubt I\nI knew that when I left New Orleans and the safety of my home and when he got a pageants email I thought it was done with them that at least they knew how to do this and I knew there was the lead me to introduce me to people and those first contacts that I met or contacts that not only do it I use my entire career in Hollywood\nWhich was twenty six years but I still know some of those people\nAre so of course that's how I think\nEven though we don't literally use the word rolodex anymore at rolodex of life and you utilize it and um and people that burned bridges are making such horrible\nHorrible was just a networking it's all about people and at the end of the day it's interesting because\nYou know through the years when I started in business\nAnd I graduated high school when they started my own company two years after high school I still have the first business card that I got from someone I have a book with my ... my God I have over a hundred thousand business going on right now that's really cool cool it's about networking\n[laughter] when I first got to LA not knowing anything I make business cards and I found a letter that I wrote to my parents about the scars actresses with business card though right and and a friend of mine that I ended up partying with as a comedy part they're still know was a dear friend who\nWe did so well early early on in Hollywood together he said that I went up to him I didn't remember this I went up to him and Harvey ...\nComedy workshop and handed them\nUp a business card he goes here this girl and he writes actually in my book at each other story at this and I never I never thought of this in my life but he goes I I was very impressed that the girl at my class curling club in business card and then we ended up working together and ended up doing stand up together\nBut um but I had that savvy at this really young age that I needed\nIt and it's about network about it you know and how many of those people because this is important for the listeners how many of those people who ... who you handed a business card to work at the time you met them really nobody and then became someone by now you had the connection ...\nGo through that list that people that I started with\nThe guy who was the doorman\nAt um at the improv who became president of HBO [laughter]\nOh out there and here's a story right there on Hulu proof isn't it\nIt's MORNING I mean there's so many stories like that and it's so many of us were young and by the way some of these guys I was afraid of because my mother had me afraid of every human being that walk which was that was fine you know she was a protective mom\nSo I didn't always follow up with them just because that was afraid of which which was now would be called the me too movement right I just didn't want to put myself in any kind of situation that\nThat would be harmful to me but I have to say that the people that came through my life that started with maybe\nBecame huge and you kind of knew who those people were going to be because they had the same sort of try that I had maybe but but before behind the camera\nRonda when did you know it was the time to go to Hollywood you were doing the things in New Orleans and was just it was a certain moment\nWas when I was it do you know did how I got there was also interesting I\nWent I was missile easy Hannah and they sent me in and out to Hollywood to actually do some modeling for the U.S our coverage he no longer in business but it was a jewelry\nCompany that's sponsored the Miss USA pageants so they had me doing some um catalog work so the patch and asked me to go out they are so low above all I get to Hollywood and you talked about networking person who was the head of publicity for our country are you ready\nFor that our country wife was the casting director for happy\nWhile they are right there you go there you're just going to say I when I was gonna ask you the question 'cause we got to get on we're going to run out of time you know I I I Need to ours was only three hours\nI Know the Fonz but we're gonna ... that that's the most amazing 'cause I grew up watching the fines that's used and I and and I want to go back and watch it because I wanted to see you when you know why but more but to every night and you know ... when I when\nI was out there doing my recovery thing and ... and then I go to\nDinner just because they were lovely people and they they kind of embrace me and his wife I it left his first name was pat and she said you know we're having our Christmas special for happy days I'm Nineteen would you like to audition for that I'm like oh\nThis was at the ... the height early days yeah it's I didn't end up going till later when I went back to Hollywood which with a later days after I finished college but so I'm Nineteen and I am reading with in the audition Fonzie\nI'm Ron Howard and Ron How rod our me voting came the biggest the biggest right right anyway they're\nActually they told me I was I was I was so nervous I actually called my acting professor who was appraised because I went to adjust what university and and I'm asking him it's a kissing scene I don't\nKnow what what's [laughter]\nGoing over there like their\nHeart but she told me when you come back of course that was in my head all I Want it to to do at that moment was to get back to Hollywood and my parents and not until you graduate\nThat's what I did and one of the first things I did in Hollywood went back for pat audition and got the role\nThat the may ... that's absolutely amazing but here you go in and you know I Want to just because we talked about obviously networking and how important it is and for the listeners but here you go how many you can ... already know the answer I Would answer it myself but I Want to hear from you how many events\nChanged your life right now\nWe'll get back [noise]\nWe are here today on my show with bike oh rebel [noise]\nAnd ah we were just talking\nAbout relationships off the air and what I Would ask you is the people who you know in your life pet are married and or engaged to let's see married how many of them do you find to be truly happy\n[noise] um I\nYou know I think where we live in an era where a be curious to know your thoughts on this where uh you know divorce is acceptable\nAnd I'd known couples who\nAre just getting tough it out and split but I think of a you know my parents' generation of people older people where divorce wasn't so acceptable\nAnd ah you know many were and I'm sure horrible horrible marriages that should've ended but I Know some older couples who said we went through those periods we went through difficult periods together\nBut it was unsinkable we would split up so we had to work it out and then the working out of the problems and they were serious problems than most people would have split over their relationship became richer and deeper and more satisfying\nI mean you actually put your finger on it because of my generation I'm ... I'm considerably older than you are um there was no divorce but they were very very very happy people but what they didn't do that they expected that I I talked to one couple came in and they were married forty years and\nAnd the woman said you know to me about her husband he's sitting right there he says\nHe's changed\nI said it's forty years I Hope he's changed disposed to change as opposed to evolve and sometimes people don't do is they don't realize that\nRelationship could really set you up or for a great day or a bad day you could change your career could change your life\nAnd in some cases in some cases not to be in that relationship is the wise thing to do especially if there's violence or there's mental disease but in so many cases if you go to someone who is not going to be\nHe's not going to be an arbitrator or a mediator he's going to be a creator he's going to teach you the language of your partner\nNow everyone says well we'll both speak English but no [laughter]\nYeah okay and you're not you're not speaking the same language you know I Can't stand you get away from me convene you don't hug me enough wouldn't take me out to dinner enough and I I Need to feel special so you have to learn the different languages and one thing is true\nThat when people give up too early\nThat's going to be a pattern for very very long time in their life because I guarantee you someone's going to disappoint you mhm yes it it it's just inevitable early so realize that marriage is not supposed\nTo be a hundred percent of your life marriage should be a certain percent ... your your hobbies a certain percent your career a certain percent your friends are ... and you yourself just\nYou know living in your own free agents brain should be a certain percent if it's well balanced um that's great and you mentioned before children I Love your line okay but I Would say this the only time to have a child\nIs when the both of you feel like this is really deep\nPassion and I am willing to sacrifice because of you\nHave a child then the child comes first if you're getting a child as a novelty thinking it's going to make you a stronger relationship\nIt doesn't okay it can kill the sex life if you're not doing the right way Oregon enhanced it um it could it could change everything for the worse for the better but you need to be on the same page and it would be a good idea to talk to someone\nUm anyone who wants to call it about their relationship issues you're going to be calling one eight hundred three two one\nZero seven tenths zero seven and eight hundred three two one zero seven to just like he does it make if my ... my line about the ... children 'cause I've never had children and ah\nYou know it's not something that has ever ... is something I've been driven to ah to to have but you know my girlfriend has every right to want a child at some point in her life and we discuss this issue\nAnd I'm Twenty years older than she is and so I said I said well look I just think about this you will have a child one day someone who you're going to have to wipe the jello putting from the mouth and we'll around and and that's going to be me when I'm Out [laughter]\nYou know is you know from and no problem no pre now that may be the number [laughter] she's getting through that you know prayed about it you can't have it both ways [laughter]\nWell I think compromise is the important thing I mean you can't compromise about a kid and those things but I think on a day to day basis for a healthy relationship you have to compromise I you know I really don't want to go to that restaurant but she does so I go to that restaurant\nTonight the definition of anger comes from the free places only three places one is the sense of injustice ... things are not fair people get angry and things and not fair if they came to you at the ... radio station they said we decided to double your salary you can be upset\nYou know they said I'm going to half that they can be upset if you're is exactly you know the second is when you feel trapped in cornered ... no one likes to feel trapped in cornered they tend to react very very poorly and the third route of of anger is just being frustrated\nWhere nothing changes and you need that change\nBoth internally and externally to be happy ... you know and you you you brought something apple for people need to connect people you know and\nAnd ... they have to be assessed of what's the best place to connect because not everyone has the skill to even go into\nA a a restaurant or a bar

I'm ... competition competition so anyway so I have a gym down fifty nine pounds day thirty four stop\nFifty nine pounds thirty four I he is on track to be actually the highest weight loss to ...\nIn forty days what officers who go to another way of us human very Jersey and you know exactly who he is because he came in last week he had a white shirt on and black pants tall guy really big guy or like you know tall like he he looks like he could play for the NFL basically almost\nUm and yeah he is on track we even had this conversation to be one of the biggest numbers and forty days except for I Believe that he is going to extend to sixty because he feels unbelievable the we need\nTo we need to track him at forty and the winds up at sixty ... what did you say Fifteen\nNinety nine and thirty four days I mean he's almost two pounds a day but um you know maybe I've got another one I've got crank who is at exactly two pounds per day\nUm and he's now a day I Believe twenty six so he's also kind of a tracking a my friend Jim over here for a New Jersey yeah both of them are Jersey last week yet this was last week said this is brand new no you know I'm\nYou know it was only ... I was only New Jersey one plus that's probably what I thought I was running around the other officers you know it's ... you know what's great about what I Would like to know I Would like to have these I Would like to\nHave the before and after\nA while you're going to be on our website definitely once they're finished I mean we like to you know we like to posted pictures of people being done you know several months out because the whole point really able to keep the weight off absolutely um and I feel that\nUm our DNA report you know I was just looking over I'm One of the patient's DNA reports um a couple of minutes ago right before we went on air and it's really amazing all this information that's in here\nUm you know we're talking about diet recommendations we're talking about eating behaviors we're talking about food reactions um we're also talking about nutrition and what works for you and what doesn't work for you such things as you know um do you have a genetic risk for decreased vitamin C. do you have a genetic risks for\nA decrease vitamin a and you know and during the training what kind of exercise should you be doing\n... you're not spinning your wheels asked him if you should be doing more aerobics or less of this and more that this is going to give you that information and says all the way to\nYou know also talks about um how exercise actually how your blood pressure for example response to exercise how your cholesterol response to exercise sometime last the body fat how does your body respond to exercise you know not everybody who's going to go run\nThree to four miles every other day is going to lose weight for same way as somebody who for example will do\nHigh intensity interval training you know and weights on you know everybody's body reacts differently and\nUh you don't necessarily need to be spending two to three hours in the gym you actually probably don't ever need to spend that long in the gym\nSo this is really what the DNA test is all about because it really gives you a road map on what you should be doing once you're through with the program I'm so valuable so cool does not change right it does not change do you have a numbering you have forever so none of the changes that is so much information it's almost\nA you know ... enough to keep you busy for a couple of weeks just stop trying to understand exactly how the information I'm really apply you and your body right exactly so I really\nIt's really it's really amazing and and uh you know that that gives the tools you know that's a personal I should ... one of the parts of the personalization that we do the supplements are also personalized each individual based on a hair saliva a DNA testing blood work assessment buyer energetic scans that we use\nA two to personalize the supplements for the weight loss component and then after the weight loss component also\nAnd so that's why we're able to get these types of numbers where people are losing you know twenty to fifty pounds and only forty days and more of that in sixty days and that's without shops and without hormones and without surgery and they're not hungry or their bodies burning your their own toxic side for fuel and so\nThe numbers are to let me give you the number so you can call in and and take the first steps to to changing what's going on with the right now is one eight five five five and Jay diet one eight five five five six five three for\nThree ate a that's a scheduled call up schedule or a or go over in our office of the program at no charge now\nThe easiest way I think there are now when you're calling please remember the people in the phones are just there to\nMake the appointment or and they don't know how the program works and they introduced to the program they don't know your specific need for whatever for the program their\nOwn leaders casually appointments so to make the point with them\nOr just keep that in mind and then we'll answer everything when you come in you can skip that whole process and just go to Jay die dot com or and only twenty seven dollars right now is a radio list are normally Ninety nine dollars\nBut only twenty seven dollars you'd come into the office I have an appointment with us do a consultation or we're going to explain everything to you\nHow the process works how we're going to personalize everything we do a body composition of assessment or we're going to take a look at things like you're a visceral fat rating or if you've got high visceral fat that could be actually slowing down your metabolism and making you not be able to lose weight that fat makes you more insulin resistance er and balance which affects\nHow your body brings sugars into yourself for energy and if that's not happening properly then it's going to turn into fat and stored and why is that so it's so dangerous as because that side of the store done on the liver on the pancreas on the other organs and so that's why obesity in itself is is basically a self perpetuating\nA type of disease really uh so we're going to take a look at the visceral fat rating would take a look at your metabolic age\nYeah you're forty years old but if your metabolic ages eighty based on the factors that come up on that body composition analysis you're going to have a hard time losing weight\nYou know so if your body is is functioning not functioning the right way than we need to we need to change it around we need to get a goal in the right way so we use all these tools then we'd personalized\nSupplements based on a pair saliva by energetic testing blood work assessment if you have it using the DNA going forward\nAnd that's going to help you not only lose the weight but also keep it off going forward as well and and maintain health\nUh and really you know after the program is complete so many different tools that we give you ten different ways to eat that day to drop the weight back down the DNA tested and continued assessment of hair saliva continued assessment of\nBlood work to to try to keep your functional functionally\nOptimally optimally functioning as as possible [noise] uh and so\nLike I said the whole thing is personalized from start to finish\nAnd that's why it works so well that's why it works better than\nYou know pretty much anything I've ever seen a and it's really you know that's that's the whole key to it so that when she died dot com and like I said it's only twenty seven dollars on line you come in and set up an apartment in New Jersey New York I'm In Manhattan right queen's Brooklyn Long Island uh and now in Westchester\nSo we've got you covered in the area just have to take the first step in and sort of get it done now you want to give me your biggest sixty days people or you want me to give you my ... I went first last time you\nDo I I really didn't focus on the six today people I had too many people in the forty days that I thought were really\nTalking about somebody on the forty days and then I'll go back and talk to about ...\nSo um what I find really I'm cool is when um we have some of the um older people come in because I'm I find that uh\nYou know more often than not have done so many different um diets and have been yo yo dieting for probably better half of their life and um\nWe had um Laura who came in sixty nine years old and she lost twenty three pounds and forty days which is a tremendous number four sixty nine year old woman gray um and she really did not need to lose more um\n[noise] she you know almost had her goal she wanted to lose twenty five pounds but you know we always our goals are always a little slightly higher than actually where we need\nTo me you're burning fat than its way we're losing they're burning fat and just wait and looked at like lose twenty pounds of looks like he looks thirty if Berlin she looks she looks\nAmazing though it was great was that um you know she was taking a blood pressure medication for the past um I think she told me nine to ten years and she said that\nIt was making her really nauseous and dizzy pretty much the whole entire time now I don't know if it was a dosage or the type of ... that was and she said that you know her doctor kept on switching you know the medication because she just wasn't feeling well so imagine you know you're going to have for the past\nSo I looked at it and go look and let me tell you I said you know rather than be going through everything that you've done in the past which has or water explained the program to explain the personalization using hair saliva buyer energetic scans\nA blood work assessment a DNA assessment for going there and so forth and let me explain it to you and then afterwards you told me anything you've done is anything like this so we ... we can afford a few things so I go through it ... or anything like that absolutely not I've never heard of any sorts of exactly let's move forward\nSo low and behold you know we did the different scans that we do we did the book the functional or assessment of the blood work\nWe take a look at it we give her some fireworks support we did research renal support twenty eight pounds forty days has a\nGreat that's really great ... I you know\nI said she's going to ... I said what are you do and she came in fire which came in last week's show so what do you do with a three inch ... with the shredded all of\nYeah like I mean I think it's also you know I think we tend to carry a ton of baggage with us we we really tend to go back I think people in general tend to they want to be positive but they tend to be on the negative side especially when they tried so many things and things don't work\nUm you know I think that that's really generally where we're at and I think a lot of people are telling people to throw up their old coal I Do I I I think that is a really powerful a powerful tool once you're done um\nYou know losing weight I I think you really need to get rid of the past I mean a fraud all your clothes when I did I ever I gave them all the way I don't have one single thing from before um when I was I'm\n... years ago she probably do it but at what point out the last thirty seven pounds as you get rid of\nAll the ... well because I started to try on my clothes probably about halfway through the program so halfway through the program was about twenty pounds down and they realize had I kept going to the forty is day which I did I Would be way down so I actually started to give them away\nUh throughout the program and of course\nYou know once you start to empty out your closet you have to fill it with something and so that really is a very very important part of the forty days out of your time for I think so I may still having a good time you know I think I think it's really really important for the mental health to get rid of what's old to get rid of what no longer fits a\nYou know although we just taped um our first TV commercial which was so exciting and um you know we asked a couple of our patients actually participate in it and through thankfully they did keep at least one piece of clothing that they used to have\nThe fat pants or\nUm you know and the case of our patient Diana she kept like some of her dresses from before she look I'm raked amazing little after she had a whole transformation she would um you know so\nShe uh they were able to bring in their stuff and really it was really fun shooting the commercial because you know these weren't models these weren't ... so it was really exciting because we had to do like a bunch of takes because when you put\nSomeone who is not an actor in front of a camera you know no matter how good their story as they start to go a ... but you know so but you know I\nReally super proud to you know they they did really great it was really inspiring to listen to them we did some uh\nYou know uh um some uh back stories almost because actually the gentleman that was doing and producing the commercial he didn't know or patients so he actually asked them to tell\n'em him their stories and it was really fun and cool to sit on the sidelines and watch\n'em you know seeing these patients who were patience of hours you know I mean Diana or what you know lost all her wait a couple of years ago the other two gentlemen that were in the commercial was over a year ago also\nAnd um to listen to their stories and really what led them to our office for me was very interesting because one of the gentleman I actually didn't even know because he was going to one of our remote locations are not New Jersey and so I never met him before and what an interesting story he's\nActually happened to be a semi professional ballroom dance or raw hum and I said that now that he's retired uh you know he told his wife he wanted to take it back up because he feels so good well he lost close to a hundred\nI think a hundred and ten or something like that pounds um and he's like I you know there's all these things now that I remember I used to do and now I Want to go back and do them again because I have all the time on my hands 'em sit either you know these are really it was really an inspiring day it was really a great day but\nGoing back to actually thought of I'm a female patient who just finished up she did um\nI don't know you might know this um eat her name is eat us I'm not sure if she did sixty days or she did a two rounds of forty days um I I think she was at the sixty day mark and um she's down over fifty pounds so she is on our website are harder to foreign actors on our website they are so I'm\nAt just almost a ... it's a it's like a great person over fifty pounds you know one of my kids I think he's fifty six pounds so it's really a these types of numbers are really staggering but what's really amazing for me is the fact that um you know you're losing fat and losing fat\nIs the only thing that works long term I'm you know a lot of these other things out there you know everybody's like well the first week or two you lose all water anyway well that's not true no uh\nAnd and it's not healthy um and losing water is not going to give you any sort of long term and\nYou know a weight loss retention if you will um you have to lose the fat you have to hydrate the only way that you lose the fat is through the label some bags the only way that that happens is when they fill up with water and they burst\nThat is the only way you lose fat I mean I don't really care what anybody else to saying out there but that is the only way that that fat goes down and that is also by the way the only way that you will see herself shrinking and your clothes getting better yeah\nEverybody loves the clothes getting burned all it's the best part of the whole thing I mean I Know I never\nI didn't get a chance I keep saying I keep I keep forgetting to talk about the six people hold on let me get back to whenever I keep talking about it so we did the men first they would do the sixty days or the female Laurie\nAh thirty eight pounds in six days\nPretty good run a big number thirty eight pounds in six days it's almost forty pounds for a woman that's absolutely tremendous talking about a different person that's that's great what certain what certain dressage forty ...\nSo for me um I did thirty I might I'm five eight so I'm I'm taller side if you look at you know of most women I I'm five eight I lost thirty seven pounds I went from\nA twelve to six starts off and that's like we're talking like the design or like they tally end designers below the ones that basically make everything to sizes down\nRight away like a normal size twelve\nIs not what they call a normal size twelve girls you know everybody outside of the United states for some reason it seems to be sooner than we are in this country there's a lot of reasons there is a lot of reasons but it's very frustrating because when you have to talk yet I saw that this is you know to go from a twelve to sex um it is um\nIs a life changing event to me and you all of a sudden shop at a different store you know because unfortunately most stores um don't carry the higher sizes so you you you ... you actually are moving from a one shouting variance to another shopping experience\nJob so so you have thirty eight so she did the thirty pounds a Steve is in sixty days Steve worked out is down fifty eight pounds in six years I didn't have you'd be from\nI wouldn't do what do you ... yeah\nThe nine and thirty four fifty nine and ... and that that amazing\nI mean you know we typically see twenty five\nWe see six twenty five to thirty five and forty days for women we typically see a thirty five to forty five plus for men and only forty days or so these numbers are ... are fantastic they're tremendous it's great both of them uh you know are off of their blood pressure medicine as a surprise you lose you lose forty pounds and sixty pounds respectively for a female in the mail\nYou were going to be off your blood pressure mounts I mean that's not there's no there's no doubt about that are now\nUh so if you've got a five pound or ten pounds or fifty pounds or a hundred pounds\nOr we can help you uh we we uh we typically see twenty five to fifty and only forty days\nAnd that's where that shots hormone surgery there is no hunger there's no pre packaged foods are monitored every step of the way you're coming into the office you're not doing this on your own you actually get a either the ... of one of the doctors in mind one of the other doctors or one of our certified health and wellness coaches who get their information as well so we're always there to help you\nUh and so you can come into the office\nIn order to do that one of the offices in the New York area and you can call one eight five five\nFive and a J diet a one eight five five five six five three for three eight and so what that does is get you a free go over in one of our locations of the program or we've got you covered all over the tri state area a couple of locations in New Jersey\nOr New York city queens Brooklyn Long Island\nAnd now opening in West Chester as well and with your calling to make an appointment please remember the folks in the phones are not they don't ... they don't they're not there to answer your questions regarding the program because they don't have the answers regarding the program is a personalized program\nUh and so the best way to do it if you want you're going to end Jay diet dot com\nWhere it's normally Ninety nine dollars but as a radio listener right now twenty seven dollars for a appointment in our offices we're going to not only look at your way we're going to sway in the program to explain the personalization\nOf the program explain how we use blood work assessment how we use hair saliva and ... testing\nA to personalize supplements for each individual to help that person get into a ... a cellular level of fat burning a we also because explain how we use DNA your DNA testing going forward to help to look at almost\nHow your body is able to uh metabolize sugar and it's those triggers aren't burn for energy your body is no other choice but to turn it into fat and store it\nSo we have to take a look at that as well so all these different things that we're looking at to personalize the situation for every single person and and and and get them the results that do you need you want\nI almost forgot like what time of year it was now it it really almost um you know at past me that\nUm you know if you get started now you're you're gonna be all set for the holiday sell their you know this is one of the um is one of our busiest times of the year for for many different reasons you know people start to layer their clothes and then they realize they have to go on vacation you know your winter break and they either have to put on a bathing suit or they have to put on a ski outfit\nAnd you know here's the deal you get benefits on both sides right you put her in a bathing suit you're the new you you put on a scale here then you you too because I knew what you have a lot more energy going down the slopes you feel a lot better you're breathing better and\nYou know if you start now where we would do we have forty days before the Hollywood we have a boy we we've got four days before the holidays you know you haven't seen some of your families\nYou know this is a funny time of year for us because what starts to happen\nIs you know we've got this huge influx of patience right before the holidays and then right after the holidays what we have happening as all of their relatives and all of their friends that saw them during the holidays how I found my cousin my aunt my uncle or whatever they lost all this weight so now I'm here so\nIt's a very interesting dynamic of what happens in the next couple of months that our practices that um\nYou see some of the you know if you will the guinea pigs come in and his whole family follows along\nAnd you know we actually had um a very interesting as thing we had a patient come in and he is doing his second round the first time around I think he lost um thirty five pounds I think he wanted to lose another Fifteen or twenty so he's only doing a shorter period he's not doing a full forty days\nBut he said to us he said does anybody ever complain to guys that it hurts to say when you lose all that way\nAnd so I thought it was kind of funny in law got\nLost without fizz ball yeah but that well that's the way you don't even think about that right when you're sitting you're sitting on you know quite a bit of power so adding and whatever it is Adam ... muscle there he said I didn't realize that he's like my heart's like understand what's hurting he's like\nI said to him I was I guess as they get up and get more active and you know\nI'm you know this is actually somebody who doesn't sit a lot he's it extremely active human being but I guess he started realizing he doesn't have as much power over there anymore\nBut that'll do it right oh he's like down almost sixty pounds and the total not sixty he's a little bit over fifty pounds but you know and the total of his weight loss he now started to feel well he should have been feeling like four years right here in his heart\nAnd the well yeah I ... is the muscles are all very sad but I just thought it was such a funny thing to say like this is kind of what's interesting right when you're talking to all of our patients some of the things that are no there's less padding on the last ... exactly exactly\nAnd you know you see a lot of uh what's also I'm kind of an interesting dynamic as someone who is very fat and who does work out on a regular basis and comes to us to lose that whatever twenty or thirty pounds and they need to lose\nA what's interesting is that you start to see their a muscle mass and you actually physically see their arms surely see that definition laying there under fat\nRight uh because we have so many of those patients that do work out on a regular basis we've actually had such a huge number of personal trainers that come in to do our program right because just like\nA you know a regular person unfortunately they come to the point where they don't understand why they're putting on weight and so once we get them into fat burning it's quite amazing because then they really start to look shredded I mean you see all that muscle and all that work that they've done over the years it's still there doesn't go anywhere\nAnd us great and the results what's great about this is the results are so fast like I mean\nPeople don't believe you know you're you're losing twenty five to fifty pounds and forty days that's what we typically see with men and women so the results are tremendous you\nGuys are coming in women within the first week people come in and go how fast you're going to see results are in a ... competition I said by the first time you are and we have people come in within like around ten days after they start the program\nBut you tend to visit women are down anywhere from\nEight to twelve pounds met her down anywhere from ten to Fifteen pounds and\nWhen they say that to them they look at me so I was absolutely that's what\nYou see here that's as to what we see and when people are coming in\nThey're losing fat they're not losing the water the water is improving because of the personalization of the supplements the water levels are actually increasing in the body\nAnd it's not only a matter of getting people to drink more water because a lot of times we have to people have people lower their water consumption 'cause they're drinking so much but their minerals that are out of bounds so their body isn't absorbing it properly which ones are slowing down the metabolism\nAnd so we we we have them kind of keep it around a star number depending on where where they are and that's individualized also but that's what the thing so like Tom\nComes in this is sixty five year old guy he comes in this week Fifteen pounds he's down in in twelve days right it's\nGreat so he he came in you know we did the ... we did the uh ... the ... the about what the by energetic testing we did the blood work assessment he needed is a long standing skin issues\nHim arena looted to that you were talking about that earlier about you know who the skin detoxify that's largest or again after he got liver support\nThat is one of the main supplements he he had it's usually a liver toxicity when it comes out on the skin like that and so you you know skins improving already\nThis is to less than two weeks in\nFrom severe skin issues for a long period of time to the attorney improving now\nAh and down the Fifteen pounds and twelve days I mean it's it's a tremendous tremendous number and we're not talking about a twenty five year old guy you're sixty five year old guy\nAnd so this is these are that these are the types of things that we really see it so one eight five five five and Jay diet is the number is the number to call here uh and so you know you're going to come in we're into the body composition analysis or we've got you covered all over the tri state area a couple of locations in New Jersey\nOr New York city queens Brooklyn in Long Island and now opening in West Chester as well or if you call one eight\nFive five five hundred diet that's where I go over in the office of the program and at no charge right so you can do that and a twenty five five five six five thirty four thirty eight a and we're going explain to how without shots hormone surgery know hunger how you're going to lose weight\nFast how are you going to lose it where you want to lose it because that's why people Stuart in different areas\nBecause the body's protecting those areas because the different hormonal imbalances how the program is going to balance your your your hormones a detox to find themselves the Oregon the tissues almost everybody in the first week says the same thing I have more energy I'm sleeping better I have more energy I'm sleeping better [noise] uh\nAnd so we've got a bunch of locations in the area in Brooklyn and queens and and a New Jersey and Manhattan\nIn Long Island and now west Chester a and so if you want to lose that twenty to fifty pounds and only forty days you call one eight five five\nFive and Jay diet that's one eight five five five six five three

plus pounds\nFor men is what we typically see in forty days\nAnd so you can either to the phone call you can also the best way in my opinion is you go on line you go to and Jay diet dot com or and normally it's Ninety nine dollars for the first visit\nA as a radio listener only twenty seven dollars gets you an appointment to the office where you're going to come in\nAnd we're going to take a

all the options and she\nWants to have a radio surgery non invasive treatment to open up the blood vessels to take away those big masses\nAnd that's the work that we do we talked about all the options so she surely heard about all the options and yes this is what we do ... what a Seventy six year old woman she's widowed and she has three children she came with her son for a second opinion of

what they want they should get\nBetter and faster and not have side effects not everyone wants came over poisons in their bloodstream talking about a man who is a ... year old is one of the big mayors in the neighboring state and he's married he has children is PSA came back elevated at four point three and four point\nSix and he was sent to a urologist and the urologist had a radical surgery and the patient was really put off that the surgeon would have a radical\nSurgery for the surgeons cancer now if you look at\nFor the patient and that can give me the data of course I Love to give up if you if he went to the biggest surgeon in New York for a PSA for ten chance of being cancer free at five years is Seventy six percent\nPeople here than work they can't just kept on growing into this big masks on their chest it's like a man's best eight centimeter mass on our fist massive massive cancers like hamburger\nHe's growing out of her chest shit out of ...\nAnd sometimes people don't understand the most common place for breast cancer to come back after ... I mean it's the same area that's what happened to her she has a big mess was painful and\nAnd bleeding in terrible and she came to us and I spoke to her she was on narcotics other medicines and even though she had standard treatment in the past does not work a chip surgery didn't work she came to us with this smelly large bleeding\nMotorists mess and got treated in only five treatments with radio surgery and the cancer went away that's what we did for her cancer went away now unfortunately she has met a study cancers stage orange she has other spots and\nWe're now courting the other spots which are the worst spot and the worst spots that she could see and now it's all gone\nWhich is great for her and her family came her husband came really just to thank our staff for the great work\nOn his wife or this was so difficult to adore with the size of the smell and the growth was relentless this all now in remission where we aim to be so good news for her thank God we treat many women with breast cancer\nSomewhere when we treat with early breast cancer find a lump or find an abnormal mammogram we find the cancer and create remember when I came to New York Thirty years ago Ninety seven percent of the women at the big hospitals were getting mastectomy worse in my practice Ninety percent of the women were keeping\nTheir breast all the women weren't different though I think it was different was that mentality and wide Ninety seven percent of women were having mess that can be the big hospitals where Ninety percent of women with us and my practice or keeping Nebraska well that was a reflection of training and day to day that's been around for a long time\nTo show that there is no need for most women not all women but for most women\nNot pillows the breast so so the reason why so\nMany women come to us at radio surgery New York for breast\nCancer treatment that we're talking about a gentleman also a treatment elsewhere unfortunately it was eighty three years old is the big business man he had prostate cancer treatment in Connecticut ... a radical prostatectomy and then he had hormone therapy and his PSA never got to zero\nIn fact I went up to a hundred and sixteen and the cancer came back ... another case have spoken about a woman thirty four year old woman has cancer came back right in the neck where they opened up or head of the big hospital this man had a radical prostatectomy and the cancer came back right\nIn the same spot in the big mess like a big rock right there in the prostate\nThat are the press that area obstructing this year and he was unable to urinate the mess that was left the mass of cancer was so massive that he was on a boat to urine and he was having to put a catheter and him so\nIt had other radiation the past he and his doctors decided that you should come to Radio City New York from Connecticut even though it's a substantial distance for any three year old man he came he had his five treatments and now\nHis urine is a boat okay goodbye catheters goodbye mess he is happy about the treatment and he's planning a round the world trip right now which tells you how happy is about the results and then he'll be back\nTo get further follow up with us he does have several other areas of cancer and he wants to those areas to be treated but again we sort of the tough area like the woman with breast cancer return to the big mess and her and this man with prostate cancer which are the big mess it's gone is your nation is back to normal finally after so difficult\nTimes having to put a catheter and himself\nBeing obstructed from that recurrent cancer after radical prostatectomy we with radio certainly were able to clean up that mess clean up the mess and get him urinating on his own and another\nIs or your allergies surgeon another one set of this patient with a Gleason seven cancer is a history of congestive heart failure pacemaker is a blood thinners he's sixty three years old with lots of medical problems he's married he has two children and he came in\nReferred by this big ... just demand for treatment of a Gleason seven cancer well why would someone come to us for at least in seven casserole number one this fan as hard failure pacemaker and\nDoesn't want to have surgery number two he knows our data is our data the surgeons are data with us for Gleason seven cancer prostate cancer success rates Ninety percent with open surgery robotic surgery Seventy six percent that's Eighteen percent better which means\nGleason set our data is Ninety percent surgeries sixty percent that's fifty percent better produce a better as a big difference and why there's so many men come to us for prostate cancer treatment well imagine or fifty percent better than open surgery fifty percent better than a robotic surgery and for most\nAbout able to avoid the problems with the incompetence of the urine of incontinence and impotence that's the work that we do here at\nRadio City New York so there's many reasons for this man to come with us uh one is is Gleason seven cancer he wants to be the Ninety percent of category not the sixty percent category so is this what\nWe do this is what we do every day here at Radio City of New York they're Kennedy for Broadway Broadway thirtieth street where we take most insurance is Medicare Medicaid there's a big article big advertiser one of the big hospitals\nAdvertising that says that they helped him keep his body intact well in fact they're talking about they went\nTo several hospitals who wanted to remove the whole long ago the four different hospitals that the evidence lung removed and he went to their house but they did a smaller surgery to remove a small part of the log\nAnd then they said they wanted to keep his body whole well number one they didn't keep his body hold it 'cause they also remote part of the long and then number two they said uh\nThey cured him well we wouldn't tell anyone there cured at any point in time because it's not fair I mean if you tell someone they're carrying the next day the cancer comes back that's not a\nCure so just because they did the smaller surgery it's still surgeries do remote part of the long with reddish surging New York with British surgery actually we do\nNot remove any part of the body there is no anesthesia know cutting and so I think this hospital is over emphasizing what they have done they said they cared him but how do they know that actually when I was a a resident\nIn radiation I report in a patient whose cancer came back twenty eight years after surgery so just because it's been a couple of years with no cancer doesn't mean he's cured cured means that it never comes back so they're over ... what they did their ... what the procedure was\nThey did rubble part of the law and they did not leave whole it did not necessarily gear him but it could have had not invasive treatment and really kept his body whole\nHad to come to radio surgery New York\nWhich is the work that we do to keep the body truly hole and to speak words accurately at radio surgery Newark where we treat patients with new and recurrent cancers even if surgery chemo or radiation did not

precise and were able to attack the cancer precisely because for example\nProstate cancer just in front is the bladder just behind his rectum on either side or the nerves so we want to hit the cancer and be accurate and successful and ending the cancer and not hurting the bladder not hurting the rectum and to the best of our knowledge we're the only\nFacility in New York performing prostate

or unsuccessful treatment with us five treatments the pain\nIt's gone the mass is going\nIs already shrunk by about eighty percent of Israeli happy happy because our treatment was well tolerated no side effects\nAnd it's working to get rid of this pain which was relentless and how it was growing and relentless about was attacking them hurting him so we're able to help him get them off of narcotics get the cancer going away and that's what most people want to do is to get the cancer going away\nNodded without cutting bleeding chemo and that's what we did when for a year he was

[noise] and after three weeks of this I could put my right hand broke my hip getting easier with the balance of nature I haven't seen anything work as well as the U.S\nWelcome back to our show we just heard our top success stories of the week and I want to invite anyone listening that also has a success story to share it with us by going online to balance of nature dot com or by calling in an eight hundred two four six\nEight seven five one that's eight hundred two four six eighty seven fifty one\nNext we'll listen to an interview that I had was Dr Douglas Howard the founder and formulate or a balance of nature\nThis is a conversation you don't want to miss as we discuss a variety of important issues related to how I Want you to ask yourself how can better nutrition improve my life\nHe's a doctor chiropractic he's also director of Medicine He's a leading researcher and fight on nutrition he's a good friend and he's the man who created the product that has changed my family's life and so many others\nDr Douglas Howard a balance of nature hello Hi it's great to be here again it's wonderful and I'm also so very glad\nTo introduce the very original how's coach of balance of nature a a a wonderful title because it's something that's so unique to this company will be getting into that as Well hi Suzy Hi Laura good to be back it's great to hear your voice it's become quite familiar to\nPeople all over the country in terms of ah encouraging people to take their fruits and veggies everyday Dr Howard this is really revolutionary and yet it seems like the most simple concept\nAnd the entire world where did you come up with putting fruits and vegetables into a capsule and why\nBoat actually years years of study you know it's interesting the other companies now are starting to think they can catch a fad we're not a fad\nOr something that for many years of study and research and figuring out how to do this is made it happened and I always ... me when I hear other companies now they're starting to say oh we have more fruits and veggies in ours and blah blah blah we have fifty instead of thirty one and I'm like\nThey don't get it it's not how many per se it's how they interact with each other and we're not just a business it's trying to get on the shelf and convince people we're about results\nAnd that's why we offer like you said at the health coaching for example that's why we offer that is to help people accelerate the results there's no extra fee there's no extra charge for it in fact business management companies have said oh you need to get rid of that department it just costs you money no that is what we are about results\nSo people say to me off and oh I take vitamins um I don't think I Need to take in a balance of nature because I keep I I'm such an advocate now because I've seen and I'm One of those that actually feels the difference when I don't take my balance of nature I Am so sluggish and\nFuzzy and when I take it and this is literally on a daily basis I can literally feel my body pick up at my my thinking gets clearer me so I'm One of those people and I my parents are as well because they tell me about that fact but when people say to me\nOh no I take vitamins I don't need to take balance of nature I'm telling them you would you need tend to eleven servings of fruits and vegetables per day and they are most potent nutritious like Ninety nine point nine hundred percent of ... like a raw vegetable almost\nAre you getting that a and B\nThey are not a vitamin and in fact you can it's just not true Dr Howard you can forego some of those multi vitamins big companies put out here and just substitute it with nothing but the fruits and vegetables is that correct\nYes in fact I'm going to reverse a little bit you you don't you don't substitute vitamins just they're they're all of its there plus hundreds of thousands of other chemicals that buffer and assist those chemicals to make them work hundred fold and that's what's important about it\nWell the reason people take vitamins is because they know that their diet is substandard if they were sitting down every day and eating more than ten servings and then friday of thirty one different fruits and vegetables do you think they would even think about taking vitamins now\nI think they would though because that's why I'm already marketed [laughter] yes it is\nTrue and let me tell you every time you extract a chemical or every time you you\nAn isolated chemical there is a side effect it's one of the first things you're you're taught and pharmacology in medical school is there's a side effect every chemical\nBut in a fruit and vegetable or fruit or vegetable then there's hundreds of thousands of chemicals that counteract those negative side effects consistently and there is a side effect fruits and vegetables good helped\n[laughter] so part a lot of the so called lifestyle diseases I've I've heard you mentioned before and I've read on your
