for the remainder of the time\nFor these next two weeks and that is Trump's spreads lives and stalks fears head of election I thought when I got in here and saw that\nOne time I figured it was just you know a graphic Cairo's graphic to represent what they were doing at that time but every time I looked up at the TV over the next three hours I saw that that that manner\n[noise] it didn't matter what else was being discussed it didn't matter who the guests were then I saw the Washington Post thing and so I checked the New York times and there it is spreading fear telling lies\nA hand of election this caravan thing you know I [laughter]\nI continue to study this and try to pick it apart analyze it and and make sense of it from a political standpoint am I still\nCan't find anywhere in the media any concern about it I Can't find anybody concerned are worrying or thinking that it's anything abnormal about it in fact what you find in the drive by media isn't tired total miss characterizations these are desperately\nPoor people wonderful people fleeing poverty in their homeland and that's not an all what they are they are part of an organized mob\nThere is no question about this it is an organized mob and like everything else the left is behind some point in the future we're going to learn exactly how this thing was pulled off or going to learn who did it we're going to learn who paid for it we're going to learn who scripted it\nJust like we've learned how they did the Kavanaugh thing with Dr balls the Ford how bad was structured how that was planned how it was kept in reserve part is that nothing that appears spontaneous or organic\nWhere it benefits the left is spontaneous or organic and he's all structured it's all plant and it's all scripted it's all paid for its all focus\nGrouped it's poll tested and from their perspective and the the obvious you know there there there's no ... you look at this you look at this caravan and it is\nYou don't want to scare everybody it is exactly the threat this country has faced for years we now have a focused concentrated microcosm of it with\nSeven thousand people and maybe a thousand or ten thousand if they get here by election day there's still a thousand miles away yet vowing to get here by election day at the drive by his claim they're walking there not walking they can't they'll never cover a

examine that from that standpoint you've you've got to wonder what it is that makes them think they are going to win the massive elections and it is clear to me\nNot only examining the caravan the mob see there I go I even got caught up calling it what it isn't it's not a caravan that's a mob it's uh bought and paid for and structured scripted mob\n\nThe Democrats clearly believe and they have believed since the two thousand sixteen election\nThat the way\nTo win back their power is to stoke and create Trump hatred that they think organically naturally exists\nIn either a majority of Americans or close to it and that's what they're trying to capitalize on is massive Trump hatred massive Trump resentments\nNot doing it by talking about issues in our own individual campaigns you'll

plan you get to keep your health plan with\nObamacare your average annual premium will be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars those lives were told over and over and over again to dump\nOn winning Americans into believing that Obamacare was going to a centrally\nBe cost free that it wasn't going to cost them very much of anything at all and that if they like their doctrine plan there wasn't going to be any change and we later found out of course we knew from the beginning he was lying about it tried to tell everybody\nHe was lying about people didn't want to believe the first African American president would lie about\nSuch things so much hope was invested in Obama\nMisplaced as it turns out those lives again and they were just the tip of the iceberg those lives were meant to deceive people\nThose lives were meant to make fools out of people they get them to agree with Obama's Davis takeover of one sixth of the U.S economy\nFor the express purpose of being able to control people's lives if you control their health care if you control people's access to healthcare you control them\nYou can determine what there'll be allowed to eat or not you can even determine what political party gets preference if there is a line at the doctor and this is exactly what Obama and the Democrats were doing it didn't get a single Republican vote\nDid the media run banner headlines Obama's spreads lies and stokes fear to pass Obamacare [laughter]\nNo way how about the Ben ... just after with Obama and Hillary lying for months\nThat video produced by somebody nobody ever heard of cause the unrest that led to the riots and men gutsy knowing all along that it was a pre planned and executed terror attack that the Obama administration did nothing to defend\nThose are all lives designed to mislead to deceive and to protest himself\nAnd Hillary Clinton and everybody else that was in on that damn fool decision how about the law is Obama told about drawing red lines in Syria\nThe Obama administration was a series of lies upon lies and deception upon deception and the American people quickly saw through it and began defeating Democrats at the polls in record numbers starting at the two thousands hadn't been terms\nAnd Obama is outlying today he went out and get his own little rally in Nevada and he tried to tell everybody\nWill what'd you think about it was ... you remember who started or remember\nWho's and he had his face in his head up in the air looking up over everybody like God like you've got to look up seeing him but you're you're so far beneath them you can't see you you just woken up like this over everybody\nKnew just remember you just do you remember where this ...\nFor rock Obama couldn't create these economic circumstances if his wife depends on it because he doesn't know how and he doesn't know how because he doesn't believe what has happened in the last two years was possible\nBut beyond that he did not want this kind of economic activity he didn't want this kind of robust economic growth\n\nHe didn't want it demonstrated that people have more control over their destiny acting on their own behalf then if they step aside and like government take care of things\nThis guy was a walking talking disaster for eight years\nAbout Obama colluding with Russia on getting rid of American nuclear weapons or an open Mike after the twenty ... right before the twenty twelve presidential election Obama's overheard\nTalking to ... number one the aid he says you tell Vladimir to be patient I'll have a lot more flexibility after this election flexibility meeting I'm up to run again and so I'll be able to even get rid of more nukes in our stockpiled than I could be for\nThe guy was just an honor disaster that the American people quickly realized as soon as the American people were able to get past the idea\nThat it was okay to vote against\nThe interests of the first African American president than the country began its recovery\n\nThe American people when it came to voting for Obama they couldn't pull a trigger not do it but when they came to voting against Democrats they did it in droves every chance they got starting in two thousand San put a picture up we got a picture for you to get a camera going to send us up to Rush Limbaugh not can we have to picture side by side make the switch\nWe're we're we're actually in a political battle with people who are not right mentally forget emotionally these people are not right mentally see them protesting Mitch McConnell and his wife having dinner at a restaurant in Kentucky I mean they're not right\nThere's something really really awful about these people and I think they've been driven to various degrees of insanity by professors teachers and the media [noise]\nThey've been lied to for so long about things that the things they expect to happen in the things they think are real are so devoid of reality and truth that they're on the table do except to Jim Jim Jim Acosta having the president whip people up at a rally\nAfter rally he says is the most depressing thing he's ever seen as a journalist this is it the citizens CNN conference yesterday in New York City\nIf you want to ask me what makes me the most depressed about my job it's covered\nThe rallies and it gets to the larger point of\nWhat it's like covering the president United States and in particular Donald Trump in many ways the danger is not what\nTrump is doing to America the danger is how America is changing under Trump and I never thought I Would see the day where I Would go to a political rally in you know people would give you a hard time I'd you know people yelled at me that Hillary Clinton rallies during the two guys make campaign\nBut at a rally after rally after rally\nHaving the president of the states where people up into a frenzy and attacked the press to me is\nThe ... the most depressing thing that I've ever witnessed as a journalist man oh man\nWe're has this guy been to the Trump\nWhipping people up at a rally after rally and having people get mad at me as a journalist is the most depressing thing I've seen\nAs a gym you can get a you've got all kinds of you could go be a waiter you obviously listen well\n\nMr Acosta however was not finished somebody needs to walk the guy back from the ledge here\nYou know thousands and thousands of people who are willing to join in and do the same thing I'm at the rally in Montana the other night when President Trump praised grudge and Ford say for bodies slamming Ben Jacobs I remember looking over to the supporters in the crowd and there was one guy one young man\nWho was doing these body slam moves you know and and he and his buddies were all going to get a laugh out of it and then he looked at me and he goes like this\nLike I'm going to cut your throat and you know it just it I I went up to him after was over and I talk to them about it and and he was a sort of laughing about it and I I guess he wasn't serious about it but to me that the Trump effect on America\nWhat are you make of this so it it's it's no different than when Trump is onstage hey Russia hey Russia maybe you can find Hillary's emails and media is looking for um nobody can maybe you can find Hillary's missing thirty pounds name was what the media they love to hear from you\nAnd everybody in the media has a heart attack thinking Trump is asking the Russians to hack Hillary server Hillary's already done the hack Hillary's already done whatever she's done to hide the\nEmails no sense of humor these people have no ability whatsoever to relate to people as they actually live so Trump praises the guy for being able to body slam somebody they see no humor in it they don't have any idea how to relate to that they see that\nThey think Trump they really do they think Trump is promoting violence\nFacing the Trump is recommending and praising girl violence ... but they just I I have never seen\nA group of people this large that is so distant and absent from reality from day to day life and how people talk to each other he goes up\nTo this guy and the guys laughing hey man hey Jim Acosta how you do it I really didn't want us what you're ... you're not just funding with your dude you're out there trying to destroy everything I Believe in Mr ... I'm just having a little fun with\nYou so these people in journalism making a lot that can destroy anybody they want they can take shots at anybody they want the people at that rally have respect for Trump the media can do whatever they want to try to destroy Trump\nBut you'll let somebody throw it back on them and it said ... described it show something terribly wrong with American culture what's wrong with American culture is that the elites of Washington DC not only do not understand real life America they don't like it much\nThey really have I think what they have about Trump more than anything is those of you who would like to do\nI think that's what this really boils down to when you get down to brass tacks more on that when we get back\n[noise] somebody has to have to say it\nShould probably be met for\nRush Limbaugh show\nAll right to all of our listeners out there who are aged Seventy five are older and only one hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy or larger I Want you to get a pen and I want you to write this information down\nIf your age Seventy five year old and I'm a hundred thousand dollar larger life policy did you know\nYou can convert that my policy into cash right now I'm not kidding you can turn your life insurance policy in the cold hard cash\nI Know the economy's been a struggle for many\nPeople need cash they need it right away and you can get cash right away for your life ... if you're over Seventy five young one hundred thousand dollar or larger life almost you know I Want you to write this number down give these folks who call it's all free get rid of those insurance premium stopping those turned that policy in cash right this number down eight four four\nWe buy Seventy five use the cash to pay bills medical bills whatever called eight ... W E B you why Seventy five Ninety four four we buy\nSeventy five ...\n... do you buy life guide\nThey're right here it is Jeff Flake we've got the ... by coming up the same event the citizens CNN conference Jeff Flake outgoing senator Arizona worst thing about Trump\nIs his followers [noise]\nThose of you who voted for metallic ya [noise] that's what a lot of this is about\nResentment and hatred for you because of how you voted dark\nYour smoking is is boxing feels rated number one seven ten W O R voice of New York and\nTo know what's good for you which\nIs how the left looks at the body politic in general it is how the left it's how Obama it's how Hillary Clinton deplorable Z why Hillary Clinton can says well\nYou know instability is warranted until we get our power back\nThings will get civil again when everything is made normal with us back in power they've done everything they can everything that's always worked to destroy Republicans in the past and to make you abandon them\nThey've got it down pat they've perfected the various attack plans the various schemes to make you distrust and by the way Republicans in the past him kind of helped out in that regard\nBy campaigning to promise to do this that and the other to get into office they do just the exact opposite so it's been a perfect storm for the\nMedia they've had Republicans who are electing properly in Tampa David they've been able to persuade you that various Republican stink not worth your support we've been able to get rid of pretty much whoever they want it to their Jim Acosta\nIn Houston, Texas last night twenty five thousand people outside Seventeen thousand people inside just roaring and cheering and having the best time they've had in a\nWeek or longer and he can't stand it after all his hard work trying to get you to hate Trump after all of his hard work trying to get you to abandon Trump to see the truth about Trump and you'll keep falling for the lies and you keep falling for the hate\nYeah you're on the problem Jeff Flake was also at the CNN event yesterday\nThe citizens CNN conference it was just Wolf Blitzer afternoon show at some conventions setting in New York City and here's Jeff Flake weighing in on this\nTo me now [laughter] it's just gone so far beyond you're not expecting the president to any more but what is troubling as to what behind him and see the reaction of people to what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now is as to who believe [noise]\nI think because it still works until rile people up [noise]\nDivides us horribly ... yeah oh it's\nJust it's very very dangerous it's very bad out there Trump spreading lies stoking fear and election there's Jeff Flake or who himself has been rejected by people like you in Arizona voters in Arizona couldn't get reelected\nSaw he now says what's really troubling to look behind Trump and see the reaction of people do what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now\nWho believes this he does it I think because it's still works at sea so Trump Trump as he pretty smart Trump knows what he's probably knows that you're idiots and Trump knows that you're ... and ... knows that you'll fall for anything and so Trump is ... is working is spending\nLike magic on you and and and people like Jeff Flake and the Washington establishment never Trump hers have resent the hell out of Trump because Trump knows what he's done so I guess Trump's not so stupid now you are which takes me to one piece that I had ready to go yesterday but didn't get to it David go lurk brilliant brilliant brilliant professor at Yale\nHis specialty is computer science but we have cited his work countless times\nOn this program over the past Twenty years we've even interviewed him for the ... way back when computer science professor at Yale chief scientist at detach L L C most recent book tides of mind and his piece yesterday the real reason they hate\nTrump\nAnd let me give you a simple quotes from MySpace every big us elections interesting but the coming midterms are fascinating for a reason most commentators forget to mention the Democrats have no issues the economy is booming\nAmerica's international position is strong in foreign affairs the U.S has remembered in the Nick of time what Machiavelli advised\nPrince says five centuries ago don't seem to be loved to seek to be feared ... in contrast with the Obama years it must be painful for any on us leftist for future\nGenerations that Kavanaugh fight will stand as a marker of the Democratic party's intellectual bankruptcy the flashing red light on the dashboard that says\nEmpty the left is beaten\nAnd this is so right on the money there now have to resort to additional rains and and and really devastating tricks like this caravan\nThe whole Kevin ... episode was was intellectually bankrupt it was morally bankrupt it was politically bankrupt and yet they persistent with it\nEven to the point of carrying not that they were destroying and American Life and American family in American career ended American future they couldn't care\nLess this is the bankruptcy of decency and the Democrat Party has none left\nHow's this ... says this has happened before in the eighties in the nineties in the early to thousands\nBut then the financial crisis arrive to save liberalism from certain destruction today leftists pray that Robert Mueller will put on his Superman outfit and save them again for now though the left only issue is we hate Trump\nThis is an instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hates about America the implications here are important and they're painful\nThis is instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hate about America and hate America it does folks\nNot that every leftist hates America but the leftist I Know right to alert or at Yale\nThey do hate Trump they hate Trump's vulgarity they have his unwillingness to walk away from a fight they hate his blood in this they hate his certainty that America is exceptional\nThey hate his mistrust of intellectual they hate his love of simple ideas that work they have\nHis refusal to believe that men and women are inter changeable and worst of all she doesn't have any ... except getting the job done his goals are to do the task before him\nNot be pushed around it otherwise enjoying life in short Donald Trump is a typical American except exaggerated because he has no constraints to cramp his style except the ones he himself in\nVans and uses I'll tell you folks this is a heck of a paragraph is instructive itself they hate Trump's vulgarity and yet they are the kings of vulgarity\nDemocrat Party the American laughter synonymous with vulgarity a day but they sit there and hypocritical claimed to despise Trump's they hate that he won't walk away from a fight they hate that he is blond they hate his certainty that America is decent\nThan exceptional may hate certainty that's what I have found over the years that people that have had some serious problems\nWith me I was able to boil it down they hated the fact I was so\nCertain that I didn't have any doubts about what I believed I've had so many\nPeople it's just not right and everybody is that you you just don't wait too you know nobody can be that kind of an open I Am I Know your full of it I Know you're wrong and I know you haven't even thought halfway about this or you wouldn't be doing the right thing\nThey can't stand that\nThey love equip vacation they love people see both sides of the things they have reaching\nOut with the heart they hate certainty\nEspecially when it conflicts with their own\nNow back to Trump he lacks constraints that the left hates him for because he is filthy rich always has been and unlike other rich man he rebels and well he doesn't feel any need to apologize for it ever\nHe never learned to keep Israel opinions to himself because he's never had to he never learned to be embarrassed that he's male with ordinary mail proclivities\nGuy went swimming doesn't see the need to apologize for it sometimes\nHe's treated women disgraceful a for which Americans left in Ryder ashamed of him as they are at JFK and Bill Clinton\nBut Gartner says my job as a voter is choose the candidate who will do best for America I'm Sorry about the course most of ... constrained the average American that Mr Trump conveys that course and this is unprecedented makes us look bad in other nations but on the other hand\nMany of Trump's opponents worry too much about what other people think I Would love the steam of France and Germany and Japan but I don't find myself losing sleep over it\nInternet you can't do\nMany of these jobs over the Internet maybe that's obvious\nBut to be an intellectual means nothing is obvious Trump's no genius but if you master the obvious an ad commonsense\nYour nine tenths of the way home scholarship is fine but the typical modern intellectual cheapens his learning with politics is proud to various teaching with a broken down the left wing junk [noise] David Gardner\nComputer science professor at Yale\nBasically basically saying the real problem a real problem is all you people voted for Trump you continue to ignore your betters you're ignoring the Democrats are ignoring the never Trump or his you are ignoring the media who are trying to warn you but you persist and go with the Trump rallies they can't stand it\nThat's why they make up these stories\nAbout gigantic blue wave sweeping you out of the ways sweeping your candidates out of the way they can't wait for you to except they're the ones that are losing ...\nDonald Trump was elected president by a significant electoral college margin\nThey can't win these elections that they've been hoping and praying to win ever since all these special elections now the midterms coming up we'll get other lying to themselves about the future\nThey're going to win back control of the house or what are they going to do is they're going to investigate Trump Nancy Pelosi can't help herself she is bragging talking about the subpoena power\nIs that really what the American people want they want Donald Trump and the people that work for him brought up under investigation for two years\nInstead of real life on the ground improving the way it is is this what the Democrats immediate really think it's just what they left wing candidates really believe that the American people\nAre so filled with a range of Donald Trump and his administration they want all of them investigated they want all of them put in jail they want the truth to come out that Trump cheated against Hillary with Russia they're still obsessed with the stuff they're obsessed with the fact that this election was they're stolen from them\nAnd now it's time to make it All right\nAnd they are convinced you\nWhat Trump investigated to aunt there\nJust to be tied they haven't persuaded you to join them so now you're part of the problem and so the American left in the media are actually trying to create a nation\nThat consists of a majority of angry deranged lunatics in order to get\nWhat they the media and the Democrats want that's what they're trying to create right in front of our eyes\nPeeled voice of New York

to run in to [noise] you know on the street I mean they they just anyway he's standing there and these people are walking past him he's not looking at 'em they're behind him and then they walk past him on his left shoulder\nAnd he's now ... he's telling everybody who they are\nAnd what they want and why we must let them in and that they're decent people and all they want is a better life and we as Americans we owe it to these people don't let them in all they want is what we want we all\nHave these various humanitarian objectives in common and I ask myself how in the world can this guy vouch for whatever it is now eight thousand people but there he was down there vouch in trying to tell everybody watching him that these are ...\nThese are the prince and princesses in Central America these people are beyond reproach\nCalming will totally bankrupt our country and then they quoted tweet from Trump every time you see a caravan or people illegally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally think of and blamed the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws remembered the germs\nThen these guys say Trump sees a twofold advantage it's a way to argue his opponents have turned a blind eye to the problem\nAlthough Democrats remain strongly favored to win back the house overhead TV pictures of thousands marching north\nHave the Democrats book asked if the\nTiming worry them and national Democrats strategist said in the Senate yeah\n[noise] what [noise]\nSo in the house it's a good deal in the Senate it's not a good deal they're Democrats are admitting that they're spooked over this\n\nEven before the caravan most congressional Democrats on immigration as a loser for them\n\nA memo circulated among Democrats congressional offices in recent weeks\nSaid it is very difficult to win on emigration vulnerable voters in states Trump carried in two thousand sixteen even the most draconian Republican policies like family separation and deporting dreamers persuaded relatively few of those polls to vote\nDemocrat\nOn Monday Trump unleashed an explosion of immigration focused statements warning on Twitter that he made the point the military to the border and threatening to cut off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador what she has doubled down on by the way\nSo this is a story trying to tell brain dead people read political why Trump is talking nonstop about the care of him\nBecause it's going to help him with immigration well\n[noise] [noise] who did they think is behind this some of the stuff\nIn the media is literally mind boggling that that they they attempt here to be on attached to it or disengaged from it\nWhen when you get down to brass tacks most people in the media would be supportive of the people is caravan and being allowed the lead in the country because they are everyday anyway\nWhether people show up in groups or two or five or ten or in a Bob up seven thousand the left is in favor of letting them in\nAnother worried that this was going to be a boon to Trump right before the midterm elections which it is\nThat's [noise]\nWhen you stop and think the Democrats are behind this has to be democratic donor money behind this and the reason I say this it may make no sense that it has this report is right this is helping Trump's allied with this\nDemocrats do this book they're not rational right now\nThis group of people throughout the media the Democrat Party itself and and all of their social media base voters I'm telling you are so poisoned\nWith hatred and resentment all of these emotions they felt following election night two thousand sixteen and all of the times in the past two years they thought that Trump was gone\nYou gotta put yourself in their shoes everyday they've gotten up for two years and they've read in the New York times out Trump is toast\nThey've read it's only a moment of time before a matter of time before proof that he's ... loaded with food is going to be revealed they believe these two years that Mueller has been God's so they get up everyday believing that Trump is history sooner rather than later and nothing happens\nTrump just keeps getting his rallies get bigger they get happier they get more raucous\nThe Democrats get more panic everything they do to try to take Trump out or to stop Trump in his tracks like the capital thing is backfiring on them now your policy out they're promising subpoena power\nSaying yeah we're going to investigate Trump we're going to investigate everybody in his administration as the reason for the Democrats to win back the house\nThey have they have lost all grounding here in in rationality\nAnd their perplexed because none of what they have done his work in a white has worked its it's if it's getting back to the same old thing\nThey can't persuade you to abandon Donald Trump they can't persuade you to stop going to Trump rallies they can't convince you to look at Trump and see him the way they do and they're just\nFit to be tied\nOver it they're at their which candidate right now so they're running these polls showing the blue wave eighty five percent chance are Democrats win just to make themselves feel better about things but they really don't\nRevisit number one dog would your personality of all time Rush Limbaugh hardly be seven ten

from Central America than from Mexico in our asylum and an entry policy it was originally intended to dissuade people from Mexico\nFrom Washington and Lee attempting to\nImmigrate across the border but it's had the exact opposite effect it has forced people want to come into the United states to first go down to Guatemala El Salvador or Honduras and start the track from there because\nCurrent US law makes it easier to get into the country if you're a trek starts south of Michael\n[noise] and that's a lot of what's going on here\nBut if you in any way permit the this mob to enter the country after the track you may as well just send out engraved invitations to anybody else around the world and say come on it\nJust can't do that and I have no doubt that whoever is behind this is attempting to pressure\nBorder control a American political systems and it's it's designed to make people I think put up their hands like some are starting to we can't stop at rush we can't stop but we just got a lot of men we can't stop it\nI I think it's ... it's almost a variation of of course our proven or pivot in these two sociologists who believe that the way to really transform America the way to really get this country right is to destroy it\nBy overwhelming the welfare state just living as many people as possible demanding and claiming benefits to the point they cannot be paid there isn't the money I have the whole system collapse\nAnd then the left will be there to rebuild it in their image based on the disappointment an anger of the people who were left out and that is a strategic plan\nIt's right alongside the Lenski lights for literally destroying the United states by overwhelming the social safety net apparatus\nAnd that's of I think another microcosm of what this mob is\nIt's a visual aid that shows America being overrun\nIt illustrates America is by itself in wealth and prosperity and that we owe it to the rest of the world to share and it's not fair we have so much should they have so little and they live so relatively close\nDon't\nDoubt the politics of this for a minute and they are not humanitarian the politics of this are decidedly\nRelated and associated with an assault on America for the purposes of trans forming it into the kind of country of the Obama heights\nWe're seeking and failed to accomplish thank goodness now\nNew York times

pigeonholed said that the Trump administration's latest plan to define gender goes beyond the limits of scientific knowledge\nQuote Dr Josh it was safer and in droves endocrinologist an executive director of the center for transgender medicine and surgery at Mount Sinai health system in New York says the idea that a person sex is determined\nBy their anatomy at birth is simply not true and we've known that it's not true for decades\n[noise] so you have a baby and your baby has male genitalia but we've known for a long time that you're a baby is not male not necessarily\nThe same time when you have a baby that has female genital yet but no it's not necessarily female and we've known this for decades\n\nAre anatomy does not say what it says\nSo then the New York times asked well then what does determine gender identity a person's powerful core knowledge of who they are is not so clear\nHere again is the doctor from\nMount Sinai in New York we know that there are a and there is a significant and durable biological underpinning to gender identity what we don't know are all of the biological factors at play that explained gender identity\nAs far as we in the mainstream

represent two tenths of one percent of the population being given the whole way of\nThe Democratic party thrown behind them to make their issue one in which they otherwise vast majority it ended up being bullied into submission\n[noise] I have I've long believed that\nI just didn't have a I I did not stumbled across the correct way of expressing it\nBut I finally did and I really do believe that

about what what is what is more fitting proof of what we have been saying about how the Democratic agenda is driven by people with mental disorders and and when I say this I say this with\nAll compassion towards people with mental disorders the Democratic party is converting those mental disorders and really lying to these people they're converting these mental disorders which need to be treated\nBy professionals are converting them into political issues that are whipping up a bunch of anger\nAnd they're convincing these people that the mental disorder is really the result of Republican conservative mistreatment and lack of government sympathy and so they're going to get even with people are going to get whatever is troubling people fix that are going to punish people who are responsible for it\nThe Democrats use Kavanaugh to whip up the women's vote\nThe Democrats think that every one of their voter groups can be whipped up into action by pointing out the mistreatment
