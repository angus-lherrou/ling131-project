my him [noise] and\nExplaining the divide that exist in the country but typically by explaining just who the left is what they've become what we're up against\nA to me it is the seminal issue that we all face we're talking about nothing less than the survival of the country as we know it I mean America is always going to be here don't misunderstand about this country surviving as founded we're under a solved it has never been worse\nAnd they made that the civil war but but those were different circumstances a that was a specific argument about cultural things regarding slavery that any and nobody\nOf any\nReason to attitude could ever support we find ourselves here in a multi layered multi faceted all out assault on the entire concept of America has found\nSome people's sense it\nSome people are not aware of it and I I've I've uh just sort of evolved here into a position where I feel compelled to try to explain this sounds some warning bills and it may be present some\nSolutions but I have to I have to be very careful I don't over do this I don't want to I don't want to you know me I'm In the nation's number one natural optimist and I don't want to sound overly pessimistic but at the same time\nI I'm I'm Still searching for the\nBest way perfect way to explain to everybody what I think the real threats that we face are still that's coming up as the program unfolds back however to the ceremony at the White House last night with the president first off apologizing to the nation\n\nApologizing to Kavanaugh on behalf of everybody in America for what was done to him for what happened to him\nAnd they have an episode caught a size exactly what I think we're up against and it illustrates something else that I think a lot of people are having trouble understanding we're not in a battle\nOf ideas\nThe left is not interested in our ideas we're up again we're battling people who do not want us to exist they have no desire to coexist with us they have no desire for the ongoing\nPolitical arguments offered the best way to do things for the majority of people that's not their interest their interest is the elimination of opposition\nHowever it can happen they have no limits\nOn how low they will go on how good braved and perverted they will be in seeking their reality it all I Am convinced started on America's college campuses well tracing where it started I mean do you go back to the twenties and Soviet influence communist influence but\nFor the purposes of my being able to explain this the most recent starting point\nWould be the most compelling I think was the best way to get people's attention or whether it's because most people's historical perspective begins with a day they were born\nI Am so ancient history is there not been taught it or they don't know so the the closer to the present you can trace the beginnings of current problems the more effective persuasion will be it's always been my feeling on this my thoughts [noise]\nBut they don't ... folks we are not legitimate in their eyes\nIdeas are not legitimate our existence is not legitimate\nAnd not even worthy discussion or acknowledgement\n\nAnd they don't even look at the United states the way we do they don't accept the founding of the country the principles in our founding documents they accept none of that none of that is relevant ... all of that is part of the discrimination\nThat was founded as part of this country as far as their concert\nAnd it was all on display in the Capitol hearing everything that we are up against the absence of a presumption of innocence cabinet was guilty because he's a conservative Kavanaugh was guilty not because they had any evidence cabinet was guilty because in their minds he's got no business being a judge\nAnd he's got no business being a judge because he's not one of them it's no more complicated than that how they get rid of him that's another story\nBut his illegitimacy is born of a simple fact that he's not on their team that he is not one of them\nSo anything that can get rid of him and directly in their world is entirely not just permissible but it's required\nIf you have to deny him the presumption of innocence then that's what we'll do if you bring former and a woman who can't prove what she says but his believable saying then that's fine that's what we'll do\nIf it takes the Democrats and Chuck

honest I'm always having to dial myself back um I I'm One of these people you probably are too I'm One of these people are thinking everybody agreed with me we would have the best country in the history of countries\nIf everybody looked at life the way I Do and looked at other people a way I Do it looked at issues of everybody looked at America the way I Do nobody would ever stop us\nAnd I'm sure you feel that way now and then but we have to temper that with reality this is a lot of loony tunes out they're incapable of seeing the country the way we do\nFor a host of reasons have you heard ladies and gentleman that the Clintons are going to start a massive stadium tour\n\nBill and Hillary won again in want to get in on all of this Trump action\nNow I\nI'm I've been wondering how long it was going to be in until somebody in the Democratic party tried\nThis Trump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixteen campaign and do not doubt me on this either the Democrats in the media publicly acted on concerned on an interest in and would always say a variation\nOf you can't judge voter interest on the basis or rallies you can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies\nFaced Trump rallies are not telling us that it doesn't mean anything he's or just rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all of people out of the country they don't like it it's not saying it's not anywhere near representative\nOf the population is is what they all said that every Trump rally\nPrivately do not doubt me privately they were jealous if they can be and they were the thing\nBecause there's not a one of them on the Democratic side who could come anywhere close to ... that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds Obama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen\nHillary couldn't do it ever but certainly not in two thousand she couldn't she couldn't she couldn't draw flies there her book signing ceremonies\nHillary Clinton who couldn't draw a crowd anywhere good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes\nWithout some ain't coming out the proper up by the elbows but seriously\nI guarantee you they were looking at those crowds they were looking for those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death\nWhile\nThey would never say so publicly they would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite\nBut they're human beings in any kind any any time anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalty that equals jealousy envy and anger and all things\nThat attached to jealousy and that'd be they have the Trump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning everything they believed in upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't\nJust in terms of average Americans being interested in the campaign interested in the candidacy and those rallies twenty thousand Fifteen twenty five thousand as many people lined up outside who couldn't get an wanted to get in trouble with his airplane perfectly placed\nSo the Trump in giant letters in the fuselage was behind him at every stop when he made his speech except for those events that took place inside actual arenas so I I've been wondering\nHow long it's going to be before somebody on the Democrats' side tries to get in on this action and I always thought you know who I thought it would be that would make the first Abbott trying it Joe Biden\nI really thought that Joe Biden would be the first guy that try to replicate this then\nI thought maybe Michelle my bell Obama but then I thought no they've got too much to lose if it doesn't work\n\nMaybe Kamala Harris maybe some of these ... somebody's going to do this somebody's got\nTo try if they've got to be able\nTo show the Democrats thinking they've got to show that there's as much excitement as much loyalty as much attention as Trump can draw up till now nobody on the Democrats' side has even given it\nA prayer until the Clintons\nThe daily wire has the story Washington Power couple bill and Hillary Clinton announced yesterday that they are embarking on a nationwide stadium\nToured taking the Clintons stage show to Thirteen cities this ball it's going to be called an evening with President Bill Clinton and former secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton that's the actual title of the show\nIt will feature the Clintons sharing stories and inspiring anecdotes that shape their historic careers in public service while also discussing\nAnd I don't think anybody's picking up on that 'cause they're not used to losing like there used to the Republican just given it\nAnd and the question I had was what do you think would happen\nIt 'cause I don't know what's gonna happen I actually think this blue wave talk is is not true from what I'm seeing out here what do you think what happened to the Democrats in the media is instead of a blue wave if there was a red I mean what do you think actually what happened do you think they self destruct I mean what was the day after look\nI have been you know I think it's a good question because I myself have been thinking about that in terms of survival\nUh and safety\nBecause I think if the Democrats do not win the house and if you if you listen to scuttle but sounds like everybody is preparing for the Republicans to hold the Senate maybe even expanded their whole there but the conventional wisdom is that the Democrats are going to retake the house\nIn numbers we haven't seen and who knows how like since Nineteen Ninety four and I'm Wondering what if what if all of this is just a bunch of ... media and and and polling unit manufactured\nJust like it was in two thousand sixteen they were not very many polls in two thousand sixteen that got even close to being right Rasmussen was won by the way Rasmussen as trumpet fifty one percent approval the CNN approval number for Trump is forty one\nOr the ... the polling David the drive by trust shows them just\n... even now after the cabin on hearing expanding the blue wave\nMeanwhile do you know that the Republican candidate just as an aside here on the Republican candidate for governor of California is only six or seven points back\n\nThe Republican the I got a note from Newt Gingrich about this overnight that the Republican to I'll have to find it a buck the Republican governor of California is is closer than is running its Gavin Newsom than anybody would ever have believed possible\nIf the Democrats do not retake the house\nI think Washington may be on the inhabitable for a while I think we haven't seen the melt down\nThat is going to happen among many elected Democrats the charges of a rigged election of Russian interference that Trump did it again um anything they can come they are ... so certain they're going to win\nThis they've already banked on the when they're all ready planning to impeach Kavanaugh and Trump and if that doesn't happen I don't think\nI really think they may lose it all [noise]\nAnd very quickly\nThe voice of New

their offices telling you they believe this\nOK so political says the GOP house it's crumbling it's falling apart\nThere are two hundred nine seats firmly or a new wing Democrat I guess this is according to polling data\nTo hundred eight team is the number of seats you and me and for the majority in the house or four hundred and thirty five total numbers there to eight teams the majority\nSo\nTwo hundred and nine seats firmly are leading Democrat I'm exist if the Democrats [laughter] nine seats\n... ... this this is a white by the Republican Party would have to be a party of
