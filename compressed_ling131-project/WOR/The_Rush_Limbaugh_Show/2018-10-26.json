{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "Ages and this kind of radicalized behavior whether it is Nineteen sixty eight whether it's antifa mobs\nRoaming the streets of our cities now whether it's the mob about to descend on our border the leftist to support this kind of activity\nDealer under the illusion that it helps them in their cars when in actuality it hurts them and that's why you get Republican wave that's why you get Richard Nixon Ronald Reagan Donald Trump elected president to the United states\nYou know ... it just it's a simple thing like oh so you were in an office and two people are fighting in the boss calls them in one is screaming angry bridges out of control that that's a risk groups there the one that's right in fact used to mirror the one that's probably wrong and a little crazy here\n[laughter] well that's right and you know what a great leader he always say if you want to be hurt lower your voice\nWas that that goes against everything we know and talk radio bark but that's a different topic for a different day but they say if you really want to be heard make people lean in here you don't screamed and yelled don't raise your voice but the left just they they don't\nReally know any other way because they're thought leaders so for fifty years how people advocated for this kind of activity this goes back\nTo the radical left wing professors Claritin even who argued in the mid sixties for accelerating the transition socialism by overwhelming the system in order to collapse it\nAnd then a couple of years after that the radical revolutionary solo Lenski wrote his book rules for radical that argued for destroying the capitalist\nIn democratic system by what the nice thing\nThese kinds of things mobs humiliation mirrors outright aggression if necessary both Obama and Hillary Clinton word ... ski again none of them should come as a surprise and we've seen these waved over and over again Occupy Wall street antifa et cetera but it always has\nThe exact opposite effect that the left thinks it's going to have\nYeah I'm gonna try that lower your voice so let me ask you about the\nVery sexy Marco [laughter] ah but\nWhat if this mob reduce the border what should the president do let's say he's got troops wind up across the board of what you do\nIn fact the secretary of defense James Mattis assigned to another I think eight hundred nine hundred troops to the border on that's not nearly going to be enough for a caravan\nOf of invaders essentially that separates have fought fourteen thousand at this point it might even grow by the time they get to the border I think mark and and I talked about this in my column it raises a very profound question that hasn't been answered yet\nWhen does a mob of foreigners like this used to storm our border when does that become an invading army\nThat would then justify military action to repel it nobody has to answer that question yet I mean if the president going to give lethal force orders shoot to kill I I don't know I mean this is why\nThe the mothers and these children are being pushed in front of the caravan what are we going to do open fire on a bunch of kids of course not I think there are some real\nDebate going on in the White House at the D O G among the a C B the customs border enforcement agency about exactly what the terms of engagement are going to be\nAnd again it's an open question but is this is not in fact\nIf foreign invading army I think so you think so then what how are we going to handle this\nWay should read the ... column Washington Times where you go to Monica crawling on Twitter Facebook and get the column there so is there any other country in the world that has this problem of an open border that they can't control\n[noise] um I Know I mean I look I think countries all have their own issues but most of the countries including the ones that are fiercely\nCondemning us because we want to build a wall on the southern border they have some of the most stringent\nUh immigration laws and they really do enforce their border like Mexico Saudi Arabia you try to get it you want to talk about shoot to kill orders you're not going anywhere near that Iran I mean they they grab people who\nJust put one kill all over the border and then throw you in prison for ten years [laughter] you know\nYou you know the idea that this country we want to be open to immigrants but we wanted to be open to legal immigrants respect us enough to respect our laws and\nCome in the right way and you can't have sovereignty you can't have a country unless you enforce your borders and your existing immigration laws you know just what Trump is trying to do\nYou know we like people to fly and user airlines but you got to buy a ticket you got to go through a security to get on the plane\nAnd and it's a question of rule of law\nMark I mean this country is supposed to be built on the rule of law applied equally to everyone\nAnd it's also supposed to be built on this idea of respect he we love that you want to that that you love this country enough that you want to come here but have enough respect for the American rule of law the American constitution and the American people to do with the right way\nWell Monica ... great talking to you know you can watch or on the Fox news channel you can read her great columns in fact the the latest one is excellent it's at the Washington Times or go to Monica ... Twitter or Facebook you can get the column right there and thanks for being with\nOh it's a pleasure mark thank you\nPick your order region of the Web page we got some great stuff up there so let's Megan Kelly was wasn't really fired about the black face stuff that was just the final straw with her uh they just couldn't take having her there anymore but to look at this this is a video from a few years ago\nThis is Jimmy Kimmel in blackface doing a racist video now let's see what ABC's going to do about this this is real Jimmy Kimmel in blackface races video it's up on the Web page\nUh also uh watch this year some of Meghan Kelly's most cringe worthy moments cut together if you never saw her show every morning watch this you see how bad it was\nA also if you take a lot of self is you'd better watch this video it's the ugly truth\nAbout selfies it's all up on the Web page just go to seven ten W. or dot com slash mark seven ten W. O. R. dot com slash mark you\nMarketed in ... New York and then you are [laughter] well let's\nBring you an update here are the twelve bombings and combed bombings were devices that were sent that were made to look like bombs who's no confirmation that there weren't any way bombs there's one that looked like it had some explosives in others didn't seem to have much of an explosive in so we'll just call them\nDevices suspicious packages twelve of them sent out today or over the last few days today there was one of the west fifty second street post office\nThat's been removed it looked like there was one on the way to Cory Booker but was this morning the latest news is\nThey've got a suspect they found a suspect it's a male they arrested him in ... Florida he had a white van which we've also sees the white band is now on a big flatbed truck\nA FBI authorities of taking this white man so apparently that might have been used to deliver these on books to the post office so the suspect is a lives in ... Florida he's a former New Yorker he's been arrested\nA he has according to some reports of prior arrest record of some sort of terrorist activities and uh they'll announce stuff later today\nTwo thirty there's going to be some kind of press conference where though a review some of what they found but it's definitely an arrest they believe the bombing suspect\nLots of ways to attract this guy down or the and the post office they've got some kind of system now where anything that comes into the post office meal on blogs packages anything is photographed\nAt every point in the post office from the time it gets into the system to the time it leaves a picture of has taken a digital picture in the store and they can uh somehow do a search and find every place that package was a post office so they tracked it down to where it came into the postal system I Would imagine there's a security surveillance cameras\nFifty\nSix they've seized his white van which had pictures of Trump and the presidential seal plastered to a window\n[noise] um [noise]\nI also have something sent to me here said that he was um I'm from Avon tour a and a member of the Green Party but what I don't see anything on here that says he is\nAll there it is about political party Green Party birthday march seventeenth Nineteen sixty two\nAh income information pending what is this site can't tell what this site is it it's um [noise]\nAnyway identifies it as a member of the Green Party a yeah he's got pictures of Trump and he's got a GOP stickers all over\nThe uh the window so law enforcement has a press conference slated for two thirty this afternoon they don't know if any more pipe bombs out there or if he has sent everything that he had the latest to recipients by the way our Cory Booker\nThe New Jersey senator and the former director of national intelligence James Clapper ruby recipients that I also saw\nFox News is reporting that law enforcement is telling them that some of these bombs none of them have gone off but some of them have been detonated because they were judged to be so unstable\nThat they couldn't even transport them to a Quantico, Virginia FBI lab to study them they had to go ahead and detonate them of blow 'em up because\nThey might have blown up in transit although none of them have gone off none of them if they were ever intended to then there's still a lot that isn't known here and a lot of people are rushing in trying to fill in blanks\nAnd this is typical during events like this is everybody becomes a journalist that everybody wants to have the first\nNews on every everybody wants to be the first to learn something the first to pass it on\nAnd on to law enforcement says what they're going to say about this at all is a speculation law enforcement's undoubtedly going to be leaking\nBetween now and two thirty to various members of the media that they light trust or what have you so there's going to be a day or use of information of what happens during these periods is that the first thing people here is what they ended up tending to\nBelieve the first thing they hear the first thing they see is that that makes the first impression\nAnd that is why during this whole week some of the some people have been concerned that the media without waiting just went ahead and signed this guy as a pro Trump anti Democrat guy\nIdentifying the people as Trump targets they make America Again a great again bomber the mad ... bomber because it creates first impressions it it's created this worldwide presumption that the bomber was an angry Trump supporter\nSet up at the people Trump is this is this is the uh [noise] the narrative if you will drive by as attempted to establish before anybody knew anything because everybody knows first impressions are what\nAre matters of same thing is happening today with the economic news we have a GDP report today that growth was three and a half percent but that's below what was expected\nAnd so the drive by are reporting that economic activity has slowed down it's not nearly what people thought it would be trying to create that first impression among the people in their audiences that there's something wrong with the economy\nThere's nothing wrong with three point five percent growth the reason why the economic growth is it didn't come into the ... to predict in three point eight to four percent is guess what the tech stock\nSector is taking a bath specifically Google also it on his alphabet and Amazon have reported earnings and every and they're they're stunningly disappointing\nAnd it's causing sell off it's causing a big problem on the NASDAQ which is where many of the tech stocks report where they listed in\nAnd saw the same thing is happening now and with intensity because we are now at a period of time or less than two weeks before the midterm elections and what better time for the drive buys to report that the economy is slowing down\nEven though it's shocking to ride along jobs are still being created everything's my three and a half percent growth nobody ever saw that in the last eight years of Iraq Obama\nWe didn't see that much before Obama wait and see it very often it's economy still chugging right along with the drive laws are reporting the day that it has a slowing down there could be trouble on the horizon and then there\nIs this from the media light\nA headline Trump unfortunate the bombs stuff is slowing Republican momentum going into the midterms\nNobody talks about this yesterday this was a I fought a left wing media narrative that has created but apparently Trump has signed onto what President Trump to today\nComplained about the pipe bombs being sent to prominent Democrats lamenting that scare has distracted from news about the terms and even Sloan Republican momentum\nSaid Republicans are doing so well in early voting and at the polls and now there's bombs stuff happens in the momentum greatly swallows news is not talking politics\nVery unfortunate what's going on Republicans to go out and vote\nThat's his tweet\nI did my own little informal survey and I asked people if they've seen any signs of slow down or loss of momentum or all that and then nobody nobody has you might just is I sadly I Wish it wasn't the case I think Trump is half right here I think it is a reflection of what's in the news\nAnd what is it and if there isn't any\nKnows about the Republican early voting dwarfing Democrats than the perception is that it isn't happening or none of this stopped or it's not newsworthy enough anymore so the bomb thing has come along\nI mean it ... the caravan that news stop being reported but more and more importantly all of the news about the heavy Republican turnout dwarfing the Democrats late Republicans pulling ... I've got a pool here today from strategic good strategic strategic [noise]\nIn the poll Ron ... Santos has pulled ahead of Andrew Gillum by a point it's a respectable poll it's a big deal\nSo the ... this is the kind of news that is not being widely reported and therefore people in Florida are not being told this [noise]\nSeven ten W O L I\nGot forty six degrees at twelve thirty good afternoon I'm Jeff make any federal authorities in South Florida make an arrest in the spring of pipe bomb mailings the prominent Democrats to new packages discovered today one of them at a post office on west ... street address the former intelligence\nChief James Clapper and tomorrow night's Powerball jackpot at three quarters of a billion dollars\nAnd he was brought here by ... car looking to buy a car online shopping can be confusing\nNot any more of a ... car and I know the price you pay for the

on seven ten wor I'm Jeff McKinney we are forty six degrees it's twelve thirty one\nPolitical building then dream may may apply the sound of\nAn identifiable website identify this guy in the Green Party being ripped to shreds [laughter] [noise] um\nNow be because of the stickers all over ... stylish white van the drive by media are concluding that he has a right winger\n\nHe's a right winger and he is a Trump loving a deranged individual\nNow according to Florida voting records he has a registered Republican full name says are ... and his party affiliation as of march for two thousand sixteen was Republican Party\nAnd he's a been active as a registered Republican since March fourth of two thousand sixteen um and as his voters status is um\nIs also active now that information is from heavy dot com to claim they got it from the Florida voters search site which they might have done but they would have had to know his birthday to get it\nUh we don't know his birthday so we can't double check the claim here so this this stuff\nJust happened to happen to write as the program is beginning I have a lot of data you know is a highly influential a major media figure I have all kinds of people trying to influence me with what I'm saying flooding lose on with things they want me to repeat\nA now say I guess the Philippine name the guy's family seems to have come from the Philippines but they're calling him Native American\nI and again I'm Wondering is on here with the with the information for you that as as I receive it [noise] um and whether or not any of this stuff is true keep in mind that what's making first impressions\nAgain I Can't emphasize that I'm staying up\nNow the drive by is having the stop their coverage and have joined the president\nTrump\nAreas that goes listen to it a little bit of ourselves he's got a big powwow heading up there and ...\nFor the media thank you very much uh I thought I'd do that and uh we feel very strongly a again congratulations to all law enforcement who had the best in the world and they just showed and thank you very much\nFor young black leaders of the White House [noise]\nNow to the subject at hand [noise]\nTo be with so many brilliant and that's what you are brittian courageous alright yet again proud of them are so much about it is\nBecause he's not getting on to this the the real meaning the reason for the meeting there which is unprecedented by the way up state leadership committee or hundreds of young black leaders are in America that are gathering at the White House has been a lot of ... about this I guess the president made\nAnd acknowledgement to law enforcement foreign ... great work and tracking down the bomber and\nBringing that story to a to a conclusion and we were rolling on it and whatever he said that was relevant we will pass that I'll say I want to grab the phones get started berets open on friday and I know you want to weigh in on this\nAh so are we going to start a list of the the we have the ability you don't have the ability to give him talking Jimmy and Omaha Nebraska where experimenting with a bunch of things here today folks bear with us Jimmy and all my heart rate to have you how you doing sir\nI'm thanks for having me on rush 'em I Want to run my theory value um and I was gonna say in advance I had this thought process in my mind even two years ago I'd have to look in the mirror and say what's wrong with you but I've become so cynical\nTowards the media and the radical left in this country that I'm just thinking this way nowadays okay but this this whole thing with a package bombs to me reeks of deep state and I truly believe you've been talking about\nHow you don't think there's going to be a red wave\nOr a blue wave I'm Sorry ... and I think I think these folks know that there's no red ... I think they know they're in trouble with these elections I honestly beginning to think that the Republicans are going to gain seats in the house or or you are not nearly going to lose as many as people are thinking they are\n[noise] and I think it's all goes back to what like Jordan saying about that ...\nYou know and this and this whole cover up\nBut if they don't we take that house\nOnce the elections are over I think the real investigation is going to move forward on that Feisal document and that the CIA and I think these people are terrified the deep state I mean they cannot let that happen\nAnd I think the ... I think these package bombs are means of disrupt in these elections to the point where they can then say\nBetween ... between these crazy right these these national strike group planting bombs and the Russians conspiring we cannot legitimize the win in this election for the for the Republicans and I think they're going to try to throw the whole thing of the turmoil I really do\nYou think that as we sit here today the deep state thinks they're going to lose their not an American to win the house back Democrats than the deep state thing not going to win the house back not going to win the Senate back so all of this is designed to create so much chaos that whatever the result is if the Democrats in the deep\nState laws as they can say election invalid too much was going on we can't we get our democracy can't function this way you ... and you really think that the the deep state here set this guy or prevent he's part of a flag operation designed to make it look like a Trump supporters gone nuts here and have the left\nYour brain is an amazing thing as you get older naturally begin to change causing a lack of ... or even trouble over three calm thankfully\nThe brake feeling president how your brain and actually improve memory is an ingredient originally discovered in ... in clinical trials to sound can improve short term memory can help you brain better life ...\nStatement not been evaluated by the Afghan product is not intended to treat or prevent I mean to be\nOver two hundred and sixty years later with a little resource\nIngenuity and\nWe're not only capturing energy\nEnsuring Americans have the energy whenever the war [noise]\n\n\nReadings welcome back Rush Limbaugh to cutting edge of societal\nTo Alex Andrea Virginia this is Tammy Ron open line friday welcome great to have you with us high\nOh my God what a privilege I could imagine if\nCan remember that very much for me to have you here too so what's shaking\n[laughter] um well I wanted to let you know I've been listening since Nineteen Ninety One when the federal judge I was quite a few for introduced me to your program um and so it's so great to be on here so many years later I wanted\nI Love that pedigree look at where you come from you come from\nYou you have a federal judge was working and that's who recommend that you are so that that that that's a wonderful pedigree that's a that's a like a great resume that we've got you into the Institute\nAnd by the way I recently gave them a gift of a twenty four seven subscription so I'm sure he's listening today\nOh that's awesome that that is that what I Can't tell me how sweet that is you know what you bring\nThat up I have to tell you we we we are ...

I have compassion for oh people all over the world we live in poverty who live under a horrible condition\nBut it it kind of the world's population live on less than ten dollars per day to ... live on less than two dollars and fifty cents a day so my question is are we obligated to let all of them and to the u._s. um art to support them all with us tax dollars\nAnd it's not how do we choose who to give the gift of coming into the U.S and she was a trick question I'd like to suggest that we have an answer for that and it's called the legal immigration which is the only fair way to make that choice for\nHere here exactly right the way we have always done it you know getting into this country\nUnder legal circumstances has always been a privilege it's always been an honor its always required some effort you have to learn about America you you have to want to be an American\nNow as for governor case that I don't think governor Casey was advocating for anybody in poverty around the world being led into America that's not what he was doing\nHe was simply trying to advertise the size of his heart to I think governor case it is still one of these people that thinks Donald Trump has destroyed the Republican Party and the things governor case that cares about the governor case it wants their money and hey you know I saw a big heart I look at\nThese people that are down trodden a disadvantage that I still love 'em and I still care about about I don't think all of them and we've got to be able to put ourselves in a in in their shoes and understand he he just want everybody to understand that he has a caring fought for compassionate person as opposed to this bunk and he thinks is in the White House\nAnd uh 'cause he clearly not advocating for every one of the lead in the country\nThat's ... that's not possible number one um and and would never happen so that's not his uh his real objective anyone I'm so glad you called Tammy thank you again have to take a brief time out of time is racing on stick with\nUs all the way we're ready to bring it up to ... be more\nHey I'm Brandt so there's this guy didn't Jordan he's a healthy guy he's a dad of six and he works as a guide in Alaska and it goes to the doctor a true story goes to the doctor and he was diagnosed with cancer stage four\nAnd here's the thing he had switched earlier for medical insurance to medical care where Christians share each other's medical bills so the question for Jordan and his wife Jenny was is this actually going to work our medical bills\nExceeded a hundred and sixty thousand dollars Medicare members shared all our bells\nAnd it was about more than just the money to this is a real community\nMedicare is is a family a group of people that stick with you because the hardest times of your life I just don't know how it could have done it without measure\nIt's so worth looking into there's a reason is growing so fast so if you want to find out more here is a number for you\nEight five five fifty one Bible that's eight five five five one B. I. B. L. E.\nOn this viewing everything I\nMoment I think if I'm collecting some thoughts all share with your my latest on all of this\nWhen we get back after the top of this man this guy was driving around in\nThis is just the odd it's just weird [noise]\nWhen you're trying to plug it into the rest of the event you\n\nAs best I can tell his twittering are twittering dates back to two thousand sixteen\nWhich is quite time a lame\nNow I\nI don't know that any of my thoughts here a minute thing obviously I'm just sharing with us some of the thoughts that I've had\nThat I and I ... process but you know I just didn't work these out when I first started noticing this stuff but let me go to audio somebody's number twenty six we have there there is a CNN sucks sticker on those bands\n[noise] [laughter]\nHe goes to a post office kiosks whereabouts are cameras\nTo mail these these bombs none of them went off\nAnd from what I'm told for reliable law enforcement none of them could have now there is also a story out there that some of them are so unstable that law enforcement Heather detonate them rather than transport them into the FBI lab in Quantico\nVirginia you know these watches excuse me so I'm OK I'm OK I did not fall\nYou know these new watches have fall detectors on them I mean if you fall if the watched detect that you have fallen it will offer to call emergency services for you if you're incapacitated all you have to do is do nothing if you do nothing after a certain number ... it'll call\nUs a call nine one one where you are it also gives you the opportunity so no I didn't fall I'm fine I'm OK this thing goes off on me twice the show while I'm sitting here\nMy wild jak sticky operations my expression field manner of speaking as drinking might watch triggering my watch into thinking that I Am boiling the gang up\nIt starts vibrating not you know what this is a great health featured on a lot of people are buying this watch\nFor grandma and grandpa because it does it work they've ... they've tested this watch on Hollywood stumped actors and stunt men and women and it works but it's also it shows it nothing wrong with is comes back with false positives\nBut I'm ... my hand than even hit the table it doesn't it just wildly just sticky waving around to her in my fall alert has been triggered him to watch that is what [noise] just interrupted me but my my point is it this guy\nHere has been screaming notice me and now here comes Dana Bash from CNN justice after the CNN sucks sticker on this man\n[noise] CNN sucks [noise]\nWe go that image than and suck the president and direct deaths he's not technically of responsible for that but in response for for not just allowing the chat than I'm stuck at his rallies stoking\nMaking clear that he likes and all you need is one forgive me crock pot\nAnd we've been saying this for two years [noise]\nWant it may have emerged and that is the danger and that is the reason why leadership is the way it is and you can have an enemy you can have a political discussion you can have political discourse but when you've crossed the line\nIt is extremely dangerous and that has what has been giant mission and everything we've heard from anybody at the White House\nOkay so in CNN's as that's Trump's van and its Trump's bombs and you know in a in a vacuum and in a\nNarrow world what Dana Bash just sent here would be perfectly fine\nBut the thing that really irritates me about CNN and the rest of these people in the leftist ... is that they permit themselves to say all of these incendiary things about anybody they want\nThey permit themselves to attack the character and the intentions and the decency and the honesty of any of their targets\nAnd they can call every president Hitler like they did George W. Bush like they do Donald Trump\nThey can accuse these people have some of the most outrageous things in the world and of course there's never any danger that at one of their crackpot view or is this going to take action except that there is\nCrock pot CNN viewers shut up or Republican baseball practice crackpot CNN viewers storm buildings where there are Family Research council members and think about letting loose with gunfire\nWe have an example after example\nOf attempted violence against conservatives when right when he was in fact one of the one of the central elements of Democrats strategy in this campaign is the public threatening and the public bullying and the public harassment\nOf Republican elected officials in restaurants in public places\nAnd these are genuinely threatening people and they are confronting people and demanding that they leave and and there's not there's never any condemnation of the ... you never hear CNN condemning any of this\nKind of behavior they chalk it up well you know this is what Donald Trump has Raj this is what Donald Trump's presidency is meant there says what Donald Trump is doing to people he's making them insane is creating all that so it's it's a one way street with these people\n\nAnd I believe Donald Trump is reacting by the way\nCNN starts this with their unfair bias coverage and unlike other Republicans who just sit there and take it\nAnd ... the stuff well this is politics you know it's hard wall you got to be able to take it and I'm sure that people are seeing her find people's data that Trump fires back at them\nAnd that's what hasn't been done before Trump fires back at him and a lot of Republicans are very excited about this fighting back because for ... for too many years we've had to sit here and watch powerless\nLate as CNN and others in the media have taken potshots at us and our issues they have lied about the misstated the miss characterize them they attempt to do it with you and the character in honor of conservative\nPeople spokesman policy people and so forth now all of a sudden\nWhen an actual Republican get shot by a gun in a bullet there is no ringing of hands over what's happening to our politics because the shooter was a Bernie Sanders supporter\nSo we talk about where of course yeah I was ah mentally unstable Trump wouldn't do that to anybody comes down to Trump\nHow a lot of people said Russia or something like two wrongs make her I'm not talking about two wrongs make a right I'm simply I I'm not talking about who started it I'm Talking about these people that want to sit here and hide judgment over everybody else while exempting themselves\n\nWhereas they said Donald Trump is perfectly capable and responsible for any behavior on the part of his supporters CNN is it\nThey're not responsible for how many of their viewers act or how any of the people on their side of the ... act and then there's this demand that they have for insulation\n\nAnd to be exam from having any impact on people that frankly offends me but this van I mean if you [laughter] if you wanted to decorate\nIn dress up a van that says noticed may and if you wanted everybody in the world to know that you are a Trump supporter who is unstable and a little over the top are major over the top [noise] this is what you would do\n\nSo my two cents for now here's President Trump at the White House today as he convened a meeting black Leadership Conference\nA young black leaders from all over the country this has not been done before in in this in this manner um [noise] and he's talking about the arrest in these bombs here\nI'd like to begin today's remarks by providing an update now on the packages and devices that had been male too high profile figures throughout our country and a media organization I Am pleased to inform you\nThat law enforcement has apprehended the suspect and taken him into custody\n[noise]\nCredible job by law for us we've carried out a far reaching federal state and local investigation find the person or persons responsible for these events these terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country\nNow I wanted one can remind you of Trump pacing if if if you think Trump is not as important\nFully funds President Trump's border\nExpands caseload people lives in Brooklyn\nAnd insurers only of American citizens have the right to vote\nThe leadership of President Trump's nice\nSo health President Trump\nFor the wall dot com\nAnd tell Congress to pass Kevin McCarthy build the wall and enforce the law\nFor my safety forty ... [laughter]\nOh war [noise] [noise]\nA couple of observations about those two audio somebody's replayed Donald Trump of the White House that I was like three hundred and fifty four hundred\nYoung black leaders from various walks of life in the United states did you hear what happened when the president of the United states praised law enforcement\nSome during applause\nStanding ovation in some parts of the room but some during applause nobody don't get me in there and nobody started booming\nLaw enforcement\nAmong this group of young conservative black leaders\nSomething else in in the remarks made by President Trump he was very gracious tort law enforcement [noise] he was very gracious toward the work done to bring this ... this gusting make America great again bomber\nTo justice\nAnd I I I think before the day is out you're gonna see various panelists and pundits and commentators on a drive by media over the edge driven over the edge by Trump doing for two reasons one they're going to consider him a total fraud\nThat he's calling for unity you might you might just going to happen maybe before this program is over there is going to be a panel on CNN or MSNBC or some leftist on Fox called Trump a total front calling\nFor unity when he is responsible\nFor all of the chaos and division\nThey will say that Trump was on believe oblique brazen for talking about this is if he's not complicit they'll rip him for acting like he had nothing to do with it\nRemember the old Limbaugh the room the Limbaugh fear him was the process by which were rock Obama\nActually got to pretend and portraying himself as on involves getting any policy that was going wrong or any mistakes that were being made\nPositions herself as an outsider tackling whoever was screwing it up [noise] um that's the Limbaugh fear among the Obama effect not response that we're going to they're going to accuse Trump\nThe voice of New York [noise]\nSeven ten W O o\nForty seven degrees one thirty good afternoon I'm Jeff McKinney authorities\nMaking arrest in Florida and the spring of pipe bomb mailings to suspect identified is fifty six year old former New Yorkers are say are the eleventh and twelfth packages discovered today one of them at a post office on west fifty second street none has exploded\nNor'easter headed our way heavy rain and high winds on tap for tomorrow but it was brought here by

Anaheim fifty one degrees\nNext news two o'clock breaking news one started David Len Burman Michael read all in the morning six to ten Monday on seven ten W a war I'm Jeff McKinney we have forty seven degrees and the time now is one thirty one race may apply [noise]\nDon't just to clarify the Limbaugh fear of them was how I explained that the media never held Obama accountable for everything was going wrong including his own policy and Obama\nWould never even always position himself as an outsider a up against powerful interests that were standing in his way and he was valiantly fighting them meanwhile it was his policies that were growing up\nAnd I marveled at how the relationship to the bottom of the media permitted to him to go through his presidency on accountable\nI mean all those lives about Obamacare you keep your doctor keep your plan twenty five hundred dollar per premium decrease every year that kind of thing never called him on it well here's Trump out there and he's a ... law enforcement\nAnd they're going to call him a total fraud here by trying to say he's free unity when he's that guy and they're going to say is responsible for it is not a man\n\nAnd they'll say that he is bracing just unbelievably brazen for talking about this as if he's not complicit in it\nThat he's trying to stand above it they gave Obama the benefit of the doubt on everything but they are going to hold Trump to it mark my words [noise] okay for those of you're watching on the digital camera here is a shot that has three windows filled with stickers what in their ... says ours\nSay Iraq in his van and as is the case with all of these labeled eventually be at Rush Limbaugh dot com so everybody can see them no I couldn't withhold them and have them only for a little cameo siege but that that would be cheap\nAh and and unnecessary\nWe're just taking advantage or of the tech and being able to use the switch or to show you these things if you look at a big van window there on the left\nOr you will see ... ... and the lower center you will see when you may not be able to tell I don't know what size screen you're looking but it's Hillary Clinton in the crosshairs of a rifle scope\nAnd just beneath her as you're looking at this to the left is Michael\nMoore also in\nThe crosshairs of a shotgun and then to stickers over from Michael Moore is the CNN sucks sticker or whatever but the thing that noticed there three total windows in the van there's no way anybody could see in or out\nOf these windows these are in the rear by the way they're on the side of the van a you've got\nParents or the upper left look how evenly proportion the every sticker is look at him nothing is off line there isn't any overlap nothing has been slabs up there in a passion or anger or any of that in either of the three windows that you'll see here\nNo no that nothing is David this is South Florida sun this guy's been driving around who knows how long nothing's fading this screams notice me\nThis this would be the face you got a bunch of people down in South Florida don't like Trump they see this ban park somewhere and you know there's somebody would be throwing things on it are scraping it with the kids or gay paintbrush and tomatoes and rotten eggs who knows whatever this van is pristine\nVan is a is almost like a a work of art [noise]\nHere is Chris in Las Vegas glad you wait until you're next year on open line\nFriday high tides are it's an honor and a privilege\nI appreciate that serve thank you\nI just wanted to say about the only thing this guy's van was actually meant the worst spotlights on a giant neon sign that said I did it around [laughter]\n[laughter] I mean I Can't speak out any more than it already has it's ridiculous\nYeah we what this guy's apparently been a law enforcement radar for a while uh they're cleaning DNA got some DNA off I guess some of the packages here he's been arrested and and uh on law enforcement radar\nBut you wonder how long this vans been decorated like this how long it's been driving around down there unnoticed are on observed or\nOr what have you it does it just I don't know if there's something about this that [noise]\nI don't know when you're watching a hundred percent right so you're a hundred percent right like it looks too good it's been out there in the sun for as long as it has been people in that state openly can despise the president and probably have a long time and nothing's happened to those guys and it's like somebody just\nTossed this guy the keys and tell them hang out for twenty minutes the cops will be here you know and then you just take it from there it's like\nHow much more to set up in this book like this they even if this guy was part of the Republican Party the guy needs help and he doesn't represent anything but a small fraction of some extreme it's you're not hold a candle to what the party actually is very\nTrue very true goes without saying but I mean you you got me imagining pictures now there's van driving around and you see people would notice I mean I I noticed a bumper sticker on a car in front of me if I think as looney tunes\nDoes this this man or\nThere's no way that this man doesn't get noticed and doesn't have\nPeople reacting to it in in certain ways so you think what then you you you you think this guy is being used\nYou know I don't know like I mean like a ... there's going to a gym we lose it and the guy is just off his rocker and he just needed medical help on on a hobby [laughter] Russia I mean\nAn American politics Tom's dire got a bomb Tom ... is a California\nBillionaire in the alternative energy business who said in July ... supporter proponent and propagandist for man made climate change so he got a bomb\nCNN says and Kamala Harris California\nGot a bomb now here's an unrelated story but\nYes it\nIs John ... reporting for Breitbart we had the news yesterday that Charles Grassley the chairman a house or Senate Judiciary committee had referred to a Julie sweat Nick and her porn star a lawyer Michael ... D O D J\nCriminal referrals for messing around with the false allegations and the ones that are questionable things during the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings apparently [noise] excuse me according to Breitbart NBC News\nLiterally here the information that would've helped clear Kavanaugh\n\nThat is the headline NBC News here the information that would have cleared Kavanaugh of the rape allegations being made by ...\nClient apparently she totally recanted her story and NBC no it and didn't report it\nOn September sixteenth cabin on his loved ones were dropped into a pit of hell do the allegations of sexual assault from Christine Blasey Ford although her story quickly fell apart during public testimony\nIn their allies and the establishment media did everything in their power to personally destroy cabinet as a drunken serial rapist enemies he knows and the ... play the huge role in this campaign one notable exchange\nWas NBC breathless way publishing an airing them assault allegation against capital and it was quickly exposed as a hoax\nNBC did not even bother to independently corroborate this allegation and proud of airing it a Democrat handed NBC the smear and NBC ran with it this was Kavanaugh's setting up gang rapes\nAt high school and college to make matters worse\nBright Mart says it they now know that NBC News withheld crucial information that undermine the sweat next allegations she again the ab ... clients who accused Kavanaugh spiking punch bowls\nAt house parties so and he and his buddies couldn't even gauge in gang rape\nAnd we know that NBC deliberately withheld this crucial information because NBC has now admitting it had the information all the way back on September thirtieth September thirtieth is a week prior to Kavanaugh's confirmation during the most intense days\nOf the scandal when his confirmation was still very much in doubt ah here's what NBC did not want the public to know if you recall although he withheld the name Abu ... tweeted out of sworn statement from a woman who backed up sweat things outrageous rape allegations that her statement\nThe second woman's war but she too had witness Kavanaugh's bike punch bowls and takes sexual advantage of\nUnbeknownst to all of us NBC had interviewed this anonymous witness on September thirtieth and she recanted but only now is NBC News bothering to report this quote\nReferring to Kavanaugh spiking the punch I didn't ever think it was breath the woman said to reporters and a phone interview arranged by ... September thirtieth when asked in the phone interview she ever witnessed Kavanaugh act inappropriately toward the girls the woman said no\nOn October third NBC News against spoke\nTo the woman and this time she often accused ... of fabricating her statement\nIs incorrect that I saw Brett spite the punch I didn't see anybody spike the punch I was very clear with ... from day one that I never saw it yet he brought her forward as a witness when pressed about abusive behavior toward girl she wrote in a text I Would not ever allow anybody to be a bill see but my presence male or female I didn't see it happen I didn't\nKnow what NBC News knew what they withheld it\nUntil after Kevin all was confirmed had they come forward with the second witness having been made up ratcheting lied about what she saw\nIt would've blown the confirmation hearing sky high so this is why people don't trust anymore what comes out of the media when anything related to Donald Trump\nIs bill ...\nLimbs off on the voice of New York\nCarlo a steel worker is married to his high school sweetheart a cancer survivor they have a special needs son Carlos just been laid off from his job losing his medical insurance and to make matters worse the bank is about to foreclose on his house with his back against the wall Carlo will do anything\nTo protect his family directed by and starring James ... Carlo is a based based bill and a bail on Amazon I tune in Google Play watch Carlos inspiring story today on Amazon I tunes and Google Play\nCovering it it's it's it's not happening and so the sense was that the momentum was being lost\nBy Republicans Republican voters the story was that Republican voters were\n[noise] somehow\nLosing their enthusiasm to I don't know what early vote a registered to vote was too late for that but whatever it was ... and now Trump is drawing that parade President Trump\nToday complained about the pipe bombs being sent to prominent Democrats lamenting that this scare has distracted\nFrom news about the mid terms and even slowed Republican momentum he said Republicans are doing so well in early voting and at the polls and now this bomb stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows news not talking politics very unfortunate what's going on Republicans would go out and vote that was Trump's tweet\nNow\nThere are some who believe that this was another example of Trump pacing\nJust like when he made his original statements about Christine balls the Ford being credible and compelling and then later\nSort of lowered the boom on her at a rally pointing out that she really had no evidence and no way to back up what she was alleging so some people think that he's some during the same thing here uh basically tampering expectations\nWith the bombers suppression of state but the trumps out they're lowering expectations setting people up so as to be able to say we overcame the bomber and we did great anyway and there's some people think that this is very very artful love Trump but he's getting really really good at this\nLowering expectations while he knows things are going to go well and then when they do go well he can go back and look at what we had to overcome looked at the obstacles that we did it we came through\nAnd we try out\nSo we will see Charlie Kirk a turning point you asked a\nTweet in uh let's see there'll be yesterday that the presidential approval rating had hit forty seven percent his highest yet I don't need a despite the poll I'll guarantee\nYou it's not a CNN poll and it probably is it an ABC Washington Post poll or even NBC Wall Street Journal maybe Rasmussen buck forty seven percent in whatever pull it is is Trump's highest and also forty\nSeven percent is free points higher than Obama's approval rating twenty tended terms does anybody remember what happened to twenty ten midterms\nHistorically a little pop quiz on the history now admittedly this is eight years ago\nIt seemed like eight years ago that Obama was president and mid term but how many seats the Republicans win\nIn two thousand ten mid term some of\nThese three\nThe Republicans won six the free now in those terms conventional wisdom one out\nConventional wisdom is the party out of power makes a big gains in the house and Senate primarily the house in the first election after a president is inaugurated\nWell that's what we have coming up here but but ... point is that Obama was sitting at forty four forty five percent back then trumpet forty seven percent and rising\nAnd therefore we uh we could be looking here at the ... a bit of an upset\n[noise] there's also polling data here in Florida and let me let me find\nThe [noise] it is yeah here we go barely two days after Democrats Andrew Gillum\nWas leading in most polls for governor of Florida a strategic Research Associates poll conducted for great TV\nAnd released a couple of days ago shows Ron dissent is pulling into the lead forty eight forty five margin of error plus or minus three and a half so statistically tied\nIs the first since the primaries last month to put the Santa Fe head of Bernie Sanders supporter Andrew Gillum\n\nNow there's all kinds of controversy about Gillum uh caught in this thing operate do I am reading\nBy the way that it is possible that the FBI is going to indict Gillum at some ... regardless of the election that he's going to be indicted for some of the [noise] corrupt practices have been investigated and formed\nA we had the news that he had he paid an under\nCover ...\nThe money to buy handled and tickets in New York\nBeyond that emails in tax raise questions on Gillum trips with lobbyist records show Gillum new well in advance that he was out of state meetings with Adam Curry could help him network with power from developers businessmen and lawyers\nI mean this is incredible that a newspaper is doing investigative journalism on a Democrat but the Miami Herald\nIs a it's a it's not so we'll see how that plays out there is a Politico story today I actually saw it last night that Trump fear is a foreign to wipe out\nThat Donald Trump fear is that we're going to lose everything in Florida the socialist in Florida are going to win everything\nAnd so Trump is scheduling even more rallies and more effort in Florida to try to save the day here it is a political started that's the word is being used the Trump fears a Florida wipe out\n\nThere are other news stories that suggest drugs dredge has links to them that are the socialist of America appear ready to win and dominate and convert America after long\nLast so committed socialist policies so you find these stories all over the place [noise] about the intention of voters this ah this cycle\nAnd how they're faring the Charlie Cook report the vaunted inside the beltway analysts who take a look at every election inside out with the election just eleven days away now\nIt seems that the overall Senate playing field won't change much although what appears that some of the races in toss up are getting even tighter\nThat said that it's getting more difficult to see a path to the majority for Democrats with Democrat US Senator Heidi Heitkamp heading for defeat in North Dakota\nDemocrats now need a net gain of three seats to win the majority be one way would be to hold the five Democrats seats and toss up and pick up three of the four Republican seats in toss up\nIf you will read the cook report I'm not going to bother telling you which ones those are but that's how they analyze the bottom lines of this story is that New Jersey has been moved to\nToss up in the cook report New Jersey has been moved to toss New Jersey ought to be deadlock Democrat any day of the year that you look at it New Jersey being in in toss up in Florida remains a\nCoin toss although Democrats see a path to victory for US Senator Bill Nelson well they better he's the incumbent he would have the path to victory in Montana between Jon Tester\nThe incumbent state auditor Matt Rosendale that racist tightened tester maintains an advantage that's either just within or just outside the margin of error there is in addition to the top ... column is the race in New Jersey moves to toss up from lean Democrat [noise]\nNow all of this movement taking place this week\nIn the midst of the bomb scare on the Republican side Republican district
