Russia ... behind the golden any ivy a microphone great to have you here [noise]\nYeah we're going to be discussing them in terms of the media is now flooding zone with polling data showing that it's hopeless for Republicans just folks steel yourself for this this is predictable [noise]\nIt was going to happen and they're also going to say that it's all based around Trump it's all based on Trump hatred it's all based on people rip regretting their vote for Trump a reading the direction America is going in all of that I just saw it happen on CNN\nA independent voter is switching math in ways that Democrats in the run up to mid term elections\nAnd if I were you I've I hold off on on believing it and as we get closer here I Know there's early voting going on we're going to tackle some of this\nI in a in an added to it in a way I Can't wait until the week before the election for a full court press because of\nThe early voting that is uh that that's happening out there so\nIt's just it's an ongoing effort to try to dispel people of popular myth that the left bands together you don't well I think one of the most effective ways\nOf getting people to think about this how many people have you heard people say this is the most important election in our lives and that's why it's not this is not the most important election of our lives to thousands sixteen was\nIf Hillary had one in two thousand six that that's what we need to focus that the kinds of stuff we need to ask people to consider what would be happening in America right now and the past two years of Hillary had one\nWho would be running various cabinet posts and the agencies what do we know today that we would not know if Hillary had one\nIncluding names of people and what they've been doing\nIf you have people between the eyes with what would America be today if Hillary had one it's a different way of getting\nPeople to focus on the importance of the elections um the the drive by us have their formula\nAnd it's rooted in the desire they have it everybody hate Trump and so that desire becomes narrative and then that narrative becomes the result polling data\nAnd since the media so hey it's Trump they want everybody else to therefore the trend is pro Democrat in the mid terms in their polling data because people have awake and then realized what a mistake they made voting for Trump none of that is true\nExcept on the hard left where it's always been true there is nothing new about it and it's not confined to Trump patronage hatred of everybody that isn't them\nLike I said just based on the last two weeks in the Capitol hearing the Democrat Party today as constant deserves to lose in the biggest landslide in a history of landslides and Democrat Party deserves to get ...\nFor the tactics they have engaged in for the actions taken by their lunatic and paid supporters\nAnd it just outrageous the kinds of things that they are engaging in in in a different world and in a sand society they wouldn't be punished greatly\nIn the midterms I still hold out hope that they could be my point is we will get to all of this as the day is unfold\nIn this weekend in coming weeks but here we go with Donald Trump and Leslie stall on sixty minutes provide providers are soundbites work I'm not confident now so the only way to know is to give it a shot the first one is Leslie stall\nTalking to Trump about the supposedly the hostility that he has created between the European Union allies and us\nWell I mean what's ally we have wonderful relationships with a lot of people but we don't teach us much worse than the European Union the European Union on line was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade and that's what they've done is hot and yet they shot hostile sounds hot he always has some of the way they treat us\nWhat somebody can't ... Danley went in with her in this country for so many years I knew willing to get rid of that western alliance now I like they don't then is fine\nBut you know why we shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO to protect your and then on top of that they take advantage of us on trade and like in a don't any more they understand okay\n[noise] so once once again we have here are the concept but just so hostile the hostility it sounds so hostile it sounds so mean eight pounds so it sounds so it's this it's confrontational\nAnd of course in the eyes of the left we want to be Europe they want us to be Europe they want us to be western socialists\nThey think still functioning at a democracy but but that's that's what they want us so we should be forthcoming and tolerant we should be welcoming we should be in ... ourselves and this by the way this is just Donald Trump keeping a number of promises\nThanks Michael this is the ... stock market report with Michael O'Keefe truth and desperate officer for ...

votes I Know people are going to support him befuddles me though back to the Trump sixty minutes interview with Leslie stall we were up here at number just as a big number three this is\nTrump talking about the necessity of consequences\nFor illegal immigration Leslie stall question what about the force separation of migrant children from their parents\nHas the same as the Obama law you know Obama had the same time it was on the books by painted and enforce that line for them who launched that zero tolerance policy [noise] terror families with children\nAnd then everybody decided and of course you don't want separation and frankly when you don't do separate when you\nAllow the parents to stay together okay when you allow that\nThen what happens is people are going to porn talk console you gonna go back to that kind of glasses\nLeslie for coming into our country illegally and part of\nMain part of the reason that I have the blame myself the economy is so strong that everybody wants to come into the United states\nMy fault Leslie I've done such a great job in the economy everybody wants to come here I'll take the blame for it\nNow she's she misspoke there this law on the bus Obama certainly didn't for separation and just didn't get reported because Obama was cool and couldn't do anything wrong and if it was happening when Obama did it than there has to be good reasons for it\nRemember we've got a two tier system of justice in this country and we have a two tier system of media\n\nWhat it was on the books but he didn't force it what is that what\nYou mean it was on the books that Obama didn't enforce the law but Trump begins enforce it but Trump didn't make the law\nThe Democrats Leslie stall included a tempted to make people think that Donald Trump purposely wrote a law or just enacted one that separate they don't run from their family the ... and you wouldn't believe the number of brain dead people actually believe this happened\nI was watching an episode of law and order in your S. U. V. the other night and they had a whole premise some guy keeping abandon kids in his basement in a cage was a hero because he was saving these kids after Trump policy and force them to be a band and he was saving them\n\nAnd he was just running child sex rings with them but they tried to make this guy out to be somewhat\nOf a hero because the whole point of the episode was to bash Trump for separating families whether it's a law that he inherited I've looked explain why the law exists and it's above and beyond they're having to be consequences for coming here illegally a pass to do with the quest for asylum and the fact that\n\nWhere the parents are taken while their cases are decided is not suitable for kids the kids were put in much better surroundings and Sanders wild their uh their family their their their adult\nParents cases are being a Jew became there's nothing there's nothing\nI mean this is the United states of America we do not due to kids what these people are trying to tell you the Republican Party does the kids it's quite the exact opposite it's just more honest me\nOr\nThat the Democrats on the left of engaged in and Trump does not backed down from it and even as I say for writing magazine was stunned that Trump got away with dominating even with these questions a couple of more before the break up next she says do you think that climate change is a hoax\nI think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but I don't know that it's manmade I Will say this um\nI don't want to give Koreans and trillions of dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs I don't want to be put in a disadvantage I Wish you can go to Greenland\nThe Democratic agenda and the only way to keep these Democrats from raising taxes is to do your part vote for Republican Congress on Tuesday November ...

Scott\nIn Oklahoma City right to have you here Hi\nRush good to talk to you don't use her\nLook Elizabeth Warren is resurrecting the one drop rule or an anti bail them a a rule created by a southern plantation owners Democrats say if you have one drop of blood was black you're black\nOr this was this was a protest cool for for for senator so small\nThey don't have to excuse me second hasn't that rural been adopted by civil rights activists now that that that if if you have one drop your going to be called black\nBut that's exactly right intersection allergy requires quantification yeah\nSo when we need to know how much of a percentage of pressure you are versus oppressed this ... this this rulers is grotesque widely discredited used by the KKK\nIn the thirties use can Nazi Germany it against the Jews here she comes again this is actually a dog whistle to her base it's not meant for Republicans it's not meant for conservatives is only about her future run she needs to tell her base\nI'm On board with intersection analogy look how much of an oppressed ram and let's find out your percentage of a pressure to\nWould you define the intersection out of it is a relatively new leftist activists\nConcept that I find that most people to whom I mentioned that have no idea what it is how would you define that\nGlad glad to thanks for the opportunity to\nDo so much more than welcome to find a good host I've I haven't been there and know what I'm thinking and asking when they listen to a caller savings\nI agree with that look a intersection outed comes straight out of Marxism Marx said that at every one is either on a presser or oppressed they're either bourgeois or Pearl uttered it\nAt its later is now being adopted to the idea of being able to declare percentages of what you are how depressed and how much of an oppressor you are it's called intersects finality because instead of just being one camp or the other\nGets spread across race gender sexual preference and other variables\nYes okay that's red intersection out all the foreign me great on washed\nYou're you're talking to your your\nSpeaking in language of uh people formerly educated on Marxism many people aren't that's why it's so successful\nUm yes any intersection out I mean it's basically something that has been constructed by these Marxist just saying that all of these different leftist organizations meet somewhere they all intersect with each other the feminist having this strain about them that that that I'm\nA ... with that with militant Islam is that then with illegal immigrants and their activist and we're all of these people intersect is worry about unified\nWell yes but it also applies to the individual because of these let's say five different dimensions you you are on a different scale and all of those and they intersect into a single number quantifiable says that this is how much of an oppressor\nOr oppressed you are this is where you're on the scale\nOf course this is the root of all this and there was a recent white privilege stuffed ... absolutely\nRight so now Elizabeth Warren because she wants to uh justify her cultural appropriation of a Harvard professor ... has to claim a particular percentage of intersection now or the oppression\nTo speak their language so she is saying that she is an old press she's asked him anyway she's a woman therefore she's impressed by the patriarchy and now I Am not a one thousand twenty fourth Indian she is impressed by the white man\nWhich is a a again a resurrection of the one drop rule this percentage is so low as to be a joke you know I if I could say I can I took a DNA test about four years ago and of course you don't normally you'd never see me but believe me I'm whites\nHowever when I discovered was zero point eight percent sub Saharan Africa well that doesn't mean I'm going to Harvard and going to claim a professorship in African American studies but I have what is that almost eight times\nMore a sub Saharan African black heritage and me and she does Native American just\nPray just submitted sub Saharan is not automatically quote unquote black\nWell that that's right in in this instance because we've identified the ancestor for the Afrikaners are not black uh I well I I I understand what you're saying I Am referring to blacks than okay All right\nI just want to best because that sub Saharan this is somebody what do you mean sub zero one is is what it was it and then you start talking to the sub continent than some people really get confused here until they from I'm from India or over to sub Saharan Africa is below the arid desert a which is where most of the population of Africa is most of it\nThere is some north of the Sahara Desert as well and I get I I I get your point a and her reason for doing this\nAll of that not withstanding the accuracy of it not withstanding the left is pretty upset that she chose this particular time to do this because they think it is totally self
