uh let me ask you some a week from today if the Democrats lose what happens are they going to get even crazier\nUh yeah I I think they will\nUm because it's all emotion as I said and you know I was

because I\nDo but he's coming from in Maynard doesn't want to work um you know\nI get some of the format don't get anything from CNN anyway I'm watching it and they're they're actually gloating on CNN seven days before the vote I guess maybe they have secret information that Trump's\nAnd the Republicans are not going to do well but there were like gloating today and I'm going to be gloating about are you gloating that you want seven thousand undocumented migrants to come in to the United states when you know there's a three year backlog here asylum cases\nIs this what your gloating about is that good for the country\nIt's not good for the migrants is not good for anybody\nAnd your gloating him I don't know what their gloating about maybe they can do a crawl mark underneath where gloating about this so I Would know\nHey when the president says it could be Thirteen in their gang members or drug dealers or terror that's a pretty good thing to always be suspicious of if you're in charge a law enforcement again\nI just think it's a diversion I mean in any group of seven thousand you're going to have ten percent which would be seven hundred who are evil bad people I mean that's the really break down of any group [noise]\nBut but here's the real story if you were going to accept people at this rate to apply for asylum do you not think there's going to be five hundred thousand or a million coming behind them\n[laughter] but\nWhen you when you're admitting people for three years at least\nTo live in this country All right because they seek asylum do not think war it's going to get out and when you have fifty percent of all immigrant families both legal and illegal on means tested welfare\nHow is that going to affect the New York state tax payer is paying the highest taxes

out\nBut that's one of and best exchanges\nYeah and I I like to do that but I had to do it at that point\nSo the interviewers today I mean I don't think they tell her guess anything I mean they ... as I said we were seeing a diminishing of quality ah I don't know really why these are these are plum jobs\nAnd um look the debate is the debate you bring your facts I'll bring my facts and the fastest

that and he's trying to send your over the edge with this stuff to make sure you go vote it's again\nA classic expression or illustration of how they haven't the slightest idea who the people are voting for Donald Trump who remain supportive of Donald Trump but back we'll get to more details that I ... back to my little test so I read all these people at the event last night\nIt's going to be a red wave Russia and listen to you every day and I'm telling you it's going to be a red way but I said I Hope you're right but let me\nLet me tell you what we're up against forty five Republicans have announced their resignations\nForty five I mean that is a huge number many\nOf them are committee chairmen not all but many of them are committee chairmen and they are resigning are retiring because they don't want to go back to being Trump's you know just regular house members it's a it's a big come down so they want to try to parlay their years in the house into private sector success\nLicense forty five seat incumbency has has incredible power\nReelection power certainly old back me up on those these are students the incumbent in house races windows Ninety eight percent of the time what we've got forty five Republicans who are not incumbents we've got forty five Republicans who've never run before\nNobody knows I mean there are districts they're known but they're not as known as incumbents are no not as well known so that that makes some of this somewhat iffy\nI and and then there is the traditional statistical aspect which says that the party that\nHolds the White House in the first myth terms after a presidential election all ways Louis ... seats so forty five seats they have a\nTough to defend\nAs opposed to if those forty five had not resigned and we're still in the house you can count a lot of those is reelect that you can't count now has re elect and this is what the left in the dry buys are counting on\nIs that many of those forty five will slip and then you've got a contest among races are in in other parts Senate of course now they're saying now I mentioned this to all of these people they didn't care and they said they're aware of this they knew about the resigned\nResigning members of Congress retiring they ... they didn't know the number not all of them did\nBut their attitude was that it doesn't matter it doesn't matter uh the American people are fed up\nAnd they are sophisticated and the people who are elected Trump know exactly what's at stake they're not going to sit home they're not gonna twiddle their thumbs they're not confident they're not sitting there thinking that job was done when they went and voted in two thousand six day and it was kind of pleasant to um\nTo what the here although there was a lot of

me being blamed the Oklahoma City bombing\nBy Bill Clinton and it's just ratcheted up from there and it's all an attempt to suppress political speech the left doesn't want to hear\n[noise] [noise] but

it was the chief justice for ever immortalized in infamy\nIt held at black slaves were not citizens so Congress got into gear and pass the fourteenth amendment guaranteed\nThat freed slaves would have all the privileges of citizenship by providing quote all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\nAre citizens of the United states and the state where he may resign which means the draft or is it the fourteenth amendment had no intention of conferring citizenship I'm the children of aliens who happened to be born here in fact\nThe very author of the citizenship clause senator Jake I'm Howard of Michigan\nExpressly said this is why the original intent of founding documents is so important quote\nThis meaning the fourteenth amendment this will not of course include person who was born in the United states who are foreigners who are aliens who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers\nIt was expressly intended to confer citizenship to slaves and their descendants\nThere was an Eighteen eighty four case el versus Wilkins Supreme Court ruled the fourteenth amendment did not even couldn't for citizenship on Native Americans\nBecause they were subject to tribal jurisdiction not us jurisdiction will an illegal alien here is not subject to us jurisdiction there under the jurisdiction of where they came from that

I I have at times I marveled that this country is held together the way it has for many years as if has\nGiven the only thing that really holds us all together as a piece of paper or a series of pieces of paper the U.S constitution the honor system and the reverence the respect for that document is what's held us together\nAnd all of our years we have never elected a desperate or a tyrant who want to literally\nRip it up throw it away and establishes on tyrannical dictatorship but it's amazing what we're getting dangerously close to the same thing happening when one of our political parties refuses to accept\nElection results for whatever reason it make it up while it was stolen the Russians this or that if it doesn't matter when they refused to accept\nIt means that there really isn't any unity around the premise of our country\nAnd we may not unify issue to issue to issue but we always have been unified about the premise of America as founded that's what's under assault today and that is what is in my mind\nA profoundly dangerous and we are raising him have been since the seventies generation after generation of students who have been taught things that have nothing\nIn common with the founding of the country we have not taught children we've ... we've ... you go back to the days when we learned that um I'm In junior high intramural football and soccer ball that nobody won\nThat there were no outs in baseball you know no kid ever struck out the kidney hit until they hit the ball put it in play there were no losers there were no winners\nOutcome based education two plus two was five if you thought it was by we weren't going to humiliate people were wrong the people who are really smart in school or in a slow them down and we're not going to service their superior ability to learn and we're going to slow them down so it was not to offend anybody else\nAnd we've not gotten to this point where kids have been raised cobbled\nThey had been taught phony notions of self esteem self esteem today does not derive from achievement an accomplishment it derives from I have a right to help self esteem parents have been\nTeaching little kids your perfect little Johnny you're perfect little Suzie I'm In it and not prepared for adversity insult when nobody has been raised to deal with adversity which in this case is losing an election we have temper tantrums and we have a child light snowflake behavior on college campuses\nAnd we have a political party that's behind all of this\n\nRight now it's rooted in the failure to accept the results of an election of that is on going\nAnd now on Twitter as I said you can find posts Hollywood people promising that there will be blood if the Democrats do not when\nThe house back there will be blood so people are being threatened if not directly but in a generic sense all of it is designed to limit turn out\nI think it's having the exact opposite impact on people I think the left and the drive by media continue to understand misunderstand\nWho Democrats are Trump voters are why they are Trump voters and why they aren't going anywhere [noise] uh let's see if we were also here being being told that we need a new kinds of civility that the Trump\nPresidency and all of his supporters are promoting all this in ... and the violence and so forth\nWhen it could be said that it's the exact opposite I ... I think reasonable am harping on the fact people refused to accept election results it's profoundly indicative of who they are\nAnd it's a large explanation of why they're behaving as they as they do\nAnd it's the refusal to accept is not just because Trump one it's not just because they hate Trump it's more than that it's because they lost they were fully expecting to win and they didn't until they simply refuse it because\nIt's not a matter of thinking it's a matter of feeling they don't feel happy don't feel good when they feel bad and something's not right\nAnd that's also been part of the education system\n[noise]\nSo we'll get some headlines Tom ...

here\nThank you rush I wanted to thank you for telling people about the truth intent of sexual on an amendment fourteen because I've been trying to do the same thing for years and people are on in the midst impression that it simply means if a child born to illegal aliens in this country automatically becomes an American citizen\nYou can't blame 'em it's been the case since the sixties and it's it's it's um\n... it it it it's we're we're dealing with mass ill education that's taken place on a lot of things in this country that's why it's so important that we've got a president willing to push back on it yet right 'cause what's causing this is causing any discussion of it this is how it happens\nI've told everybody that this is what pushing back is going to look like so\nWhile you were talking about Dred Scott as a reason why the fourteenth amendment was ratified which was actually on July Nineteen sixty eight but\nAnother reason why it was ratified is because it goes back to the thirteenth amendment that abolish slavery well the southern states weren't going to accept that so they passed laws are codes that were so restrictive the plaques\nThat essentially made them slaves once again and they were called the black codes so then Congress said okay you want to play that game then we're going to formally recognize former slaves of citizens which will make them subject to all the privileges or immunities to the citizens in several strays ... article for section two claws one\nSo after that the those black folks were polished and that's why we have a ... you know the fourteenth amendment\nAnd matter of fact you know the one of the ... the the guy is considered the founding father to the Fourth Amendment was represented by the name of John Bingham from Ohio\nAnd he made some remarks about the fourteenth amendment if you're a few years later and you can find that in a house report number twenty two dated Eighteen Seventy one January thirtieth\nSold all explains how this joint committee passed the fourteenth amendment so President Trump with all due respect to him he wouldn't be not be ending birthright citizenship because it never happened he would be upholding the U.S constitution\nWell that's the point that is exactly the point that I made is why he shouldn't\nDo this and that's his point people have looked into this\nMay have found different rationale than you did but the point is if you look at the original intent of people who were involved in writing the fourteenth amendment all Trump is doing is enforcing the constitution and taking it back to its original intent the fourteenth amendment was never intended\nTo confer citizenship on people here illegally or the sons and daughters of ambassadors are foreign agents it was expressly\nWritten spoken first citizenship on slams\nAnd now it has been expanded and again that you can trace it back to the Nineteen sixties when this began which coincides with the Democratic party wanting to re open immigration you know I I still run into people who do not believe me when I tell them\nThat as a nation we suspended for the most part I may never there's always been\nA people being rapid citizenship but we suspended mass immigration from the mid Nineteen twenties to the mid sixties\nPretty express reason of allowing all of those who would emigrated starting in the late Eighteen hundreds all the way through the Nineteen twenties to assimilate\nThat's what immigration was people were coming here to become Americans and they wanted to be Americans\nThey didn't have to give up their birthright they didn't happen and they they settled in ah in in neighborhoods are Irish have their neighborhoods in New York and Philadelphia the Italians\n... ditto but they wanted to become Americans they learned English uh and they became part of American culture at ... of which there is a distinct and unique American culture which is rooted in western\nCivilization that's what's different now there's no interest in that\nWe don't even make a serious effort at assimilating we're Balkan icing they use this term tribal but we're more organizing our population because modern arrivals don't all sneak\nTo become Americans people trying to get them on the on the legal immigration side of course are\nBut this this mass illegal immigration has an entirely different purpose behind it and political support is entirely different for it then for standard uh immigration so what Trump is doing is simply with his executive order if he does this\nWill be reestablishing the constitution and re asserting it so yeah no you're exactly right about that so two calls to great points the the guy who from Pittsburgh who asked a question though he lives there and he watches the news and he's been\nBlamed for the Senate gone surely [noise]\nWe've got to tone it down and we got a company gotta we gotta do this we've got to do that\nAnd if it's being Senate that's being said in the media you know it's all aimed at Trump and his supporters a pre shit that called again Southampton in New York build your next great to have you with us or Hi\nThank you Russian thanks for all that you do for us yes you ... ... with the ... um with regard to the fourteenth amendment why not take it to the Supreme Court or is that where this is going to end up actually show that they can decide oh it'll be their language says it'll get there and they'll get their okay yeah\nIt'll it'll have to get there that no Senator Graham is going to offer legislation that the Senate\nAh look we're way way far away from this we're just getting the conversation started here which\nI don't make the solution to this is enterprise zones in El Salvador or Guatemala\nUh maybe long term a economic relief for any nation having problem is a greater dose of capitalism but\nThere isn't the political climate for ... and many of these countries there their dictatorships one degree or another\nAnd this is an immediate problem that's going to have to be done because if it's not they're just going to keep coming and it's ... and\n[noise] we're not going to stop these caravans if we start implementing a tax free enterprise zones nominees nation as where American companies going to relocate and hire them there instead of hiring them here 'cause that's if people aren't capable being hired anywhere\nYet\nI understand that if you want to talk of political theory and economic theory it makes sense in the world and otherwise you know quote unquote normal circumstances but this is a short term political movement here this caravan [noise] I looked\nNo George Soros I'm George Soros his name has become I'm kinda like a bogeyman for everything people mean far left wing radicals when they mentioned George Soros I don't know who's behind somebody is and their purpose is to destabilize the United states the purposes not to improve life from these people\nThis caravan whoever's behind this is not really trying to do something for these people to make their lives better this is being done to it to invoke damage on the United states particularly Trump and to advance the political advantages and notions of a particular political party\nWhich wants to welcome these people in as dependent voters\nA jam in Madison and Virginia and great to have you with us You're next on the E R B network high\n[noise] Ah yes fresh up here I got my husband and I adopted or Hispanics\nWho were in foster care and we had had him a couple of years and then they cannot with action their parents about the Italy Gulf of Mexico they had flipped over the border at least four times the illegal at one time at the end of each time they had children here too and then they come back to my left them with the grandparents came back I\nHad two more went back and got him a long story short is that even today I had you know they were came to us thanking Trump was horrible and that when he would send them all back home and and you know now they love Trump and they think this has got to stop and have an escape because my father's in prison for twenty eight years with his\nMother fled the Mexico not of course that's\nA kind of ... awful crimes against their own children\nAnd you know I just said [laughter]\nAnd they can do to stop that he's got to stop it because they they come up and they have these babies and I have another situation I can tell you that way you know our country has caught where they had a Fifteen year old girl at the border seven months pregnant at the end they let her across they sent the other six to eight teams with our back\nOn my stomach so they can't say we don't have heart they do the situation they need help\nBut you know even Hispanic girls that thought Trump was horrible that he was to send all these people that they realize now that he is doing what the country\nWell we'll take them you know whatever they realize it is a is is is fine with me of course it's it's\nA\nOnce you understand what's going on it's impossible to support\nIt's it's just it's impossible support on a little less\nYou have particular political notions of what the United States purpose in the world is and\nWhat we owe\nAnd so forth but in in terms of being the best policy for the United states it isn't anyway appreciate the jam thanks much will take a break and be back at\nRush Limbaugh\nI'm tired Cox owner of ... dot com bust or as a family owned and operated business I started over eight years ago when my wife and

S. Trump said in an interview with Fox News that if any of the migrants do make it to the border and apply for asylum\nUs plans to hold them until such time as their trial takes place we're going to build tent cities were going to put tense up all over the place and they're going to wait\nKnowing it didn't announce was putting Joe Arpaio in charge of them\nUnder current protocol a a peace says migrants so clear an initial screening are often or at least until their cases are decided\nIn immigration court which can take several years that's not the official protocol the official protocol is with their detained\nUntil their amnesty hearing but the ACLU when the ... so we're able to get the Ninth Circuit do agree that this forays settlement which required to children being released after twenty days and that's why there's family separation but left again\nWe can hold the asylum seekers for as long as it takes and we can't hold a kids for longer than twenty days they have to be released left wing policy has codified but the Ninth Circuit court of appeals trumpet nothing to do with it the Republicans had nothing to do with it says it left wing policy\n[noise]\nLet's go to the audio soundbites I mentioned earlier um\n[noise] it and some people\nI'm not even gonna with knowledge of the things that are saying today because there are just totally off the rails\nBut it's predictable as the sun coming up it started well I Can't say it started\nWith me but I'm sure this had instances of occurring long before my show came along but when the Oklahoma City bombing took place whenever it was Nineteen Ninety four I think what whatever it was Clinton tried to blame me\nFor riling up Timothy McVeigh with all kinds of anti government rhetoric\nAngry voices on the right ... and I I ... I thought I saw\nAbout ... Michigan Militia shortwave radio not worth what the excuse was so now\nThat's become a me we have here is this a montage\nYeah we got about just CNN people and some National Review people uh radicalizing St ... saying that Trump is radicalizing domestic terrorists just like ISIS listen to this\nWhat are we learning about how the Pittsburgh suspect was radicalized\nThese men appear to have been radicalized these men appear to have been radicalized\nRadicalized people seeing what the president and his supporters I thought that the\nWeather is Sarah Huckabee or Donald Trump the half truth thing leads to people getting radicalized who was radicalizing people in America Donald Trump certainly a parent's responsibility\nFor the bomber was radicalized into sort of this Trump super fan community where president has radicalized so many more people than I ever had\nJulia I off there she is with the I guess it ... she pronounces you off your shoes GQ and I think she's a ...\nYes GQ writer Julia your feet Trump was radicalized many more people than ISIS she said that while I was a guest on CNN and then she apologizes for claiming Trump was radicalized more people than ISIS\nShe apologized to Monday shortly after claiming a on the air but Trump has radicalized more people than ISIS Twitter blow up after she made the comments since I don't I used to be one Twitter blow up it\nWas all liberals that was all leftists you know Twitter is blowing up and left us all over the place now\nHere's the next one CNN Tonight with Don Lemon speaking with the former Republican National committee chairman Ryan ... Mike shields\nAnd Washington Post columnist Max Boot about the links between Trump's comments on the actions of the bomber and the synagogue showed her\nIn Nineteen Ninety five when Bill Clinton blamed Rush Limbaugh and talk radio or for the Oklahoma City bombing you have to be very careful that you don't start to tell people that their political speech isn't allowed any more because there was a direct connection between political speech and violence has a very serious thing to do that\nJihad as terrorists lone wolf carries out an attack we always ask what radicalized and what inspired him to go to violence we have to ask the same thing about right wing terrorists of whom there are a lot more in this country right now than there are as long as terrorists\nAnd you cannot divorce the actions of the second ... from the sick rhetoric that you're hearing\nThat's Max Boot Max Boot used to be as conservative as anybody you know uh in the Washington establishment something you may think that's not a very conservative but he's certainly wasn't this\nWe have to answer the same thing\nAbout these right wing terrorists of whom there are a lot more in this country right now than there are Islamic terrorists\nYou can't divorce the actions of these people from the sick rhetoric that you're hearing\nSo what he's talking about is you have in a jihadi who walked into a mosque one day was a perfectly innocent young guy had no ill intent toward any buddy walks into a mosque starts listening to your mom preaching comes out of their Osama bin Laden junior\n\nAnd he's saying that's exactly what's happening in the unit so somebody Donald Trump is is radicalizing people Donald Trump is encouraging this\nThe moms are telling people what to do and how to do it they're being taught how to make bombs how to explode themselves with bombs they're being nobody on our side doing this is ridiculous\n\nIt's the comparison alone and it comes from never Trump ers who are frustrated that they have been able\nTo diffuse Trump they'd been unable to dispatch Trump\nAnd it's always a one way street we never heard about Bernie Sanders radicalizing the guy that shot up\nThe Republican baseball practice we never hear about the whoever was radicalized\n\nAny of these leftist so Hillary Clinton right it's always this one way street there's always you don't want to root it invokes it's rooted in the belief that not a single conservative can make up his or her mind but what about anything one of the first criticisms\nOf this program dating back to Nineteen eighty eight was that you are a bunch of mind numbed robots and I ... valley and I\nAm telling you what to think every day because you're too stupid to make up your mind on your own I'm telling you what to think I'm telling you what to do I'm telling you how to vote I'm telling you want to go that has been the criticism and what does that rooted in it's rooted in\nThe presumption up superior intellect to people on the left and the belief that you are literal idiots\nWho cannot make up your mind on anything what they never understood and they made no effort to understand that and the fact that they make no effort to understand it or understand Trump and his voters is what's largely doing them in\nThey never understood that you already believe what you believed you already thought what you thought when I came along\nAll I did was repeat\nWhat all of us had been saying to each other but you ... you were not hearing it anywhere in national media what you believed was always laugh damp or criticize made fun of mocked but you were never\nGiven any respect whatsoever than this program came along and it reflected what you think and what you say well you were talking about with your friends and that's why you're glom onto what\nNot because you were sitting out there in your relative ignorance day in and out all of a sudden started learning things so the presumption is that you're so stupid and you're so mindless\nThat's been golly you can tell you how do you think or tell you when to start blowing things up or window started shooting people\nAnd now we've even got never Trump conservatives or out saying this kind of thing\nAnd it all boils down you know what I keep the essence of things that keeps\nWorries they're real anger at directed at you think it's Trump and it is but the real anger is for you who voted for him\nThat is where they are fed up beyond their ability to express it in the fact that they can't talk you out of supporting Trump there to be tied\nYours the reason that this was all going because you have the stupidity of voting for the guy and now you're blowing things up and you're shooting people\nJust deeply darkly insulting it's not promoting civility it's not promoting unity quick\nCongressman Dan Donovan knows better Dan Donovan will keep your tax dollars from paying for abortion and Dan Donovan will support laws to protect unborn babies from painful late

have you here with us so\nThank you so much for taking my call today rash and thank you for all you do you ...\nI just wanted to make a quick point a hard left and the media and the specially Hollywood and I think it has been engaging in gas lighting or the right\nWould you expect when you define that I hear so many people to use that word [noise] okay would you tell me how your impending it to be defined\nOkay gas lighting and the nice comic sample is when I'm In a family they cripple usually been nice this child in the family to take care of all of that picking and burned\nAnd what they do is say ridicule that person they talk about then they sneer at then and especially when people aren't looking and then if that person dares to get angry oh look look\nLook at look at how bad you are and then they tell everyone they know how bad this person is and they make up the entire narrative and what they believe rush it that that person is an idiot they're not evil\nNow I'm not saying it all that every I'm liberal person is like this I think that they're these kinds of people exist on both sides but I think that's a left elevate people like this and I think the right height that shut them up um and that's really all you can do I mean you can't always control he's on your side\nBut you can control the you elevate and I'm lying is perfectly fine if your cat fighting um and especially the a dog whistle\nBecause you just imagine what the person says oh well clearly that was written it's well they use the word the oh well don't you don't want to be at the dog was not one someone on the right you did that for trying they use the word be that's just that kind of logic\nWhat white and look what word H.

riddled in the morning six to tend to borrow on seven ten W a war I'm Jeff McKinney\nAnd again we have fifty two degrees and the time is to thirty one or two [noise]\n\n\nLet me explain what I meant I'm suffering here I'm In the last two callers have been speaking a mile a minute and I've been unable to hear enough of what they were saying [noise]\nTo comprehend so I had to put it together after they hung up the most\nRecent caller I lost her when she just how families will gas light a\nThe weakest number of the family I I've never seen that so I'm rolling it back and forth on my head but then I finally heard when she was talking about her definition gas light a I got an ... her point was that the Democrats the media and get to define everything\nThey get to define that get to decide everything and what they say is is\nThis is what is in anybody isn't that then of course as abnormal or what have you and that that that has been my point is is a different way of saying\nThat\nIt irritates the hell out of me too I watch the media that my my favorite example of it and I'm Sorry for being redundant here Indiana and there are countless examples here Indiana passed a religious freedom Restoration Act\nThe media hated it was\nIn response to people not being allowed to tell gay couples no I'm not going to make a cake for your reception I my religion doesn't allow me to do that so these gay couples but then they would target these places hoping for that reaction and they'd file lawsuits trying to put these bakeries and photo shop businesses out of business\nAnd the media would come right along and act like that was entirely justified that these big\nIt's what we feel is to bake a cake or take photos on gay wedding reception or what have you uh so when ... when when Indiana passes along Pence who's the governor the media was out ranged and they began to\nReport on this as the whole country was outraged that Indiana was somehow a loan out post of racism and bigotry and homophobia\nAnd it's this this this\nAttitude and all things that they do wear what they report in the way they report it and what they say is what is normal and they get to decide who the big it's are and who the uh the racists are and once that happens your tag you're it and then they ran around and they started knocking on doors\nAsking businesses\nWouldn't you bake a pizza when you when you make a pizza for why they were and they found a little girl Twenty one year old woman a running a pizza shop for her family no we wouldn't it would be against the salt they zeroed in on this Twenty one year old woman and they wanted to make her out\nTo me that typical Indiana bed yet and she was just answering their questions naive way and in his leash she was just trying to be honest with them she bought that they were really interested in what\nThey were asking about they were looking for a victim they were looking for a target and she fit the bill and so for however long the reporting that went on Indiana was odd the people in it are odd weird racist beget sexist home of pubs\nI Know exactly what the caller Mitt Democrats get to decide well let me tell you something folks\nNot true anymore that may be the way they report it and they met that may be what they try to create but people rebelled against they've called Donald Trump people rebelled against that the Democrats since Obama had been losing elections don't lose sight of this\nStarting in two thousand ten the Democrats have lost over a thousand maybe it's closer to twelve hundred electoral seats at federal state local level\nAnd there's a reason for this they are being rejected\nAnd the media is being rejected as as well and so gas if if if what the media dead ... to the state of Indiana is gas lighting as if that's what the definition is now heartily endorse it and ah and accepted and it's this arrogance\nAnd just the primacy of superiority that goes along with that kind of coverage and it's it's everywhere it's you have\nA the synagogue shooting while the obvious the obvious explanation\nIs that Donald Trump and his conservative media posse are radicalizing and this becomes the narrative this becomes just the way it is and everybody thinks this\nIs is crucial for me the way they report these things to make it look like they are the majority and they are what's normal went increasingly they aren't\n\nAnd what really is happening here is that people who know they're not by definition\nSpent numbers normal are trying to turn everything upside down so that what they are is normal and what everybody else is is the one that's odd ball abnormal the media's right in their facilitating this or that I'm telling you it isn't it used to work like a charm\nAnd on many people still does we still have a lot of people in our side still want to couch how the media still wanted to find whether or not conservatives or Republicans are succeeding by virtue of whether the media as being nice to them or not it's frustrating to know when when I run into people like that and they're out there\nBut the\nElectoral results just in the past two years ah indicate that people are more and more aware of this and pushing back\nAgainst that\nUh to see what [laughter]\nI didn't see this I didn't watch Fox News Sunday on Sunday but apparently Chris ...
