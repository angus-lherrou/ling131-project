small team it's related to it and doing whatever needed to be done to get out of\nMy life just got better\nWell congratulations because you did a great job there's another story is amazing and and I say you should be in front of colleges preaching everyday and talking to a business schools an entrepreneur schools because\nThese kids who are coming out of school they they they are taught what's in the books and that's what I Love about what my daughter's earnings ... learning real life this is real life\nThis is a real life and and people don't understand the value of credit\nYou know I Want to ask you ... you know I have tons of questions I mean I could spend three four or five hours on on the air with but it's it's you know ... banks banks one always I just always blows my mind right obviously the psychology of a bank is and and a financial institution as lending you money\nGiving you credit you know you have to think about how they think and that's how you can you can you know I don't want to say get over on them like get get get to work get the credit that you need is what I've accomplished you want to accomplish\nRight is banks only ... usually want to give credit to people who have money\nAnd then and then the people who don't have money they don't want to give credit to and those are the people that need the credit\n... so how do you deal with that or\nDoes the best way to do with it is you have to find alternative funding research\nFind alternative sources and that's what I you know I'm starting out you know after all rebuilt my credit a traditional bike would not give me money so what I did was built up my credit access in other areas you know and I figured out other other funding resources because I was determined to\nYou make my dream happened I was determined to you know what I'm saying get the things that I needed to get to in life by any means necessary there's always a plan B job and I think that a lot of people just don't realize the\nRight and and and and I think that there's such a thing as smart credit bad credit obviously it's how you use it in high and and and how you deal with it um you know talk about credit abuse\n[noise] oh man so much of that in my twenties [laughter]\nYou know I think we all had it a little bit\n[laughter] credit abuse is really just a just really\nNot really understanding that the relationship that needs to be with your credit I think that a lot of people don't understand it it really goes along with your money you have to have a relationship with your money and your credit and you have to understand that you have to use it wisely your credit is your reputation it's everything\nBy man I Love it I Love it and that's what I preach I present all the time your credit is your reputation somebody gives you something and you don't give it back to them and you don't pay it back to them you're done your reputation on ruin\nYour done and no one will ever trust you but the difference is is like when it happens with companies like they tell on you\nAnd they and then they tell her for everybody else to see it and then it completely ruined a reputation and no one else wants to do business with you and us invest a difference between businesses and personal you know personal relationships I think most people operate on the same principles of a business was related to lending people money\nYou know it's really based on the relationship that you have with the person that's going to really\nAllow you to lend them\nCertain amounts of money and I just think that it just if you approach your credit with that same mindset\nAs you will like a relationship\nI think you'll really see that things are really turn around for you it's it's always tell people your credit is more than just a score\nYes yes it is it so it's so deep you know it's it's interesting\nBecause you know I look at it and I I look at credit is multifaceted and you know I I almost like a relationship you have to work it and and I think that people most people when you correct me if I'm wrong because you're the credit doctor you're the man\nI'm you know but I'm an entrepreneur and I use it as a tool in my business to get where I Want to get in to accomplish what I Want to accomplish but I think that most people don't look at their credit until there and really analyze the credit and understand it until it's time for them to need it\nAnd then they're like now what\nI Love that you said that that is so Tom a priest is so much people have to do a better job of being on their credit from the beginning this is why it's important and I love that you are on your your daughters about um you know them you know on their credit and I do\nYou know I did notice that in one of your daughters are thinking about like build some hotels and stuff and and\nYour gas correct yes she ... she wants to build the luxury hotels\nYeah and I mean in addition to an addition to that his money you know she is going to be to lead to sell owner oh you know what I'm saying so that's where her credit her reputation her value that's where that's going to come in and I mean by use instilled in that in her young which is what we have to do a better job of door\nNo doubt and you know what I look at it and I always say credit easy to your friend or your enemy is my friend an entrepreneur it's my friends were going to take a

just remember we got a quarter of a million listeners out there listening to you so you know let's get back to watching your credit and the importance of it I watch it you know I studied my credit I studied on a on a weekly basis I Am I'm On it I Know my credit doing I Know you know I I look at my reports to credit reports\nTalk to me about monitoring your credit in what people should be doing to monitor your credit to let's let's talk to the listeners because\nMost people don't understand that they would like I said before we the commercial break we talked about it they wait until it's time that when they need to go buy a refrigerator or car or a house or they want to buy a vacation home in there and and all of a sudden they I Can't do it that the bank doesn't want on me the money\n[noise] I think that you definitely have to make sure that it's monitor at all times I Love the you know you monitor all the time I monitor mind constantly religiously um and there's different apps that are available that makes it so easy for you to monitor your credit\nIf you're a person who doesn't have the extra money I mean those credit cards which free\nI mean you may not get the most accurate credit score but at least you can get an idea of what's actually going on with the reports and things of that nature and keeping up on that because\nYou're going to need credit you know it can it can happen in the state of emergency just like you said and most people wait until they have the bad you know until they need something to look at it\nAnd by you kind of being proactive and looking into it beforehand you know I say at least once a month you should be checking it out um there's like I said credit karma I personally use experience\nBecause I like to see um my personal psycho score is like an actual example or a model and not be the exact model but it's going to give me the closest and the most accurate depiction of what a business is going to see when they're looking at me\nSo this was important because once you have that you have that knowledge and you've built your credit or you want it to be at\nAnd you know it's worth just certain level you have control over who you want to do business gas\nReally about you want to be in the position to where you can control okay I don't want to do with with you I Want to actually work with you because you have a better right and you have this you know you have this promotion I Want to do with with few verses you you want so always remain a control and that's what our show people yeah I Know about you\nHaving control over your credit your financial situation and not allowing these businesses to really dictate the most she making your life\nRight you know what I I equate it to you know I mean it's like you know you ... if you want to win a war you have to have ammunition and I I look at credited ammunition\nPeriod as it is is your pet issue a ticket in right\nTom as your ticket in the door I mean don't get me wrong you yes you have to have money but like say for example if you walk into a bank and you have twenty grand and you're a cow and say you only need five all of your credit scores in the five hundred\nThey don't care about twenty granted the banks are going to give you any money right you know what I'm saying because they won't even give you an opportunity because if you're a bad reputation\nRight you know and that's the thing so how does monitoring\nYour credit score affect your credit score because I always hear it and I've experienced personally myself you know and and and obviously I'm On a you know I borrow in a different level for businesses in real estate and you know but but but on a personal level you know\nOn and one um I have a question for you you know it you you you cleaned bankruptcy twice which is absolutely a ... to me is like ... three times three that mind boggling to me I have never coming back to see my entire life\nThank God but I I Can't imagine how it feels to be under under that pressure you did it three times and you you spun around and you came out and made and I think it's an absolutely it's the American dream it's it's an American dream story\nHow do you repair your credit people and they're sitting out there have bad credit they want to borrow they want to buy a car you know I I look at it you know you have consumers who want to do things but then I look at it from a business standpoint\nYou can't operate a business without credit unique credit you need to you need to uh you know have credit lines you need to access to credit to be able to to how to run a business it's just the way it works it's the way that America works we'll talk about that in a little bit but how to repair your credit you got bad credit you're sitting out there\nMaybe eating claim bankruptcy you just have bad credit or maybe it did claim bankruptcy taught let's talk about both scenarios how\nLet's start with the first one which is you're just sitting out there you have bad credit you you were made on your payments you you you have a bad reputation how you clean it up\n[noise] okay well before and this applies to both but and I know this may sound a little cheesy but for me the best way to the the number one thing that you have to do to repair your credit is it all starts in your mind is a mental it's it's it's ... it's the mentality that you have related to your\nLove it you know ... I always say life is Ninety percent mental and ten percent video you have to have the mentality you have to train your mind to think a certain way\nYou know I did it in a very young age you train your mind and once you do that you can't think any other way and when you see people with bad credit you wonder like what were you thinking did you not understand the value of this how\nDid you not make this payment you know and and and people don't understand there's more than one way this cat there's other ways to to do things and make payments\nThat maybe you missed overweight on\nAnd because you know you just didn't you didn't uh you properly execute so\nMhm absolutely so I think that for a person I just you know just has you know a a bad credit situation the first thing that you have to do is look at your data by trade on the data analysts so that's the first thing as I Do is I actually were research data\nYeah well I I I call that in my world and I and I try and teach all the people that work for me and and and they're surrounded by me\nAnd you know when I go speaking colleges I teach I teach I I Try and teach the kids about this is Michael those your instruments and you can't fly an airplane without instruments you know if you ever walk into a cockpit of ... and the planes in the air the pilots fly the plane off of instruments and if you don't have instruments guess what happened to your plane crashes\nYes absolutely yeah\nWe're we're going to take a second hold hold your thought we have Anthony calling in from queens he has an issue with his credit and his credit card payment and he wants you want your advice go heading up any\nShow a cycle the seventies I missed a payment is paying out too much money and I went overboard I Can't afford it now it's like it's like nine nine hundred nine change your mind paying out\nOnly the only to spot that pay fourteen hundred dollars ah my Merrick and express and uh my uh\nAnd then he can you turn your radio down we got a little echoing I Want to I I Want one will be able to hear you an answer your question\nI'll do that right now so thank you\nYeah so uh it's like it's like coming to like almost nine fifty a month that up a out what credit cards and and I said my marriage press had paid off for a change in my discover card is like two of us do laundry\nAnd ah I have a tweet we caught with the uh the Capitol along and and that's that comes to like four fifty a month\nAnd and that's why let me share of JC penny I over there too so it\nIs such a like a hundred Seventy five dollars a month\nHello hello yeah\nBasically that's just starting out this week it's not that I'm a lifelong ... dollars a short and I can't I Can't come up with it and you know I borrow money from friends and stuff like that just to keep the credit going now like that come into stole all I just can't do it in ... [noise]\nYou know what to do I don't want to quit and I\nHave to take a call went up to consolidate what the credit card companies sit that child they should have to pay them to pay them off monthly payment but that would want my credit\n[noise] so you're saying if you were to do like um [noise] so you're referring to look up their consolidation company now take it right right [noise] okay do they would be like four hundred so you know it's still you'll be half of what I'm paying now but that would that would that would destroy my credit\nRight I'm In I'm Sorry what was your first name again sir\nAnthony Anthony if they think you're I mean if any um [noise] I think that the first thing that you want to do more than anything as you want to make sure that your concert thing a communique misinformation with your credit card companies have you talked to them is spoken with them or let them know your financial situation you know\nFast so important ... Anthony you got to get out there you got to pick up the phone don't hide behind the bills go to the creditor and have the conversation with the people are so afraid of what's going to happen but you have to communicate\nYes that's the first step you got to talk to them first and let them know the situation I was going on and a lot of people were surprised the critical company does not want to lose you as a customer they do so they will work with you I'm a lot of times\nIt may be where you may not be able to use the account for a certain period of time um but they will work with you so that you can set up some sort of a full affordable payment arrangements um that can may be better\nFor your budget all the time is what I Do have our clients is that if they do get into the situation but I may even white and a lotta times are written notification is is it is just different\nIt's just different than actually making a phone call and speaking with someone and um but I Would start talking with first you know if you talk to them let them know hey I'm sure I'm having an issue with my money you know what can we do to outlaw my payments for a little while at ... at that point when I was ... I was taught chipping away\nAt paying these critical about also relatives off from smallest two largest start with their smallest ones first while maintaining but minimum on your others and work your way up until you're actually able to get them all paid offering\nAdvice one great advice in ... I Would actually asked the credit card companies because because I've I've I've I've given people would vice on this before is you know it's no different than in a larger scale with a bank asked them listening is there anything we can do destruction is where I can make the pain\nIt's do you guys I Want to pay you I'm not running from you but I Want I don't want it to affect my credit\nYes and as for like ... programs a lot of companies have those you know absolutely\nYeah I think I think that's great advice Anthony\nYou know I think you've got to get on the phone you got to face them you got to talk to them communicate with them and ask them for a ... a payment plan that you can afford but before you do it sit down with a piece of paper write it down and and understand what you're budgets are and make sure you could afford it 'cause once you make that commitment you don't want to go back on it\nAbsolutely yeah Anthony thanks for calling and hope we want help you want we're back to how you clean up bad credit\n[noise] so and then you know we're we're looking at they were after you analyze your data you're looking at it and you notice you want to look for stuff that's well that's the first thing clean up the wall stuff is on the credit report clean up the stuff that you know was illegitimate is legitimately wrong by writing in\nEvery question to get that information that at all the reports if you have credit card accounts\nYou want to keep your balances if it's your personal on for ten percent is the sweet spot or you want to keep your credit card balances so if you have balances that are twenty thirty percent\nYou're killing yourself you got to get them down ... something that can immediately see you're jumping your school\nThat's four to ... percent of what the outcome of the of the credit line\nOf the of the credit line it's off your credit line is you know five thousand dollars you shouldn't go over five hundred bucks at any point if you want to maximize your potential in that particular area anything over thirty per se but you're killing yourself I'm\nIn a lot of people they do go just user caught up in pay it off every month well you're kinda hurting your utilization\nSo that's an immediate thing that you can do to really help your score\nInteresting lose you know my daughter I talked about my daughter in college and and I tell young kids that are in college get a credit card go buy something on a credit card and even though you have any cash paid off just builds ...\nYes yes you gotta you have to\nIf you don't build credit and I mean my second book I wrote it for college students because like they just don't\nKnow this stuff I don't know um but like that's something you got to build you got to build the credit and you can only build the credit with credit cards\nNot not only but it's one of the fastest ways and it's one of the most well known ways and it's really the only way that you can really maximize your credit scores are going to have to have some critical care for it is\nYou know it's interesting because one of the things that I Do it and again you know in a larger scale and entrepreneur I run businesses and companies and\nWe know that people wait have less good results so why would you wait if you have a terrible cancer\nWas bad communication maybe as doctors didn't tell him what it meant to have a high PSA in a high Gleason score or maybe they were pushing surgery kid MRI's showing bulging of the process to cap so he had no obvious Freddie lost wages weighed\nA hundred and Twenty one pounds two years ago was one forty seven is five foot six [noise] and I examined him he had diffuse enlargement of the prostate large big prostate and he came to us to get treated and the reason for treatment is to get better results and you can look up the\nSuccess rate us versus some of the biggest hospitals in New York City page six unfavorable categories are results or Ninety One percent better than some of the biggest hospitals in New York City Ninety One percent better for the high risk patients\nSo it's easy to understand why this man came to us why does this mad with prostate cancer high risk high PSA high Gleason score come to us [noise]\nMost likely because he wanted not to have radical surgery because he wanted not to have robotic surgery that he wanted to\nNot be impotent that he wanted not to be leaking urine and those are all good reasons to come here to Thirteen eighty four Broadway outpatient therapy for prostate cancer\nThis is the work that we do every day and so we are treating him now in fact we just finished his treatment and he's doing well and he's had no side effects and it's a\nTestimony to our treatment the treatment is so easy to tolerate and well tolerated\nThis is what we do every day at thirty for Broadway Broadway and thirty it's in the heart of New York city we have lots of information to give you if you want to talk about uh fifty one year old woman from Haiti\nShe's separated with four children she has diabetes and she presented with a left breast cancer inflammatory breast cancer what does inflammatory breast cancer means\nIt means that cancers

New York\nNew York some of this is talk we'll rated number one seven ten W O R voice of New York and\nOr the body water so important that your body what it's supposed to be around sixty percent people don't realize that sixty percent of your body should be water people are coming in\nWith forty percent thirty five percent forty five percent are particularly\nIt affects really are obese people but it's certainly ... women obese women in general or if you're if you're a body water is law when you're walking around with a bunch of water and you're walking around with a book with drinking water all the time and meanwhile your water's low uh you're gonna that's gonna affect how your body's metabolism is going to work\nIt's going to affect a your muscle is like the engine of your metabolism\nAnd so if that's not happening um because your body isn't absorbing water properly maybe one of the reasons you can't lose any weight so we put you on that machine will be able to see if that's the situation there so\nI said and J died dot com it's only twenty seven dollars and you could schedule appointment come in\nAnd we'll get you're going on the road to health and on the road to possibly shopping and different parties\nYeah so I got you beat on that one what what what was your number your number one what phase and\nBruce was sixty days fifty six pounds and succeed I got\nYou beat on that one I got I'm yeah I'm a I'm ashamed to say well I'm not ashamed to say I don't really know his first name because he's in Brooklyn office this woman and and so and I I Believe that his pictures has the foreign actors actually on our website already a sixty four pounds and sixty days\nOh yeah I Know you're talking about yeah sixty four pounds in sixty days yeah yeah and he took a great profile picture of himself this gentleman is wearing a white shirt and tie and so the profound pictures fantastic says you guys get a chance definitely go to and J died dot com and take a look at that profile picture sixty four pounds of sixty days is very impressive\nMan woman it doesn't matter how old you are I mean it really is that um [noise] it's an ...\nAn astronomical number in my opinion and officer Amos I I think something to that effect again I don't know the patient personally because I don't go to the Brooklyn office but\nAh you know this is just a staggering number and really just the health benefits is a vast officer he's chasing criminals around I bet you can do it much easier sixty four comes down I Would think so I definitely I think that's probably a much better situation for them especially in this heat that we've got going on them\nSo we improved we've we improved the safety\nOf our city just yes that's correct if he can chased on criminal yeah ... yeah ... ... yeah when I went wow ups yeah when when\nOne at a time right so but you know that the pounds of great but I think that um\nA lot of what we see in our office is really the health benefits of what happens and um\n[noise] you know just losing ten twelve or Fifteen pounds can make such a huge difference in how you feel and um what you are a blood tests are and where your numbers are so we stand who are just um was in and he's on day thirty three\nOf the program he went from two Seventy one to two forty four\nA which is a twenty seven pounds in thirty three days which by the way is not a tremendous number for a man typically you know for a man that um has a lot of weight to lose you know in thirty three days we'll see anywhere probably anywhere between thirty six to forty pounds however and all over town however his\nA health uh results or hit\nOverall uh health um\nHave been ridiculous so his blood pressure is now one of four over sixty four\nWhich I Would say probably a little low [laughter] not apply right his cholesterol ah when I'm Down to one oh nine from from\nTwo twenty eight wow so his HDL is at forty six and his LDL is at forty two down from Ninety seven his triglycerides are now a hundred and seven down from two fifty\nA this is day thirty three of the ... well\nI mean I I Would think well that's basically what his doctor actually said too because I guess he had a doctor's appointment like\nThirty three day into the program which we usually tell people you know wait until you're done with the program and then go to your primary care physician and kind of do a blood work and all that other stuff by his appointment was already scheduled so he figured he'd go why not write so his primary care I fell off the chair absolutely\nJust blown away he asked him what he was doing he was like I don't understand he's like you were a couple of months ago you know your your numbers were a disaster basically you know and his eyes I can understand I have so much energy I'm doing this and doing that I feel so good\nAt you know but that that's really what's cool I think right thirty three days in and\nLiterally um he's basically almost off all of his medications trauma it's tremendous tremendous um so I think that those are the coolest results right and we talk about that in the office you find\nThat health part of it is the best part and I and we're able to do that because of the personalization of the of the of the system and\nPeople come in with his hair and saliva or we use blood work analysis we use DNA Analysis as well and from saliva and uh we were able to look at your blood work in a functional level and and then to\nSee what supplements with support people need and and so everybody gains weight in different areas for a reason\nThe body is generally trying to protect those areas because of heirs hormone\nA disruption and so you've got the different body types who got to be with the floppy overhanging belly fat or could be an adrenal issue protruding hard belly fat deliver 'em the day that that side Roy issue with the apple shape apple shaped generally thyroid imbalances\nOr the pear shape reproductive imbalances doesn't really matter\nOr it could be a Ninety number of things are and so we're able to use the buyer energetic scans that we use from parents water use blood work assessment tool or to see what a functional level to keep to keep a ... to keep the body functioning better not so much diagnosing disease\nAnd so then personalize the system personalize the supplements for each individual to help get that one person or into fat burning and\nUnable to ah basically get people\nInto the secular state of fat burning and then the body starts bouncing self out body starts detox of flying itself\nThe hype of found this which is the uh the main hormone controller and the main thermostat of the body starts resetting itself so when people are done they're not going to put the weight back on because the thermostat as basically re set at a new number just like a house thermostat you punch in Seventy two phases Seventy two\nSo that's what we were able to do the problem is that the reason a lot of times people can't lose any weight is their thermostat is set of two fifty and no matter what they do they're going to say to fifty\nSo then we get them their bodies bouncing come down to let's say two ten than we set the thermostat a two time you're going to say to tech\nAnd then we give everybody tools going forward as well so if you're going to you know if you if you will give you ten different ways to eat if your weight even pops up by two or three pounds would tell you how to what to eat that day drops the weight back down so you should never really be above two or three pounds over a year you know day forty or or a six year and a program where\nSo ah you know to the system it's personally from the beginning of ... at the end at the end we also use DNA\nTools or we do a DNA test\nAnd so the DNA shows a different eating a types or exercise for each individual a central the need for a central vitamins and minerals\nOr ... different or metabolic factors are assessed so we're looking at over forty different genetic factors to help people keep not only help keep lose the weight but also how to keep it off going forward so\nIt's basically all encompassing from beginning to end this personalized to each individual because everybody's going to be a little different camping one\nUh can't be a one or what one thing that fits everybody so it's got to be a little bit different not one size fits all travel to switch these things up and get the people get people work and get their bodies work in the right way and then when you lose the weight and your body's bouncing than health problems start to go away as well so\nIt's really uh it's all it's all about getting that weight off it's all about getting healthier\nAnd so the number to call for that is one eight\nFive five five and J\nTwenty five five five six five thirty four thirty eight oh and that's the schedule of free go over the system in one of our look five locations and in New York tri state area\nOr the best way to do it I think is to go on line you go to and jade diet dot com and that's normally Ninety nine dollars for only for only twenty seven dollars right now you can come in and we'll do a body company an appointment with us a body composition analysis we are going to look at not just wait\nWe're going to look at body fat percentage were going to look at body water percentage were going to look at your ... your your metabolic age so you're going to look at your basic metabolic rate and how much your and your daily caloric intake so those two numbers needs to be close to each other\nFor you to be able to lose way we've got people routinely coming in and they're burning off let's say two thousand calories a day but their bodies function which are taken in three thousand calories a day and they're only eating Fifteen hundred calories a day and they can't figure out why they can't lose any weight because at the end of the day you still owed calories\nYou know plus or reading on the program so losing one pound to lose ... pounds thirty five hundred calories we routinely see people losing a pound a day plus to read it so we're talking about the body burning anywhere from four thousand\nAround four thousand calories a day minimally\nA ... to to to lose the weight uh so you're not you we re route where your body is basically using for fuel your body's just using your own toxic fat for fuel so to\nTo get that done it's eight five five five and Jay diet one eighty five five five six five thirty four thirty eight or ... ... to schedule an appointment a for a free\nGo over one of our officers now when you're calling and you're talking to the folks at the at the call center there they're just an appointment they're set appointments right so they don't have all the answers to your questions I can guarantee that ah that's why we were moving all the ... just come in and get a check up\nGet a get a check up and all that [noise] uh and so just don't get mad at those people were people yelling at them all the time all the time or and so just come in and and and uh\nAnd the U.S are there and but you can also go on line A N J died dot com and that's for only twenty seven dollars normally signing nine dollars only twenty seven dollars\nA year you can um come into the office\nWill do an appointment with one of ... with one of us are you also will do a body composition analysis will take a look at your weight will take a look your body fat percentage your body water percentage of visceral fat writing your metabolic cage or basic metabolic rate daily caloric intake we're looking at a bunch of different things\nA body of water so important it should be closer to sixty percent\nOr if you're in the forties you can't lose weight and you're wondering why and you're walking around with a bottle of water all the time you're drinking a hundred ounces of water and you still can't lose weight\nI guarantee your body isn't absorbing it the right way you have a mineral or electric light imbalance we see these imbalances with things like yo yo dieting you'll see it with digestive issues or you'll see it with certain medications like directs that are used to control blood pressure\nOr because you're overweight or you'll see it with a with a an acid medications a lotta times you'll see it a lot of times with the antidepressant medications it's one of the reasons they cause weight gain or and so\nYou know that might be one of the reasons you're having a problem so we take a look at that and then we can personalize the program for you and you could still lose that twenty to forty pounds more than likely you are not going to need the blood pressure medications and some of the other medications as well so we see this all the time we've seen people come off of all types of different things so there's no limit\nTo what the body can do when you get it working helpfully the body is a is a wonderful healing organism sometimes it's just has some a lot of barriers that it can't overcome on its own it just needs a little bit of push it needs to a few dominoes to be kind of tilted in knocked down and then the body will do everything on its own after that so\nUh starts and end with the customers ... and the personalization of the of the program the bio energetic scans\nOr the hair and saliva sample for that or blood work functional ... assessment a DNA testing or that shows us over forty different metabolic factors that we assessed ah to help you use the tools going like a blueprint going forward on how to not only keep laid off but also had a stays healthy as possible so\nReally easy and J died dot com or when a five five five A N J diet or I Want it to tell you about\nA Sondra are we talking about sleep I guess sleep with some some started a lot of people coming in with will sleeping issues and you know I Wonder why people are walking around with trouble to triple ... lattes well sleep it off he's from God Knows where\nHe just sleep deprivation causes sleep deprivation and having like a to take our stomach you know I Know and that was uncomfortable and one of the most awful things you can ...\nYeah but like so people are coming in I guess they ... they're sleeping and you know they don't tell them necessarily some sleeping issues it when they come in but uh you know when they come when they're done with the price what's cool about the program like people come in and they're very they're they're very very skeptical but they're even going to lose weight and then they stop focusing on the waiting to start thinking about how their health is improving\nA center came in a thirty nine year old female uh she lost ... severe sleeping issues she was she was a having a lot of getting up trouble falling asleep trouble staying asleep waking up early tossing and turning just having a ton of issues sleeping\nA and a lot of times it's a neutrino adrenal issue with cortisol levels and and things like that and you know the quarter slows so important uh they're supposed to you know they're supposed to quarter solves as grades it's a\nIt's produced by the adrenal glands and and so it's supposed to during the day help you burn fat and the night help you sleep and if your adrenal exhaustion issues a lot of times you'll see the opposite you can't lose you can't burn fat and you can't sleep\nOr and so she came and she lost a twenty four pounds in forty days so you know ... you know great usually see twenty five to to thirty five with women so she was just a little bit on to that but what's great about it is that she ... she says that after the first seven to ten days at a program she's basically been sleeping like a rock\nFalling asleep eleven o'clock she goes to bed will on weight syrup at seven she says she doesn't even realize she's asleep anymore she's just kind of goes to bed wakes up boom rich already started day\nRested feeling great no crashes in the three o'clock in the in the afternoon or much less need for coffee in the afternoon which is great which is going to help her sleep say see when you get this thing going in one direction it's going to stay going in one direction\nUm say\nTwenty four pounds sleeping like a rock she came in we did the hair and saliva sample or a ... blood work functional assessment we gave her a hormone support type of family support we also gave her dream will support um got they got the body work in the right way and uh now we've got the results that we say\nIt's not surprising either right around that age right around the age of thirty nine forty I hear more and more of that ad right between the ages of like thirty nine and forty one I'm a lot of things change in the women's um\nBody you know ... and cycle right and so it's really it's interesting that every ten years right it's kind of way where he's at least I think that it's interesting that um you know you brought that up a speaking of at the health benefits so we've had this happen a bunch of times in our office but there's just recently happened again\nUh Michelle I'm who am I Believe she's in her mid thirties and she lost eighty pounds she did to round yeah I mean really very a lot of weight ... past eighty pounds well what happened was and she had some trouble getting pregnant with her first child and so get a lot of\nYou know um hormone therapy type staff and ... and ... and\nAt ... and all these other things and all of these drugs are really am known for and they'll put on weight I'll put that dealt with a ton of weight on yam white him and really just create all sorts of floating in the body and um all sorts of very unpleasant things but you know she got a baby out of it which is really a great positive because of that\nAnd she had gained not only a bunch of weight before she got pregnant but also while she was pregnant and then\nAfterwards really hard hard time taking it off so then she tried to get pregnant again and again more hormones and more and you know are these procedures and unfortunately her second time was not as successful as her first\nBut she was about eighty pounds heavier than she had started out the forces she came to us she did to\nForty days around which basically means she went pound for pound and both of them um and that's very and you know ... it's common because this was not\nHer regular weight right this is wait put on with your mind right so that's why she went pound for pound because nobody really needed it really needed to get rid of all it's great\nFor pound for pound a pound a day for a man is impressive pound for pound packs a day for a woman is absolute\n... we had a number of Maryland without an atmosphere it up so anyway so\nShe comes and she comes and um and she says she goes you guys wouldn't believe she came in for ... saliva test I'm just one after the program and she says you wouldn't believe what I have to tell you she says I'm pregnant oh no hormones great now at\n... no ... no nothing on she says I guess my body got rid of all the talk sense of all the extra hormones I dropped all this way\nShe says and now it's a really great story but you know we've had this happen at you know I don't know at times I Would say yeah half a dozen two dozen times where um you know but she by the way completely didn't expect that I mean her her her and her husband\nFully like just you know\nWe're settled with one child and happy and the baby's healthy and so\nNow she's about to have a second one and she said I Can't believe I'm going to have to lose weight again but you know what I think it's going to happen to be honest with you is probably ... now they're not exactly regulator bodies more regularly or probably gain she'll probably ... has not\nGained a ton of layer already and she even said that with that with the first baby she had gained so much during the first couple of weeks and kept gaining and she said with this one she feels completely different she feels so much healthier and really\nFeels good not as much knowledge that during the ... really she says it's just a whole different experience for her she feels like herself and it's really great and congratulations to her and uh you know looking forward to meeting that healthy baby\nYeah that's that's awesome we had a chill off so I had a somebody came and it was telling me the same thing uh Joe came in and she's thirty two years old she hasn't had a a regular cycle in years she says it was she would come and go heavy bleeding\nFor days on end and it wouldn't than a it would go for weeks than it would stop for months and completely inconsistent\nAh and she came in and I'm similar situation you know she said that it then the ... cycle totally stopped\nShe's down Seventeen pounds a twenty two days\nI'm Shauna came in and she was down so shot at it or to the program she kind of did it in a weird way she looked at it for thirty days than she had a two week vacation\nSo she did the program for thirty days stopped the program two weeks short before a vacation to get her little ... to get to reset couple of days and then she came back in and to and she did another twenty days of the program she was just a total of Fifteen days are and what should the cool thing is she was away\nSo she stopped the programs for thirty days or lost a bunch of weight\nLoss of twenty five or thirty pounds or something like that in ... in the thirty days went away on vacation for for ten to fourteen days\nAnd days and put any of the weight back on all while on vacation which is awesome and then she came back and did another Twenty one days of the program so basically she had fifty days at a program and lost so fifty six pounds total in the fifty days\nThat's pretty impressive yeah that's great to vacation in ...\nIn the middle ... you must you must have customize that one for her\nBut yeah we have to have it a little bit of ... so she had a she says you know she had a vacation plans she had been away and look I'm not going to tell somebody not to go on vacation so we just customized before we played with it a little bit did it the right way um and what's great is she no more thyroid meds\nAre no more no more sugar medications a siren levels are normal so she doesn't need that ... to ... medications anymore uh and when she came in we we were able to do we did the herring saliva\nBy energetic scans gave her a hormone support gave her thyroid support she needed bankers support also and she lost she lost that weight or the DNA we're going to do the DNA is going to be used to also to help keep the weight off to keep her ... to keep her as as healthy as possible uh and you know when your thyroid ... you know is really important\nWhen you're talking about people that are coming in LA Times with mineral imbalances and and things like that\nUh that affects the thyroid a lot the thyroid really that I ... got to get by with sodium to get into the cells of the thyroid a T free to even work so that's why you know if people have a sluggish thyroid a lotta times you'll see weight gain and the problem might not even be what the thyroid problem might be but the fact that your body's not is has a mineral imbalance in the and the uh\nThe the the ... dying may not be with you get into the cello the thyroid gland so you know that conversion the tea forty three ah is really get that that that sort of the the gas pedal to their metabolism so to speak\nAnd if that's not happened the right way so if you're if you're having a hard time losing weight you have a mineral imbalance unlock trade imbalance a meeting your body isn't absorbing water properly before because of that you'll be affected on the weight loss ... end of it and now if you're if let's say the thyroid if you've got fired issues\nAnd you're not be able to lose way a lot of times we'll see the thyroid not being able to get to even the chemicals the minerals into the thyroid to get the the whole process going so that'll slow it down also\nSo it's all important your body is just a ... an amazing amazing mechanism but unfortunately here and there will see\nA few issues come up a few imbalances come up and that's all it takes really is a few imbalances in getting it going the wrong way and you're going to stay going the right or wrong way and then\nConversely speaking you got to move in the right way it's just the body heal so great on its own then once you get a deal in the right way you're going to be able to keep it going that way and and and get on the road to health and stay on the road health so\nReally easy one eighty five five five and Jay diet a one eight five five five six five thirty four three thirty eight that the schedule a free go over

with the radio listener you go on make an appointment\nCommand will go over everything with you explain to how the personalization works with the blood work and the how the DNA part of it works and

Island are now opening in West Chester as well so everybody\nKnows how much I Love numbers right I'm I'm In a number of kicked today so we had John who came in he's a younger guy and his early thirties um you know he ... he was having some issues you know he had that typically like\nA belly fat going on and he was on um\nHe was put on a med foreman already unfortunately hold a early thirties so um and so the sugar yet I buy the sugar yeah for the sugar exactly and he was not diabetic get you know I was just like a ...\n... pre diabetic diabetic and I'm so twenty three days twenty points six pounds down alright everybody ready body fat percentage down in twenty three days from thirty percent or twenty six great muscle mass went from twenty percent to thirty percent\nCool water went from fifty six percent to fifty nine percent which the ideal numbers that sixty five and his blood sugar used to be a hundred and Seventy in the mornings which is why his doctor play a monument met foreman clearly\nThe empty stopped his medications because now he's at Ninety two every morning correct those are pretty cool numbers right or at least thirty this guy is I cannot imagine what the body to coming up the body fat went from thirty percent or twenty six percent tremendous tremendous right extra twenty three days and it's great right so you're he basically replace ...\nPercent that level has right body fat he replaced it with two percent body mass and my muscle mass excuse me and a two percent or more than two percent water so really that's exactly how this number just supposed to work\nThat's exactly what it is a muscle weighs more than fat that muscle has more water in it uh and so when you get rid of the fat race really taken the fat out replacing it with water and those are numbers exactly where it was really great what ... what was his what was his weight loss and how much\nA twenty points six pounds and twenty three days and times yeah and you know it's interesting

the New York city police but I Want to tell you about him how to everything but his name he's fifty two years old he's married he's married to a fellow New York city police\nWoman as two stepdaughters\nWith his wife and she's a sergeant in the New York city police penny had kidney cancer spread to the lung no he went to one of the big hospitals in New York about a year and a half ago when he had blood in the year and\nHe had blood in the year and he went to this big hospital\nI should tell you that he never smoke because\nSmoking is one of the biggest causes of kidney cancer is he never smoked but his father was a smoker\nAnd so he got the second hand smoke from his father and this is another educational point if you're forty years old him to stop smoking today you'll live nine more years so there's a lot of the evidence by stopping smoking if God Forbid your family or your\nParents are like this that his father smoking try to get your\nParents or family to stop smoking why should they hurt themselves and why should they hurt their family\nWhen I was this man's only smoke and experience and he had blood on the euro and we often talk about that as an educational point\nHad blood in the year and he walked in the hospital and they told them all and I talk about this a lot also you walk in the hospital the problem and all of a sudden the surgeon pops out and says you got to have surgery have\nCancer he got out of surgery well he went to this big hospital and guess who popped out a big surge in with a white coat and the stethoscope around his neck and says you got to lose your kidney or kidney cancer\nAnd this man said yes now what's interesting about that number one is that we know that kidney cancer doesn't mean you have to lose the kidney\nWe treat people with kidney cancer every day with high success rates without cutting no bleeding no anesthesia without removing that kidney but that surgeon and the big super famous hospital did not tell the patient that he could save his kidney no\nHaley told him he had to lose the kidney well why would the surgeon tell the patient the only one option is to lose the kidney well maybe it's good for the surgeon maybe it's good for the hospital but I think that\nThe patient should have been told that there were options that were ... or ... and he was never given an option which I think is very unfair for the patient the patient came back\nAnd he was found to have the cancer traveled to the lung why don't they they really staged up to the person that didn't do the testing before they cut out of his kidney they just cut out as kidney and lots of luck\nAnd then he came back a chest X rays the cancer trouble to lungs had the CAT scan\nMultiple nodules the lung and he was seen by the urologist these are the surgeon to cut out the kidney and the chemo doctors and he was worth the price was losing weight he lost twenty seven pounds why most likely because the cancer was eating at his body and then he\nCame and he tried systemic therapy and he decided he just didn't want systemic therapy and I saw him with medicine at a cancer stage or this is a fifty two year old New York city policemen wonderful man great man intelligent man\nServes the community who do is stage for cancer at age fifty two for nothing that he's done\nIs done nothing to deserve this cancer and he came to me\nAnd he chose to have radios surgery to these multiple lawn nodules he just did not wants to stomach therapy understood chemotherapy can only slowly if at all shrink the cancer before the cancer comes referring back that chemotherapy early works temporarily\nHe does I don't want that he did not want the side effects of chemotherapy did not want chemicals in his body poison in his body is\nThey may know therapy and his buddies with low success with facts on his entire body possibly he didn't want that he wanted to pinpoint\nRadio surgery pinpoint and that's the work we do for kidney cancer either primary kidney cancer I met a static kidney cancer we recently a present a day that the world's largest radiology meeting\nPresented by Dr Ossorio Lederman showing a Ninety\nSeven percent success rate for medicine at a kidney cancer to the lungs created with radio surgery treated by us and our team our experienced team is the work\nThat we do we're able to treat primary cancers andme ... cancers most anywhere in the body and well many people say a kidney cancer the responder radiation well we're not using standard radiation set of radiation is weeks and weeks of large fields\nNo we do pinpoint treatment we make a mode of the body computer as the body we find that cancer from thousands of NGOs we attack the cancer and that's what we did for this man last year and then one day his wife called me up\nAnd she says my husband is disease falling down is not himself and I said okay go immediately either come here or go immediately to emergency room have a number I could probably has a brain metastases because once the cancers and the system it can travel anywhere\nAnd to travel to his brain remember he had had that surgery on his kidney but the doctors numbers stage them up so we staged them up found mass and the kidney but it was that the other hospital he walked in the emergency room and guess what happened again the same hospital the surgeon comes in and says Mr\nFacts stir policemen you have to have your head opened up you have to have that cancer cut out from your brain are gonna die and [noise] the patient remembered\nThe other patient demand on the gurney the man who jumped off the gurney and wrapped himself into sheet and came to me not wanting to have radical surgery and this\nPatient the city to euro policemen married with two daughters did not want anyone opening up his head he came in to see me immediately\nI saw him at the other facility there's medicines to reduce the pressure on the brain called this a jacket or honor steroids and that given them such a low dose the dos I've never seen ... for I think they almost wanted him not to get better from the medicine so they could push to have that surgery\nI saw the man I got him a higher dose and while I was seeing them within the hour from that do see already got better\nAnd then we talked about all the options I examined the Murrah and examined the body and that examines him when I spoke with him and I spoke with was loving wife\nAnd we spoke about all the options and yes he could have surgery if he wants that's if he was but it could also avoid surgery if he wants and they have only focused beam\nRadiation where you lay on the table is lay down and open table there's no cost a phobia cutting no bleeding though in the south Asia beams come from thousands of angles to attack the cancer and that's the work we do and he said Dr Lieberman that's what I Want you to do you did on my lungs\nNow I Want you to do it in my head that's what I Want\nYou to do and we treated him just to the few treatments ten minute treatments compared to opening up his head which could lead to stroke or death with us he had a few ten minute treatments you lay down the moves around for thousands of angles attack the cancer in the brain\nDoes this work that we first pioneered Dr leader in me first in New York with brain radio surgery when every hospital in every facility every doctor New York thought standard treatment was okay one doctor brought a stereo tactic grain radio surgery to you\nAnd your neighbors and your loved ones and her friends and the person down the street and the policemen and we have the longest experienced the most experience of New York first in New York with brain radio surgery with no pans low cutting though and the ... the show and you can understand the appeal this man had a treatment and\nHe got up and you went across the street to Macy's or Brian Parker went home or with the launch who is able to be a fully intact every day doing what he wanted to avoid being radical surgery and this was all done I should say last year and he came to me just yesterday\nAnd I saw him just yesterday and we reviewed his new scans is a new scattered has had a discussion of his body\nAnd all his cancer and the brain and cancer in the body all his cancer stage for after only radio surgery no chemo no immunotherapy no ... low bleeding after only radio surgery is in remission\nNo dialysis Dr Lederman even treated her second different cancer in a year or with no cutting no bleeding non invasive early it's gone to\nMarry is happy and healthy Mary is grateful that she met Dr Lederman\nWho changed her life she functions fully and this cancer free treatment was out patient and painless Mary as grateful to the doctor Lederman perhaps Dr Lederman can help you to for a free booklet DVD called two and two choices two and two choices\nMost insurance is Medicare Medicaid accepted Thirteen Eddie for Broadway at thirty eight two and two choices Dr Lederman\n[noise] we'll come back to the radio surgery our doctor Gilead I'm In the leading cancer prostate cancer not in the first New York for ... brain radio surgery first in America\nAnd in the western hemisphere finding radio surgery you can also call Dr Lieberman at you when you're killing for a free informative and DVD hey Dr\nLederman while back where our back corner office if you want book the DVD or an appointment we accept most insurance is Medicare Medicaid I was thinking about the sixty eight year old man he came from Florida he presented with a master's England all area and I sat down and spoke with him I said so tell me about the mess\nHe said well I think I have a third testicle and said well that's not very likely that no tree many I'd know biopsy has been growing for a year and a half it's causing pain causing them bleeding and he came from Florida\nHere for a valuation because she wanted to find out why he was having pain was bleeding by having a mess\nAnd I don't know exactly where this mass was well I examined him and there was a mass five centimeters just about two inches so hard flushing ... next to his grow to ...\nAnd was never evaluated before you came here came whatever Fifteen hundred miles to try to sort of New York to be worked out but we got a biopsy this mass we arranged for that and it turns out to be a base will sell cancer like the size of a golf ball next to his grow them\nAnd we staged them up to make sure the cancer as it traveled because a large cancer like this could travel\nSpread and cause harm and luckily for him we staged him up and found there was no spread of this cancer he was seen by surgeons who've seen by others pilot to give patients all the options and they said Dr Lederman I Want\nYour treatment invisible beams of radio surgery to attack this cancer and we offered him all the options and indeed\nWe did follow his command and treated him and I remember this is all two years ago we treated him two years ago I didn't tell you that the beginning but we treated him two years ago and while we were treating him this big mass created with radio surgery here thirty for Broadway\nCompletely went away completely melted away a large mass the size of a golf ball remembers ... testicles and pain is obviously it\nDoesn't want any harm coming to as a child to tell you and that's the beauty of radio surgery that we're able to focus the beam on this mass and he went away and he's cancer free and he came up this week for a checkup I see all the patients I'm Talking about I've seen in the last few days I take notes and then they come\nHere to talk to you and why am I telling you well number one he had a big mess number two he chose to proceed with focus the radiation only declined chemo declined surgery declined all the other treatments only with invisible beams and now he's cancer free two years out and we re staged him\nHis whole body and there's no evidence of cancer any where\nIn his body this is the work we do here at Thirteen Eddie for Broadway Broadway thirty eight straight talk about a woman is fifty seven years old she's Filipino woman she's divorced she is one child she came with her sister and years ago she had a mess in the breast and shit ten positive lymph nodes\nShe went to one of those super super biggest hospitals and we often talk about this I often talk about this that at the big hospitals there is such a push for radical surgery and big surgery when it came to New York\nNinety seven percent of women at the big hospitals were having mastectomy for breast cancer whereas in my practice Ninety percent of women were keeping their breast die believe every woman should be given all the options\nBut she wasn't really given an option the surgeon told her she had to have surgery even though she had ten positive them floats he pushed her to have surgery then she had that surgery and then they operated on the other breast to try to make the other breast\nLook like the reconstructed breast and so now neither breast looks like a brass because the reconstructed breasts looks like skin over a beach ball and the bright brass which they read did does look like her normal breast either and then the cancer started traveling\nAnd she started to have chemotherapy well the super duper big place they gave her years of systemic therapy and chemotherapy and the chemotherapy caused her kidneys to shut down\nSuddenly here she is fifty seven year old beautiful woman both for us have been operated on one breast removed shed\nMastectomy when I Believe she did not need that mistake I mean it's okay to choose it if a woman wants that that's a woman's choice of course it's every patients right to choose what they want to put some of those people are not being given all their choices and well why did you come to me well she came to me because her sister\nWorks for a doctor who knows my work and the sister is telling the doctor that chemotherapy they gave it one of these super poop or big St Elsewhere places so famous caused it'd be a kidney failure she's on dialysis three times a week for hours and hours it will be for the rest of her life most likely\nNow she started on oral chemo because this other chemo caused his kidney failure and\nWasn't working and the cancers growing and she has a new PET scan showing that the cancers traveling and she has pain from cancer so she has pain\nThe cancers traveling the cancer treatment cause kidney failure and the cancer treatment is not working and finally years later after this long ordeal she comes here\nFor treatment and for advice and to get better and to go the pain and of course I Would have wished that she came here ten years earlier so\nWe could have avoided that unnecessary one surgery and two surgeries at multiple surgeries on her breast which just doesn't work and the cancers traveled and the treatment is caused so much destruction to her body if I could tell you that are successful in treating breast cancer where we attack breast cancers about Ninety percent or go\nTo to stop or shrink or make the cancer go away is very high in the breast\nAnd elsewhere then we see so many women with breast cancer primary breast cancer or medicine at a cancer even do prior surgery or chemo or radiation she's at the mall has\nFailed and in this case failed so painfully don't talk about the sixty eight year old man he's from Ghana he's came with his grandson get a large crossed\nThat he was totally ... had cancer was offered surgery or radiation he chose surgery\nSo the other case another ...\nProstate stories since ... surgeries bin Laden is had no more erections since that surgery which was done six years ago is funding continent leaking urine for

[laughter] no but I think everybody in my peer group an older than me I Do I Know people that have that problem\nThose are sub clinical signs is Kirby and now we think oh we get out you know I take vitamin C. pill will\nAll of those are signs of different disease aspects and those are things we look for\nFirst thing is as cells start to die those are things that are happening\nAnd you know it's interesting as even with bounds of nature I'm not here to tell you that everybody's going to grow a full head of hair back and some people do but that's not what this product is about but hair loss slows down an even even hereditary hair loss seems to slow and I'll never forget a patient that came in once and\nShe said oh I've got to show you this and my husband and go straight as I said OK okay and my own and she showed me his head you know take your hat off took his hat off and yeah he was about ... and she has no you don't understand she showed me the line of hair that had all grown back about two inches of it was coming back and she's I have been saving his head\nFor Twenty years and I know that head and I know where it was and now he's starting to let me know want me to grow some of back and then the other one game and she says that you've had a mayor would we had to go in another room and I said okay and she said she said the league\nTake your shirt off [laughter] okay [laughter] that I took a ... had this you know chest of hair and I says a nice she was no you don't understand\nThat used to be gray I said great you know and so and this man happened to have a breathing disorder and because of his meds and some other things and what and he was able to become more active and becoming more activities able to get some of his meds because he was taking balance of nature and it's all a big cycle\nBut as that those things happen then that was an unnatural graying and so when the body was able to do what it needed to do those things reverse\nAnd so there's a lot of lot of fun things\nFriends if you're interested in in knowing more about balance of nature there's people standing by right now that want to talk to you and you can call them simply an eight hundred two four six eight seven fifty one you're gonna get more information about promo codes and so forth coming up in our next break but to write that number down one eight hundred two four six eight seven fifty one\nDr Howard the reason you and I are talking is because a number of months ago maybe a little more than a year ago now [noise]\nAh I called you desperately on a weekend and I said Dr Howard I have the worst flu I've ever had I've never I've never felt this way I've never suffered this way\nYou ask some questions about my my nutritional background I struggled with chronic bronchitis growing up there were regular chest congestion issues and sinuses and ah allergies and so forth it I was dealing with for a long time in fact when I was a kid\nUm I Would get bronchitis nearly every time the weather changed or if it went from real cold to real warm in a fast short period of time\nIn fact this spring here in New York we had one of those days and I could tell my body want it to to go there didn't get there this time but uh you you talk to me about the difference in sparking a flame and the way infection works in the body and you said what which is easier to put out the big roaring fire or little tiny spark and of course the answers to spark [noise]\nUm but you did I'm impressed you remember the you oh man he made such an impact or in in you you basically did say basically your flu is a big giant roaring fire right now you've gotta you've gotta get that doused but once you do or the balance of nature with the nutrition from the fruits and vegetables can't put out those sparks much more quickly\nAnd I found that to be true because then the next year and a half or so since I've been on the product\nI have not had any a serious re occurrence of bronchitis and when I when I feel like something starting to go up the dosage take a few more fruits and vegetables for a few days under the directions you gave me and it has worked every single time including as recently as just a couple of weeks ago\nAnd Dr Howard or some some of your best success stories are people that have used it and and now they tell other people about it and we've got someone like that who's calling us from a coconut creek Florida Rachel are you there\nI heard it's good to have you with us today a bounce hedge radio Rachel what was your story what why did you come into contact with balance of nature\nI fail I currently I should get twenty seven I found my ... my down nine a B B\nThat you know I ... a day I found that very day that\nI could take by getting on for a while but now I Am I reading on I don't know what a quarter\nOf faith activity at each year we went from nine and Ninety ... guy that I read that where the main thing that is awesome\nRachel it's it's so good to know that you're able to uh for periods of time now go completely without it a Dr Howard she she's bumped up to Ninety nine she has more improvement that can still come\nYes yeah it is time you
