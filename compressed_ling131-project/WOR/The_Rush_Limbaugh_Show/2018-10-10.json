there and I wouldn't know the difference in Taylor Swift\nNow the story is Taylor Swift lead American music awards hit all time low in the ratings while how the hell can that be if she is generating

are brimming with confidence over the fact they're going to be running the world than three weeks I'm finding a lot of evidence in security for example I have a story here what is this is in the hill dot com and it's a column by somebody named brand Butowsky\nWho sounds like the captain of a bowling team ... says he thinks this guy was a legislative aide to who who do you think\nThis guy worked for the lord benefit\nA a former senator in Texas I knew Jack Kennedy Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine and you quail you're no Jack Kennedy that lord Benson right okay [noise] well whether he did or not he still writes pieces for the for the held uptown Butowsky code red alert to Democrats\nWhat are the Democrats were smoking I thought the Democrats are going to win everything like the he'll got kind of had a story yesterday I mean it looked like two hundred nine seats are going to convert to the Democratic party\nFormer first lady Michelle Obama wildly most popular respected public figures in America shouldn't spend the day taping personal endorsements for democratic candidates for the house and Senate\nThis column is a code red alert I'm reading from it by the way\n[noise] [noise] this column is a code red alert to Democrats in a call to arms\nFor the most popular in respect to the Democrats with America's such as Michelle my bell Obama to lead the charge for all hands on deck at a critical moment for America and democracy\nIn my view writes Butowsky there is a twenty five percent chance are Democrats and the mid terms with a nightmare scenario what twenty five percent chance of a nightmare why don't you guys had it all locked up I thought you're pretty much had the house already done but mostly\nIs already talking about being speaker you guys are already planning to impeach investigate cabin on and then Trump or first by so\nNow there is a twenty five percent chance that Democrats and the midterms in a nightmare scenario that's that's not quite\nThe same as a Ninety three percent chance Hillary wins the presidency at five pm on election night\n[laughter] why are these people panicking\nMr Butowsky says this is not a moment for complacency or easy talk of blue waves it's a moment for bold and maximum action and turnout based on a powerful look urgent sense of opportunity in danger\nSays it's\nPossible the Democrats win the house by a significant number of seeds how ever it is also possible Democrats gain only twenty seats falling short of winning control that would leave the Republican dominant\nWith a smaller but even more right wing majority of the leading loser is\nIn the house midterms are comparatively moderate GOP house members Democrats could lose one or two Senate seats continuing a Republican Senate there's even further to the right and even more partisan than the GOP majority today\nBowed ... says it's a ... in this nightmare scenario for Democrats and America if it unfolds a vindictive and try\n... Trump having won a victory for the politics of hatred and fear and don't you love [noise]\nYou people on the left don't understand unity when you see it you don't understand love when you see it you do not understand confidence when you see it you see love\nYou see hatred UC excitement you think you'll see fear when you see\nThousands and thousands and thousands trying to get into Trump rallies you somehow see division\n\nOf vindictive and triumphant tropical scammed along side Republican leaders of the new Congress feeling he's achieved unstoppable dominance\nOver his party our country in every branch of government with all checks and balances destroyed this code red alert writes Butowsky warns about the danger of so much unchecked power concentrated in the hands of a president who tried to criminalize\n\nMy point is again\nDo not fall for any of this hype that it is over and that the Republicans have no prayer and that there's going to be this gigantic blue wave because not even the Democrats in their private selves when they talk to each other in private and not even they\nReally believe that\nThey want you to think they do they want you to be this theory of hand or depressed\nThey are very alarmed\nIn fact that the latest polls that show the cabinet effect on the Republican side is ... up the turnout ... up\nInterest and they're really flux and ticked off at a bunch of polling data\nIs an NPR poll out there there was a Fox News poll a couple of others but show some bourbon Republican women are saying in polling data that they have a renewed interest\nIncreased energy and intense desire to go vote this is not what we're supposed to happen\nThat's why all of these attacks lately in leftist media ripping in two white\nConservative suburban women and do we need them or not and we don't they say so this is not as we sit here today this is not developing as they want you to think it is\n\nBack in two thousand six soon as you remember any pieces\nBefore the presidential race anywhere in democratic media warning people hey hey\nYou know what there is a nightmare scenario here were trumped up when you got to dial it back we got to be very careful you remember any of that\nThere was none they were so solid sure they were definitely of of uh convinced that they weren't going to win every Hillary was going to win and the biggest landslide\nI mean they had Trump's chances at three percent seven percent ten percent but\nNobody gave Trump a chance in fact some of the news even said Trump never thought he was gonna win Trump never even wanted to win Trump was the most surprised\nGuy in a lecture in the world when he won he didn't want to win and they were all the press that Trump quarters that's what they wanted you to believe\nNow they've started out saying the same thing is though power is a birthright that every American realizes that Democrats have to be put back in power\nEvery American realizes the mistake of voted for Trump every Trump voter can't wait to apologize every Trump voter realizes embarrassed wants to fix the mistake can't wait to vote for the next democratic on their ballot\nNow all of a sudden it's not just Butowsky by the way either there are others who are raising red flags out there that this might\nNot be developing as they wish also from Fox News the homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen\nSaid yesterday that the ... are engaged in an unprecedented influence campaign leading up to them in terms of this is the Trump administration's latest warning that the ... attempting this way American opinion I handle the elections\nOf a ... watt swim [noise]\nTry comes want the Democrats to win ... why do you think that is why why would a bunch of international communist dictators want the Democratic party to win in the trunk comes or not our friends at trying calms want American leadership they can easily manipulate and triumph over\nA ...

Ford for her at my ... what message does that send to women\nAnd remember women went for President Trump in two thousand sixteen Hillary said white women did\nI'm an ... yes that's right white women I forgot white women we don't like white women right Hillary that's right we don't even though I Am one white women all white women or women went for me white women went for Trump and look white women have been voting against\nDemocratic presidential candidates for decades now the white vote has only then won twice didn't last sixty years my husband being one of the two Lyndon Johnson being this was not a surprise it's a disappointment that white women vote Republican and not for me but it is what it is\nAnd they're in Hillary Clinton's stumbled and the swerve into a truth\n\nExcept for a very exceptional election year of Nineteen sixty four which was following the JFK assassination the Democrats have not gotten more than fifty percent of the white vote in the presidential election since Nineteen thirty two\nNow when you look at it that way you can understand why in Democratic Party circle there's hatred for white people white people white women had been rejecting the white married suburban women had been rejecting them this is why the kind of Nazi movement sprang up this is why\nThe left as as it started contacting all different categories for non white suburban women to be plugged into so that they can then be said to be Democrats constituents\n\nThis and by the way this is again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again from about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three if you're Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I Would not to zero\nBut we put very strict limits on and the reason\nTo be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds through the Nineteen early twenties\nAssimilation was key to American immigration policy\n\nArriving immigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way and there were things they had to do to become citizens they had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on\nA test and they had to swear and plan their loyalty and devotion to the United states and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\n\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans [noise] and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all\nWell Nineteen sixty five us when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course led to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way\nAnd\nThat wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries the Democrats\nRealized they could only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted in here to Christian I'm poor of CNN it never occurred to them to change their policies what they have to do in order to attract white voters what they had to do\nWas change America so back to Hillary she said what was done last night in the White House meeting Trump apologizing for the nation to Kavanaugh\nWhat was done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court and that troubles me greatly crusty on I'm On poor it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillar of our constitutional\nAsked the judicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton's the rest of the Democrats as your private refuge\nYou have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded the leftist activists\nTo make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the courts have you want to really get frustrated you heard me say this and you've probably heard a lot of other people but stop and think about this\nOutside of Obamacare practically every liberal\n... mistake every liberal idea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed liberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nThat we have bastard ice pop culture laws and reality today is because Democrats activist judges have been essentially writing law when they take cases and interpret them and then pronounce decisions\nRoe versus Wade is the most sterling example of\nThis but there are countless others the simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never been capable of winning\nLegislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't want them that's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats wouldn't Mrs Clinton says\nThat what happened in the White House the other night saddens her\nBecause our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional got\nThe ass not by you in fact to the Hillary Clinton and people like are the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere\n\n... did you see any way even a conservative state college when I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we had political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each other we're not going to destroy each other\nHillary Clinton well certainly I Would love to see a return to civility Christianity on poor listening to one another working on our differences\nBut that is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland here we go off to the races again miss characterizing that\nYou're blue in the face\nThat's a Joe Biden rule the Democrats invented that rule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices\nDuring vacancies that happened in the last year of their term that's a Democrat inspired instituted rule and she knows it\nBut the Republicans didn't destroy Merrick Garland the Democrats didn't have to fight battles defending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy them as they did Kavanaugh anyway the upshot of this is\nThat Hillary Clinton says it's it's it's a time for instability it is it time for this kind of extremism because that's what we're up against Steve skill lease [noise]\nWho was shot by one of the believers of Hillary Clinton that that Republican baseball practice\nCannot believe that Bill Cassidy senator from Louisiana responded to Hillary at a time when the Republicans are being shot stabbed docks beaten\nRun out of restaurants and sent death threats Hillary Clinton urged Democrats to be even more uncivil what an irresponsible statement every Democrat shouldn't denounce they're not going to denounce or they privately publicly encourage ruined by applauded they supported that is who they are\nThis is the party by the way that has been railing against all this and civility\nFor I don't know how this is why\n[noise] I look at average American voters paying attention to this and I don't understand how any of them can want to side\nWith what the Democratic Party is doing how they're doing it\nI Know what happens but it's it's a mystery to me and my hope is my faith is that this incivility this insanity this on the hinge\nDemocrat behavior is negatively impacting the Democrats that the Kavanaugh effect\nThe median desperate\nThen reports that Taylor Swift comments caused massive Democrat voter registration\nJust just making it up\nThen the president announces he's going to have lunch with Kanye West than the oval office tomorrow what happens next Mr james dean and Mrs Jay Z Beyonce come out denounce cognac\nEnd end Kim car dash and a two for they denounce ... and his wife Kamkar dashing meanwhile Taylor Swift\nHost some music award show last night nobody watched it the ratings plummeted or an all time low\nSo how can it be that Taylor Swift sponsored inspired massive voter registration drive after criticizing a Democrat or Republican Senate candidate in Tennessee\nNow where is this massive belief and supportive she's got this popularity and people can't wait to do what she says and express their support in why didn't the same people\nTurn around and watch her show that we're not supposed to ask the question to different things Russia can't extrapolate do voter registration drives an audience whose for award show I can you people can make it up left and right I can probably mild analogies I can I ask these questions\nI'm happy to hear you say out there but that this stuff doesn't um intimidate you I think I think it has it intimidated\nAverage of Republican voters in a long time elected Republicans are a bit of a different story Dennis in a ... great to have used or how you doing\nWell thank you long time listener first time caller thank you so it was just\nA wanting to comment on on the Hillary thing whereas I listen to do to last night and I can't quote it exactly but she said if you disagree or if\nIf the party is destroying the things you believe in love that you should be an civil would that not apply to the Democratic party as well Republicans conservatives I'm being an civil to the likes of her\nShort would sure what I mean that's the standard if the party that you oppose is destroying your way of life and you must be an civil against\n[noise] but [noise] [noise]\nAnd you know this in the Hillary Clinton Democratic Party world\nUm our world should be destroyed that is just is that\nIs what's called for conservatives and Republicans being destroyed that is the new morality\nFighting back are resisting it we deserve what we get\nThe voice

thanks for explaining that to me ... as long as I can hear you that's a you know that's all I Need\nNow I Know I was going to Pennsylvania looks like there are thousands of people who are already lined up and probably will do that tonight and we're going to go down here as soon as we can we don't want to interfere with anybody want to go as soon as possible\nYou have seen a right nearby we have thousands of people going tonight and they've already many they're already\nKnow a lot of people I just got some emails when this stuff happened you know you're falling for Russia just prove what a suck up you are Trump's not doing this for any other reason that he just wants to brag he's just doing this for PR\nNo friends you may think that and I'm not going to try to disabuse you of it but the president's doing this because if he didn't\nCan you imagine the stories that would be published Trump doesn't care Trump didn't convened a meeting Trump didn't ask very many questions Trump didn't seem curious Trump hasn't seemed to have any real interest since he doesn't have a home they're all this kind of stuff that they would say about\nHim he does this for a host of reasons but most importantly I Believe\nDonald Trump likes himself and he's very proud of the job he's doing and he wants to be able to see it and he knows that the primary conveyor is of information in this country do not convey proper information about him this is only smart here's here's Kennan Oklahoma City we're back to the phones great to have your or hype\nHey it's great to be on Russia I'm not only are you all rushed but but you are the voice of the mainstream media you should have the best that in part gas\nOr should have the ... app and pop [laughter] hey my point is a today a with Hillary's comments that uh by liberals\nDon't need to be civil to conservatives anymore it reminded me\nOf a profound credit came across years ago and maybe even you set it ah but here's the quote a society is either moving towards civility or barbarism and I see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society\nAnd it's apparent that the liberal left his embrace the barbarism again just wanted to get your thoughts\nAre ... the question is do I do I agree that uh our society has always trending toward a barber is what what barbarism in a\nSociety harbor resume or civilly were trending one where we're not in the middle of the ... eater trending towards civility or barbarism\nOff the clocks\nAnd the oh it's a constant influx and so what what what what is your question more Trump isn't it [noise] well\nUh it seems as if a Republican conservatives are taking the side of it\nBelow the and working uh you know towards the law and order or restoring it and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism dry ... with all of their character assassination attempts on Trump Kavanaugh and teach a violent shooting\nThere's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father and I remember so well you know the conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact most of the states\nWell let me ask you this was the Democratic party the Democratic party ... what was it wasn't that was all good doing fine and dandy one more day then\nI think it was before the Nineteen forties\nAnd no one word and what not when what were they what were they like when the Democrats were the Democratic party over your dad or your grandpa what they want but they're doing\nWell um the Democrats at at that time there they seek a issue was a labor laws and um when you were what purpose\nMy putting the Democratic party hasn't changed that much is my point\nThe Democratic party has always been rooted in the modern era in our lifetimes of this century and the previous at the Democratic party has been rooted in an anti capitalism has been rooted in pro socialism and big government\nThey've just now a band in any pre chance of moderation about that and have gone all in honor militant and violent socialism to achieve their means my boys they're not\nThat different there just mass getting less today\nYou know read about it in the paper tomorrow ... be Mitt worker\nHey I'm Brandt so there's this guy didn't Jordan he's a healthy guy he's a dad of six and he works as a guide in Alaska and it goes to the doctor a true story goes to the doctor and he's diagnosed with cancer stage four\nAnd here's the thing he had switched earlier for medical insurance met issue here where Christians share each other's medical bills to the question for Jordan and his wife Jenny was is this actually going to work our medical bills\nExceeded a hundred and sixty thousand dollars met his share members shared all our bells\nAnd it was about more than just the money to this is a real community\n[noise] since where they see the campaign see so I think I think Fox is\nDialing back you know on the potential you will time claims even though there are Democrats doing rallies like this\nSo my point is that that not as many people are seeing that men and the last night this is such a contrast I have to tell your folks and I this is the kind of thing that you just if you have any observation will powers at all\nYou can't miss this these people at Trump rallies they're non violent\nThey are not threatening their not intimidating and and then they're not dangerous and they don't make anybody feel in danger or threatened these are people have a great time\nThese are people that are up beat him happy they are excited to be wherever they are\nThey are part of something that matters greatly to them\nThey want to be involved and they are the contrast to the the makeup of people and their behavior a Trump rally and your average ordinary democratic protest is striking\nYou contrast the people at this rally last night it was\nIt was a Council Bluffs Iowa you contrast that with with that unforgettable picture to me of these kids are slowing and the front door of the Supreme Court Saturday afternoon there\nAny gang banging on the door and clawing at the door\nTrying to get him I didn't know if I was watching the wicked witch of the ... army or what but it was it was certainly\nNothing but was inspiring or promoted wanting to be part of the Trump\nRallies or the exact opposite\nAnd I don't mean that people at Trump rallies or a bunch of nerds and dry balls don't misunderstand or just wholesome people in there and they're having a good time and there's nothing threatening or intimidating and there's a lot of laughter\nAnd just general happiness and you never see that at any Democrat sponsored event and even if you do have some happy\nPeople in the Democrat sponsored the audience isn't gonna last long because the Democrat on stage is going to get mad and outraged and get everybody else ticked off\n\nAnd I want you to hear a little bit of a Trump rally last night this is it's about a minute worse the Trump rally crowd has find a way they're found a way to recycle and keep lock her up relevant and current about Senator Feinstein this another [noise]\nUsually the documents well [noise]\n[noise]\nI don't want to have you ever see no [noise] no no we didn't [noise]\nAnd I\nThink that don't get about five and can you blame [noise]\nWorst body language on\nWords did she get a hundred percent hand mattress during our citizens and you don't give power to an angry left wing mob and that's what the Democrats [noise]\nYou don't hand matches through an arsonist you don't give power to an angry oh by the way that word mob\nThe left is is in thin that Trump is calling their supporters the mob and so now there are left wing stories defining the word mob\nBoss up on dictionaries in the wake of PBS and trying to make the case that it's Republican crowds that are the mob and not Democrats they're really a bunch of Democrats elected Democrats are just in pigment end up and did that Trump is daring that called ...\nOrders a mob [noise]\nThey're just they're so used to having it throw in the right back at him with the same force they dish it out they are so on you used to having their ideas and behavior being criticized and they really can't stand being laughed at\nWal all [noise]\nSo now Dianne Feinstein lock her up I Want to go back to two thousand sixty to two years ago two years exactly October tenth eleventh way about montage hear\nOf people from ABC

Ronan Farrow reported on Deborah Ramirez on corroborated allegations of misconduct by Kavanaugh\nOut of eagerness to show a pattern up such behavior\nMayor told\nElle magazine in her recollection of the Thomas hearings and James yeah so\nHaving watched this before I knew the key issues would be whether the judge had a pattern of similar behaviors since that helps establish was telling the truth when there's a standoff there wasn't a pattern this is amazing she ran uncorroborated story to illustrate a pattern\nI I'm almost speechless in my attempt to explain this\nThe first story that was run about Deborah Ramirez nobody could corroborate her story kept changing there was no evidence for it the New York times found that so bad that they wouldn't they wouldn't allude to it much less reprint aspects of it\nAnd so Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow run a second story\nThat isn't true just to establish a pattern in other words we're going to lie twice we're going to run a false stories first that has no backup and then we're going to run a second story to show a pattern\nBecause I remember that with Clarence Thomas other women came forward it showed a pattern and it helped us persuade people at Thomas was guilty and so we wanted to show a pattern of behavior with Kavanaugh a pattern\nA beat you couldn't even substantiate uh single allegation be it from Boise Ford or be it for Ramirez or from Amman ... client\nWas her name sweat Nick I mean this is a slight out admitting yeah we made up a second story well didn't use those words but we wanted to show a pattern\nSo essentially they're saying we believe we can convince people that something happened just by writing a story alleging it\nAnd of course their buddies in the left will gladly accept an allegation is fact and an act on it you know we needed to show a pattern here is Krista Smith bill Ohio your next I'm graduated high\nHigh right very very cool to talk to you thank you [noise]\nUm so I was just wondering I was concerned and mine to get your thoughts and Internet fun of it yesterday but within my role as it is and let's Hillary claiming\nThat they're partying neatness civility right now I'm I just can't worry when the mind and they left and and the accidents and then fattening or if they begin to help people", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "New York", "day": "10"}
