one that aroused says my suspicion about this there's even a tech blog ...\nOut there called apple insider this tech blog has been misappropriated as a source for this inserting on Google searches they have run a piece of apple insider denying any relation\nAny any complicity in this story\nSo whoever is behind this idea that the murder and the conversations that took place prior to it and during it were recorded by the show is apple watch and are now somewhere on iCloud\nA\n... and ... when you find out that a tech blog that has a famous name hasn't been misappropriated and has been falsely accused of reporting this in order to give it legitimacy in certain Google searches then I started to question a lot of things about this story not very briefly here's why the the apple watch\nAngle this doesn't work I Know that most of you don't have apple watches let me just briefly explain to you how they work there are three ways that an apple watch can receive and transmit data\nAnd the biggest one the one with the longest range the one that is most capable is not even available in Turkey and that is el he or cellular signals two years ago when apple in well actually uh fourteen months when apple introduced the series three watch they\nActivated L T E cellular service which for the first time made the watch independent of the phone you can\nTake it out of work out you can do anything you can take it away from the phone inhabit operate it would still get emails and messages and they're recording your workout data and so forth if you could receive a sell certainly didn't need your phone nearby\nSo it was the first time that they they watch it failed to be doing just ceased to be a slave to the phone the other two ways or blow to and why\nThose are the three ways that day they can get to watch and data can leave a watch\nYou take out he out of the mix because it doesn't exist in Turkey and there there there's no watch no apple watching the world and that it's an apple watch they claim he was wearing\nThe story is that his fiance has his phone out in a car in the parking lot at the consulate\nThere is only one way that watch could communicate with that phone well there's two ways there'd be why and blow to blow to if you have to blow to this week by design it doesn't have much rain sixty feet max\nYou get into an embassy the shielding the I are the protections against\nOther nations being able to monitor and over here and steal signal there's no way\nThat the Bluetooth component of a watch would be able to permeate the protections that an embassy would have to protect itself from just that there's no is it that couldn't happen so the only other way would be why\nBut that one only works if\nThe wife fine network password of the embassy or consulate\nHad been answered\nAnd the wife I connection on watch just because the phone connection to why when the phone does the watch automatically connection but not the wife I can next to the phone it's a slave to the phone now if the watch knows why fi network because of the phone it's parents\nWho uses it then like if you're at home or your ... your your phone is inside you have to go outside to walk the dogs you'll come back to the wife I network on your property even if your phones out of range\nIf you've entered the password to the wife I network on your watch as well as on your phone I just don't think she'll be did that\nLike he was probably know to do it um I don't\nKnow that they wouldn't give them the password how'd he get the password of the Saudi Saudi console don't

identified liberals of all races and ethnicities now command a majority in the Democratic party raising the possibility that view is once confined mainly the party elite\nHave spread to the rank and ... on [noise]\nI'm On the Democrat Party elite\nSad to say we're never these radical leftists now I'm going back ... Clinton\nThe Democrat Party moderate elite has been overtaken\nBy the left wing radicals and that's why some are scratching their heads anyway\nFrom two thousand one or two thousand Eighteen to share a Democrat voters who describe themselves as liberal has grown from thirty to fifty percent yeah well you don't want to know something else the percentage of Americans that call themselves liberal is shrinking now into the high mid thirties\nThirty five percent tops the American people identify themselves as liberal\nHe doesn't say that [noise] I'm adding that the percentage of Democrats who say they are moderates has fallen from forty four and a thirty five percent percentage of self identified conservative Democrats has gone from twenty five to Thirteen percent\nThat here we go now this is a long piece but this next grab this is the money graph\nReady well educated whites especially white women\nAre pushing the Democrat Party this site simply leftward according to Gallup their share of white Democrats calling themselves liberal on social issues has grown\nSince two thousand and one from thirty nine sixty one percent of because of this growth white liberals are now roughly ... percent\nOf all democratic voters\nWhile a substantial percentage of Democrats minorities identifies liberals those percentages have not been growing and anywhere near the rate they have for white Democrats\nWait a minute into those are the level of white working class was totally go to hell no all of a sudden the white women are the majority of the party and the the percentage of the Democrats represented by\nMinorities is not growing\nYou mean\nI guess that's why Trump's approval number amongst Hispanics Latinos and African Americans is that a record high\nFor Republican candidates while\nA substantial percentage Democrat minorities identify as liberal those percentages have not been growing anywhere near\nThe rage that they had been for white Democrat so blacks and Hispanics have not contributed significantly to the rising percentage of self identified Democrats liberals\nInfectious Mr Thomas Bee ends all white liberals are well to the left of love black electorate on some social issues take the issue of discrimination as a factor holding back African American advancement white liberals are to the left of black Democrats\nPlacing a much stronger emphasis then African Americans\nNow wait because earlier this week we had a story but the Republican Party owns white suburban women right we did so who is who is white women\nMaking up the majority of Democrats liberalism\nWho are but back in ...\nShrimp boat show you know I'd be met for\nThe Rush Limbaugh show on that\nFive year old brutalized law enforcement officers gunned down\nThese are the victims of illegal immigration American Life destroy our broken immigration laws\nAnd conservative congressman Kevin McCarthy is leading the fight\nKevin McCarthy ... ended for so long back\nFully funds President Trump's border wall\nExpands caseload to ... women\nAnd insurers only American citizens have the right to vote\nConservatives illusion of America deserves the leadership of President Trump's new\nThere is no place for that kind of language you shouldn't have said that since Speaker Paul Ryan who is usually measured and his criticism of the president\nRepublican history teacher is Liz mayor said yeah yeah it's just another Trump tweet in an on going pattern\nWhen you constantly behave in an outrageous fashion people get immunized and numb to it and in fact [noise]\nRight on cue I have a piece in the wall Street Journal they're written it was just ... just the name of Lance Morrow ring a bell to you [noise] blanche Morrow used to practically run time magazine back in this I Believe is the premier journal is not was not an executive buddy practically ran the place\n[noise] I met him at Mr Buckley is home here in ... you were good buds but Lance Morrow\nWas a a typical turtles which means means left and so far he's got a piece in the wall street\nJournal that is the headline is we've grown accustomed to Trump it always concern is that Trump's outrageousness\nNo longer fuels anger on the left as it should give people just got used to it\nAnd and if the anger subsides it's bad because that's the only thing the Democrats have to get their people to the polls\nAnd here comes ... mayor a Republican strategist making the same point but she's not doing it in a positive way yeah you know what this guy's been a river bay for so long and just people who have gotten used to it\nShe says\nI don't believe the headline Trump attacks fuel Republican or maybe the headline is true that the Republicans fearful about losing suburban women but I don't think Trump's comments stop and think for a minute here\n[noise] there may be an isolated case of a suburban woman [noise] thinking that I Can't support this guy he just called a porn star a horse race but this election\nIs really important and people that are involved in this election know how important it is and people that have voted for Trump in the past and have voted Republican know how important I just don't I don't think the media's learned his lesson yet this is not the kind of thing\nThat is going to cause Trump to lose an election you mean there's a few votes here\n\nIt may it may have caused other Republican candidates to it'll lose maybe hold elections but but but not Trump\nI just think it's all part of the equation\nIn which Trump critics still don't get it\nThey don't get the bond between Trump and his supporters they never will understand it because they're not curious to understand it and so they take these things that they think are just outrageous insults just so totally permissible in American politics and they\nAssume this is it that Trump's finished this has to be it and not even the Access Hollywood video than it\nThis isn't going to do it [noise]\nFrom the fuel dot com Trump threatens military action of Mexico does not stop this immigration\nOnslaught President Trump\nToday warned that he may take military action to stop immigrants who were crossing the southern border into the U.S may just not take action to stop the also this is the caravan that's headed our way\nTrump railed against Guatemala Honduras and el ... saying that they have almost no control over their population I'm watching the Democrat\nLand because they want to open borders and existing weight loss\nI'm watching a Democrat Party whether salt on our country by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador leaders are doing little to stop this large law people including many criminals entering from Mexico to the U.S\n[noise] these people I don't I was talking earlier I'm ... I Know that that the Democrats somebody has to be paying for this there is somebody out there and maybe a lot of them who really think that somehow this is going to help Democrats get votes\nBy sending a caravan of four thousand ill legal non citizen Americans on a caravan all the way up from Guatemala and Honduras through Mexico\n\nRight before the midterm elections as we discuss somebody's paying\nFor this somebody they have to eat they have to be drinking thing we've got to be using\nFacilities\nSomebody has to be buying the gasoline to transport vehicles to power the vehicles that are being used here\nI guarantee you these people are not walking every step of this thousands of miles journey\nSo who thinks that this caravan arriving within a week say\nOf the mid term election date helps Democrats by itself how does this help but this is what got Donald Trump elected\nThis is what turned out the giant Trump coalition the invasion at the southern border that neither political party took one step to stop\nSo what's the calculation here well we had a caller earlier suggesting that the calculation may well be that there has to be something go wrong you put four thousand people on attracting it's gotta be somebody gets sick\nThere has to be some fights break out somewhere somebody on this gang of people got to have a gun all it's going to take is one little incidents of violence\nMaybe an allegation of sexual abuse\nAnd maybe started by Trump law enforcement\nPersonnel [noise] I wouldn't put it past them if that's the if that's the game plan but I'm struggling to see\nOther than just the general chaos it's creating them and maybe the Democrats think that people want to stop this chaos into this chaos is only because of the Trump that Trump weren't there are none of this will be happening and so let's get rid of the Republicans Republicans are the reason we have to put up with chaos every day\nIf that's the calculation they are going to blow this why they haven't blown much else in politics that's not at all what the conclusion average Americans are going to have if this caravan getting closer and closer to the border\nUp letting head back to the phones got time to work some in here to make up for the first hour where we didn't get any in and this is Andrew in Cleveland thank you for waiting so you're up next\nAfternoon rush hey I'm\nAs for the Hannity interviewed I'm sure being broadcast professionally knocked it out of the park\nUm if you didn't do than just a second I'd like to say I love it to my wife Kym who's always told me to call you I should call your call you will finally I got through rush my my point is all these illegals coming up in South America nobody's talking about the fact of the diseases they bring along with them

polio like yeah it's the same length and also killing American\nChildren back twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen I was not free for let me say that the CDC or as of now has not said they're not sure where it came\nFrom there [laughter] twenty fourteen twenty sixteen we had a similar outbreak yeah\nAnd I'm hiding a tough time finding the bleak side of the Internet because it's just the beginning scrubbed but on January fourth of twenty six key on a website called natural news the headline read tarot virus the sixty eight linked to illegal immigration behind fatal polio like illness killing America's\nChoice right right right now the CDC is not coming out and people aren't coming out because it leads to much creative Trump's\nOffer a wall if somebody was actually telling the truth and the drive by needed don't you think that this would have some effect on those miles with small children [noise]\nUh yeah I Do I this is another really good point the news it's it's amazing how these things remain isolated [noise] we are here in the midst of an invasion of people\nFrom various backgrounds from various countries in Central America and South America\nAnd just independently some days separation apart there's a story of my shockingly\nUnforeseen increase in polio cases in the United states and the stories\nFeature medical professionals who are stumped they can't figure out why this really happening\nThey they they can't they can't even make educated guesses as to what might be the origins of this\nAnd then a couple of days go by and there's another story of a mass numbers of people from various parts of the country a world South America Central America there's no question these things are related well I said there's no question common sense tells you there's a relationship here\nFrom Washington and giving it back to you but Democrats think your money belongs to the government the ones who raised taxes protect criminals was things were cities and reverse the twenty sixteen election within beach but\nThat's the Democrat agenda the only way to keep the sea Democrats from raising taxes is to do your part vote for Republican Congress on Tuesday November ...

I have a different theory on what is going on and why they're waiting I don't think they're ... they're not an accident at all I think if the Democrats for somehow take the house that\nMore will have a scathing report if the Republicans hold it\nLowers report will be much of nothing\nThat's really suspicious of you [noise] I mean what do you think of the institutions have your government that there's this big long report that just waiting to be written based on the outcome of the electorate\nLaw I think they're already written and I'm just I think he's waiting to see which one is you've got to re release\nAll you know you think they're both written in just determines the election I come to terms which one he turns in\nAbsolutely more is the swap [laughter] all he he is absolutely everything he's there to protect the Clintons that's ... that's the only\nReason I just uh Clinton thing is that or protect everybody there to get everybody yeah a\nLot of Russia's been such an honor to listen to your for twenty seven\nYear wait a minute I Need to ask you a question if I knew I\nWas given that if you're if you if you think that Mueller's report will the substance of it will be determined by the election outcome\nWhy wouldn't Mahler just just write that Trump did it why why wouldn't they just say that they've found reasonable suggestions that there was inappropriate contact between\nRussia and the Trump care whether they can prove it or not why not just do that [noise] I mean if there is certainly this this honest which we know they are if there is that the idea that weren't really are dishonest\nYeah the idea that we're going to get an honest subset of reports from this Munch which is ignoring the real criminality criminal activity which is Hillary Clinton and whole apparatus that created that dot C.
