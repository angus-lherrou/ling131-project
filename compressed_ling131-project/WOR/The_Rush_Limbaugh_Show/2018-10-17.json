and Democrat membership\nI'm not every Democrat was the clan member um but every clan member was a Democrat that that the plan was a little like Planned Parenthood that way on as usual um history moves on and suddenly they started saying no that was a Republican organization\nSomeday someday they will be claiming that the pro lifers were um where Democrats\nAre throwing in a culture you should get her book resistance is futile\nA boy or you know every time you write a book\nIt's a great idea but then it turns out like in the coming months after that that is like the biggest thing so I think happened here the resistance a lot of people have said as bad as it was in the last few months it just ... ratcheted up worse than ever will use it\nYes it really has\nUm well if they read my book they know how to attack Trump properly which would be\nUm to run on Democrats should run on building a wall and restricting immigration in order to help the middle class but I'm starting with in the Clinton era I Would say the Democrats used to appeal to blue collar workers used to care about the working class used to be against unrestricted\nImmigration driving down wages and changing\nAnd changing the culture and of course being illegal um and the case of illegal immigrants which is not all the problem wages get driven down by legal and illegal immigrants in any event around um around Clinton's time the Democratic party just moved to becoming a party of of yuppies and\nAnd and immigrants identity politics um you know the feminist send us an e and the angry grievance groups um but they completely gave up on regular Americans living between the coast\nSo they can't do it all they can do is is to to unite their basis to keep screaming about white supremacy racism white supremacy you know know keep your eye on the ball we hate white Americans\nUm it's the only thing that unites these various disparate groups\nI don't know if you saw um Louis Farah can has has apparently recently on leash other another another gym um he said something like I'm I'm not an anti Semite on anti termites\nAnd\nA ... as you can see from from the hot house flowers who want to literally make a federal case out of being groped in high school don't think I'd ever happened as Christine Blasey Ford but even if it had\nCome on we're talking about being groped in high school students is not a rape it's groping I'm at its high school and it's Thirty years ago um so how was how was that group going to fit in with\n'em all the Muslims they're bringing in um who don't want women to drive and women are subordinate and here you're going to wear this ... cloth over your head I'm no there are groups really ought to be at one and others throats I mean who is jobs are being taken by masses\nAnd masses of low wage immigrants I'm well obviously if any low wage worker but that's heavily Hispanic some blacks\nThat's why we have to keep hearing about racism racism fascist no don't don't notice that you hate every other member of the coalition just keep your eyes focused on you hate white people\nYou know if the Democrats had a real leader one real smart leader they would look at all the metrics over the last two years in say everything we're doing is working it's not hurting them and we gotta switch tactics yes they'd get your book\nResistance is futile you explain right in there why this doesn't work and you should do well there's no leadership in the Democratic party\n[noise] yes well they have been counting on especially well especially I again starting with the Clinton Administration that was kind of that that transition period\nI'm On the new waves of immigrants being able to demagogue them on many of them don't speak English and you can you can rally them with with what they're angry grievance groups and guess who gets to be you know the head of the grievance grilled on the ... or the or the the the the ethnic group the people running the grievance corrupt\nUm ... obviously anyone coming to this country comes from a less free country many of them coming from authoritarian countries so they're used to being pushed around by\nOld what to do so they ... they really are just counting on the the wave of immigration to numerically out number American voters on that's clearly what Hillary was doing and you know we're about at the tipping point it's not not that far away she didn't get more of the popular vote\nYeah well if you want to read a great book and cope his book is called resistance is futile if you find yourself in reducing what the hell are they why are they going to a crazy over to read this\nBook or if you're one of these resistance idiots and you say how come it's not working [noise] read the book and tips there [laughter]\nIf you know one of these resistant beauty is you have a friend or sort of get them the book and say here read this I think this might explain why what you're doing this I'm going to work a

ask you if the guy you want to vote for the better candidate and it looks like he could win all the all the political experts I talked to said even if he wins in Connecticut\nHe's not going to win 'cause there's a lot of fraud up there you know every time a\nRepublican seems to win and Connecticut the suddenly the votes from Bridgeport or three days late in the votes from Waterbury they can't

but the drive by stink Obama respected ... love dumb but he didn't\nSo you didn't give them the time of day and when he did it was looking down his nose but they didn't care because Obama was hip\nThey didn't care because Obama was cool they didn't care because Obama was wiping out the Republicans except the one since Obama was enabling the Republicans wipe out the Democrats as we discussed in great detail yesterday\nAnd ... came to me today he said you know what you don't even know what you did yesterday I said well\nYeah I have a good memory and I I remember what I did know you don't know you don't remember what you did with your with your watch story I said you mean about\n... he said yeah I said well what do you mean\nYou blew up\nThe entire intelligence community excuse or a story\nOr having evidence of how your shoulders died they were out there saying that there were probably going to get proof of his interrogation and murder\nBecause it does apple watching here you come blowing up the whole thing pointing out how it's technologically not possible\nYou blow it up and you didn't even know it did you I said well no because I wasn't aware of they were using the watch as that central if at at elements proving their case but then when ... said this to me I have the pause I had to contemplate\nAnd then I have to consider he has a point\nBut there was one of these things I wasn't contemplating or calculating at the time I just I Know it's impossible\nThere is no way that Jamal ... watch could have recorded anything that happens women there's no way it could have\nTransmitted or transferred it\nTo his iPhone which was in the possession in his fiance in a car in the parking lot of the consulate there's just no way especially sense apple has yet to activate L T E service\nOn watches sold and operated in Turkey so on the last ... had entered the password for the consulate why fine network on his watch which I Know he didn't do\nBecause most people don't even know they have to do that most people don't even have a watch don't even know there watch will work on why five most people think they got to have the phone right next to watch in Ninety nine percent of the time it right\nBut if you're a watch learned was a wife network like at your home that your phone logs into regularly then the phone or the watch can access that I find that work independently of the phone if you're not close together but only\nIf you have answered that why fight networks password into your watch\nWhy five settings [laughter] I Know that this guy didn't do that [noise] [noise]\nI myself didn't learn you had to do this until a couple of years after I got my first wash that mean that's how old's your a setting that it is anyway certainly says you just\nBlew up you blew up\nThe reason all these intelligence people were giving for knowing how he died you blow it up now they have to come up with something else\nLike I said well I was totally unaware you say well you should be aware because they're mad at you [noise]\nNobody's most of the day they say the show was recorded the events of have to record on watching their base will say wow that's cool and then you come along and say no it's not possible\n[noise] another headline you probably have seen this so should've pressed Trump tells the a P he will not accept blame if the Republicans lose the house\nThe truth of the matter here is there are more stories today two or three more about the dissipating\nBlue wave including none other than the door yeah I'm\nA Democrat National Committee cheating and electric and bringing\nDown to Brazil\nWho strangely enough showed up on Fox that I should shut up a bill hammer down to Brazil did not go to CNN did they get rid of her because they found out she was sending answers to Hillary [noise] that's right\nSo see and I got rid of Fox willingly open our midway had done in Brazil on and hammer was asking are all about the blue wave and other Democrats are planning to do this and that's well you know twenty days is a long time in politics bill\nAnd I don't scramble my eggs before my chickens hatch who we listening to hear Dan Rather\nI don't scramble my eggs into my chest\nUs fairly and therefore we do the news they owe me on the news so I can talk of myself\nAnd what about the your tweets are so far these people say we don't want any more tweets anybody ever tried to sell you stopped waiting\nOh and I don't think I'd be talking to you if I did that that's a way of getting out the message look we're fake news everyone's sake and I'm not saying you and some of the people on Fox and I know of\nWhat some of those but there's so much this information being put a [noise] that's my only form of communicating really other than having a press conference every hour [noise] but I don't go to wait and I thought social media would definitely getting the word I we have the greatest autonomy and the history of our country and there's nothing we boarded\nWhere you go it's that simple he's the only way he get his message out he's not gonna stop he loves it and the fact that they're getting frustrated than it is CNN's media\nMedia whatever\nGuys they don't march talking residents there's just too much media there's too much he's gotta he's gotta stop promoting the country\nAnd so they're so frustrated they

Don Mueller's wrapped it up and got big garden smaller is gonna be releasing at\nAny moment they're going to be talking it up\nBefore the midterms in hopes in the hopes this was what they're hoping they're hoping that the acknowledgement that Mueller's report is done we'll be perceived by voters as the proof that Trump's do the election\nIs imminent that is what they're hoping they're hoping that you and well I don't think they think you're going to fall for it but they were hoping that the great on washed up near the ill educated under educated on educated miss educated are going to believe\nThat it's only a matter of time\nBefore this report is made public proving that Trump colluded with Russia and that will then influenced the way they vote that means they will vote Democrat that's what the effort here is\nThey will create this cloud of suspicion this cloud of danger that\nPort handles disaster so Trump they'll reference this each day leading up to the mid term elections\n\nAnd you'll hear people in the media speculate oh it could be trouble be removed after the midterms when mullet releases this report it could well be Trump's gonna have to be removed to report my all of this is going to happen to one degree or another the second thing\nThis tells me is that Mueller himself is waiving just see who will be running Congress before he decides to really in this\nBecause his report goes to Rosenstein who is technically his bosses at the department of justice and to Congress and there is decided whether or not that it is made\nThanks rash thanks for doing everything that you do Russia I have two quick points a one on a a lifelong Democrat [laughter] I was a teacher I just retired and I have been the biggest Trump supporter out there\nFor for my when does your support for Trump again during the campaign OK okay go to the campaign and one of the reasons that I see\nDuring the primaries are during the day after he won the nomination\nPrimary primary okay\nAgainst the seven anyway he um [noise] I became a a Trump supporter one of the reasons was because she's got to be so good for the country and ... and I'm ashamed that Democrat my whole life\nThat these people aren't happy to see the country doing well that's what amazes me the most I mean I was always brought up the Democrats for fair and my dad was a Democrat my mom and that they sort of the country\nWhat you thought the Democrats for for the little guy looking out for the little guy and try to help the little guy make it economically and overcome obstacles Republicans wasn't aware\nExactly and so so I'm very proud to be a Trump supporter but I'm about to pack it in I'm going to tell you why frustration is so high\nRight now for not only myself if you put in a neighborhood because she said it before with Stuart gardening\nUm he said the Trump ... and he says the only reason the only way I can get my message out well his tweets are good but not that many people really here and I can't understand why he does not address the nation [noise] I don't understand [noise]\nWait a minute when you say when you say package you mean you're about to abandon from\nThat advantage Trump but I'm going to really losing a lot of energy and frustration I really am because so many people don't know the good things that are happening they're not gonna learn preaching to the choir which treat tweets most of the time\nAnd the fresh prince ... they skew anyway so if he addresses the nation and he should it should be proud of what he's done the greatest time economically that I can never remembered I'm sixty six I can never remember anything like this\nIt is amazing in it but you know you said something here very by I Want to I Want to circle back to something you said\nAn observation you've made of the modern day Democratic Party that they don't seem to be happy right now the country's doing well they don't they don't seem to be encouraged or want to be included in it they don't want to even try to get some of the\nCredit for the country doing well in that shock geo right\n[noise] you know not any more at a ... year and a half ago but I'm starting to realize they don't care about the country\nThey they really don't care about social issues they care about taking this guy down who I think the strongest guy since Reagan I've ever seen how we can take these bullets day after day I mean he's ... guy\nYour frustration is noted and I think it's shared by a lot of people what you're you're really\nYou you made it sound like your frustration is with us from because he won't do a nationalist press and try to reach people that his tweets don't read short ... that he that he doesn't rage but your real frustration of the U.S is with a news media and many people are in the same boat\nWho are doing their best to hide all of that and make sure people don't know it's\nIt's a joke amazed the frustration I've never been so frustrated in my life I Can't ... it ... me it was me out of the country so it was so well and so many people going to go out and vote and they have no idea I hear it newscast and they\nWell I think that you are a well why do you think you're one of the few people that let realize how great the country's doing if you think about why why do you think more people have\nListened to you if the reason\nThere but the economy you you said you've never seen anything like this in your life you don't need me to tell you the economy's doing well you see this on your own\nThree point seven unemployment are you kidding me with all the jobs and all of them a ... wage is going up\nWhat am I ever seen anything my\nPoint is I think you're going to be a little confidence that you're not alone in seeing all of this\nAnd that more people are aware of it then you may know and of course you can be a it'd be understandable if you fear people don't know because the media is doing everything they can hide it or even worse lie about it\nAnd you are of the impression that most people get their knowledge information from the media but\nI think what happened with a lizard with Warren here they could not carry this October surprise they could not cover for the fact that she's bogus they used to be able to do that they're not able to there's a reason for that and I think it's also helping get the truth out about Trump's achievement\nWe take a break for that has to have much to say\nRussia's probably by being met for\nLimbaugh on the voice in New York ...\nAll right to all of our listeners out there who are aged

here at the top of the hour and back\nKeep on keep on after the\nBoxing rated number one seven ten W O R voice of New York and high\nBut it's it's a British network and the title it's six episode one hour per episode mini series called press and it was about two competing newspapers in the current era in this modern day\nAnd it's amazing\nHow honest if he is about what journalism is now this\nIs not about contemporary events there's nothing in this series about Donald Trump or Theresa May or anything current in either country it is a modern era I'm generic piece lowers the storylines or all fictional all made up\nAnd it is\nAbout two competing newspaper is one of them's big one of them small one of them is\nVery serious take them very seriously don't do tabloid anything [noise]\nDon't focus on celebrities the other one is nothing more than pure trash and it's the one that wins it's the one with the biggest building is but one with the more employees they're reporters are stars and so forth but you know what this does it's flat out amazing how\nHonest it is in terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is destroying people\n\nBoth of these papers in this in this miniseries end up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out\nOr some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the\nBig people powerful people rich people there obviously\nHas to be something they're doing with breaking the rules and there's the gun suits breaking the rules there has to be something they're mistreating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something\nAnd the purpose of journalists ... call 'em out and and and ruin them\nWhich many many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target\nI was never I had a little taste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that that that that have me and their crosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism but I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking\nTo some people about it and they said you have to understand what journalism is I said you mean the bias well there's that but that it's it's it's more than that it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalist and these little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or a or a or a piece on somebody that can be made to look accurate\nThat nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against the little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbs led if you go back to the early days of sixty minutes it was all about that\n\nAnd it remains so today it's just it's it's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day now is Donald Trump\nAnd any Republican who gets in the way like Brett Kavanaugh it's all about destroying people the thing about this series is it makes no bones about it\nI I don't recognize the names of the writer or writers I don't recognize the stars I've never seen them and the thing for I don't recognize the names of the producers\nAnd I haven't taken the time to Google that many of them but I watched this\nI've seen two episodes so far out of the ...\nAnd I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching this thing at how brazen really honest this is one of the the editor the head of ... of the of the tabloid paper is one of the most is fixable human beings I've ever seen portrayed\n\nWho is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he's he's just two years and he is totally on affected\nBy life to him everybody's a bad guy you just have to find out why his favorite his philosophy in life\nAnd the way he guides his journalist is the world has no solutions I'll stop what what if that were your world view of the world has no solutions\nAnd he's telling you it's not your job to fix things it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job they're trying to solve problems because the world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he the one episode\n\nWent to great lengths to show how this this sleaze editor\nWho has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual just up there that they have some kind of a relationship not pretending like each other but they owe each other from way back before the series began\nAnd the editor\nArranges a cover story about appear to file and then puts a picture of the prime minister on the cover with his his picture only an inch away from the word ... to file\nYet the story is not about the prime minister being Pete if I was

O. R. N. NBC News radio station\nThree\n\n\nOh\n\nYou're welcome back okay back to the phones and go I'm I'm I'm not through making the point is blue wave stuff but there's a lot of\nLike here's the CNBC poll do not expect a big democratic wave this fall I got three stories that are out here plus ... Brazil about this\nNow I don't want to make too much of it about the best thing that we can say about it is that they are losing confidence or maybe they are just purposely dialing it back\nFor Strategic reasons and still think there is going to be what I I I don't think that's what's going on here I don't think they're able\nTo discipline themselves\nUniversally unilaterally across the drive by leftist board there's always going to be some renegades that'll bust out of any attempt\nA in something like this but\nWe'll get back to this I Need to get back to the phones first Canton, Mississippi in the daytime and nice to have you welcome to the E R B network\nLike Mr Limbaugh I appreciate it this is definitely a bucket list item for me\nWhen I'm flattered I appreciate that very much\nSo I had a a different take on why they're not going to release anything from them Mueller investigation before the terms\nThat not that I Would say you're wrong I mean I just uh I don't think that they have anything against Trump and they don't want it to the fight the Democrats' chances and you know boost the Republicans' chances in the mid term [noise]\nWell uh I that would be a wonderful and magnificent if that's true of all I can tell you is for what it's worse there is\nIn in the in the\nQuote unquote cannons a procedure in our revered and volunteer department of justice that nothing they do should impact elections\nI mean call me even five at this as reasons for doing some of the things that he did\nIt now I Know I Know I Know it looks like he was doing the exact\nOpposite I forget what he did for a moment it's what he said there is all I'm telling you is that there is this it may even be a written regulations for all I Know\nBut it I I Am for certain that it is and acknowledge gentleman lay procedure that the the O. J. you know Doug balances him just as the scales that justice third wind the department of justice does nothing\nHe hated clothing indictments that would impact and election\nNow the Hillary cases do they had to exonerate heard their futures dependent on it\nTheir careers depend on it and she was a Democrat nominee they're not going to be in the business of charging and pursuing and diving the Democratic nominee again citing the unwritten regulations not impacting the election so it does exist\nAnd it probably is a factor in smaller report not being released\nWhat I expect to happen well I don't know what could happen\nSince they've decided to lead that Mueller is about finished since they've decided to leak that the report is imminent let me get that headline again just to [noise] not have to paraphrase this Mahler ready to deliver key findings in his Trump probe\n[noise]\nNow you know and this was going to drive the left literally batty\nThat it it it they're not going to be able to restrain themselves how long do you think it's going to be before somebody on that side of the aisle starts demanding that Mahler revealed is\nHow long do you think it's going to be before dawn lemon or little Brian\nStyle turned Jake Tapper any of these are the start demanding this I mean if he knows what it is why can't we know it shouldn't affect the outcome of the elections will be told I\n\nThink the odds are that are pretty good or not well let's play the game what's hypothetically say that that pressure is brought to bear it's not up the Mahler it's going to be up to Rosenstein and the president to an extent Congress that's who gets the report what yes\n[laughter] [laughter]\nI Can't see this happening but what if\nThere is a lot of pressure brought to bear on mother to reveal this release it are are Rosenstein whoever\nAnd somebody like Trump says well okay All right if you want to see him and they release it and there's\nNothing that indicates Trump what do you think that does the Democrat turned out\n\nA couple of weeks from now three ... what do you think that does that's why I don't think there's anything in here on collusion\nI don't think there's anything in it on obstruction because folks in one of the week just sixteen never Trump anti Trump paid mongers on Mueller's team if they had the guns yeah what a week and it would be leaking right now and it would be used to guarantee a blue\nAnd that didn't work\nNow he's out there are calling the porn star who by the way is a back stabbing black mailing\nDouble crossing\nPorn star is that they're calling her horse race\nAnd there are shutters and the drive by maybe su Dee Dee\nOh my God [laughter] presidents doesn't acts\nYou know what I find interesting about this all up\nThese so called parent kinds of virtue on the left where wandering perversion has become normal in their world and they demand that we accept wanting perversion as normal they sit there and act like\n[laughter] oh women Austin but we're not talking to a woman we're talking about a dual ... what porn star double crossing back stabbing\nWoman who has tried to destroy the guy with her third rate lawyer she's not just an innocent ordinary everyday woman the Trump decided to call in name she is a woman who attempted to run them\nBut for these liberal Democrats his people in the media to act like people don't talk to sweat prejudice still to come on\nPeople talk this way on this is what ... what I resent about this the idea that they are cleaning shores the wind driven snow and they don't think this way they don't talk this way what an absolute crock simply looked after the things they say about us during the course of your average political day\nFrom your Hitler through your Nazis to Europe this or that they make fun of people's appearances they make fun of people I mean they ... their their comedy has become literally hate\n\nAnd then they act like one of the greatest social ... question your history of humanity has occurred when Donald Trump uses the term horse\nFace when he did not mark balls the Ford but simply ... feet in the truth about her allegations I just I just find that to just a little bit\nHollow as low take your pick ticket they take your pick any left wing or on media\nGriping about Trump's using the word horse race and ask yourself if that media reporter never talk that way and the answer but Russia these people are president and he is and this has been nice the dignity of the presidency\n[noise] [noise] [noise] well I Know they look at it and think of it that way my point is they can try\nAll day long that's not going to separate Trump from his voters that some of his voters and she showed that in fact that there's so much good going on here focus on that don't don't need to distract every body with that stuff\nBut he did\nThey're also going to they're not going to give up trying to link Donald Trump to the murder\nOf the uh of the journalists in the Saudi\nConflict is some ... uh ... they're still working on that\nBut I think they're frustrated to no end that nothing they do works\nAnd now I have a story I have to print I haven't had the chance to printed yep just cleared the transom here uh it's about Trump's approval numbers are probably much better at much higher than anybody on the left and the media wants to add

punishments he's not\n[noise] ah\nIf you want to go back to the twenty Fifth Amendment it must be that you don't have anything else seems like the twenty fifth amendments always fall back when nothing else\nWorks now the CNBC story ah about the\nBlue wave is next don't expect a big Democrat wave this fall says and it was the NBC poll with um economic optimism soaring in the country will Democrats be able to sweep the power in either house\nOr will boy and settlements help Republicans keep all of their majorities latest CNBC all American economic survey offers mixed signals but leans against a wave Democrat election like that those that swept the Republicans to power in two thousand ten\nAnd two thousand fourteen now those were red wave elections thank you for Iraq who's saying oh CNBC survey not seeing it here and you see this more and more as we get closer and closer to the\nActual elections\nOne big our left we get to it before you know\nThis is talk rated number one seven ten W O R voice of New York and\nDonald Trump simply took it upon himself to inform the American people what the drive by maybe were hiding\nThat she didn't know anything about the event she couldn't tell anybody where it happened when it happened she couldn't describe the house where it was she wasn't even sure of the year much less than a month she\nIdentified for people over there all four said they were not there she did not have any answer for how she got home what she said to the person as she first met after this happened none of it all Trump there was remind everybody of this or actually inform him because the drive buys had not\nAnd that then cause the meat either run the story of Donald Trump saying this because they hadn't been hiding it\nThey hit it because it was not helpful to their ... their cause which was getting rid of ...\n\nI mean it's a central part of the story that the person making the charge doesn't have any evidence places people there who deny there were there and can't remember anything about the events other than she had one beer the media not reporting that Trump does the media falls for the trap and reports\nOver and over Trump saying it while accusing him of mocking her mocking is not what he did\nTo my career he would've had to attempt to impersonate her and he did not try to impersonate or he simply\nReminded everybody in the real world language that she had no evidence and it was the turning point in the outcome of those hearings make no mistake\nOnce Trump didn't and caused the media to end up reporting what they had been ignoring\nThen\nA lot of support that was their instinctively fur balls e for advantage jihad Noel\nIf there was nothing to support\nPeople with the common sense there was nothing that you you believer yeah the basis of what well she said is that what but she doesn't know when she doesn't know where the poor people she said that we're there to say they weren't\nShe became impossible to support and defend other than by partisans and that was the turning point and Kevin came in and of course his his re testimonials re appearance was a subtle factor now the whole thing is happening again\nThe story was that the porn stars defamation lawsuit a Trump got thrown out\nIt was a nothing burger\nForum on ... drive by media reported that Stormy Daniels and the creepy to warrior that she hired ... we're going to destroy Donald Trump they were going to prove that Trump had violated campaign finance laws to remember all this\nAnd there was Michael Cohen in the mix and he paid are often Michael Cohen's slipped and has now become a Democrat and he's offering to testify against Trump that's how last he is\nBut the media invested a lot in stormy Daniels' where ever she went to perform whatever poll she was slithering around a drive by Israel they're making a hero out of her\n\nStormy Daniels became a cause ... even before balls the Ford did\nAnd then that fell apart a judge in Los Angeles for rule out the porn stars defamation lawsuit of Trump\nClaiming it was bogus it had no merit\nSo in one decision the porn stars entire reason for existing vanished political\nAnd so did the lifespan of her creepy porn warrior who had already shot himself in a couple of feet by bringing forth some charges it that Kavanaugh had arranged gang rapes in high school and college\nSo all Trump did\nBy calling her horse face was call attention to what news story that the drive by as we're trying to ignore the news story was her lawsuit was drunk Trump was not guilty of whatever she was ... he had done to her\nIn fact she\nHad been found guilty the judge it through the lawsuit out demanded that she pay his legal fees\nI said this makes Trump a big winner again here ... the prostitute porn star is paying\nTrump who among us can arrange it that way folks but Donald Trump can\n\nThey also ignoring that part of it\nIgnoring that the stripper porn star and been ordered to pay Trump's legal fees\nBut when Trump called her horse race in a tweet all of the media were forced to run the story of his victory so you can sit there and say that Trump is embarrassing\nI guess they were stopped talking about people that way so it makes it so hard to\nRemember what I told you about the white Trump operates and pacing how he his original tank or opinion on any issue might make you think he's selling out but he gets that\nFirst take on the record media says wow it was very reasonable you said that Dr Boyle sea Ford was very credible very compelling shake Tony surprising\nThen after the passage of time with Dr ... Ford clearly has no evidence Trump says you've got no evidence and here's the evidence that she does however there's blah blah by the Trump gets his news covered\n\nThe media was not reporting this lawsuit have been throwing the media was not reporting and she had to pay him it was legal fees the media was not\nReporting a big Trump win and remember what was this woman and her lawyer we're trying to ruin\nTrump campaign finance violations and all of that [noise] so you can say you may not like the methodology but\nIt ends up working as an email friend of mine said this is ingenious at work [noise] trust Trump you mean too but he thinks the calling or horse race was genius somebody [noise]\nHad an email that I have here let's see what the Democrats try this headline this is\nFrom the hill dot com Democrats damp down hopes for climate change agenda what what does this say\nDemocrats are on the likely to pursue major climate change legislation even if they win the house majority despite a growing body of evidence suggesting time is running out to address the issue\nThis represents a shift industry the jury for when House Democrats last control the chamber in two thousand nine maybe they're not going to pursue it even if they win the house majority they're not going to pursue it\n[noise] it's a wonder why\nCould it be that in the span of forty years we've now had the forests ten year warning at least the fourth warning we only have ten years\nAnd in the midst of these forty years we've also had reports that we're beyond the point of no return that there really is nothing we can do [noise]\nThey've tried everything now they're even saying that climate change is going to destroy beer and there's nothing we can do you know why\nIs climate change going to ruin barley it's gonna ruin the ability to harvest and grow barely barely won the primary ingredients and beer [noise]\nBad news for judge Kevin alright\nInvestors business daily Trump's approval rating is better than you think\nSome pull quotes as a matter of fact Trump's approval rating is now higher than are tied with\nThree of the past six presidents at the same point in their first terms he is currently tied with Obama at forty four percent he's above Clinton at forty one percent Reagan at forty two percent at this time in his presidency\nBut there's a broader point here Democrats in the media keep describing Trump\nAs a hugely divisive figure but the polls show that his approval is starting to line up with previous presidents and what's more\nTrump's low numbers are almost entirely because Democrats are universally opposed to him another poll quote at this point in Obama's presidency ten percent of Republicans approved for the job he was doing and that was after the failed pork you it was\nIt was after the signing of Obamacare in after the signing of Dodd Frank another policies highly antagonistic to Republicans Trump on the other hand\nGets approval from only five percent of Republicans and that's where it's been throughout his presidency so Republicans in other words were far more forgiving of Obama the Democrats have been of Trump\nSo who actually is being divisive\nCrumpet the GOP or the Democrats who will hate Trump no matter what he\nDoes I have to think that the drive by are fully\nAware of this may not want to admit that Trump's approval numbers really much stronger than it's being reported and is a much higher here's that story certainly you didn't believe a daily basis Democrats fear Obama going soft for the midterms\nSeven ten W.

[noise] my\nQuestion is a really rather simple one where was this concern for our ambassador and three other men brutally murdered in Benghazi\nSomebody explain that to me you realize how much attention is being paid\nTo what\nHas it been confirmed if something happened since this program ... has it been can firmly that ... was murdered by the Fifteen hit men from Saudi Arabia hasn't been confirmed not confirmed so they'll likely or thought to end the story is that\nIt took him seven minutes to die that they dismembered him alive\nAt some point gave him drugs to knock him out and then they listen to music\nWhile they did all of this and of course\nUntil I blew up the theory that the apple watch contain the evidence they were going to try to make it look like proof existed in the form of audio recordings ... knew what was in store for a method\nFor NATO's apple watch the recording the stuff in the somehow is iPhone that very very unlikely\nBecause of it being technologically impossible barring a ... just only two exceptions that I Would have a tough time believing shall we even knew to do or how to do\n\nAll of this concern and remember\nHillary Clinton when repeated questions were asked about how in the world for Americans were allowed to be murdered in bend gossipy\nWith no assistance and Hillary Clinton's reaction what difference does it make now she said in frustration is is anybody see\nA a disparity here in proportion now of course\nWe all understand why the Democrats seriously believe they have a way\nOf blaming Donald Trump for his CNN\nAll afternoon has tried to make it look like the Trump knows the Saudis did it and is trying to provide them cover\nThat's it's despicable and graphics that they were using to try to make that case\n\nBut I think there's a lot of a proportionality missing here and again I don't think the media realizes how obvious\nThere's subterfuge is to people now anyway you know every uh every home has a a front door with a lock on it Dr balls the Fords home had two ... two doors did you know that\nDr balls the Ford had two doors that something to do with a claustrophobia and fear\n\nAnd handed over to Google employees reading this\n\nWait a minute it was a five hundred square foot plates said two front doors at the\n\nOther Google employees going back and they had their own separate front door oh well that's that's a big difference than meeting at Fort claustrophobia and P.
