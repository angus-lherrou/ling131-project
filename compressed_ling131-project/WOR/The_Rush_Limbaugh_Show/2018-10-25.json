the cost to\nWell that's what I say they they came from the from the from the swamps of Georgia as far as the drive by it looks so exactly\nYeah I just feel that they're just throwing anything against

as yesterday there's all kinds of stuff out there they have nothing to do with the bombs that were going to get into and not going to be sidetracked not going to let our enthusiasm here be tamped down or damp earth as you can\nTell already Bybee energy level which is off the charts here in this inaugural our if today's excursion into two broad cast excellence\nWe have to brief break here at the top of their local affiliates are tells you what's going on what's important where you are and we'll be right back after that so the patient\nCan use your most most of the box you'll see rated number\nI don't know about ... or whatever to actually implement these things because it's safer to buy into the whole welfare state mentality\nIt's and it's much easier to get credit for carrying and being compassionate I simply agreeing with the notion that govern much shorter and could take care of every ... every once\nAnd that's just been an irresistible tug and yet I mean there hasn't been a no nobody is targeted medicate here nobody said as a policy\nPriority that we're going to reduce medicated role but nobody said that it's just happened and it has happened\nAt the same time as a booming economy is happening it just it just more evidence I think these are the kinds of things that in some cases of people around the country either consciously aware of maybe subconsciously aware of what these\nBits of evidence of a roaring there there's a reason for Republican enthusiasm there's a reason why Republicans are out voting Democrats an early voting there's a reason for all of this upsetting the apple cart that's going on there was a reason why conventional wisdom is taking it on the chin\nAgain at least up to this point and the reason is resolved the reason is reality and it's a um [noise]\nA great thing okay to the audio soundbites as promised this was on the Fox news channel America newsroom good a bit\nHammer and Sandra Smith were hosting a round table out there was there was a three women\nWe had Republican National committee spokesperson Kaylee Mac and Fannie\nA bustle dot com head of research and Jessica tar love I I refer to her affection Italy is Natasha on top\nAnd Washington Free beacon a senior writer Liz Harrington they're talking about the Patrick ... ah the the the package bombs these these a mail order devices that have not exploded yet and bill hammer\nStarts off I go into came back in any case I mean what are you what you've been watching what you've been observing over the past six hours what are you see\nWhat I've observed a president who examine leadership he condemned the attack\nHe called for unity and then you had a response from the liberal media today ... the president [noise]\nThey should instead of blaming the president take a cue from the president\nDidn't leadership yesterday called for the country to come together instead of attacking one another with partisan politics time than behind the president shameful I Will add that the New York times today tell us to publish an article and to pick the fascination and the president of the United states we're twenty four hours from the thigh convene delivered and how have for the New York times\nI now I mentioned that through your toward the tail end of the hour they actually did they published a fiction piece\nBy a writer fantasizing over a secret service agent\nTending a Russian agent his gun to assassinate Donald Trump not the president not just the president not a no names and our Donald Trump you've got a Russian agent trying to assassinate his gun does that go off and so a nearby secret\nService agent hands but Russian assassin his gun sincere use mine the times runs this story and they excuses by say well\nWe must publish stories that relate to react to live with the Mueller investigation of Trump and from what they've got to do with Trump being assassinated anyway even if there was something to it which there is not\nAnd and then they're preaching to us why publishing that story they're preaching to everybody about\nCivility and why you need to dial back what Donald Trump is saying and the Donald Trump needs to dial it back and Donald Trump needs to change it Donald\nTrump didn't mean while they can call him a Nazi they can call him Hitler are they going to lie about the things he says and does all day long with no recourse that's what Mac and then he's talking about here now is Natasha on a top response\nI think that the president controls ten thousand that seek I'd laugh at it has rally that he was poking fun at the whole idea of all I'm not going to talk about the things I'm going to be a presidential which is essentially saying to the audience you know what I'm thinking and and this morning he tweeted that it was CNN fault\nWhich basically is they can tell if a woman gets actually thought that was her fault for wearing a short time has been completely and a permanent ... saying that CNN and was responsible for that because the fake news that they're spreading this is one fault but the arranged maniac that offending does I\nHope of all let me just adding van and that's what they want to be on the record of Latin python shut up and not culpable\nFor in the python culpable for the rhetoric that we're seeing back and forth than anyone an anchor on that network indoors to play in Central Park to pick the me assassinate the president\nSaying that the leader right now you heard Natasha on a top\nThere say you really you you want to\nBe on the record saying that when a pipe bomb showed up how about her analogy that Trump blaming CNN is akin to because they got about ... like\nBlaming a I'm a ... a woman who sexually assaulted blaming her for the assault\n[noise] [noise]\nI mean that's that's that's the logic that's the analogy to she used okay so so um the conversation continues here now you'll hear in a senior writer for Washington Free beacon lose Harrington or join the conversation at resumed here by by Natasha on atop\nThe kind of rhetoric at the ... than ... than a thousand things for years he recently commanded that Congress men about body slamming the reporter he has called the ... the enemy at the people have to pay them a legal for anyone who's guiding fellow at about\n... what about the language in Atlanta and every time than trying to do that kind of hair Brennan\nIn Santa Ana had a choice cats are today he always thought the president come out of his core into what America stand for black half I Wonder if the un anxious to complain if I'm the president can glean some fair than earth John Brennan echoing that how\nDoes that move at Fort Larry Flynt them at Ford at fighting the low road President Trump put the highlights Clinton said last week they cannot have the ability\nRight we cannot have civility so what your hand here yet on a top actually trying to blame all of this on Trump and of course using this\nI'm from the high road and I'm I'm from uh I'm from propriety and so just simply because she's on the on the left now before we go to the break\nWe're going to we're going to we're going to switch gears you're just a bit to talk about the caravan 'cause I saw this coming up right after I saw the soundbite that you just heard and I switched over to see it and I caught the governor of Ohio there John\nCase it and he is being\nInterviewed I I don't know who the reporter was at the CNN another matter being interviewed about the caravan and America and how to deal with I just I just want you to hear this we have to buy your number one\nWe have a caravan coming north we don't want all those people coming across our border and there are ways to deal with it I Believe that if we would check those who were legitimately in need of asylum could be vetted before they even get to the border\nBut you know why we're born in America you know how lucky we are to be born in America and not be born in Guatemala where they would say to your daughter deal if you don't do what we want we will rape your daughter or we will kill your son if he's not a drug meal\nNow they're marching north and you know what it could easily have been all of us that we're in the caravan there were marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nAll right so what is the rule was here or the technique here is moral equivalence\nThere but for the grace of God go live Phil Donahue used to do this all the time Phil Donahue was hosting the show and when the subject of illegal immigration would come up he wouldn't be he started preaching about the accident of his birth\nYou know I was born just a few miles inside the U.S border and it's it's look different it's made for me and if they started a stolen the guilt if he felt\nOver how the accident of his birth resulted in him being an American how basically on the air and that was to watch other people in the world as though being born into a country of prosperity and decency is something to feel guilty about\nAnd\nIt may be something to feel very grateful for I have no quarrel with that but it's how you deal with this\nThat matters we simply can't take and everybody in the world the answer the solution is to spread our area of dominant influence and to get rid of tyrannical regimes and dictatorships which treat their people like dirt\nAh and condemn that and do our best to spread our way of life around under the belief that it's good and decent but there are way too many people don't think we're the good guys and they think that the American way of life is an imposition\nTo others and that we don't have the right to impose our views on people but somehow we ought to stay on the side and let everybody who wants him in\nBecause of our guilt\nAnd he says uh you know it did their Marjorie nor is it could easily have been all of us that we're in a caravan that we're marching nor is trying to save our families and save our children\nThe voice of New York
