is supposed to sit\nBack and just take he's just see those are the old rules in Washington\nPeople under assault take it\nThe best way to deal with it they are advised to non make waves sit there and take it and that's how\nResponsible reasonable Republicans always acted well that's not that Donald Trump as he wasn't elected to act that way\nYou ask me the wrong people being told tone it down\nThe left needs to tone down it's organized violence the left needs to tone down all of these political stunts that are in many ways designed to provoke a reaction from people\nBecause they\nUtilize abuses of power and character assassination\nAnd the the character being assassinated just supposed to sit there just supposed to take it\nThat's how you get ahead in Washington if you're under the gun you take it you just sit there and you take it\nAnd you realize it's just politics don't take it personally judge Kavanaugh don't take it personally it's just politics because everybody hates Trump we

Kevin O's life was ruined and he's never supposed to want to get even he's never supposed to fight for him so\nTrump ditto not supposed to stand up to this not but that's who Trump is they're not used to it they thought they would have since Trump packing a year and a half ago they thought they'd be rid of Donald Trump\n\nAnd they still aren't let's go to the phones we have Steve in Pittsburgh with us You're up for us today Steve thank you for calling hello\nHey rushed pleasure to speak with you thank you sir\nI can tell you that last week in front of the Pittsburgh School board they had a proposal to arm school police and it was voted down to one\nWell it's been happening in school but you know similar situation where President Trump came out and said if they had an armed guard this could've been prevented and then you have but Mayor Bill Clinton was very anti Trump very liberal come out and say that an armed guard would not stop it's what we need is more gun control\nI mean how many more things have to happen before they realized that more gun control not answer not putting someone with a gun that can stop this\nWell look I hate to be the ones who tells you are but uh there's no amount of death there's no amount of\nShooting whatever get your mayor to change his mind about what he believes because you see it's really not about guns he thinks it is and it's important but it's not really about guns it's\nAbout something much larger than that it's about being able to tell people what they can and can't pay if it's about it's about telling people that they have freedom of speech except\nYou can't say this you can't say that can't but other than that you got for freedom of speech with us leftists [noise] ah yeah and you you want to have gotten you're going to have a gun except in eastern Kosovo but but but but\nWe're all for freedom as we define that he mentioned this let's\nGo to the audio soundbites I Want to start here with a [noise] Trump himself this is this is this is an example\nYou [laughter] well I'm sure some people were shocked a\nOn Saturday when this was Trump's reaction speaking with reporters he was a joint base Andrews it used to be Andrews Air force base case you're wondering what does this joint base business\nWell it used to be Andrews Air force base and then there was another military base close by another branch close by to unify them all the cotton joint base where multiple services are on the same place\nAnd so that's that's where air force one is parked at for Trump takes the helicopter to get on board Airforce one way is going to travel a reporter said\nMr President do you think you need to revisit seem so a guy goes nuts in a synagogue and spoil hill\nAnd the first question a drive by Mr President do you think you need to revisit\nGun laws [noise] by the way I Need to tell you something I've observed this is the last time the drive by some cared about the guns this guy had an arsenal and the drive buys have dropped focused on it because they think there is a bigger target\nAnd that is\nTrump being responsible for this and that in all the other things [noise] anti\nSemitism they think oh there's a lot of racism so they're not really focus on this guy's guns as much as they would otherwise\nThe worst part is that the rightful owners of those names never had a clue who he was they never

I got\nThis that's exactly right and this is where this is all headed this is all headed towards atheism anti God that's exactly what is a unifying the people on the left whatever they claim their religious views are the trend is towards atheism and no God\nOr at least agnostic ... because that removes any judgmental ism right it removes any limits on behavioral morality or anything else if there's no ultimate\nPower that can meet out approve or disapprove of one's accidental one is totally free correct\nAbsolutely\nWell I I just I'm so\nYou have this of this event in Pittsburgh given everything else that you say that you are\nAll the liberalism creep in to Judaism and a rising anti Semitism you're right it's it's anti Semitism is rising in Germany and nobody's talking about is rising throughout Europe and there aren't very many people talking about it so\nThis event in Pittsburgh did it did it adds to any of the uh discomfort or on is you're having about things in general\n[noise] ah I I I don't\nI don't feel like that there's a ... million people out there targeting\nI'd choose and the way that they would want to go she got the thing that I think that that these are isolated is an incident in this country that causes the country it's so good at that so many people I mean this guy is facing the death penalty he he went he certainly wouldn't be facing the death penalty anywhere else\nAnd I I mean I don't I don't feel unsafe\nAs a person who is Jewish walking down the street because they didn't Jewish I and I and I obviously don't think Trump has anything to do with it at that absolutely ridiculous and it's it's not going to make me not vote in the ... or anything like that\nI Am glad used because I'll tell you there's a lot of people that think and they're predominant by thank you thank you so much a re July precepts racial from Thousand Oaks California [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't think these events are going to have anything to do with them in terms of a lot of people do\nA lot of people think it's going to dampen a turnout what do you think I'm wrong or you\nYeah I don't think it's going to have a thing to do with them in terms like now after seeing sort of say a dare I say this\nYear I put my hands together and look to the lord and do I say this\nCaesar sidewalk and his pipe bombs none of which exploded\nWhat do you think the odds are that the drive by the Democrats are thinking well I don't have to ask as we know what we had people talking about how that whole thing last week was suppressing turnout remember and even Trump alluded\nTo the fact that that story was maybe going to dampen some people's enthusiasm remember that OK well there were some people I'm sure not too unhappy about\nThat and then the second events happened on Saturday in Pittsburgh and\nIt was the to the people that politicize everything\nAnd that's the people I'm Talking about and that would be the media and the American left ... people politicized and of course you've got extremists out there in the fringes everywhere who [noise] irrationally try to explain things away\nBut the people at politicize everything who look at both events through a political mountains [noise]\nHad to be thinking are right now this is going to this is going to really help us in the midterms this was going to dampen turns going to dampen enthusiasm for Trump I have\nI have an entirely different ... why I did the show open today but I did I don't think it's going to have that impact on people\nIn fact I think the media in their natural state drives more people to Trump each and every day and I think they've been doing it since the Sunday shows yesterday with is\nThe attempt to politicize this the attempt to blame Trump for this\nThey can't help themselves they have spent the past two and a half years trying to get rid of Donald Trump they have thrown everything they know\nEnd of the public domain hoping to influence people to abandon Trump and it has been happens to these two events come along and they but ah this is it this has to be what it is they're thinking [laughter]\nAnd they just can't help themselves they start blaming Trump for the synagogue shooting started asking the president what he's going to do about guns as you have a different view on it as though he somehow responsible\nAnd what it does it portrays it gives away the fact that as far as the American the left is concerned everything centers around Washington\nThat Washington is the solution for everything and how is Washington disillusion Washington is the solution because Washington is where\nThe enemies of the laughter going to be punished\nIs where the enemies of the left are going to be dealt with that's the role of government as far as the leftist concern government as an agent of power to enforce punitive punishing policies on the enemies of the American left that's its purpose so a shooting anywhere it takes place Phillips says\nThe voice of

silent coup using the upper reaches of power at the department of justice all Obama loyalists and Hillary loyalists\nWe no way we wouldn't have the power to plant spies in the campaign of a presidential campaign that we opposed there is no way any of us\nCould write up a phony document purported to be real intelligence claiming that Hillary didn't despicable things on a bad in Moscow and go get a fire warrant\nTo spy on the Hillary can't there's no way any of us in the in the conservative media couldn't come close to doing anything\nThat has become\nA natural everyday occurrence on the ... you want to talk about extremism and this this so called magical ability to brainwash\nWhat do you think happened in the past two years in the mainstream media brainwashing the American people

moment still believe\nThe Trump stole the election he worked with food and then the Russians to do it\nAnd it's only a matter of time and why do they think this because the media has assured them that it happened for two years\nWith the constant reporting of an anonymous sources\nSo health President Trump\nFor the walls dot com\nAnd tell Congress to pass Kevin McCarthy build the wall and enforce

to speak with you today\nThank you sir I'm very much I I just wanted to make a couple additional observations about the ABC News reporting on the synagogue shootings yes now I I normally watch Fox News but I always try to watch a network program every day just so I can legitimately compare the two\nSo I'm the ACC news reporting they quoted a study showing a rise in anti Semitism in this country\nNow when they sat this neither my wife and rock remember there ever recording this before even after the Farrah Khan turned my comments I'm also during the report when addressing the issue of armed security for places like the synagogue\nMore than one person commented that if we started this winter weather and\nI couldn't help but think what a classic liberal response to think we can't do anything that might make sense because\nOf their fears about what might happen on my own thoughts were um about armed security for\nThese you know they never have that fear about if you keep getting government bigger and bigger and bigger and more and more intrusive they never worried about where is this going to end\nBut\nIf you were if you do things you can give people more safety more control if you give people a greater feeling of security that liberals can't lay claim to then all of a sudden they fear where is it leading to where's it it's absurd what are you where's that hadn't yet\nMy thought is people are getting killed armed security if you think about that issue my thought is where can we START I mean if it's true that anti Semitism is on the rise maybe synagogues or a great place maybe in our schools since that's obviously a very common target the safe\nWell except the ... the lapses you'll you we we have gun free zones in schools now you can't put guns in America the only people get in with guns or the bad guys you\nPeople up [noise] um the left thinks that's the way it should be that if you put more guns in there and then somehow so the gun itself to the left is the problem so the presence of guns mean [noise]\nA voice in New York [noise]\nSeven ten W O\nGot fifty five degrees at two thirty good afternoon I'm Jeff McKinney another suspicious package
