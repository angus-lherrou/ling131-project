B. I.\nSpecial agent her best friend for life\n\nAnd she is named as one of the people that Dr forty helped pass a lie detector test in her appointment application for the FBI\nMonica McLean\nIssued a statement to ABC I have never had an Christine Blasey Ford or anybody else prepare me or provide any other type of assistance whatsoever in connection with any polygraph exam I have taken it anytime\nI ...

[laughter]\nLack of a reveal what in the New York times tax story on Trump\nThe\nNew York times did a year long investigation of Trump's taxes now I I don't know where they got the returns that it's illegal that they have them\nObviously somebody at the IRS doesn't care I mean the left as infiltrated everything's obviously that's how this happened what does it matter wants the times has on that that but they've had them now for a year and know when the story runs\nThey ought not be trying to crowd out the Kavanaugh story right this is something ideally you'd want to wait until closer to the election\nYou want to make me wait a couple of weeks but no they ran this thing yesterday and now there's a companion Showtime network documentary on this so there's been some collaboration might even say some collusion on this\nWhite cover up the Kavanaugh story with that this is providing a huge challenge for the cable news networks what to do what to do we got Trump out there they claim is mocking\nBalls the forty wasn't mocking or walk I I understand Republican senators saying what they're saying oh my God this is on the acceptable I don't know why president that\nHe did it for some reason\nEverybody's pointing out that the Trump just\nLast week was saying she was very credible yeah he did and we knew when he said that why he said it\nHe had to everybody has to before\nAll this is a investigated and put it but you can't run out there\nAnd start ripping on her even if it deserved even if it's warranted last week you could not read up on Christine balls before there was nothing there is no upside to doing it no matter if you were right even if she was lying there were teeth and you can demonstrate a last week was not the time to\nDo it so Trump joined the chorus I find a compelling I find her very credible\nWill now she's not so credible she never was but now she's not so credible as all kinds of whole\nDuring the hearing last Thursday but the Republicans were not going to go there and they were not going to challenge or because it just wasn't\nSmart [laughter] specially with that voice that she was affecting to go after her in any way that would seem like an attack or like you didn't believe her whether or not been politically useful but in a in a normal congressional hearing\nCommittee hearing her allegations wouldn't be challenged in tested they weren't not that's all Trump did\nTrump pointed out the mistakes or the ... or the difference is the prevailing occasions she can't remember where when who the people she says ... says they weren't that's only did Republican senators should have done that last week but they couldn't\nSo Trump's Kevin uncovered Trump writing shade for them and let them go out and rip him for doing and if they want to understand that by this time we have to assume Trump knows what he's doing when he goes off script he doesn't step and it\nIt might look like it but he doesn't but that's not the big takeaway [noise] the big takeaway for me as this one year the New York times has been investigating the prompt for forty years they've got tax returns going back who knows how long\nAnd guess what's not part of the story guess what is not part of any income tax story\nOn Donald Trump guess what one word you do not see in the report anybody want to take a guess\nWhat did you say no that's not the word what one word is not in this entire New York times or I'll give you a hint\nIt was the sole reason the last one I didn't get their hands on Trump's tax returns\nRussia at ten for that yet they want to Trump's tax returns because their tax returns they said\nWould prove Trump colluded because his money came from Russia because his wealth was be causing due to Russia and connections that's what everybody on the left was convinced was true and now here's the New York times story\nYear long investigation Trump's taxes going back more than forty years and then not able to find any Russian mommy\n\nSo now they didn't find any Russian money and I guarantee you they expected to\n\nThey're the ones that said this they're the ones that said I'm Talking about everybody on MSNBC CNN and go back a year ago back to the two thousand sixteen campaign when everybody was hell bent on proving\nThat Trump was they put in storage\nTrump wants to Tony Trump was compromised by Russia because it was Russia that enable Trump to get rich\nAnd his tax returns would prove it they said so I guarantee you when the New York times got these documents the first thing they did\nActually or whatever or something somebody said James borrow things mostly are too young to remember\nBottom line and I know what had happened to a woman for political\nNow what grams point is there's a lot of young people in his audience it don't remember the Clinton years in Nineteen Ninety two when James Carville was trying to destroy all John's\nEh you never know what's going to do when you're grabbing gotta go to ... ... what you got to come up with just like you're not gonna you're gonna come up by women like New Hampshire gray the president had\nBill Clinton and that's Hillary Clinton was right in there trying to help destroy those women and Lindsey Graham was referring to these people in the audience didn't know what they thought he was talking about the word\nAnd that's when he stopped and said I see that's actually a reference to something somebody said James Carville most of you are too young to remember this\nSo not only do they live in denial than it ever happened now they're trying to shut down anybody who brings it up you know the Clinton years in what they did the women supposed to go down a memory hall\nNow I have a transcript and anti Kevin all protester was confronted a a Republican senator and he pushed back this was an attack or a confrontation walking down the hall\nOr any Kevin all protesters have flooded Capitol Hill and they've been around to get into the hallways of the offices\nIn Senate office buildings how does that happen\nBut what we all know that what happens but they're they're one of these protesters approached Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana on his way through a Senate building walkway Monday\nAnd she said why are you supporting Kevin up where are you supporting candidate on caster they did not ignore her he took the chance to push back\nHe asked her if she would like it if her loved ones were destroyed by uncorroborated charges\nCassidy why wouldn't I support Kavanaugh protester because rapist or bad Cassidy wait a second everybody there said it didn't happen either rape anybody so why am I gonna so you're going to you're going to believe mark judge over a woman no I'm going to believe her best friend\nWho says it didn't happen she wasn't there\nHer best friend didn't say didn't happen her best friend said she wasn't told about it her best friend said she didn't remember it protester so you're okay as a doctor do harm a woman Cassidy\nWait a second are you OK as a person to go ahead and do accept the non corroborated charge to destroy somebody's life\nIf you destroy your life your son's life\nYour husband's wages to answer that question if it was your husband your son your father whose life has been destroyed by uncorroborated would you like that protester I Would support a full FBI investigation we're dealing with appropriate robots I'm Glad Cassidy pushed back but it's a lost cause on the protester the protesters not even hearing what he says she's got program dancers\nBought and paid for by George Soros\nAnd she hears key words and what he says knee jerk reaction causing things replies accordingly\nCastle you know no would you like and on corroborated charged destroyed I wouldn't marry somebody that was a drunk so the protestor\nOh wait a minute uncorroborated answer the question I don't think you're able to because you know it's unfair protester I Would stand up Cassidy you know it's unfair protester I Would fight and I would make sure women or heard clearly you're all care for rapist goes on the Supreme Court Cassie do not\nBut then on the other hand clearly you're okay the absence of evidence obviously means nothing view protesters there is evidence look at a standard how many people are in jail for ...\n[noise] so what this ... unless somebody like me gets hold of a transcript something like this and help people understand that it's a total waste of time to engage in these protesters especially if you're trying to persuade them you can't persuade them I just like you can't persuade the media\n[noise] you know I'm I've told the story when I was first at this\nVery young wet behind the ears naive and the media would want to talk I thought there were really interested I didn't know nobody's ever heard of me a radio shows taking off I thought they were legitimately curious and that's how I went into early interviews I found out that's not an all they weren't curious about anything they were simply there to discredit me\nMake fun of me to raise doubts it took me\nLonger than I Want to admit to figure this out you cannot for sweat and these people you\nCan't change their minds and debate it's why I say the only option is to defeat them politically and that's happened\nThat somebody has to have to say\nRussia's probably by being met

are the questions she should have been asked last Thursday by Republican senators heard timeline should have been challenged her allegations should have been challenged but they weren't the Democrats weren't going to the Democrats announced her and stayed at her\nTo be credible she's above and beyond reproach you cannot challenge or she is the accuser so the Republicans they've they they they played ride along and without Henry Joel Mitchell ask her some questions which now journalism a brilliant but at the time we were all kind of curious to know what what's the purpose was\nUm all Trump

for your caller credible testimony compelling and he'll even go so far to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth yeah they're my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\nThat gives him credibility\nIt makes people kind of cock their head they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that's a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later\nTo be critical and to step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found are compelling then as we learn more and then as events play out Trump is able to parlay his original statements\nInto what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to have said initially what he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense\nWe've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph expert and I have taught people how to beat them we have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did it gives him a credibility later to be critical\nJust step away it's a common technique you use as he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there have been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned that Trump\nWill tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... the ... the ... before he pulled out above the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say\nClimate change very serious thing to do with a look at it than we are looking at it than\nMoving to the right to oh so he's on record as being open about then later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes up tells you what he thinks\nReally thinks it's a pattern it's a technique if they\nTrumped developed I don't even know if he developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation Senate Republicans having Trump has Trump has a stab wished\nThat after he makes an initial statement on something and he can make fun of things\nAnd what really irritates ... he gets away with it I cannot tell you how it irritates them to he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has an just continue to prosper and triumph I cannot tell you\nHow the lions Lee insane\nIt has made the with rage\nOther Republicans have not developed the golden adds to do this\nAnd pull it off\nTrump hasn't been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand they did was three years\n\nIn fact it's it's it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much\nHe doesn't care anymore it doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows he's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why\nHe is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night I Know Murkowski\nAnd Collins or shorter ringing cowering in the corner with the vapors oh my God it was horrible it was the one the horrible everything he said is true\nIt was not mocking her the actress\nVideo audio we played mocked mostly for Trump didn't\nHe just simply boy she she came back up she cannot corroborate there isn't any cooperation for what she said why is that not relevant why does that not matter\nWhy have we gotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accuse any man of anything and it's gospel\nAnd then be joined by a so called movement called me to work all women can joined that can you imagine if there was something going on there can you imagine a man organized\nFor the express purpose of destroying women\nYou can't even imagine that can you you can't even imagine there or\nAnd nice movement the male version of me too\nWell\nRush or a million women or nor do their search we'd do well\nYeah yeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not about even ban and set it this is not just about sexual abuse this is about Raul power this is about female rage\nBecause of things that have happened to them the leftist women\nAnd they have organized all of these disorders into a giant political movement I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision\nA movement of men if if such a group existed\nAnd Oprah Winfrey had invited the leader on her show he'd been thrown off and the first ten minutes and I've been ridiculed and made fun of for the rest of his life it could not happen\n\nWomen are a minority and supposedly even though they're not uh in numbers but it's so out of balance all Trump did\nWas say what everybody

a National Review um\nThe more time I spent covering politics the more I'm convinced that a significant chunk a grass roots political activist or not really arguing about politics at all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them under the world of politics bingo I've been searching for that description for years I have no\nProblem admitting that I was unable to put this together as one of the rare moments I was unable to\nThis is exactly right we're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics\nFor the solution or the written Ben is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding than every representative of the group that they are the individual that did something can\nBe made to pay a price for it that's what the ... this this um [noise] well\nThe me too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was\nA and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democratic party look at look at the uh [noise] Occupy Wall street move but look at black lives matter I take take any left wing group that you want it's\nMade up of people who for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up their cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party of all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all of these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people\nCapitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible insult people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy and then the big donors come along and underwrite them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to view that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with this\n\nNo idea whatsoever so we ended up and debate about whether\nBoys\nWant to pretend to be girl so they can go on a girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate\nThat's sick it ... it is in many not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating\nMovement that has been constructed to push\nAll of these disparate various agendas and the target is America the target is America is founded the target is American Capitalism and so when our caller says\nThat Kavanaugh is simply a stand in for men who have abused every woman out there he's right\nBalls the Ford will end up being supported by other women who have been abused whether she's\nTelling the truth or not it doesn't matter because it\nDidn't happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching this did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case I mean capital that's how they're going to be heard\nRather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them\nIt's the same thing I think with black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem a all cops are bad every white ... every black convict is in is\nIn every instance here points to the country at large as being responsible in unfairness in biased in discrimination in racism all of this [noise]\nThe Democrat Party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of these\nComplaints Democrat parties happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one and Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they'll fix it\nAnd they never do they never the range and the anger never ends if only gets worse because the Democrats don't fix anything and finally\nIt doesn't even depend on being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not\nNow Sarah Sanders White House press briefing is going on and she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly what I said if I don't mind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply recites did the facts\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats they are to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public they had ... forge email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim\n[noise]\nA survivor of men community now son CNN\nAnd here it is that there's this they didn't even the Connecticut Senator who himself has been the target of attacks from Trump the target of attacks and the guy was flat out why or what do you mean the target\nOf attacks from Trump trumped an attack anybody told everybody who the guy is\nAnd here is Sarah Sanders from the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts and\nIt was all about do you think that maybe the birds we shouldn't have done it marking her like that because you get Collins and Murkowski it'd be the way they vote or do you think the president for maybe should have not done it\nThe president was dating the facts I frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report he was fading facts that were given during Dr Ford's testimony and it's and it has to make a decision based on those facts\nAnd whether or not face the judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold the position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's been\nPicked apart every single word second by second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about the accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits and outrageous\nExactly right ya can't challenge her so Trump did for everybody else who doesn't have a gun adds\nTo do it Trump did it in yeah he's providing a little shade for some of these people to hide under [noise] and I'll guarantee you they may be publicly saying I Wish you hadn't done it that's outrageous what prompted their thinking everybody did it privately\nSomebody has to say it it's the freaking truth\nOkay not back to the phones and we go to Tom's river New Jersey ... is next and he is Fifteen Years old ever among glad you waited you're next on the program thank you for calling\nHey rushed great to speak to you again a right to have your back\nYeah it's great to be on again anyways so I'm watching this whole thing on me too movement watching the Kavanaugh hearings I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nInto a girl but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women that pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them or coming old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know he had to draw on CNN ... like a couple of months ago saying that a guy raped or because he asked her for her phone number [noise] can't believe any of them and I think that what this this hold me to\nKind of white ... ever mounted on credit anyway at that that is my exact point I Believe that woman\nI Believe she think she was raped when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned\nWomen's studies on campus\nThe the outright hatred for men you know I keep talking about it but it's relevant Catherine McCann and this was back in the nineties\nShe was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class that all sex is rape even the sex of marriage the women were lapping up and women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today so you have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist but it's entirely possible at the same time out from\nThat the cause of what she's been taught and heard on the news and talking to her she may literally believe that men don't have no right to ask for her phone number is the same thing as bullying her raping her that's my\nPoint she may really believe it\nIt goes well rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about how they've been raped or off the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nOr have you\nEver um a year right sex without consequences it but you better not\nBut then they claimed that all men are predators but then they run to the right hook up and then they want to have abortions for free\nWhen it's their idea then everything's fine you\nKnow if I'm up at a ride by the way here's this ... you're also random it's not all women but it's been made to look like that isn't it\nThe me too movement supposedly include all women women\nOn across America who do not think this way are being lumped into this movement\nAgainst their will it's just an assumption that the Democrats and the drive by media\nOr making I think I Am from you're young you're growing up I think you're

neither here nor there the objective of this was to get Kavanaugh to withdraw his nomination or to have Trump pull it\nNow that that hasn't happened this case is beginning to collapse you see stories all over the media about how all this so called evidence just isn't fair\nThey thought that the mere allegation that that Kevin on with not sit there and let his life to be destroyed like this they fought Trump wouldn't sit there\nAnd let his nominee need be destroyed like that because they think Trump's ego is such that he will not be allowed to be made to look bad because of what somebody else did or didn't do so they thought there would be a giant cave on this and there hasn't been\nSo now it is panic and scramble time\nSo the zero in on flake\nAnd Trump couldn't hold it in any more or last night at the rally he just on ... on the fact that Christine Ford doesn't have any evidence is changing her story and the media is all over the place now saying well you know there's\nJust many

free Heitkamp Donnelly my cat what's actually for Donnelly McCaskill mansion and Heitkamp have all been hoping that Collins caves that maybe even McConnell would cave and that Murkowski would cave and that flake will continue to flake and cave\n\nBut in their states there's hell to pay in their states people want Kavanaugh confirmed [noise] in fact in North Dakota voters back Kavanaugh's sixty to twenty seven\nPolling has been gun heading the wrong way for Heidi Heitkamp so my point is it may not it may not matters or matter what happens to Collins and Murkowski\nBut if they if if they actually don't vote for Kavanaugh simply based on what Trump said last night\nWell that would be embarrassing for them [noise] [noise] now\nSince Trump's on the record as questioning the veracity of Dr Ford and I want to share something with you I found today a power line Scott Johnson one of the contributors a power line\nWrites that a reader of theirs noted the changes in the timeline that Dr Ford herself presented the power\nLine reader refers to himself calls himself an engineer with especially in data visualization\nAnd he made a graphic it created a chart in essence based on public sources based on the Washington Post and other legal documents and it\nIs the dates to varying dates the different dates of the sword there the event Dr ... says happened\nAnd the dates float she's not even consistent with the so the timeline of her story doesn't even add up\n\nThe reader notes the sudden story changed correlating with the time progression in the story date column I'll get that isn't just a second\nHis question of why this sudden change within a few weeks after July sixth of two thousand Eighteen the answer is that's when Dr Ford came into the Democrat or bits of Anna Eshoo Democrat California and Feinstein and their staffs\nAnd the highly partisan Democrat lawyer Deborah cats recommended by Feinstein right after that foreign changed her story two more times in two months\nShe grew more specific after she began consulting with Democrat activists\nAs they conspired to destroy Kavanaugh\nSalt the charge here and try not to try to serve a difficult to convey but this is a text to charge there is some uh some\nBars in this thing but it isn't title Dr Christine Blasey Ford's ever changing story multiple inconsistent stories of the date of the alleged\nIncidents in the therapists notes the incident is said to have occurred and the men the Nineteen eighties the when she was in couples therapy\nThe therapist notes from when she was an individual therapy say that the story occurred not in the mid eighties but the late eighties\nIn her text messages to the Washington Post she's back just saying that it happened in the mid eighties\nIn her letter to Dianne Feinstein she said the incident happened in the early eighties\nIn the hand written statement at the time she took her polygraph high school summer in the eighties and early is crossed out\n\nEarly eighties could have been eighty eighty one\nIf the Senate Judiciary committee hearings she sent it happened in the summer I'm Nineteen eighty two she had never said that\nBefore she said mid eighties late eighties mid eighties early\nEighties highschool summer early eighties she specified summer Nineteen eighty to these changes are current as she is in consultation with all these Democrat activists the staff of Feinstein and an Anna Eshoo and Deborah cats the the lawyer\n\nAnd hurt changing story leaves her short on credibility put aside her emotional performance her testimony\nReveals her as a witness was memories chain\nIn ... at her convenience\n\nThe problem for Dr Ford is not that she doesn't remember everything if the everything she remembers changes that her convenience first

something that is that what she's doing it because she was making the wrong person and letting the person to actually get it to her get off scot free\nYeah that's see that's the thing here with me if something actually happened to her\nThen whoever did it\nIs got to be laughing all the way to wherever resented exactly\nWell I'm Sorry I have a problem with this line that something happened to her obviously but did not have been kept\nWhere I'm not saying that I totally agree with it but I don't think that that's what people you know because how do you conduct that\nPeople say that because they want to be seen acknowledging her as believable or credible southern no they don't get rid of our\nI Need a labor\nAnd she they hand I later wind it because she does it say where it happened he can't remember the house you can't remember that there that I have an amber things that have um\nWell what about the business that some of these ah experiences are so so so demeaning shocking violence that people some victims don't want to remember and don't I mean they suppress it do\nHaving happened having had this happen can you speak to that 'cause I\nThere are a lot of people who who I'm told have horrible things happen to them and they do suppress the memories and night and sometimes they're they're forced into therapy to bring those memories out because if they don't they're never going to get past it\nMight well with this ah this package I ended up pregnant and you know I I didn't let it took me to have an abortion that for a lot\n[noise] now I Can't get you get ... but I think it'd be the way that it happened because it was near my home county I was a um major rack\nAnd it was a round the end of a September of Nineteen Seventy four now the day the very day I Can't give you

that happened\n[noise] yeah I [noise] you you try to put yourself in a similar circumstance I've I've never been\nA cost it that way I've had I've had a upsetting things happen and we all have and I've tried to think independently none of them and they were approaching yours don't misunderstand I'm\nTrying to think what thirty six years ago there was a fire things have happened at once I Know where I was once I'm able to place where I was\nEither within a given month or a week or even a year then my memory starts telling me a within a certain day and re date range of things happened I'm In my case the more upsetting they were the more vivid the memory\nUh because they were the man was a formative won a for either good or bad but I I I Do remember a specifics [noise]\nNow I couldn't take it to the exact house where one of these events to me happened while having dinner I Know that it was in Sacramento I ... I couldn't tell you where the house was today if my life depended on it uh\nBut I can tell you the guy and his girlfriend and the layout of the kitchen and all I can do that but where it was I couldn't\nBut rape victims in sexual abuse victims um it depends on on on the victims some of them have vivid recall of every detail like this and some some uh some don't but her date range or and descriptions of the house in a place for the people there who all deny it\nUh and the timing of all if you put this whole package together\nIt just [noise] [laughter]\nAnd the reason for it to keep a conservative off the Supreme Court I just don't think any of this a spontaneous happenstance [laughter] I don't think Feinstein just received a letter she didn't know it was coming just don't believe it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "New York", "day": "03"}
