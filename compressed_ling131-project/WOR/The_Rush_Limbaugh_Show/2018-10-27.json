away from that and the pharmaceutical took over and now we're back to fruit and vegetables are good and [noise] and I think is the best thing in the world\nAnd what are some of the um the good positive side effects um have you experienced from taking balance of nature\nWell or feel good and the you know I just I put forty is in New York City fire department and\nI didn't expect to make it past sixty and I just turned Seventy nine and a in September so uh yeah and I've been thinking about the surveys for for a while and ah [noise]\nAh both for that is a take these movies my kids had me

in it you know your nine year down right away the few sound like\nYou're thirty though so that's a good thing is there any thing Dr Howard that you think that might be a a a reason why he's been able to kick the cancer and also go to the gym three times a week and\nThe great grandchildren with the kind of lifestyle he had being a a fire\nAnd are just balance of nature help in that way\nWell sure and I don't know if a ... bill how long have you been taking balance of nature I'm not sure\nOh for several years ah you know and it's spreading I can really say that I've heard you know you can't put your finger on everything but I feel generally I feel good\nGrade and then I Would say yes it's been several years it's a part of\nA part of your chemistry it's been a help in in New kicking those but again we go back to the trial judge I don't know if they've talked to you about that try to help that triangle of\nOf the physical part of help the mental emotional spiritual part of health and the nutritional and you you have mastered some of those other areas that have helped you through this because I Know this because I've talked to fill before\nAnd and I I Love his books he's written some books to be able to shed some of his some of his stress and and hardship inside of him he's written it in a book and those books are wonderful my I tell you what my father was a fireman\nAnd um and he he actually died of effects of being a fireman and um and\nSo fail was kind enough to send out the a couple of books to my mother was a\nGracious note in there she left it does really well he has left family would be in her room and all of that in the\nHouse laughing all to herself in there and I knew she was reading your book [laughter] yeah\nWell you know I wrote the first book because like you said that things are bothering me that and I didn't even realize that I was like the press I was division commander in Brooklyn for uh twelve years\nAnd from Nineteen Ninety One to two thousand and one right before nine eleven [noise]\nWe lost twenty four guys in a line of duty in my job and a twenty of them were good friends of mine and guys that I worked with and it was really getting to me and I didn't even realize it but once I started writing about it and put it on paper\nI it they're out of my mind that didn't have to think about them anymore and I'll talk to people who've outer anytime they want but uh I don't have to think about it so that's why I started writing books and then a publishing told me I think you've got two more books and and he was right\n[laughter] and they're great they really were on the\nThing is is it it really supports the whole aspect of of that try to help that spiritual mental emotional side is so important\nAnd and that's another part of it and put that with the chemistry and sure it's going to boost up fills physical side just just if we boost up two sides of it it's going to boost up the third\nAnd I and that's just awesome and that and these\nAre the reasons your the reason fill that that I was inspired to do this product I didn't set out to make a product I Love being a doctor but when it when it hit me I thought I Need to do this about like you did you you need to write those books\nBut but I had to for the first book [noise] the title of the first book his laughter tears and muscle drums I had to put laughter in there because I had to put some funny stuff because it was just too many tears you know\nYes yeah but ...\nBut I was having a depression and that was before nine eleven ... that was the ten years before nine eleven from made it a Ninety Nineteen Ninety One to two thousand and one then nine eleven hit\nAnd that was like a and I was supposed to work that day I worked in the day before and uh which was my birthday September tenth\nAnd that was relieved by two of my best friend's sadness cross who was a battalion chief in my division tank commander and he was acting deputy that night so I was relieved at six o'clock on Monday Night by\nDennis and to me ... Paul who is the captain and a ... road with him because there was no place for him to work every ... every\nEvery unit was covered so when that happens in a captain is assigned to work he rise with the deputy chief and that's what happened that morning they wrote together and ah I never saw them again\nCan you just give us the name of the books really quickly and show\nThe first book is a laughter tears in muffled drums\nThe second book is bringing everybody home which is a cheese that says fondest wishes to bring everybody home and the third book is uh the last true hero which is like

saliva or by energetic scans\nBlood work a also personalization with DNA or to make sure you were able to keep it off a so it's it's it's completely for you\nEach individual and that's that's why you know we got deep some tremendous results twenty five to forty five pounds a and and that's what we typically see\n[noise] um it it it's very interesting because we've had so many um we we kind of go in waves in terms of like the\nUh professions that we see in the office which is really weird I Know it sounds weird but it kind of makes sense now that I Know more information about it so this week we had\nJust one of your off the cops do now it's ... yeah I Do a lot of\nThe ... well you know you don't remember I set up front right I I'm generally at our reception desk all day long so\nI hear and see so many different things and I really try to tune in and listen to what a lot of our patients are saying when they think nobody's actually listening to them right and so this week we had um a number of commercial drivers and our um you know front desk waiting area and so\nSome of them were current patients some of them were new patients that were just about to get started some of them were just new patients that had just heard the goal over we're about to get into a consultation\nUm and what was interesting was that I didn't realize that commercial drivers have a whole set of rules about the health that they have to actually be in or achieve show with our job\nDriving a big old ... strong\nRight but if you you know you would think ... or policemen or I don't know like a\nA doctor should have certain standards that they're you know\nTough guys are driving by a giant truck right up there for hours and hours on end and it takes a ton of indoor and right\nBut you usually don't think of that right so what was interesting is that one of our patients um who was saying these checkups right so one of the patients that was sitting in our waiting room and struck up a conversation with somebody who had just been in the consultation is actually signing up and\nI'm the gentleman said to him you know does this program work and the other gentleman said yes actually it does and the new patient started asking him some questions and\nThe existing patients said um you know the reason I came here is because I had this a checkup that my job prescribed and I was basically told that if I didn't lose the weight because I was borderline diabetic borderline you know very high blood pressure cholesterol issues\nI if I didn't lose the weight and if my health and improve I was basically out of a job cuts and no it's not and so what I found to be amazing is that the potential patient turned him and said oh my God he said that's what I Do for a living as well\nAnd they exist Haitians looked at him and he said\nAnd you haven't had that check up yet and the guy said no I haven't but I'm sure glad I'm Talking to you about it [laughter]\nSo yeah so I didn't realize this but you know lo and behold um our existing patient his name is Paul he said I I don't recall the new patients name So Paul said to him you know this diet does work and it really is amazing it's really easy to follow 'em\nAnd it's really easy to follow the blow while I'm On the road when he never thought that he'd be able to actually do a diet because of that\nBecause you know these guys are always on the road down the road for hours and hours there's not a lot of stops of places to eat it and if there are there usually extremely unhealthy so he says that he's actually been able to find really healthy options in all of these places that he used to stop and now he's eating according to the violence of the program he's almost done with the program by the way I think he's down close to like\nThirty seven pounds of forty days well that's all he really had to lose\n'em and and the summer there were tremendous amount of he's taller guy so he carries it well but clearly the health issues where the more concerning nervous and and you know just going back to my original point of the beginning of the show is that really what we're doing is we're changing people's lives in terms of\nHealth and that's kind of the most important thing here right because with all that fat laws come so many different benefits as far\nAs getting you better feeling a better so\nTalking about the commercial driver's ah Jake uh who you actually saw um this week is done with his two six today rounds and he is down a hundred and twenty pounds I'm also commercial driver um\nAnd he says that you know he he always meet up with some of his friends along the way along his route that he does and he says people don't recognize him anymore and I was like well listen a hundred and twenty pounds is you know\nIt isn't just around six year olds that are ... to to their to sixty day around to the program though was he'd be the he would be the big you know he would end up down for the for the guy who was fifty four year already beat him well we had somebody who lost sixty nine and six they also I Know that from say for the week yeah no north to roll right he's\nPretty high up their hundred and twenty you know basically a hundred and twenty pounds in a hundred and twenty days or is that what it is right it is up in the middle you stopped in the middle reset and he got\nCaught up what's really cool about his story is you know the ... between\nThe grounds you didn't put anything wrong because now you know give them the tools that your weight goes up by two pounds here's what you do here's how you knock it off he's got the DNA test he's got the blood work to help keep his body bells he's got the personal are supplements and he's not going to just not going to put it back or\nHe he couldn't figure out how to get enough calories to eat while he was on break from the two six today rounds\nHe couldn't even a food sickly uh that's kind of where that was that but the interesting thing about his story is that what he said to me was his doctor kept track of his blood work the whole entire time that he was on the program through 'em\nAnd he said that each and every time that he did blood it just kept getting better and better and better and he\nWas saying that before he started the program he was basically a\nPre diabetic they wanted him to start taking seven hundred milligrams of met foreman a\nJust you know it was really lucky at his weight I noticed lately already not a very lucky is very very lucky\nBut he told me that I'm at the end of the day all of the medications\nThat they wanted to put him on would have cost him out of pocket seven hundred dollars a month well okay let's calculate that I Believe\nThis gentleman is in his late fifties I'm not a hundred percent certain of his age let's assume he ... he lives until he's eighty\nSo let's let's give them another twenty five years ... twenty five years times twelve times seven hundred dollars go to court and that's out of pocket that's insurance not covering for and you know what we don't even know if these medications are going to be able to control whatever he had going on so that was actually what he focused on your says you understand how much\nMoney I'm saying that I'm like I Do the ... I that's just mind boggling numbers hundred and twenty pounds a hundred and twenty days and we saved a potential seven hundred dollars a month for the rest of it and who wants\nTo take those medications even if there were for insurance covered all of it who wants to go on and you know most of these things that people are taking the medications for for for obesity they're really you know every doctor will tell a patient that that\n... ... it's almost a hundred percent curable because they're all affected from what I'd rather and was told her all the result of of of being overweight and that's and that's really tremendous so\nYou know these are these are typical result twenty five to thirty five pounds for women is what we see thirty five to forty five plus pounds per month\nAnd that's only in forty days it's without ... without hormones without surgery it's all natural solutions supplements that are personalized each individual from uh from blood work for parents live a bar or Byron jak scans\nDNA testing as well a beginning and end and and really you know that's what makes it go with the personalization of how to how to balance each how to help balance each person's body\nWhen they come in a and so you can call one eight five five five and Jay diet what I start five five six five thirty four thirty eight without the schedule an appointment and one of our offices and we're all excited about ... about Princeton opening lots of people bring coming up\nFrom South Jersey saying when you can open when you're gonna open so we're finally opened up place down there were I see patients fare and it's really great so twenty five to forty five pounds and typically what we see a little bit more on the men's side sometimes and a twenty five five five and Jay diet and like when you're calling and make a phone call when you're calling please remember the people on the phone [noise]\nThey're just there to schedule the appointment they really don't have the answers to your costs\nYou just shrink and you look great because you were making sure staying hydrated and increasing your water and you how your body's absorbing water so she said she lost twenty twenty two parts because I Swear I I look I I I'm wearing I can get into clothing now that I I couldn't get in when I was thirty thirty five pounds\nLighter a and so she's just she says she came in she's super thrilled I'm going to do much for shopping spree she says she says her husband is going to kill her as you go into a shopping spree a and put what's great you know she came and she had a bunch of share the history of of major digestive issues\nWhen she was coming in and you know every time she ate she says within like\nTwenty minutes to a half an hour she's gassy she's bloated a she and she feels that way for hours this was this was beforehand\nAnd we you know she came in\nAnd did a concert weather obviously a we looked at a bunch of different things\nUh we did the hair saliva or with the energetic a buyer and drug testing well we took a look at some blood work that she brought in we were able to do a a ... a toxicity support a digester support or minerals and vitamins support and so boom twenty to twenty two pounds\nUm in in forty days which is fantastic\nA little bit below what we typically see but still you know like she said she looks like she's thirty pounds\nShe looks like she's thirty pounds a lighter she looks and feels that she's thirty pounds lighter and\nYou know she's going to go spend some money on somebody get get get help the economy a little bit of a shopping yeah shot shot in the arms of the economy a little bit get herself shopping at a bind some clothing and uh it's always good right she looks like she's thirty pounds a lighter she looks and feels like she's thirty pounds lighter and\nYou know she's going to go spend some money on some get get get help the economy a little bit inaccurate shopping yeah shot shot in the arms to the economy a little bit get herself shopping at a bind some clothing and uh it's always good right\nAll good I you know I think that there is nothing that feels or um that feels better than\nI'm buying yourself a pair of jeans at our size or two sizes smaller than you were only like hello twenty thirty forty days ago or so in my opinion it's like you know for a man who is tightening his belt thought All right and and you get to see that mark\nAnd that he's had there for like whatever eight years and now that markets you know now that belt is on a different a whole and I think that that's I think it's really special and I think um\n[noise] and I think what really matters is the fact that\nYou know every single day you're accountable to yourself now and you know what you're doing and you know and\nYou kinda feel comfortable in your own skin now you're no longer afraid of the snack attack you're no longer you know having these cravings and we had Stella call the office this week so she's been off the program for three years by the way\nI'm and she I think she lost about thirty seven pounds three years ago and she is sixty four now so she was sixty one I'm\nThree years ago obviously she called because she wanted to know\nAbout the DNA testing 'cause that was really interesting to her and also because she gets the complimentary hand saliva evaluation every three months she comes in and she does that and she gets the appropriate and apple of chicken ... I told her about that too but so one of the things that she said to me that really\nChanged her\nAfter the program was that she's no longer afraid to walk into a supermarket she's no longer afraid to go sit down at a restaurant because she knows exactly where she's at the track like she's completely control in control your ...\nAnd she said that this wasn't the situation three years ago she had completely lost control\nAnd that's a scary place to be at and I'm really proud of her that three years later on and she said to me\nShe goes you know it's a daily thing for me now she says I wake up in the morning and I think about\nWhat my days going to look like and then my second thought as what my days going to look like food wise and it's an interesting thing right we wake up in the morning we think about what we have to do during the day but why not think about what it is that we're going to eat during the day\nOr ... you know that's what fuels our body that's what determines how much energy we had that really\nDetermines how we're going to feel the next morning right here but a lot of people don't think of it that way but she says\nYou know it completely shifted her paradigm it seems like she's completely on a different wavelength in terms of what happens to her every single morning she has a routine\nYou know she knows what she's going to eat she knows what she's gonna do that day and that really helps her and three years later all the way to sell off and she's doing great\nYou know it's great it's great and then that's what you do you empower people yeah when you have control your empowered and you you can handle it and you know what to do and and so each person is given\nTen different ways to get the weight off her each person as the way it's set point reset each person or is given a DNA test that tells them all these different things for over forty different metabolic factors and so that's what it's all about without any shots and hormones in surgery we typically see twenty five\nTo thirty five pounds and women are we typically see thirty five to forty five\nPlus pounds with men and that's mostly fat that's without shots without hormones without\nSurgery or without hungrier eating natural food uh you're you're you're not hungry in the program because your body is burning so much toxic side for fuel\nThat were just basically rerouting what your body's using for fuel and then we were out it back in and so it's really monitor you every every day you have my personal cell phone number my email address so nobody's ever\nAlone a on this process\nAnd it's really easy to just go to n J diet ... gets started going to end J died dot com normally it's Ninety nine dollars but as a radio listener uh right now you go on line is twenty seven dollars for a full body composition analysis [noise]\nUh where we take over and take a look at a bunch of different things we do a full consultation body composition analysis we look at not only weight\nBut we're also looking at a visceral fat we're also looking at your basic metabolic rate and so we're also looking at daily caloric intake and so the difference in those two numbers is important because\nYou know if you if your if your body's functioning your basic metabolic rate let's say you're burning off Seventeen hundred calories a day but your body's function like you're taking in thirty five twenty five hundred calories a three thousand calories a day\nAnd you're wondering why you can't lose weight that might give you an answer yeah and so we take a look at metabolic Lehigh your body is working\nAnd so then we we then do heroin saliva leads into\nThe buyer and genetic testing uh when decided to go forward with the program we didn't take a look at blood work that people bring in\nTo see what supplementation to support them with and we look at it a functional level or we just tighten up those parameters a little bit so we don't you know if you keep the parameters within a functional level you have to worry less about being diagnosed with big without the ... by those problems getting worse\nAnd being ... God Forbid diagnosed with something so we want to keep it in a healthy range and keep your body balance and if we're able to do that then there's less chance you know upstream downstream if you're if\nUpstream you're able to keep the body balance then you have to worry about less disease downstream and so that's n J died dot com or for twenty seven dollars for a a a only twenty seven dollars for a full body composition analysis in a\nIn a consultation with us where we can get you started and gets you going on the way to help you if you want to call you can uh it the number is one eight five five five and Jay diet that's eight five five five six five thirty four thirty\nEight uh that's the scheduling appointments and one of our locations we've got prints than opening a that's open now ready to see patients so about Princeton queens\nOr Long Island Brooklyn a New York city close to New Jersey I think I missed something I don't remember but anywhere print since ready to go in and people have been real happy about that so uh that's great and so you can come in scheduled appointment or you make a phone call\nJust remember when you are calling that the folks on the phone are only there to schedule appointments or they're not there to put you on the weight loss program uh [laughter] they still get mad at the fabric great do whatever they they get mad at the people on the phone a lot of five I don't know why\nBut uh yeah so yeah they're just they're just because the appointment they don't have the answer is just come on and then we'll talk to an end will give you all the answers about the program and so forth [noise] um so bill came in this week\nAnd it's really you know it's amazing when you when you\nHave a lot of extra fat in general and a lot of visceral fat that's the fat on the organs\n... levels of visceral fat really cause inflammation in the body inflammation in the body will cause is one of the causes to all the different chronic\nNo systemic sort of aches and pains so it's not just one area that hurts systematic shoulders and elbows in choosing the joints and that's why\nAre people that are obese more more more of a ... susceptible to arthritis and things like that and just generalize information the body\nAnd so you know bill comes in and got all these different aches and pains or he is he's got high blood pressure\nOr he's one of these guys you know typical belly you know the body stores fat in different areas to protect their is because of different hormonal disruptions generally in those areas so if you get somebody with like that you know floppy overhanging belly fat you're looking at a dream knows if you're looking at that that apple shape you're looking at a thyroid if you're looking at\nHis hormones are off his body is off nothing's work in the right way and when he came in and he's you know I just got a friend to the program it's just I just got to get the same results I got to do something there's no way I can live like this [noise]\nUh and so they gave him you know did did all the personalization processes here game which Reno support we gave them reproductive a reconstructive Oregon support all natural type of supplementation\nA personalized for him and so boom forty eight pounds got 'em going fifty days libido is back no more crashing in the middle of the day is barely even thinks about coffee anymore just has like a little cup in the morning\nAnd and he's a rock and roll and and and so you know that's what it's all about so\nYou know thirty five to forty five plus is what we see with men typically only forty days twenty five to thirty five\nWith women typically a ...\nIn only forty days and it all natural there is no everything is either a avid base mineral base ... supplements that are personalized for each individual based on either by energetic testing or or blood work or DNA as well uh and so without any shots without hormones last surgery\nPeople aren't hungry on the program because their body would just turn their body into fat burning machine so we we're out what your body's using for fuel you're going to burn at least\nTwo thousand calories of your own fact for fuel you can't be hungry and and so ah it only forty days twenty five to forty five plus pounds across the board\nAnd so that's an J died dot com right now it's normally Ninety nine dollars as a radio list are only twenty seven dollars gets your body composition analysis\nBut an appointment with us uh where we take a look at not only your weight you could give us out on the phone I mean we look at your weight we look at body fat percentage we look at body water percentage we look at visceral fat rating I'm against folks if your if your your your body is water is low you're visceral fat as high\nYou know when you get high visceral fat that's the fat and the organs and makes you more insulin resistance when your body becomes more insulin resistant away your body metabolize has a sugar for fuel is instead of bringing into the cell and burning it your body is taking in turning into fat and storing it\nAnd that's going to make your metabolism work much slower on top of that if you've done a ton of weight yo yo dieting losing a ton of water too quickly\nOr like a lot of times with women that we see your water levels are going to be off if your water levels are often you got high visceral fat you're ... you're in you're forty years old you're metabolisms function like a seven year old you're not going to\nBe able to lose weight just no way to do it\nSo we're gonna have to take a look at all those things and and then and then personalized these the solutions that supplements are the the for each individual get your body and the fat burning that's one of the things that we look at it as mineral balance metabolic cage daily caloric intake\nOr and so it you know that's that's how we do it on the front end and then and then we personalize the ... everything for the for you for the for the forty days program as well and we're all excited about ... about prince and opening up lots of people have been coming up from South Jersey saying when he can open when you can open so we're finally opened up place down there were I\nSee patients there and it's really great so twenty five to forty five pounds is typically what we see a little bit more on the men's side sometimes and it's one in five five five and Jay diet and like when you're calling to make a phone call when you're calling please remember the people on the phones [noise]\nThey're just there to schedule the appointment they really don't have the answers to your questions most of them are just there to schedule the appointments so don't yell at them or you can go to and J died dot com the easiest way only twenty seven dollars just going to end J died dot com [noise]\nCome on and we'll get you going even if you're skeptical little worker won't even matter if you can be skeptical is or is that gravity even if you're skeptical of gravity would jump off the building you will hit the ground is the same thing with the program you're going to lose the weight you're gonna do it so\nHad and carried I don't know if you remember him he had a quadruple bypass eight years ago I remember everybody yeah I Know but I'm just saying you know just in case you don't want to remind yet so Jared and had a quadruple bypass eight years ago and\nNot the most ideal situation and really um\nInstead as I'm working him you know getting better and working at um you know exercising more and feeling life like someone up there I gave him a second chance on life he\nWent and it completely other way and started to eat really unhealthy he really felt it was so unfair that this happened to him and he had this quite triple bypass and all these other things and\nSo he kind of really started to um go downhill and um so he had a checkup with his cardiologist and he basically told him that um\nYou know a he's heading down a not such a good road and so\nYeah so he I guess decided his girlfriend and I think finally told him that you know you kind of either need to get with the program or sort of you know get out because you know she wasn't going to go through this again what happened eight years ago and and so he came in and\nYou know this was a guy who was getting every one of his meals\nAnd snacks um take out ... you know so he was basically running in wherever eating whatever I'm and I'm\nYou know he used to be a runner he used to be you know all these things he used to do a ton of sports so anyway lo and behold a forty days later\n[noise] he lost a forty nine pounds while and uh we are back to running we are back to having known any pain no ankle pain or we are no longer getting every meal out which is really really cool because he says he\nIs my favorite part he gets to spend more money and buying clothes and buying clothes first girlfriend and presents for her so

R. W. A. X. kill eight detail New York\nOr Boston New rated number one seven\nNot at the benefit of the patient and I think that each one of us as physicians has to be aware that we're physicians\nFor the patient burst and there's no way that he or the hospital and it says super famous hospital I wouldn't lives in all these hospitals there is no way they can justify doing what they did to this woman and so\nFor weeks she had the surgery she kind of less from surgery then she gets the CAT scan showing all these nodules growing and now he wants to send her for radio surgery when he told her radio surgery was baloney before so this to me is total bologna and why am I talking about it because I have several cases on the same genre and the ... surgeons\nOperating beyond their capability beyond the ability of surgeons in this day and age it's great for the surge and it's great for the hospital but it's terrible for\nThe patient and this is exactly why we brought stereo tactic\nBody radio surgery to America I can tell you that I'm the first doctor who brought story tactic body radio started to America and when I brought it doctors at this super duper\nFamous hospital and all the other hospitals every hospital thought there was no need for radio surgery and the wrong they were wrong then then they're wrong now just like the surgeon was wrong to encourage this woman falsely\nTo have surgery telling her that surgery it'd be most likely to benefit when it served no benefit to anyone except to him and that's where we'll be talking about what is radio surgery radio surgeries noninvasive pinpoint treatment that allows it\nTo treat cancers non invasive leave with high\nDegrees of success why is it so successful because we make a stereotype to frame of the patient we localize the cancer we find the body we find the frame and then with computerized guidance we sending thousands of beams of high dose treatment to attack\nThe cancer it's not traditional radiation it's not chemo and that's not surgery information to mail you if you wish and we encourage that caused during the week Monday through friday eight to eight or office numbers two one two choices and we

everything we do has a meaning our phone number as a meaning to one two choices because to into his New York city choices we believe that you have choices and this woman had choices\nSad to say she knew about radio surgery and she declined radio surgery so part of the onus is on her part of the onus is on the surgeon to over promised his surgery that he could not deliver and when he didn't deliver on one\nSide he then went on and read doubled his mistake on the other side\nGreat for him great for that hospital and sad for the patient a fifty year old woman with two little kids my name's

people say doctor Lederman why don't you present your we've been presenting our data for Thirty years\nAnd the surgeons who want to see her work they\nCan call me up they can go to the meetings they can learn so much I don't have to keep cutting and\nCutting and cutting cutting that it's good for them but not so great for the patients I told you at the beginning of the show on and talk about three special patient so they all saw in the last couple of days I saw these patients the last couple of days and they really had a impact on me in a very emotional way one thing about a man I saw he is a fifty year old man with the anal cancer\nFive years ago he went to again a super duper big place and the usual treatment for anal cancer would be a course of chemo radiation the success rate is very very high it's treatment that will save the Amos and save the quality of life nope he hit a surgeon\nAnd the surgeon wanted to cut on his ... and it was I guess at a fancy dancey place and so the patient doesn't know what to think he's thought why not such a fancy dancey place and the big surgeon wants to cut on my ... so I guess I should let them kinda maintenance and let them cut on his ...\nAnd well the surgery didn't work\nThat wasn't the usual treatment\nAnd then two years later the cancer came back came right back in the same place in the in the area then he had the usual treatment by then it was too late than the cancer traveled the patient is still at the super duper big place and for the last two years has been getting chemotherapy well what does it mean when you get chemo chemo\nChemo that many people on the radio falsely thing that I hate chemo I don't hate\nChemo I Love the things that work and let's say if you had an anal cancer and you came here to\nThird tentative for Broadway and you saw me I'd probably put together a program of pinpoint radiation in the course of some chemotherapy\nDesensitize the anal cancer to the radiation to give the highest chance to be cancer free\nTo make the anal cancer go away and to keep your brain is and I don't like talking about there ain't us but we need our heinous otherwise we can control or poop and then we need a bag on our side and the changes our quality of life a lot so there's lots of times it's good to talk about those body parts and that's why we're here today is to\nEducate well this man had say a deviation yet a hot shot surgeon he tried to cut his way through\nThe anal cancer he failed cancer came back then he had standard chemo radiation it was too late and now he's been on chemotherapy for two years has stage for cancer well what do I like about two years of chemotherapy well the problem is that after a while the cancer outsmart the\nChemo after a while the chemo doesn't work anymore I remember the typical chemo costs about ten thousand dollars a month this guy has gone through two years that's a quarter million dollars of chemotherapy now they also had more came over before\nSo let's say has gone through three hundred thousand three and fifty thousand dollars of chemo and he's worse off today than he was when he started the cancer is traveled and where is the cancer not oil came he's got a mass\nIn the in the pelvis the same place where the cancer started that surgery to them how the radiation and then how ... how two years of came other than how the cancer traveled to the ... which is the covering up the lung cancers grow and\nBecame most not working and the cancers traveled to the super Quebec lymph node deliver meals by the ... this guy's going to the super duper big hospital for five years and the first time he heard where his cancer is when they came to Thirteen eighty four Broadway he was shocked\nTo hear what the cancer as his doctors have been telling them to ... work and they came up as okay everything's okay just keep on taking the chemo that's always been told for two years\nAnd the cancers growing he hasn't been told the truth for two years at least when I trust the patient I trust his wife why would they go through two years of chemo if they knew it wasn't working no logical person go through two years of poison and their body it wasn't working costing a quarter million dollars would you and finally he came to\nThirty for Broadway what were you able to go through his records and examine the patient and tell them and show him and show his wife exactly what he had and that more and more chemo is not going to help him and they were sitting sitting there in\nFront of me they'd started more chemo became most not working and they're asking me doctor should I take this came or not and they said Mr that came out not working would you take poison and your body if it wasn't working and costing you ten thousand dollars a month is that some logical to you\nAnd he said no and his wife said no and his wife was pairing him he says is beautiful blonde woman she was tearing me doctor tell me more tell me more about my husband thinks that I didn't know for the last five years and then they said well the doctors over there\nWant to give a new chemo and I said well didn't they tell you that are going to give you a new came all that it's better than the world's best came out so fantastic and they said yeah you know months ago they told me they're going to give me the world's best came up and I said that didn't work I mean what are you going to stop believing that when are you going to believe in the facts and not these false promises\nAnd there's another case deviation of care surgeries doesn't work on the ... has\nGot to the chemo radiation to light your now chemotherapy for stage for anal cancer it's not working again that's great for the pharmaceutical industry ten thousand dollars a month it's great for\nThe doctor it's great for the hospital it's great for everybody except for this fifty year old man who has a matter of static anal cancer and dying and thinking that the chemo was working\nWhen it's not working at all and he came in he asked us after explaining all the options and we're not afraid about talking of chemo or\nSurgery or radiation or radio surgery but it seems like the other guys are afraid the other guys in other hospitals or surgeons and the chemo doctors are afraid\nTo talk honestly about all the options I Believe it was a doctor were morally obliged to

religious man he has three children and they came to me last winter with\nTerrible neck pain he had cancer of the lung traveled to the next ... neck and the pain went away the cancer when the way we treated his long he never smoked but he had a lung cancer and he was around a lot of smokers is a religious\nMan and he works as a jugglers they worked with a lot of places where there were smokers and a sad to say he got this uh lung cancer well about three months ago he decided that he's\nGoing to have him you know therapy heard so much about him into therapy and he went to other doctors before he came to me and they kept on calling him say hey Mr Smith you got to get him in the therapy so hot everyone work so well it's so fantastic so three months ago he went to one of the super super hospitals in New York City and so one of the super duper doctors\nAnd he started on three months of him into therapy and I hadn't heard from him at all and then friday morning he wheeled in a wheelchair with his son was the first time I've seen them in three months when he left he was juggling he came to our offices juggling three months ago he was walking he was fully\nFunctional and now he can't walk anymore we immediately got a PET scan that that other hospital he was getting sicker and weaker they didn't do any testing they kept on giving them more immunotherapy is one of those things ten thousand dollars twenty thousand dollars a month they kept on giving him him into therapy\nEven though he stopped walking he lost weight was in terrible pain we immediately on the same\nDay came in in a wheelchair we've got a PET scan of his whole body I saw him back to the same day his whole hip had melted\nAway from cancer that was growing while he was on the super duper immunotherapy that doesn't work at all he wasn't tolerating it the cancer was growing like not to was in terrible pain and the bones were melting away because cancer was eating through the bones luckily he came through us and we're starting treatment immediately to try to reverse\nThe the lack of affects of immunotherapy and how many people think him into therapy as the cat's pajamas it ain't the results are pretty lousy really if you look at the overall success rate the cost or a man's and there's many side effects which are under reported no talking about a gentleman and the good news department in Seventy two years old he has three\nChildren his wife recently died his PSA while his wife was dying went from four\nTo five and a half he had a biopsy and the biopsy show the Gleason eight cancer a very aggressive cancer remember Gleason tried to tell us how aggressive cancers should be made a scale of two to ten so he has one of the most aggressive cancers under the microscope\nYou know work up with them arise and bone scans there was no spread of the cancer he chose to have our treatment because he saw that with surgery robotic surgery or open surgery\nThe success rate is about twenty percent with us it's dramatically better he came to have our treatment because he wanted to avoid robotic surgery wanted to avoid robotic surgery open surgery he wanted to avoid\nThe complications of opening a robotic surgery you wanted to avoid\nThe importance of opening a robotic surgery wanted to avoid the urinary leakage of open and robotic surgery you want to avoid radical surgery and that's why he came to us and why am I talking about him today because he's in remission with us he is in remission he avoided unnecessary surgery is sex life is\nWorking his urinary life is working and his PSA is now in this zero range even though he had a Gleason a cancer one of the most aggressive cancers that exists\nFor prostate cancer in many men come to us with prostate cancer we've created

with two children she had a lump in the breast she went to one of the big hospitals she had\nTwo surgeries they told her well they think is DC ISD says means ductal carcinoma in sight to it means it's a breast cancer that starting it's in the docks present growing through the ducks into the breast well they did two surgeries and then she saw the radiation doctors and the radiation doctors told her well she better have radiation\nFor this because otherwise you may be sorry and then she saw the chemo guys and the chemo guys told her well she better have systemic\nTherapy for five years or she might be sorry\nAnd to me I smelled something that wasn't exactly a kosher shall we say something stunk and Finland and what stunk is that the pathology wasn't clear cut\nAnd none of these doctors called the pathologist none of these doctors asked for an outside review they just wanted to treat the patient them treating the patient might be great for them and great for their facility and great for the hospital and great for the drug companies probably grade\nFor everyone except for the Seventy six year old widow and so I called the pathologist and I said I don't I'm not sure about this\nPathology it sounds to me like a that we don't have confidence in the diagnosis and she said well I don't know everyone says it's the CIA us and they said well I Want an outside review and she said well how about I send the down the street I said well how about you send it out of the state\nTo a documented certified plays that\nCan read it independently and the pathology was reviewed independently\nAnd we just got the anthology back for the Seventy six year old woman born in Germany and what does it show\nNo cancer so had she stopped and God the treatment of the other place she would have had unnecessary radiation she went to the other place she would have had unnecessary five\nYears of hormone therapy for what for a diagnosis that they never took time to document and that's the difference of the work that we do at thirty for Broadway radio surgeon you are where we work for each patient way of a real doctor student\nWe truly tried to give each patient options and tell\nThem what's going on in their body in that way for example this woman avoided unnecessary radiation she avoided five\nYears of systemic treatment and she wanted the trauma of being told she had cancer when she has no cancer and I can tell you that it's a great moment of my life to tell someone ma'am I Know you thought you had cancer and the doctors told you had cancer but you don't have cancer\nSo it's a sweet moment of the day ...

do radio surgery what would make them older on the body computerize the body we find the cancer and then we send in thousands of beams to attack\nThe cancer so it's a precise for the cancer it's much more intense than standard treatment but it avoids in general the\nHarm to the healthy dishes and then she had those five treatments ten minutes each she came for follow up she has a new PET scan and she is happy to be in remission and she was here with her daughter and I was happy to give the news I gave a copy of the images and reports\nAnd that's the work that we do from patients for many

I don't even know where to start\nHigh it's great to be here again Hi Laura said to be back I'm very curious as to how\nThey can actually be a product on the market that's nothing but\nFruits and vegetables with absolutely nothing else in it how in the world can this be life changing and where did you get the idea for it and how did you know which fruits and vegetables to actually select for the product balance of nature\nWell started out I studied in Russia for several years and while I was there I started seeing the need for nutrition more and more and when I returned back to my practice in the United states\nThen I started seeing how lousy our diets really were when I started really realizing how important that balance of chemistry is how much a to see the deed e and back then I still believe that the was vitamins not hormone anyways and\nAnd I started seeing that the necessity of balance of chemistry and so I started searching which one was the best which vitamin was the best in balance and at the same time then the the notion started coming of um\nYou know we're we're discovering more and more chemistry and fruits and vegetables raspberry tall a course of two and a six and then all these different chemicals that we're finding had positive effects\nBut they were from different fruits and vegetables and so then I was on that path and I was looking for which of these vitamins [noise] is going to be the magical vitamin there was a day that\nThat I was like well I'm searching for the perfect balance of all of this chemistry and at the same time there's all this chemistry we haven't even discovered yet that's when I started learning that there's hundreds of thousands of chemicals just in an apple alone\nAnd hundreds of thousands in an orange and and all of them and then I went well wait\nI may be dead when we find this magic chemical I'm looking for because out of all of this how am I going to find the needle in the haystack and on top of that\nI already know where the perfect balance of all of these vitamins is it's in our fruits and vegetables it was already made for us for our bodies and so that's when I went okay I've got to get back to that I just have to get my patients to be able to consume that\nAnd as I did that first I started trying to have them have better diets well that was like leaving a horse to water and trying to get him to drink to didn't want to drink\nAnd then and then I started having some people juice 'cause I thought okay well I can get them to juice and get a concentrated amount well later I realized that's an extract because for example I got people to juice but they were using mostly carrot and apple let's say maybe cared apple and celery but I've had patients starting to come in with care named mia which means\nThey were turning orange because they just were consuming so much you know and a carrot juice well that wasn't healthy that we're not supposed to be orange then I started trying to figure out how to get this and then I started realizing the number one component of all of these fruits and vegetables as water\nIf I can just remove the water without damaging all of the other chemistry\nThan I can packet more dense I never imagined I could get it as dense as we have it I never imagined that I Would be able to get it down to three fruit capitalism three vegetable capitalism and have the same nutrient value is eating over ten servings of fruits and vegetables every day\nYou know what I find so interesting is what you're talking about is\nWhen I Try to eat healthy and get the fruits and vegetables that I mean it's really a process\nI have to go to the supermarket it's very very expensive where I live you have to spend a lot of time chopping\nAnd in order to keep the nutrition and you basically kind of have to eat it raw it's really hard to get ten or eleven servings a day that you're recommending Dr Howard and sell for me balance of nature is just an easier way\nTo do this and actually more economical\nYeah it it cuts out all the shopping cleaning chopping and chilling he just swallow it I mean it's it's really there isn't there isn't a chilling involved in that much fruits and vegetables absolutely so\nNow I'm not going to tell you don't need the fruits and vegetables anymore you do that but the beauty of this also is is once you start taking balance of nature it's interesting your appetite generally starts to increase towards fruits and vegetables and many people report decreases toward sweets\nOh that's a wonderful thing yeah wouldn't it be great if we could all substitute that Dr Howard when somebody does take these at ten servings a day with balance of nature what is it that they can expect to fail I mean how is it that something so small like that could actually maybe prevent some of the\nDiseases that you were talking about and some of your literature\nWell it's interesting will have anywhere from somebody saying from minutes after I took my first dose or just like somebody flipped the light switch on and I just feel it all the way to nothing I mean\nIt doesn't necessarily mean you're going to feel something in your in your body by the time you feel something or by the time you feel a symptom you've lost over sixty percent of the function of the cell to shore Oregon and that's important to note\nSo what I really developed this was not to feel anything but what's to prevent\nAging diseases was my original purpose to prevent the risk of of cataracts and strokes and heart heart attack and heart disease and cancer\nMacular degeneration and aging diseases is what we really that was the focus of what I was doing it's not a cure anything I guess that's what I'm trying to say that purpose wasn't to cure anything it's to give the body the chemistry and the nutrition that needs to do what it needs\nYour body is far more intelligent and knows what it needs to do more than I can can force it to do something\nFor those that are just tuning in I'm Talking with Dr Douglas Howard the formulate or of balances nature's fruits and veggies and fiber in space\nAnd I'm just amazed at what it is doing not
