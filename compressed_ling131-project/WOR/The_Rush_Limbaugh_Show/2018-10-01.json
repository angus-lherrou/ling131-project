at a Safeway where\nHe is Rachel Mitchell found this highly suspicious and like much else that she said impossible to prove\n\nHer report I mean I printed it out it's like six pages here I I it it is devastating be inconsistencies in her stories the variables in her story\nThe fact that none of the stuff that matters can be proven the fact that the people she set in the room the number kept changing from the original letter to subsequent interviews and then to the\nTestimony she had the idea\nThat she was afraid to fly and yet here she is make hay shooting all over the world how did she get there the idea that she refused to talk to the committee even in California we learn that she didn't even know the committee had offered to fly out there because of the lawyers didn't tell her\nBy the way a couple of Republicans not demanding an investigation Tom Cotton says we're going to investigate Feinstein we're going to investigate this leak and we're going to investigate these lawyers who may not have told her to come and he was willing to go out there because they believe that she was afraid to fly none of this was true\n\nSo I ... the idea that she's ... she's the last\n\n... she's not the least credible witness in all of this and yet there she is automatically\n\nSaid to be credible every leftist supposedly reviewing her performance I found or her credible\nBased on what she was in such pain she was so so still shaken by what happened all\nThose years ago you because it yeah because she really knew how to make it look like that I don't think for me I don't think any of this has been genuine I think it's all orchestrated I think a lot of its focus group that I think it's scripted\n\nAnd I just I because none of this past is any kind of a smell test anyway back to mark pencil very quickly\nAmericans believe her and both believe Kavanaugh if the FBI finds no corroboration of the charges sixty percent believe Kevin all should be confirmed\nAccording to a weekend harbored Harris Poll of the thousand three hundred and thirty registered voters sixty six percent of Americans support the decision to have the FBI investigate that includes eighty percent Democrats sixty nine percent independents with only forty five percent of\nRepublicans who are the smart ones\nHuge numbers in the weekend poll reported seeing parts of it or reading about it forty percent thought she alone was credible\nTwenty three percent thought\nKavanaugh was twenty seven percent said both ... if you combine all that the poll findings indicates sixty seven percent found her credible and fifty percent found him to be\n\nBut the credibility of their testimony does it appear to be the decisive factor instead the question comes down to collaboration is the standard for tipping public opinion on whether Kavanaugh should have some of the high court in terms of the overall needle after the testimony was heard\nThirty seven percent say confirmed the nomination forty four percent say rejected Eighteen percent remain undecided Democrats going one way Republicans\nThe other but but but but but the hang on no get depressed once the voters are told that\nThe named witnesses deny any knowledge of the allegation it\nShips from forty four percent of fifty seven percent in favor of confirmation meaning meaning the people in this poll do not know did not know many of them did not know that the people she places in the room have denied being there\nAnd when the pollsters told them that in fact the numbers of people who thought he should be confirmed jump from forty to fifty seven\nPercent and then up to sixty percent\nIn a hypothetical question if the FBI after a week agrees there is no cooperation for her story and they've already done that but now we've got a call me entering the picture\nNow we've got to call me urging the FBI to keep digging the same FBI that's been running a silent coups FBI leaders trying to get rid of Trump\n\nI Want to grab a phone call because this guy has a great point and I want to add something to it this was a ... Jason Muskegon, Michigan Jason thank you so much for waiting I appreciate it how're you doing\nAnything no problem and thanks for letting me be part of the excellent [noise]\nWell I appreciate that you are you are here as part of the excellence by association\n[laughter] yeah I was thinking on that uh there is no better way to um motivate a group by attacking them in by attacking Kevin uh they're basically essentially attacking the entire Republican base\nWe showed up and sixteen and voted Trump and I'm part of that reason was for the Supreme Court nomination and here we are Democrats are going to make the midterms about a Supreme Court vacancy and they think that they can last year twenty twenty so they're not really pressing issue as hard as what Republicans could\nAnd knowing that if we want to get our guy in there you know we're going to have to show up in midterms are going to they're going to have an adverse effect that they keep doing this\n[noise] I've heard people say this I uh uh he he he Jason here thinks that all of this is going to backfire on the Democrats and motivate Republicans to show up and vote not just now two thousand eight seeing but again for Trump and twenty twenty\nOr let's go to the audio soundbites on this case and thank you much we're going to start here this is a boxing friends weekend\nOn Saturday morning Rachel Campos Duffy was one of the hosts is talking to CBS em political corresponded David Brody about all this\nAnd she says all we know the Democrats all ready men really energized about them in terms I don't know how much more energized they could get\nBut I'm sensing that Republicans have become very energized this week this hearing has really fired and the Republicans\nUp from my reporting and found that the horrible evangelical base I can tell you they say the Democrats dirty tricks have riled them up like never before and I know Rush Limbaugh has talked about how if Kavanaugh is not confirmed it's going to be real tough for the Republicans actually of capital is not confirmed\nThat would even rile up at the coral evangelical base in the jail the base I Believe even more at least the people that I'm hearing from and so\nI think that that's a big part of what's going on here\nNow like you you can't blame\nDavid Broder you for being fifty percent of informed because\nI I pulled back that original production after it had gone viral all over the drive by media that's why it's still prominent in people's minds and my retraction of that production has barely received a whimper\nIt was it doesn't serve the drive by is any good when the dry buys here me you're predicting Republican doom they can't help themselves they got to put her all over the world in the media Rush Limbaugh says Republicans are going to lose ... capital not confirmed that prediction was based\nAt a specific point in time on if the Republicans caved\nIf Republicans didn't fight for Kavanaugh if Republicans just when bird out I predicted that what happened but once this began to unfold\nI retracted that production and said it could end up being the opposite here\nBut of course that prediction didn't go viral and I want to Jason in Muskegon I Want to thank you for bringing it up so that I could make the case here is one more\nA bite on this is a CSPAN Washington Journal Saturday morning yes Holland is talking to a correspondent at the Weekly Standard and grew Edgar about me\nThere's been several conservatives including Rush Limbaugh who warned that Republicans could lose their majority if they don't get half a mile prefer him to the Supreme Court is that something that Republicans in Congress are really thinking about mid term consequences\nArguments like the one that Limbaugh makes our little convenient on whether or not Kavanaugh gets through I think the whole situation is really fired up Republican voters\nTrump says his new trade deal with Mexico and Canada is based on the principles of fairness of

brand new trade deal\nThe drive by as were under orders not to ask questions about Kavanaugh which meant they ask questions about capital and Trump after making sure enough time was spent on NAFTA started entertaining the are the questions and what we had one true good four of\nThem here and here is a Trump ... this is this is not actually in response to a question he's just riffing here during the\nCeremony talking about the uh mid term election fake news Kevin ... things\nWe have Senate races that weren't even in play six months ago as you know there are a lot of repression poles or polls that are on very accurate [noise] we had areas and we had congressional seats to\nWhere I Know it's got to be a positive outcome\nBut you look at what's going on and it doesn't seem to be broadcast that way but I certainly had that with my election [noise]\nThey were telling me I was you know in trouble in certain states at the end up winning like in a landslide and I knew I was gonna win them in a landslide but they wouldn't reported that way you know why fake news\nNow during the Q and a a Cecilia vague go\nABC News the White House correspondent said in a tweet this weekend you said it's incorrect to say that you're limiting the scope of the FBI investigation into Kevin what your own statement on friday made it very clear you said this investigation must be limited in scope so which is that\nThis is our seventh investigation\nOf a man who has really you know you look at his life until this happened what a change she's gone through what his family's gone through the trauma\nFor a man that's never had any accusation any statement about him he's led I think he was number one in this class and yeah he was number one in his law school and yeah and then what he's gone through over the last three weeks his incredible [noise] so\nI Want the FBI this is now their seventh investigation so it's not like you know just starting I Want them to do a very comprehensive investigation\nLet me explain that answer it let me ... let me at least sound bites them got to be yeah number thirty coming okay [noise] [noise] ... this\nWhole FBI investigation started everybody knows we we heard flake\nDemand a week for his vote one week\nSo that's how the committee vote in Lebanon to pen and paper Kavanaugh with the provides though that flight was not going to vote well I'm a former vote for final confirmation silly FBI had spent at least another week long handled this\nSo that NBC runs a story out of nowhere fake news claiming that the White House intends to limit the scope of the FBI was a set up it was a it was a trap\nThey lay in a trap NBC News which is complicit with the Democratic party in most things later trap accusing Trump and the White House of trying to limit the FBI scope because you see there are things to find the Trump wants to cover it up Donald Trump who's had so much control over the FBI the last three years\nSame FBI and it's been doing his level best to get Donald Trump thrown out of office somehow Donald Trump has been able to walk in there and tell those guys to limit the scope of their investigation\nSo Trump person I'm not limiting the scope of anything I've told the FBI the look at whatever they need to look at\nOkay thank you Mr solve it needs to go to waste they're going to go to waste\nSo the White House is not claim there aren't any limit to see how this works\nIt was a trap it was a set up and Trump tweeted out\nHe's not limiting the scope NBC is why course they're lying it was a set up\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nAnd so now it's out there that we may not be enough now Fox News is reporting along with Fox Business news\nAt the FBI is saying they might have this wrapped up tomorrow but then the question becomes what to do with that if they asked me I just finished talking to everybody I talked to\nThat one of the Republicans do with that that they hold on to it till friday and art art art or do they move\nOn it will just tell you if this ends tomorrow this is all accurate\nAnd the Democrats here but the Democrats are going to be fit to be tied to the thing didn't go on friday and they're going to demand they're going to start saying that this thing is rigged they knew what was going to be rigged and they're going to demand even more time\nTo fix the fact that it was Richard they're going to do that anyway they're not going to let this thing and on friday\nIf we let them have their way this investigation isn't going to end on friday it won't be long enough besides Trump said\nHe's not going to limit on the FBI so why are they stopping now it isn't possible they could have found everything there is to find on those labels to which the response as well they found nothing in a hundred thousand or more Hillary

[noise] bumper rotation here at the ... by being up market so I just saw that just took a look at the Drudge Report during the break at\nWhat am I see what is the lead a headline on the Drudge Report let me read it to your White House expands FBI problem is that what the hell is that so I clicked on the lake here's what it is [noise]\nRight here my formerly nicotine saying the fingers in New York Times working in tandem with NBC News headline of White House tells FBI to interview any one necessary for Kevin inquiry this is because of what they claimed Trump said\nAt his press conference today where he's now I don't want to limit anything I said guys I missed\nThat they run a fake news story NBC does claiming Trump is limiting the investigation central I'm not that's fake nose so then they've got it on record Trump not limiting investigate which means you can go on and on and on and on and now they're broadcasting and everywhere White House tells FBI interview when he wasn't necessary\nAnd rice on schedule CNN reports\nThat the Democrats have submitted a list of twenty four people\nThey want the FBI to talk to this after Fox News had an earlier today that the FBI is about to wrap up tomorrow\n[noise] this is going to have to be shut down at some point this cannot go on all this\nIs is delayed delayed delayed the way and I'm going to tell you what needs to happen\nThere is an assumption operating out there that needs to be shut down and that assumption is that the investigation that has taken place since Kavanaugh was named is somehow insufficient\nAs somehow incomplete somebody needs to stand up and say it's the exact opposite that this is the seven now Trump has but somebody besides the needs to make the point\nThat this has been a thorough investigation that every last minute Jack in the box that's popped up here has been looked into and the effort has been made but there's only so much you can do with a woman who doesn't remember where or\nWhen whatever happened to her happen and there's only so much you can do when the people in the room she sounds were their claim they weren't\nThis investigation somebody needs to stand up and vouch for it somebody needs to stand up and promoted\nIt needs to be spoken for\nThis has got to be stopped because the it's not real the Democrats are allowed to make it up as they go submit names they want the FBI to talk to\nThey dug it investigations don't work that way FBI follows evidence leads and when they don't find anything on like Bob Mueller face stop\nMueller's been looking for collusion with Trump and Russia for two years and has been found anybody is still going and that's exactly what this is going to be if somebody doesn't stand up and stop this somebody on the Senate\nJudiciary Committee needs to stand up or Mitch McConnell needs to stand up and start voucher thing for the investigation is taking place there are six separate FBI background checks of Brett Kavanaugh somebody needs to speak up for him\nSomebody needs to vouch for um somebody needs to stand up and say they have been thorough and they haven't found anything or he wouldn't be where he is now sitting on the DC circuit court of appeals\nBut that's not happening somehow were letting the media get away with the idea that the investigation here in the Kavanaugh has been half baked lukewarm and incompetent\nBecause of Christine Blasey Ford coming around at the last minute with no evidence no cooperation and nothing yet she's credible Kevin O's not somebody look\nWe had a caller earlier how do you stop a bully you smack them in the face somebody needs to stand up until the Democrats the shut the hell up that they've gotten everything they've asked for this thing and there just isn't anything there and to go home\nThe idea of this investigation is not thorough is incompetent is incomplete or has been rendered is absolutely bogus another making things up the Trump is going to limit it did no such thing but he sure fell for a debate\nI Am not limited to thing it's totally FBI to take us wherever it takes them promptly Democrats while you're Twenty one people we want you to talk to\n[noise]\nIf you called the FBI you say there's there's some people in my town here are really really screw on the porch and I need to get something done about an IRS in when you go talk to them but it doesn't work that way does it\n\nPut rushed put rush this was the United States Senate clearly that can happen to know is that\n[laughter] and one of her thing you know one of the one of the movies I have recommended over the years people rent they haven't seen a go go watch what's called the lives of others and it's a movie about East Germany during the Cold War essentially\nHow the
