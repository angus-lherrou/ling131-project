is going to happen anytime soon the leftist saying yeah conversation started as all it is Trump doesn't really mean it is trying to rile up\nThe base that's where you're wrong Trump does made it\nIt is about time this was changed we have a crisis brewing\nWe have a crisis growing in terms of what kind of country we're going to be what kind of culture is going to dominate in this country and we are under assault by people who don't like the United states of America the way it was founded there's no complicated mistreated this is just what it is that's who the opponents are\nVery hell bent\nAnd they're not going to stop until they until they went another Mahler investigate looking at all of us in the lower investigation trying to come back to life remember had told yesterday how many leftist were convinced that Mahler by now was going to have issued a report proving trumping colluded with Russia\nYou know how many people on the left believed that and how many have been thinking all this time that Muller was timing this release for right before the election was going to happen and if it didn't happen that it would be a leak or did they will be some kind of education and yet ... zero not at the latest from Muller is it somebody is running a scam on him a sex scandal of some time\nThat they so boring to me I haven't even delved into the details but Muller is saying that people are trying to run a sex scam on him up some kind or tried to or what have you all all I Know is that that's the last thing that the left was counting on Robert Mueller having to say\nIn the days and weeks leading up the election was a big deal psychologically I'm telling you these people really thought you you wouldn't be amazed at how many people\nThat drive by media the American leftist propagandize significant portion this population they have believed from the first day that\nTrump first day they herded the Trump stole the election they have believed Mahler has found they believe Mahler was going to find it and didn't find it in his holding it and it's going to release the most opportune time despite the fact that in any evidence more there never has been any evidence for because they're going to happen\nIt did happen in between Hillary the Democrats but it didn't happen with Trump there is it a shred there will not be a shred of evidence and yet they're still holding out hope\nMuller\nAnd he was people trying to remain relevant\nRising from the dead looking like Trump may answer some questions after the election remember the news stories about that\nHow many months maybe over a year now have there been stories about Trump will or won't submit the questioning by Mahler lawyers thinking should lawyers making sure the Trump wants to set the story is but his lawyers say no way\nMeanwhile the conversations never happen from never met with mother never answered written questions they weren't submitted a total non story that both sides were participating in\nThe news now is the Trump might speak with Mahler after the election might answer some questions after the election\nThe takeaway is that the primary weapon the Democrats thought they had to get rid of Trump end when the house and Senate has fizzled\nIt's not there so they're turning they always do to other things\nWe also have the usual parade of celebrities\n\nBrain dead idiots celebrities vomiting their opinions throwing away their money we have\nProven that we really are not motivated to do anything celebrities advise\nIt has been a long established the celebrities do not move public opinion when nobody is worried about celebrities think or do in that sense because they don't and yet they persist\nWe now have the Oprah were told they offer is going to go into Georgia and campaign for the Democrat governor for Georgia Stacey what his name Abrams what is the last time the Oprah was a factor in an election can anybody tell me\n\nDo you think Obama's first victory was was was it was time to to to the Oprah\n\nYou think she was helpful why I Will admit that she didn't hurt me you think if Oprah hadn't been out there doing what the offer was doing it Obama would not\nHave won okay Obama what is still wanted despite what the offer was headed Barbra Streisand Barbra Streisand's out so she's trying to gin up anti Republican vote by promising people to move to Canada\nIf the Republicans hold the house he anybody cares about that other than the people say go get move it's going to motivate me to vote Republican\nBut how many people on the Democrat oh my God we can't lose bathrooms oh no we can't ... remember to Canada we got to vote ... how many people think\nThat that's going to be the way people take their vote and yet it makes the news\nYou have all kinds of people who want to impress you and how smart they are and how analytical they are but it's like anything else in the future nobody knows and that's because there are so many races according to the polling data can break either way\nThere are so many that are so close but then when you say that okay do we trust the polling day though the polling data versus two thousand sixteen not all that ... nobody knows bottom line\n\nNate Silver or given exam Nate Silver is considered a good word you know why\nI think it was was it two thousand and fourteen two thousand twelve was one of those\nTwo elections

there will not be a shred of evidence and yet they're still holding out hope Mueller and his people trying to remain relevant\nRising from the dead looking like Trump may answer some questions after the election remember the news stories about that\nHow many months maybe over a year now have there been stories about Trump will or won't submit their questioning by Mahler lawyers thinking should lawyers making sure that Trump wants to send the stories when his lawyers say no way\nMeanwhile the conversations never happen Trump never met with mother never answered written questions they weren't submitted a total non story that both sides were participating in\nThe news now is the Trump might speak with Mahler after the election might answer some questions after the election\nThe takeaway is that the primary weapon to Democrats thought they had to get rid of Trump end when the house and Senate has fizzled it's not there so they're turning\nThey always do to other things\nWe also have the usual parade um celebrities\nBrain dead idiots celebrities vomiting their opinions throwing away their money we have\nProven that we really are not motivated to do anything celebrities advise\nIt has been a long established the celebrities do not move public opinion when nobody is worried about celebrities think or do in that sense because they don't and yet they persist\nWe now have the Oprah we're told the old for is going to go into Georgia and campaign for the Democratic governor for Georgia Stacey what his name Abrams what is the last time the Oprah was a factor in an election can anybody tell me\nDo you think Obama's first victory was was was it was time to to to the Oprah\n\nYou think she was helpful I Will admit that she didn't hurt me you think if Oprah hadn't been out there doing what the offer was doing it Obama would not have won okay Obama what is still won despite what the offer was hounded Barbra Streisand Barbra Streisand's out so she's trying to gin up\nAnti Republican vote by promising people to move to Canada if the Republicans hold the house\nHe anybody cares about that other than the people say go get move it's going to motivate me to vote Republican\nAnd how many people on the Democrat oh my God we can't lose bad oh no we can't have or move to Canada we got to vote dumber and how many people think\nThat that's going to be the way people take their vote and yet it makes the news\nHoly day though the polling data versus two thousand sixteen not all that ... nobody knows a lot of blood\nNate Silver or given exam Nate Silver is considered a good world do you know why so I think it was was it two thousand fourteen two thousand twelve\nWas one of those two elections were Nate Silver lucked into calling every state on the money\nAnd that seat won the election I go in the past whenever it was gave him this reputation that he's in the tunnel since that won election where he was an infallible he hasn't come close\nDoesn't matter because he came closer was dead on the money when Democrats were victorious he's become a guru he's become a shrink he's become a psychiatrist or psychologist Democrats tuned to Nate Silver distaste than when the information they're hearing doesn't go the way they want it to go\nHeard pat ... can I say this silver guy nice guy but he's never run a campaign he's never taken a single poll only does this analyze them\nHe's never participated in a poll either the polling company he's never run a campaign and it's a ... point was you need to temper all these so called experts what's some reality to guy hits it on one election that happened to be exactly what the Democrats wanted to hear turned out to be\nTrue and so it becomes a girl wrote and the media continues to cite this like Nate Silver is out there saying eighty six percent now chances Democrats when the house nobody knows\nSo you can't you can't succumb to the temptation here to go blob vi\nAnd become flat line and it's hard I I look I Will admit it's hard as I say the human emotional reservoir can only hold so much and at some point it's going to get depleted and maintaining fever\nPitch energy becomes a challenging thing to do precisely when the news every day is Ninety eight percent slanted Ninety two percent slanted against you and what you believe in and what you want to happen\n\nThe Trump print to end the or the birthright citizenship today the Dems are still mad about it\nAll kinds of experts being trotted out it's unconstitutional no it's totally constitution no it isn't it got Republican leaders that we don't want to go down this road is a silly we're all in favor of his many people getting in the country's again Democrats saying the same thing but it's out there it's a conversation starter\nNothing is going to happen anytime soon the leftist saying yeah conversation started as all it is Trump doesn't really mean it is trying to rile up the base that's where you're\nWrong Trump does made it it is about time this was changed we have a crisis brewing\nWe have a crisis growing in terms of what kind of country we're going to be what kind of culture is going to dominate in this country and we are under assault by people who don't like the United states of America the way it was founded there's no complicated mistreated this is just what it is that's who the opponents are\nVery hell bent\nAnd they're not going to stop until they until they went another Mahler investigate looking at all of us in the lower investigation trying to come back to life [laughter] remember had told yesterday how many leftist were convinced that Mahler by now was going to have issued a report proving trumping colluded with Russia\nYou know how many people on the left believed that\nAnd how many have been thinking all this time that Muller was timing this release for right before the election was going to happen and if it didn't happen that it would be a leak or did they will be some kind of education and yet ... zero not at the latest from Muller is it somebody is running a scam on him a sex scandal of some time\nThat they so boring to me I haven't even delved into the details but Muller is saying that people are trying to run a sex scam on him up some kind or tried to or what have you\nAll all I Know is that that's the last thing that the left was counting on Robert Mueller having to say\nIn the days and weeks leading up the election was a big deal psychologically I'm telling you these people really thought you you wouldn't be amazed at how many people\nThat drive\nBy media the American leftist propagandize significant portion this population they have believed from the first day that Trump first day they herded the Trump stole the election\nThey have believed Mahler has found they believe Mahler was going to find it and didn't find it in his holding it and it's going to release it to the most opportune time despite the fact that in any evidence more there never has been any evidence for because it didn't happen\nIt did happen to between Hillary the Democrats but it didn't happen with Trump there isn't a shred there will not be a shred of evidence and yet\nThey're still holding out hope Muller and he was people trying to remain relevant rising from a dead looking like Trump may answer some questions after the election remember the news stories about that how many months maybe over a year now\nHave there been stories about Trump will or won't submit the questioning by Mahler lawyers thinking should lawyers making sure that Trump wants to set the story is but his lawyers say no way\nMeanwhile the conversations never happen from never met with mother never answered written questions they weren't submitted a total non story that both sides are participating in\nThe news now is the Trump might speak with Mahler after the election might answer some questions after the election\nThe takeaway is that the primary weapon the Democrats thought they had to get rid of Trump and when the house and Senate has fizzled it's not there so they're turning they always do\nTo other things we also have the usual parade of

by promising people to move to Canada if the Republicans hold the house\nHe anybody cares about that other than the people say go ahead move it's going to motivate me to vote Republican\nBut how many people on the Democrat oh my God we can't lose bathrooms oh no we can't ... remember to Canada we got to vote dumber and how many people\nThink that that's going to be the way people take their vote and yet it makes the news\nLiberalism today\nThat white men are the problem from the establishment of the American government is a capitalistic economy uh to the United states in general just setting themselves up as the majority and they now recap bank and they get unfair benefits and so forth and so on and so this\nThis is the culture wars that we are in and this\nIs the side opposes us\nThat's

he's twelve thirty one\n[noise]\nOkay listen to it again this is Monday Night on CNN taken a couple of days for this to reach the mainstream [noise]\nNon ... women says it on Monday Night on CNN\nAnd its noticed today and again he's talking the freight Cuomo all about all the recent shootings in mailed the pipe bombs and ... says there was another have filled criminal just last week in Kentucky\nAnd other white man in custody for shooting and killing two African Americans in a grocery store we barely had time to cover\nWe have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men most of them radicalized to the right\nAnd we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\nYou know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy ban\nNow Don Lemon ... what is your reaction to this I mean this punks I'm telling you this is not a one off this is I mean the specifics of a white guy Bannon but that may be something that he individually holes but the idea that the opposition\nAs far as the leftist concerned is white men predominantly white Christian man that's that's dead on the money that's right exactly where they are aimed\nIn the perverted view the Americans left it as white men who created this racist and bigoted unfair unjust immoral country do not consider me to be exaggerating here\nThat is what we are up against and this all of this from the from the uh Lenski days all the way up through the Obama administration and a real objective has been\nTo transform America away from\nThe traditions in institutions of the founding based on the fact that it's all racist and it's all bigoted and it's all unjust an unfair they continue to point to slavery\nAs the primary and evidence the primary example are exhibit\nOf their claim that America is unjust or unfair they of course pay no attention to the steps America took to end racism that gets no credit gets no mention whatsoever as far as they're concerned racism and slavery still exist in prisons on the caravan immigration policy\nYou name it\nAnd so this is what's animated and this is certainly what has energized and Phil ... of women all over this country with rage leftist women it's being utilized\nTo ah to great effect but that's the single organizing purpose is racial or I was gonna say racist but it's racial in uh in its origins now it covers much more ground than that in terms of its objective but that's their target that's what they're using and had been for a while to energize\nEverybody who is not a white man they're using a victim of allergy\nAnd victimhood in to a tea\nThey are making people think that they have no chance in America as long as white men continue to run it and be at white men or continue to be the majority and they just continually\nEnraged people they ratchet up the anger there has to be an outlet for it I think they are if you if you want to start attaching if\nYou want to start attaching media responsibility to the actions of people you notice how quickly they want to do that notice how quickly on the left at people who commit crimes are not really responsible for it on their own ways the result of environmental things\nAnd so on the left telling us that these guys are being motivated by Trump they either love Trump or they hate Trump but whatever Trump is making them do these things\nI think it's day if you're gonna if we're going to go down that road never going to start attaching blame the people who don't really have any responsibility for making the bombs or pulling the trigger on the guns who isn't that isn't raging them like I say you cannot turn on the news today and find a single thing positive about anything\nYou can't you you cannot find any reinforcement anywhere in public media for the good innocent decency of America it's quite the exact opposite\nAnd since these people are the vast majority immediate you know they exempt themselves from having any role in all of this while they are eager to try to find anybody else in the media who might be to blame for this\n\nDon Lemon and said let's to Monday Night also that he doesn't see Democrats killing people over politics\nYou mean Don like the followers of black lives matter or any Republicans in that group looking number of police officers have been murdered Mr lemon by black lives matter supporters and look at how many of those cops murders had been defended\nAnd explained away by people like you\nIn the sense well they're cops and they mistreating they're racist they deserve it\nBut don't try to tell me the Democrats are killing people yeah how about the guy that shut up the Republican baseball practice I think he was just intending to wound to people states ... almost did die it's amazing these people that way they talk and the things they conveniently forget or don't even register maybe in the first place\nA general General David Dinkins where there are fifty four where are you parity yes sending me that was\nGreat longer hear it again someday but I just wonder are your thoughts on why we haven't seen or heard of any reporting on this airline that went down\nTwo days ago and I recall that last plane went down in Malaysia CNN was all over for about a month and a half a non stop the and we haven't seen anything about this this brand new plane that went that\n[noise] yeah where did I go down\nIn ... Taiwan there about a hundred and eighty nine people died it was a brand new I Believe is going I'm not exactly sure\nWell there's no way to link it to Trump good point\nThere is no way to link it to the mid term elections there's no way to use that crash to gin up anti Republican anti Trump no I'm not joking day how I'm not I'm not joking and they don't care about it because it has no impact it has no usage they can see\nIn affecting the outcome they want in the mid term elections for don't worry they'll get to it when they decided nighttime to attack a corporation\nLike bowling or whoever made the plane they'll get to it after they've done what they can do on the midterms\nMuch appreciate it\nYou do you do do do do doubt me on this\nPersonally no but uh I just don't ever remember CNN go when wall to wall on that last plane that went on\nWell of course because that's CNN CNN neighbors there were there was they were sucking hot or they were in last place out there\nAnd ah this was that was pre Trump and ... the belief in media is that airline airplane crashes airliner crashed as a lot of passengers is white blue eye balls are ballooned to TV so they believe and then he had a mystery where a damn thing\nWhere is it Don Lemon even ask the former director of National Transportation Safety Board corn it had been swallowed by a black hole\nRemembered that you remember that\n... percent we remember that not going to ... ... ... ... ...\nThey had a mystery on their hands and indeed you're right they went wall to wall with it and it became a standing joke\nYou know that the the best way to make anything you're doing it success is to lose it and and have CNN try to find it for you\nI just haven't seen it on any media outlet whether it's Yahoo Google CNN NBC none of the nightly news show one picture from what I\nWant to wait a minute how do you know about it then well I saw it on line\nNews maybe where Monday morning Monday morning was the headline news\nHeadline news they just announced they're getting out of the news headline news just announced they're going to go eighty percent uh uh uh advertising or something like what do you ever forget what you call that program and I just\nGone to kill your that that was not one little usually anytime the plane goes to show him that many people especially it was a brand new planning that\nNow when I use it to a brand new playing what kind of playing was he says about what you remember the model number\nBut since it's brand new it's got to be one of the dumb somewhat but uh and that's what made me think even more that we would see news as to what brand new plan going down is unusual and ah we went out\nTo sea salt in it Ayesha I'll tell you what it was a bowling seven thirty seven max which is the latest uh upgrade of the seven ... seven thirty seven is a debate wide body\nAnd not as widely courses a jumbo jet wide body but it's stuffy and they have a mixed ended a damn thing to try to make a whole more passengers went down\nBut it didn't go down in America a Donald Trump had nothing to do with it going down that they can they make a case ah they they could not say that the pilot was angry at Trump and decided to take everybody out in his ... so\nThat no way to link this I'm not I'm not joking\nI Wish I was there is no way to link that crash to the mid term elections they'll

other business out there\nAny other retail business I think the news business has people that know the least about their customers and consumers and I don't know of a business out there that that has contempt for their customers and consumers like the news media does don't know if one\nI don't know of a business who ... who who rejects half if not more of their consumers are customers like the news business does\nBut the news media has a habit negative is is assuming\nAnd then operating on the assumption that whatever they think and wherever they care about is what everybody thinks for everybody cares about so I'm not so sure that all that momentum got interrupted if the momentum was interrupted if that energy level decline that wire Trump's rallies still so over the he's got one in Fort Myers like it's Fort Myers\nYeah for the sounds of people\nAlready wind up Trump's got six rallies plan between now and election day you've got all the way up to the night before the election and he's pumping\nSeries of themes and one of the themes\nJust how great these past two years have been for the U.S economy reviving moribund industry is bringing back employment bringing back wage increases bringing back a economic confidence consumer confidence in the economy\nUh he's talking about how all the things he wants to do to slow down the illegal immigration and buddy is having to deal with obstacles put on his way by both parties know what his messages\nAnd he remains is upbeat and optimistic as anybody ever has in circumstances like this so whatever is out there in the daily news media is not affecting Trump doesn't affect his mood doesn't affect his uh\nAttitude or anything of the sorts I think a lot of it as wishful thinking I got a lot of this idea that\nAll of this momentum that the Republicans had has been kinda stopped because the pipe bomb and the synagogue shooting\nThis is ... you know I I circled back to I really don't know what's gonna happen on election day and I don't believe in what he does because we don't have fortune tellers\nAnd all we have is polling data and then yeah that's a toss up you want to believe it did not want to believe it is it is it accurate is showing these close races really close but we don't know we never know until the aftermath\nHere's Trump tweeting out at Paul Ryan Paul Ryan should be focusing on holding the majority rather than giving his opinions on birthright citizenship something you know nothing about our new Republican majority will work on this closing the immigration loopholes\nThis is about this is this a classic Trump comes out gets a conversation started on a lemon dating birthright citizenship and Paul Ryan is one of the first opponents to speak up criticizing Trump saying why you can't do that that's unconstitutional but\nYou know it's ... I'll tell you what's frustrating to me there is all kinds of great news in this country economic news all kinds of a rebirth and there's evidence of it everywhere and the Republican Party itself is not even getting that message out\nI don't know about individual candidates an individual races but the national Republican Party apparatus\nIf it weren't for Trump and his tweets\nAnd his his rallies\nThe American people wouldn't have anywhere near the idea of the decent good things going on out there because Trump's own party is not joining the PR parade on this\nAs one of the reasons I'm never going to join this crowd of people thinks Trump should stop tweeting\nAnd Trump should stop all these ah incendiary things he says why let me ask you some people it's horrible what Trump said about Paul why is it why is it why is it\nA problem the Paul Ryan took the first chance he had to disagree with his own president about this and by the way all this this is a conversation starter right now\n\nIt's it's mandatory it's necessary that we have a conversation as we don't get a handle on this immigration problem you can say goodbye to America is you know it\nWhich is the design that's one of the reasons why the supporters are what they are Mollie Hemingway as a great piece today [noise] speaking of cabin on it's just right on the money and let me ask you a question during the Kavanaugh hearings\nRemember all the Democrats question and Kevin I remember all of the allegations we had balls the foreign with her allegations whatever cabin on there that led to the fact that Kevin all of a spiking punch with drugs to set women up for serial rape we had all of these women that were dragging forward\nClaiming they had evidence of it none of them ever present at any but the media\nAnd the Democratic party were hell bent on convincing everybody the cabinet was such a rotten guy that his life and career deserve to be destroyed\nSo\nAfter Kavanaugh's name to the Supreme Court he is he passes it gets ... ... ... the confirmation vote and is in sworn in why did the media drop it\nIf Kavanaugh was such a rotten S. O. B. Y. has the media stopped its investigation\nRemember all the Democrats are yeah yeah I would've Kavanaugh's confirmed we're going to a piece you were going to throw out of there we're going to get rid of those guys are rubber rate serial rapist where is all it just it's gone is it not\n\nMollie Hemingway if the media and other Democrat leaders wanted to have any credibility of all that the post hearing release of multiple allegations was not a pure political nuns\nFor which they were willing to destroy a man why they continue to fight for justice everyday wouldn't they they'd still be out there trying to nail Kavanaugh if all of that was legit\nIf if everything capital was accused of being was actually cruise they would not have stopped at him being confirmed him the Supreme Court they would still be out there right because of justice\n\nThey went up there asking every Democrat candidate whether he believes Ford and supported impeaching Kevin why aren't going that there's a big campaign going Kevin always will be rallying point Kevin always a reason to deny the Republicans continued leadership in the house\nSo why isn't the media asking every Democrat candidate running for office\nTheir opinion of Kavanaugh did you believe balls the Ford and if you did do you still support impeaching cabinet where are these questions\nThe reason those questions aren't being asked are the reason why the media isn't doing is just because it was all trumped up it was manufactured none of it was true it was a classic Democrat operation like every day I'm One of these is\nNone of what they were saying about capping off as true it was manufactured they didn't bring balls the Ford up until the very end as a Hail Mary if balls the Ford were actually telling the truth she would have been one of the first witnesses\nShe would have been one of the primary ways the Democrats ought to get rid of Kavanaugh but they had this little requests from her not Jimmy made humbling guys terrify do here and so they had a built in excuse not to use it that was convenient\nHis whole thing was manufactured the whole thing was made up\nYour Republicans running for office have you ever debates left you need to start asking a Democrat opponents they still opposed Kevin all don't let them get away with dying they ask you ask them if they still support Kevin ... or oppose Kevin I asked them if they are going to demand that he'd be impeached if they win\nReelection or election\nIf this Kevin all thing is going to work it's going to have to be turned back on the Democrats the Republicans running for office are going to have to keep bringing this up either in campaign ads we've got a week if not to wait to include this in any ad campaign if if it's been decided to leave it out\nNot to wait to cut some new ads and re inserted people need to be reminded\nLet's pretend that some of the momentum was lost low came we got plenty of time\nWe got the E R B network got all kinds of ways to remind people what happened to Brett Kavanaugh who did it what its purpose was and the proof that it was a series of lies and made up charges as evidenced by the fact that now there's not a single story about it\nBecause the media lost the Democrats lost\nIn their effort to destroy Kevin ... they lost in their attempt to use Kavanaugh to hurt Democrats or Republicans in the in the mid term elections\nHere's another one if the cabinet confirmations circus\nWe're about justice for his alleged victims Little Women instead of about killing his nomination by any means we'd still be getting updates on the story when we I mean if it was really the purpose about getting justice if it was to make sure that\nThe voice of New York [noise]\nSeven ten W O I\nGuess sixty one degrees one\nGood

to\nLeave because ... ... was becoming mine and I can handle I started writing my class cause courses because I couldn't handle how they had Wi Fi is American history the reason I called was the topic on immigration\nIntegration efforts in the book probably gets about one paragraph what most people don't understand is when ... million people came over\nTo Ellis Island we didn't just open our arms and say come on in the way the Democrats won again now these people were given a thorough examination by the ship\nEspecially looking after I take a device him like open up\nThe upper island and if you had a disease called trek karma you were automatically let go a mate you walk up and down steps to make sure that you were a strong and we're not when that\nNow once the ship Dr performed has examination you were put on a ship and you were sent to Ellis Island where they gave you a second examination\nDoing that check coma exam once again\nWalking up and down the steps\nAnd if you didn't make it you were sent back about two percent of the people were sent back and the reason why it was so low is because the ship doctor really did a thorough exam\nIf you were sent back that ship had to pay for your passage back to Europe so they wanted to make sure we did not want any on the cutting out work\nWas not healthy and watch not strong\nYou realize that the what you're describing is factually correct there are people listening to you today who think my God America was cruel back then\nYou have I that's what people are thinking listening to tell the story\nI'm sure they probably are because they've never heard it and we were compassionate to those who couldn't work\nUm there was a saying that said I heard in America they had streets then I heard the streets were paved with gold and then I found out I was going to be the one page in the streets but we did not want people would be on welfare we did not want those people\nWe want it only strong healthy people that's been totally left out of history books and\nI Can't tell you how much it frustrates me to listen to these Democrats talk about how wonderful into the world a lot of everybody not true\nI have a nine year

I I John Silver at Boston University at Boston University way back in the nineties\nDid a survey of the most popular high school history textbook and found one paragraph in reference to Abraham Lincoln one paragraph there were pages devoted to Bill Clinton for example\nIn an American history the name that you want to know is Howard Zinn Howard Zinn as a textbook writer as a as a as a as a quasar socialist Marxist and he somehow has been a gold\nThe vast majority of text books purchased for use in American public schools have been written by this guy but you know you remind me of your story about Ellis Island I Need to tell this story again\nBecause immigration has been a subject for as long as I've been hosting the program\nSo over Thirty years in one white thank you very much a Ella for the call I really I'm I'm Glad you got through to remind us about el as it was it not only by the way we're checking people's health\nThey were determining whether or not people actually wanted to be Americans it was a restrictive process\nNow we were much newer and younger country boom and we had an entirely different attitudes about immigration and growth and it was required that immigrants assimilate and it was required that they be healthy we we're not going to open the borders to illness\nWe we're not going to expose the American people do things through accidents or or design but more importantly the immigrants who were allowed in\nHe was still would not guess what got the loudest and most sustained applause of any announcement [noise]\nAre you ready when apple announced that the new Matt book air is made of one hundred percent recycled aluminum\nThe young people in that in that room erupted into a circus gain standing ovation\nAnd I said to myself well it's all over the environmentalist wackos with this age group have one more than any technical advanced what're achievement more than any cool aspect of it would be as good as most of the fact that it was a hundred percent recycled\nIt just these kids have been told that climate change is destroying the habitat that there may not be\nAway for life to be sustained when they hit sixty five you'd be amazed at the number of young people who've been brainwashed and propagandize to believe that [noise] and so the fact of Apple's introduced a little bitty computer year and it's made a one hundred percent recycled aluminum was the big news of the day\n[noise] holy smokes now let's go to the audio soundbites vis vis folks\nI talked about this earlier here's the evidence first up Jake Tapper CNN with Erin Burnett last night\nThe president of the United states making a controversial visit the Pittsburgh today after the deadliest attack on Jews in American history\nPresident was greeted by a hundred protesters singing this land\nIs your land protesters with signs saying the president's not welcome until he saw what they perceived to be his assault on immigration and refugee the protests are not surprising\nOf course not after you protests are not so ... what what does immigration refugees have to do with this event anyway why are these protesters\nOkay so here's Jake Tapper the protests are not surprising it's totally understandable nobody wanted Trump here Columbus hated Trump is reviled everybody wishes Trump would not come in every did come they wish they would just leave\nSo now we go to the University of Pittsburgh Medical center President Trump's first lady you Monica\nTrump Jared Kushner walking through the halls to visit people wounded in the synagogue

president there and it's not just Jake Tapper everybody in a drive by Mr President your sham should not thought this was not your place you know business going they don't want you to forty five thousand people signed a petition asking him not\nTo come oh wait we're not true we stay at the University of Pittsburgh Medical center and now I'm a lot of the first lady and Monica Trump gets some love to\nThank you very meaningful\nThank you very much hate her name is John John ... [laughter]\nThat was a male employee looking at Jared questionnaire saying nobody ever heard of you laughing that his wife was a\nBigger star that's fine no problem eat everybody laughing about it but what is you're not going to see this anywhere I mentioned it to you in the opening our of the program that this is what happened\nThere are thousands of people already in line in Fort Myers awaiting a Trump rally there later tonight [noise] but nobody wants Donald Trump anywhere she everybody hates Trump everybody despises Trump everybody regrets that they voted for everybody can't wait\nTo vote for Democrats so the Trump can't do anything you know everybody wants the Democrats back in power so they can start investigating Trump and get rid of it that's your drive by media\n\nThey don't show you get a reaction to real people you will not see those videos you will not hear that audio and\nReduce the number one your personality of all time Rush Limbaugh hardly beat\nThe five year old brutalized law enforcement officers gunned down\nThese are the victims of illegal immigration American Life destroy our broken immigration laws\nAnd conservative congressman Kevin McCarthy is leading the fight\nKevin McCarthy is real mobile handed force the lone\nFunds President Trump's border wall\nExpands caseload ... criminal\nAnd insurers only American citizens have the right to vote\nThe leadership of President Trump's new\nThat's conservative guy who was like\nSo health President Trump's\nFor the walls dot com\nAnd tell Congress to pass Kevin McCarthy build the wall and enforce the law\nFor by the Tea Party express [noise]\nWell CNN was the first to do it a month ago CNN declared the Democrats have won the house because one of their falls in the poll lousy is declaring victory in the battle of the house\nShe was on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert last night and set up until today I wouldn't have said in the election were held today we were when but what I'm saying now is we will when we when we were when the house\nNancy Pelosi\nPredicting a house that was already been won by the diver so no need the Democrats\n[noise] New York is the most most of the box they rated number\nMessage ... everybody knew it was just a conversation starter just exactly like what Trump is doing with suggesting that we need to uh and birthright citizenship claiming the fourteenth amendment does not say that\nYou have everybody in the world out there disagreeing with him but the purpose of it is to start the conversation Trump is done that that's what conservatism was as a former movement back in Nineteen sixty four [noise]\nUh and there are those examples where were you know that that somebody's going to lose either at a local race or a presidential race but in mid term elections I can I can show your countless in two thousand ten\nWhen the Republicans picked up sixty three seats nobody forecast that the closest I remember to anybody forecasting a massive Republican takeover was none other\nThan the prince of darkness in himself Robert Novak back in Nineteen Ninety four predicted I think to within two seats the Republican takeover of a house in those elections I think we one fifty four seats are forty something out of he predicted was off by two\nBut nobody predicted the Republicans are going to pick up sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nI mean the media didn't want to think anything was even possible because of so much love and devotion respect for Obama and then when it happened you should've seen if you remember the bottom fell out the wind just totally came out of their sales\nIn two thousand two everybody thought\nEverybody did Democrats were going to walk away with the house of representatives because everybody hated\nBush Bush was not duly elected Bush stole the election in the Florida recount with the help of a twisted Supreme Court and Democrats did the Wellstone memorial and that was going to galvanize Democrats all over the country to show up and vote and there was no way\nAnd what happened Republicans gained ... seats [noise]\nThe left was done to the drive by media couldn't believe it so they're examples even when people are dams certain what's gonna happen\nThey end up being surprised the brightest minds the greatest go rose the most heralded analysts\nAnd it's all about presenting an image of making it look like you know what you're talking about more than anybody else does I have here is from a ... a real clear politics by one of the written down their\nPoll analyst and data and listeria Sean ... I'm not going to read the whole thing of print out the four pages bought the headline here under certain movies loom as mitten terms\nAnd her final stretch nominate tell you what this long piece says I can do this long piece in three words we know nothing\nOn certain days alone as mid terms that her final stretch the twenty eight ten midterms\nWorking their way toward a conclusion in a week we should find Leno who will control the house although at the outcomes close it could take weeks to finish counting ballots in California\nThe consensus view is that the Democrats are favored to take the house of representatives analyst disagree on just how large the majority they're going to win is and how likely that majority is if you split the real clear politics toss ups in half\nThat's much polls it results in Democrats gaining about twenty five seats\nFor a narrow two hundred and twenty to two hundred and Fifteen majority\nI tend to think says Mr trend day that the toss ups will break disproportionately toward Democrats\nAnd see something more on the order of up to twenty five to two hundred Ken Democratic majority but this is hair splitting to a certain degree okay so here he says in the second paragraph it's all over and it's a Democrat's two hundred and twenty five seats the Republicans with two hundred and ten\nNext paragraph at the same time this isn't the only way to read that data the Democrat pickups could be larger but they could also be smaller here are some things that shouldn't\nBother any sober minded elections analyst in the final week of the election why we just concluded here and as the Democrats are gonna end up with two hundred and twenty five states and the Republicans two hundred and ten so why do we analyzed ... because the truth is we don't know\nThose are my words and I'm just trying to raise\nHis words resume here will there be a late break as we learned in two thousand sixteen and in a less dramatic fashion and two thousand fourteen a late breaking the races can altered the landscape substantially this year there are a lot of undecided voters remaining\nLook at the most recent house polling from the New York times Sienna in some races and get to the gym membership numbers\nThis adds up to a situation where a slight break in the undecideds toward one party or the other could be the difference between a healthy Democratic majority and a slim Republican but wait here's are these are predicted to twenty five to ... I'm not harping on Mr trend day here\nIs we don't know he's given you his best gas but now he's giving you every reason in the world is ... ... to ... to be can think of where it might their talent that way\nGiven the closeness of many races and the president's improving overall job approval is also unclear\nHow do evaluate all of this in the current cycle well then how did you get to to twenty five to ten if it's really unclear how to evaluate all this [laughter] but that's just me into being smart alec\nUh in New York's twenty second congressional district Sienna college places the president's job approval at fifty three percent so Republican representative Claudia Tenney as possibly in better shape than her polling numbers suggest\nBut what about the nineteenth representative John Faso is up by a point that the president's job approval is at a forty six forty nine split that suggested very close race and there are likely a lot so\nTrump's on the ballot or he isn't\nIs it going to matter what Trump's approval number is in some of these house races or is it not [noise] anybody who thinks Trump's not on the ballot here\nNeeds to reexamine things and then the next burgers how many votes are Democrats wasting one of the biggest news stories this cycle has been a massive influx of money\nAnd the two Democrats campaigns this initially showed up and marquee races like Beto O'Rourke challenge of Ted Cruz but it has since filtered down into more marginal races like Indiana's nines\nOr California's first or a outer Mongolia of seven\nAnd all of this is relevant because Democrats right now have a roughly seven and a half point lead in the generic ballot\nWhich asks which party would you prefer to have control of Congress not normally this will be enough to flip the majority but if Democrats run up the score in districts that are unlikely to win suddenly that seven point margin translates into a closer than expected seat but then there's another consideration and that's how heart related army errors\nMeaning how reliable aren't they [laughter] and then the next\n... are we're relying too much on one pollster oh that's a pretty straightforward concern\nAnd then the next ... what is it early voting telling us well the pet response is nothing but that's too simple early voting returns usually tell us something but unfortunately they can only be deciphered in retrospect meaning we don't know the early voting is still it's over\nWe're not counting votes yet so all we know is party turnout but we don't know how these people that voted nobody does the only way you can determine early voting is after the election is over\nBut yet we're still going to talk about it [noise] so the final paragraph what else is lurking out there and this is probably the biggest concern and the what else is lurking what yet to happen that hasn't happened that could swing a bunch of boats [noise]\nWhich renders every poll prior to this\nDay largely irrelevant which is why I continue to\nRail against polls about congressional midterm races in November the year before or in August of the summer before because the stuff that's going to determine the way people vote hadn't even happens so what's going to the polls but here at the end of this four page story\n\nWhat else is working out very well that's probably the biggest concern we've we've gotten good polling on the\nCandidate coal competitive districts but take argument to and then realized that in some of these districts Republicans might be caught napping we've seen some examples of this such as the open seat in Florida Fifteen or the incumbent Rob Woodall in Georgia seventh film [noise]\nWe don't however no how big a problem this is right now or even if it is a problem\nI suspect we'll have a surprise or two on election night but what if there are ten surprises regardless of whether that happens\nWe're well set up for such an eventual out on the bottom line I happen to live inside the what's gonna happen but in my job is to tell you how it all looks to me [noise]\nThat's people we believe investment advice is about more than helping you manage your wealth our investment advice is about it's about providing your kids with opportunities for headstart in my feeling secure in your retirement in real life and your dreams just may become a reality because you have a plan we believe in you\nYour path to investment advice starts with your steeple financial advisor find your news people financial advisor ...\nThat's S C I F E L people Nicholas in company incorporated member S.
