E. W. international Brotherhood of electrical workers local union four five six energizing run over a century\nAlways great to catch up with\nNights they usually would be able to catch up\nEarlier this week with a former scarlet I quarterback McMahon take a listen\nMike for you um\nI remember the day you signed at Rutgers to come here and I thought to myself wow I we had a big time quarterback coming here you are highly recruited [noise] how do you decide to come here and I know the programs came in on your but\nYeah it is um I committed early ah about the second or third game my senior year\nBlatantly your other school started coming in but um our to get my word to Rutgers my dad said you know you give someone you were just stick to it and actually it worked out great I you know I had a great coaching staff\nGot a good education and uh you know got to go on a ... so\nEverything works out for the best that way\nI Would take me towards because represents a young quarterback now you came in your plate right away um when did it start to all makes sense to you when did it thought to slow down\nTakes a while um but it just ... the more reps you get the more comfortable get\nHe's got to get some weapons around them to help me get some receivers that will help 'em out run game\nAnd a good defense will help a a a young quarterback out as well but it's again it's going to take some time\nAnd he needs rats you just gotta practice getting the ball quicker seeing things than actually it'll just slow down\nFor him it's all about decision making and so when the received about the break right\nYeah he's got to get the ball you know and that's obviously a help to on the line I'll help him out as well take them head solve them\nAnd you know the coaching staff doing a great job getting the ball out of hand quick as well they said that split second longer he's got an anticipated and that again will help everyone will help him out help is by a hopeless receive result getting open as well\nAnd one thing that help you out what was your ability to run you you're probably came at the wrong time in the NFL now they're kind of look at the quarterback who can do what you do you what kind of a ... threat quarterback who could really throw it but also run\nYeah yeah I came in running for seven as a freshman and I left running up four or five wanted to combine while Iran for for a hand held I remember the browns asked me if I'd be willing to play receiver might not be just as you said earlier and uh\nYou you learn you know you gotta you gotta get a little faster once these guys are coming at you bought a again that was something that\nI was able to use a being at Rutgers it's now it's the all the teams want that a little bowl building you know I think when I play they wanted to bore taller guy Peyton Manning and all of us go back and carry Collins and sit in the pocket\nStill like that but that athletic guy gives it seems a little bit more options are pushed a little bit more pressure on the defense and with the way the rules have changed the NFL I really wish I play now beginning to protect the quarterback and not okay to protect her body better protect your statue gets all went down the middle of field\nYou ever get you get back but you know come back because you made a bad decision by the receiver got killed so again the rules are changing it definitely much more quarterback friendly now\nYou know it's just the way the game evolves\nYou know it's it's funny you get into a game when you're in Detroit on Thanksgiving Day and I remember telling a friend of mine that said if my man gets into the game watch out and you add one of the most incredible performances of your career\nI'll I'll never forget that game it was a doubt sixteen I was actually talking to tide that run the sideline and they were talking about that with my kids are playing time\nThere's there are six six or seven minutes left in the game and I talked to try to I'm thinking about my drive going home to Pittsburgh have Thanksgiving with my family and sure enough two seconds later Marty comes over his warm up you're going in Green Bay yeah and try to start laughing and here's like\nYou've got to go play and I honestly I went in and like a like a young guy here like you know a freshman at Rutgers I went in the game was fast I just ran around them a place there was like back to our football and uh\nI remember talking to ... for the game he said man you're right Mitt Romney young me and it just kind of like a playbook went out the window and I just went around and throw it and have fun but are we as well most memorable games ever had and you know it it just\nSomething at Rutgers always taught me in the same thing was never give up and that's what you know the game was ... came back and lost by two so unfortunately it didn't pan out at the end but uh you know or something I'll never forget\nOh it's good to see you playing in the NFL for six plus here then you went and played in Canada and us that ballot you got the most out of your talent and that's always great to see how quickly what are you doing now I Know you want to get the coaching\nI'm working on we are doing a little broadcasting by really to get back into coaching I Love the competitive side of the game planning and I really like about some young quarterback you know
