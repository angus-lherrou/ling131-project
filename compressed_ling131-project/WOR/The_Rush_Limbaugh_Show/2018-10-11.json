states involved in this now Trump is being openly asked about it\nAnd it has\nTo do in many ways with with our new found relationship with Saudi Arabia based on the fact we no longer depend on them for oil\nNow ... is Saudi I don't know if he is related to add nan ... not common ... is is a as a Saudi or Arab name and then the show he was a famous arms runner made famous as a celebrity\nBy a a\nLifestyles are the rich and famous but the guy was an arms merchant he was an arms dealer and that the source of his wealth which is made to look like a jet setting party animal by Robin Leach so

kings king ... he is the brother of the late ... king king of double their father grandfather uh started the house of Saud they are the royal family\nThe crown prince the each of these guys have many sons there are\nConstant battle for power with in the royal family the crown prince is the chosen son and he has the air\nNow Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of king Solomon but he has been designated the crown prince meaning he will be the next king as such Mohammed bin ... mom has been trying theoretically\nTo reform the some of the the Saudi economy and to take it away from being strictly petrol and ah oil\nFocused because\nThe world is expanding in ways that the Saudis are not involved in one of the things that Mohammed bin Salman has been doing has been traveling the world and making friends in the United states you spend a lot of time in Silicon Valley he's gotten to know is winding dying the Google guys he's winding dined Facebook guys spend a lotta time an apple\nHe wants to build a brand new\nCity out of nothing in Saudi Arabia and make it a tech center he's thirty two\nIf\nHe takes off the Arab garb he looks just like your average run to the middle guy a very attractive short little stocky\nBut he represents if he is being\nTruthful major reforms he is the guy who has opened up driving to Saudi women he is the guy who wants to relax\nAll kinds of cultural rules on on Saudi women and open up speech to them all but not being able to drive a go places on their own without male a company but this made him quite controversial he also last summer not this past summer last I think it was this past summer\nHe arrested the lead of the elite\nOf Saudi well some of them even among the royal family and took over\nThe Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh and that became a giant jail and he put all these guys in jail demanding a certain percentage of their wealth on the basis they had stolen it\nDo the corruption and connections and soon as he made a lot of enemies well Jamal ... has as a journalist doesn't buy any of this and has been running around openly criticizing Mohammed bin Salman\n\nEven running stories suggesting that Mohammed bin ... father the king has grown so upset with his son the crown prince that he's taking toys and power away from it this reportedly has not set well with the crown prince Mohammed bin selmont\nDespite the reforms in Saudi Arabia you still don't get to run around and criticize the government and keep\nYour head you don't get to run around and criticize the government and keep your knees for example ... wanted to get married he had to get a wedding lie a marriage license he was in Turkey\nIn order to do that by the end it before the he had supposedly had been targeted by the crown prince and others in the

to benefit your average Democrat voter\nWell I'll tell you how the Democrats have so poison their voters\nDemocratic voters want revenge not a job not raise non a bonus they want room range and the

stuff that creates a blue wave I don't [noise]\nI don't believe that the country is that it ranged but the Democrats are counting on the fact they think it is okay to the\nPhones ban in Fresno Europe first today great to have you with us or high\nThey rush thanks for having me on Yes sir I\nSo I was there I was in the for the three days of the nonsense last week I saw the the them screaming and yelling and attacking us and and the folks and and so why was\nThis is all they have the reason that they continue the reason that John Lennon saying the nonsense she said on CNN the reason that they just continue with this game plan but it's the only game plan they have\nAnd they're hoping that the American people are dumb enough to still buy it but I Believe that the American people even in California where I'm at the American people are seeing this crap and they're like this this is an old game we don't find any more\nAnd and and they have nothing else to claim there's nothing else for them to do but they just keep doing the same knock it and the look in their eyes it was like they know they're losing they know that we're not buying it anymore but they've got nothing else to say\nNow that's a whole lot you know that's an interesting point because if they do have the maturity of the presence of mind\nThey do have to realize they're losing Trump one Trump is getting elements of agenda his agenda a pastor implemented Kavanaugh was confirmed everything they've done to stop Trump\nEverything from the judges to the courts to travel but not much has worked and so I think you're right they do realize they're losing\nAnd you think they're in a fit of desperation that they've got nothing else to do that's why they're not proposing any ideas to counter Trump's that's why they are not proposing any new policies to counter Trump's because they don't have any\nAbsolutely they let loose when they're both the right loses when were silent and they it for so long they've expected us to just shut up and go away it\nWell that that's true too I I think they have become accustomed to Republicans caving and Republican voters will certainly conservative media up ... conservative caving as well I think they've they've gotten accustomed to bullying working that's for rats lying\nYup threats flying all of that and and and they're hoping that it's going to work together and the only way it works\nIf we don't go up that's why that's why you see the polling data still showing them winning that's why it showed Hillary was going to win in a landslide because they know that if they can to sway does that they can discourage jumping up and up and they could not go up that's the only way they win but if Republicans conservative\nStand up when every single time we just have to show up we have to convince other people to show up you convince them to convince other people to show\nUp you say you were in Washington for three days what did you actually see

does not like echoing remarks from his wife the bully millennia Trump about it doesn't say that but you know they wanted to write it\nDuring a live phone interview a Thursday morning with facts and friends of president said it was more true in the past when he was first setting himself up in Washington and he just trust and members of his team\nHe cited Nikki Haley who announced her resignation as weak as an example of the great people who now feel his administration he said he's going to do away with people who doesn't like\nAre there so am I Am not in love with yes we're going to weed them out slowly well she said that ... there's just not coincidence\nThis is not happenstance\n... and Trump both are putting stab you in the west wing on notice\n\nA Trump also said we'll get to it we'll get to it I don't want to jump ahead let's go to the audio soundbite starting with number seven teams sorry sorry sorry\nUh Thirteen [noise] this is Trump calling in to Fox and friends that I was talking to Steve do see a do you say you took some heat yesterday Mr President for going ahead with that rally in Pennsylvania despite the hurricane\nI really had very little eat other than the natural haters of which there are obviously some we had thousands of people lined up by the time either making decisions on my decision was do I want to tell people that were waiting ten and twelve hours already\nThat I'm not coming and I just thought it would be and we're talking about thousands of people you know when they get there that early and who you know that area obviously has not affected at all by it we added on a great control I don't think really\nThey go to Sherry hot relative to other things I think it was very minor\nSo president essentially saying look these people to blind\nUpdate expected me to show up I follow through I Do what I say I'm going to do\nThe hurricane was going to do what it did and there's nothing I could have done about it last night when I was in this rally my people are down there working on it we got it covered\nI can do both and I'm following through on the commitment so\nThe next question in from the do somebody who probably is not going to vote for you Eric Holder\nFormer attorney general said they go low we kick him and the whole room Mr\nPresident started clapping and cheering when he said that what does that say to you about the tenor of politics to\nBe careful what he's wishing for that I can tell you better be careful what he's willing to discuss things safe for them to make a very dangerous stay put folder [laughter] is held in contempt by Congress or when after Christians he went after our\nGreat evangelicals he went after the Tea Party people you know that they just settled with the IRS just settle that case\nA holder is they've got some problems\nNot used to be talking to like this in the old days Eric Holder can say whatever you send them to Republicans ... away or not even acknowledge porn or they would say\nWe strongest term ... we ...\nRhetoric co authored by law attorney general holder written and it's ... ... ... much oh totally totally uncalled for and we we routinely a unilateral condemning\n[laughter] Trump says [laughter]\nYou better be careful [laughter] he's wishing for [laughter] that I can tell you that he'd better be\nCareful what he's wishing for now the stock market's been kind of the song it's been a roller coaster ring\nAnd Trump\nIs suspicious as he can be up and let me just tell you something folks there are a number of wealthy Democrat Wall Street types investors people look run hedge funds who I Am convinced\nWould willingly take a bit of a financial hit to their wealth and businesses primarily their business is not their wealth but they would they would David in person pain if it meant\nLowering economic activity on enough to hurt Trump I have no doubt that there aren't enough\nLooney tunes on the left who would willingly do this I think they're that desperate as a previous caller said and of course\nIt it flies in the face of the Democrats in the media tried to say when it was a new age ah yeah the economy's doing well but the president's not going to get any credit for ... ... people don't even leave it I Believe it looking aren't\nPulling people obviously that's not true I think they're terribly worried\nThat this great economy is going to be greatly beneficial not just to ... but the Republicans\nIn the midterms and so there's a monkey and going on with the interest rates is the point it's calling are causing the stock market's a roller coaster and here is Trump was ... pointed out to him yesterday was not a good day for investors\nThe Federal Reserve is getting a little bit too cute that so when I took over this economy this economy was ready to crash we were at one percent GDP now or a four point two percent [noise]\nIt was ready to crash it was the worst if you look from the great depression when is the worst recovery and the history of our country and Obama tremendous money at it [laughter]\nDon't forget Obama's was playing with zero money so he was playing with funny money he was it was very easy [noise] I'm paying interest at a high rate because of our fed and I'd like are fed not to be so aggressive because I think that making a big mistake\nTranslation he is worried maybe accusing\nThe Federal Reserve of raising interest rates because the economy's chugging along so well that traditional inside the beltway Washington gets very worried when the economy's going great\nMy whole life I've noticed this and my whole life I have been perplexed by this I've asked myself why and let's look the fans here as the establishment in this story\nWhy\nIs a great performing and growing economies so for renting\nTwo official Washington and it is because every time the economy starts talking what does the fed do they leak they leak that they are thinking of raising rates and what does that do that kills activity in equities markets\nIf these people think defense is going to start raising rates people start selling rather than buying and investing what Trump is saying that he thinks this is being done purposefully to slow down the economy\nAt the time totally unnecessary for it right before an election and he's calling them out he's caught it's another thing previous Republican presidents would not do he's calling out the fed Mr Limbaugh doesn't Trump from the ... no you may appoint the Federal Reserve chairman but know day to day no way\n\nAnd the Federal Reserve chairman the odds are that the number of the board of governors are going to be you know a bunch of\nTommy leftists as they are at many financial institutions are not going to pretty strictly crazy about Trump despite how much wealth they are earning the cause of Trump\n\nSo Trump calling them out on it he says there's no reason to start raising rates right now right before the election was why things down\nSo they react to it and and this roller coaster stock market day actually ended up being only a one day roller coaster\nI think there's positive action today I Will I Will check it ah let's see one more thing here we have yeah\nA ... heart\nSo your wife recently had an interview she said there are people in the White House she doesn't trust people you don't trust that you have to watch your back is that true and if that is the case why are these people you don't trust still in the administration\nWe have great people right now are more kids\nAre there are some that I Am a not in love with us and we'll weed them out slowly but surely\nUrban some other embarrassing leaks are you any closer to figuring out who these people are\nWell let me get my legs I think a lot of the lake so not link that made up by the newspapers the meat is very very dishonest beyond anything that anybody can understand\nNow even a letter to the times that there is a chance there is a very good chance that that was written by the time so I wouldn't be surprised because at times is totally corrupt and dishonest\nWhere did you first hear about right here\nWho was the first or maybe the only person to suggest that the times itself wrote that piece that memo that pose a memo written\nBy an angry staffer in the Trump Administration claiming their up close and personal things the president doesn't know what he's doing but don't worry there are adults in the room and we're doing everything we can to stop this guy we're conservatives and we love this\nAnd they started a massive manhunt to find out who did this\nAnd they couldn't find anybody and I think on the first day on the first day whenever I go back and check the transcript\nOh my goodness rash thank you so much for taking my car that you have to bear with me I'm so nervous and excited and you are amazing and you like is any value vote you off to the country and the world I'm\nAlso had to my dad ... my hair so [laughter] I guess I have to practice um by saying that I Am black I Am also a millennial and I'm female I Wish those things did not matter but unfortunately the left is like just so\nRelentless in their game and like divisive politics it's still relevant to my overall point\nUm I saw you in the package she thanked me nine and your main speech was about I'm not a taking on a victim mentality and I was so fired up and it was amazing I had to feel um and I remember realizing that I never felt that way and my whole life\nUm even though the left would label me and say that I should be feeling that way\nAnd I just really I Am so fired up especially with the Koch have announcing I feel like this whole divisive war on man I'm I'm so fired up I Want everyone to feel that way um I Am so committed to doing everything I can to expose is\nI'm I'm inviting all my friends that let's say to you [laughter] throughout the week and at the weekend we are going to get together and we're going to talk\nOf I feel like you can't rely on the mainstream media to get any of that for you and I think that's the only reason why the less they had to reach that much power at you\nAnd there's actually that is I'm very that that your your ... your soon as you as a ... a ... is is great a year you said you're a millennial so you're you're near thirty and\nOn the yeah I'm On the upper ...
