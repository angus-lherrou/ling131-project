O. R. voice of New York and high\nAnd then I come to the radio station and we talk about those patients so it's the only radio show in the world where you have a behind the scenes look at really what's happening in the world of cancer you learned about cancer you learned about human nature you learned about medicine you learn about the\nBig hospitals and doctors and how they practice you learn a lot it's not just the practice of oncology or cancer but let's jump in and I just got an email from a a\nPerson and I'll tell you the name of this person has a say their first name actually like I tell you their last name and a C or\nName is Mary Ann Mary wrote me simple little ladder but it's a letter that has a lot of gravity you said you'd treat stage for breast cancer well the simple answer is yes and I wrote Mary back and I said yes we do as a matter of fact that's something we do and I get lots of\nQuestions Dr Lederman you treat the stage for cancer well why wouldn't we let's talk about what stage for cancer might mean to marry or to someone else was breast cancer or another kind of cancer stage for\nLet's just say the cancer Mary's talking about the breast cancer left the breast that's what stage four means left the breast left the local lymph nodes\nAnd it's spread so where does breast cancer spread and how does it spray spread well it can spread through the bloodstream which is the most common site to spread to distance sites\nSo usually a cancer starts at a particular place like the breast then can travel to the lymph nodes at most common first sight of lymph nodes is the\nArmpit remember in the body you should think about the body and how it functions the body has a heart which is the pomp and it's pumping fluids throughout\nYour body from head to toe your whole body is based in blood and we need the blood we need the blood to carry oxygen to our body from our head to our toes who need oxygen everywhere in the blood vessels carry it everywhere\nAnd you also buy products that need to be discarded so the blood goes to the kidney and the kidney\nFilters the blood blood goes to the intestines help us to absorb food and nutrients\nBlood goes everywhere bone marrow and liver and lungs and while it's going there it can carry cancer cells with it so if a cancer started in the breast and travel to the lymph nodes under the armpit will the next stop is going to the super cliff it killer notes lymph nodes above the cloud call\nAnd then it goes to the heart and that's how it gets into the bloodstream so think about the question Mary asked\nA cancer starting in the breast spreads lymph nodes get in the bloodstream through the heart of the ... the live channels end up in the heart and pumps again pump pump pump and whatever your heart pumps sixty already times a minute it's pumping all this\nFluid blood cells through your body and that pumping action than kind of sucks the\nBlood back through the veins systems of veins system is lower pressure of the heart pumps pound pound pound compound and it's pounding on a high pressure the blood out but it comes back at a lower pressure and that's how cancer cells spread\nAnd if you think about cancer cells spreading let's just say for example a console cancer tongue cancer well they spread to different lymph nodes and a breast cancer would spread because they started in a different spot so us tonsil cancer tongue cancer often will spread to the lymph nodes of the neck\nWhereas let's say a cancer of the rectum may spread to rectal lymph nodes around the rectum and pelvis and then off the blood supply the blood supply that goes from the [noise]\nRockville area often travels to the liver\nAnd often takes cancer cells to liberate which is a very common spread of let's say rectal cancers and colon cancer colon cancer is a member of the colon system to call them is designed to bring in nutrition to the body digestion\nAnd the blood that goes from the cold and to the liver for digestion often can carry cancer cells there [noise] so which\nPart of the body as unique distribution and we recognize that and we look for that and we deal with that whether a cancer starts in the lung and spreads lymph nodes and the media Stein of the center of the chest these are all known methods of spread\nBefore the lymph channels dumb the lymph fluid into the heart and their combined with the blood and then re circulate spreading possible cancer cells so where can this breast cancer be stage for that Mary's talking about well could be anywhere could be in the head\n... there can be a nod your cancer in the brain and that's why we were the first ones to develop stereo tactic grain radio surgery in New York the first ones to deliver nearly three decades ago though why ... why did we think that it's so important\nTo develop arraigned radio certainly well prior to that time people that had brain metastases had the whole brain radiated are surgery opening up the brain and the whole brain radiation which is pretty gross\nBut sad to say it's still commonly done there's many many neurosurgeons who's still go in and ... on the brain and many doctors reddish doctors do give whole brain radiation radiation to the whole brain even though we know it's not beneficial to the brain if it can be avoided [noise]\nWe brought stereo tactic pinpoint precision to treatment of cancers in the brain\nAnd so let's just say of Mary's loved one had breast cancer traveled to the brain rather than surgery on the brain or rather than radiating the whole brain which might be harmful to the whole brain\nWere able to pinpoint thousands of beams to attack the cancer in the brain wherever it is from thousands of NGOs pinpoint invisible beams special lays down on the table\nWe hold them in a good position but comfortable not claustrophobic and then we send in thousands of beams attack the cancer and in about ten minutes the treatments done patient returns for their life whether they go home or work or go across the street to Macy's\nThis is what we do every day revolutionary\nInsurance can say wow the neurosurgeons must be angry at you Dr Lieberman yeah they were\nAnd the other cancer doctors write angry at you yeah they were because we're disrupting the apple cart were saying okay for many cancers probably most you don't need brain surgery can have started tactic radio surgeries same for you donate standard radiation why would you want standard radiation when you can come and see Dr Lederman\nAt Thirteen for Broadway and have pinpoint treatment for the brain cancer and let's just say Mary's loved one had a stage for cancer because of travel to the long\nWhile we're the first to the western hemisphere with steroids tactic pinpoint treatment of cancer in the long for example [noise]\nAnd we couldn't attack the cancer with a Ninety percent success rate ... percent means that cancer tiny percent will never come back for the rest of the patient's life where we attack that cancer\nThat we know others competing methods of treatment for example marries a loved one may want to have chemotherapy but the problem with chemotherapy is that it goes everywhere there's a toxicity to that that's the way people talk about\nHair loss and the pain and numbness in their hands and feet to bone marrow and other issues [noise] whereas his radio or do the treatment is pinpoint [noise] so if there is loved one God Forbid has a cancer spread to the lungs were able to attack that\nWhere else does breast cancer spread well can spread anywhere really common spots or the brain along the bones and you'll see in our body book with if you call her office even now to get her body book with [noise]\nThe call at two and two choices two and two choices you will see us treating cancer in the bone is eating away through the spy is a big hole in the spine looks like a rat was eating through the spine we treated that mass and the best one away the massive cancer went away\nAnd the bone healed up back to normal lots of people have pain from cancer when it spreads especially in the bone in other areas of east to the bone and each through the nerves that causes a heck of a lot of pain and we can get rid of the pain while we get rid of the cancer and that's why so many people come here for treatment\nI Know so many chemo doctors just keep on giving chemo whether it works or not I see so many people are just getting\nMonths or years of chemo even if it's not working which to me is not necessarily beneficial for the patient I don't think it is beneficial [laughter]\nMaybe it's good for the hospital and pharmaceutical industry the doctor but if they're giving chemo and it's not working in the cancers growing and there's more pain I think it's time to call Dr Lederman a two one two choices where else can cancer travel stage for breast cancer what can go to the adrenal gland\nThe adrenal glands adrenal was Latin word as being above Reno means kidney it's a glamorous about kidneys responsible for making hormones [laughter] it's a common sight and other sites as well lymph nodes anywhere in the body\nSo this is the work we do so for Mary the answer is yes we treat better static breast cancer stage four and other cancers every day and were highly successful were very good at it\nI have a high degree of precision this is the work that we do every day we have booklets in DVDs in car office there is no cost there is no obligation you just call her office at two one two choices [noise] two one two choices pick up a book with DVD\nAnd then read through it or maybe give it to your friend her neighbor that person down the street who you know is struggling and help them out to help them understand that there\nTwenty years this is the mother of their friends she is eighty three she's marriage has children she came with her husband came with her daughter\nAnd last winter she had pain in the air and decreased hearing and went to an ear doctor and had tubes put in the antibiotics and all the usual teen and\nFinally a few months ago shut an MRI them arrive the face showing this massive cancer in the carotid a cancer of the ... gland more than five centimeters eating through the\nBone eating through the manned about extending up into the brain\nExtended all the way to the brain into the sinuses [noise] it was tracking along the nerves was tracking along the facial nerve so the tumor cancer was growing right along the nerve to think about a nerve going from the brain to the face to make the face move and smile and close the eyes and open the eyes [noise]\nThe cancer was growing right along this nerve is if it was the highway [noise]\nAnd she had a biopsy it was an invasive aggressive cancer and she went to different doctors and finally saw the big chief of the big hospital in New York City\nWho told her that he could cut it out and what did he do he did the operation that I just described it cut off or ... removed her teeth took a bone from the leg [noise]\nTried to soar all back together again this is six eight weeks ago well she came to see me yesterday and at first she and her daughter were chat chat chat chat chat they didn't realize I don't think the seriousness of what she had\nOr maybe the surgeon downplayed or maybe no one really communicated or maybe she was just nervous\nBut in any case a chat chat chat and then\nFinally I talked about what she had that she had this\nProduct cancer in the deep below that was five centimeters in the past ... called the pathologist and we've got the ... report which is a microscopic exam other cancers show there was deep invasion into tissues that left the product of land\nAnd invaded the soft tissues invaded demand the boat invented the masses are must so\nIt was in blood vessels there was nodules of cancer in the blood vessels the cancer was adjacent to the nerve like we saw the ... the margins where the surgeon caught were positive that means that Dr ... through the cancer and I when I told her that she said oh yeah he told me he was going to cut through and leave the cancer\nAnd I said well why would someone ever cut through the cancer and do this to forming surgery knowing they're going to leave cancer behind how does it help you to leave cancer behind this is the one of the biggest chiefs the biggest head and neck departments and one of the biggest hospitals is super duper pooper scooper\nIn New York City one of the biggest ones in America [noise]\nAnd she was left now a bone taken from her leg the lengths deal has inhale the legs also for went up and wrapped up with a graph from her thigh\nInterfaces and um and she can't eat and the whole left side of her mouth has been removed and the teeth are gone and the ... and then there I didn't close because he caught the facial nerve the facial nervous responsible for moving the parts of the face\nAnd I did and clothes and she was going to go blind to kill the eyes because the eyes needs to be lubricate it by the eyes lid dropping every few seconds that's what we do we blink and that serves a useful function for the ... necessary function so they had to show up her eyes that\nCan eat can smile lost the teeth had the big surgery\nAnd then the same doctor Center for an MRI Center for a number I this week which was done right the day before I saw her and I called up the radiologist and they got the report showing the cancers all ready growing in the sinuses around the brain and the brain area\nThe base of scholar area it's already growing it within weeks of the surgery it's growing\nMassively [noise]\nAnd I explained this all to the family the woman and\nHer husband and daughter explained how serious it is and the woman was sitting there saying I don't want any treatment I don't want any treatment\nAnd I said though that's fine no treatment is is an option obviously every person has that right to say no treatment\nBut I said why would you have gone through all that surgery which was a massive do farming difficult painful irreversible treatment when there are other treatments available like radio surgery pinpoint treatment like our treatment\nTo attack the cancer [noise] now of course I wished that she'd come to us\nBefore that super radical surgery why because we may have been able to show her that the surgery wasn't going to help the doctor the surgeon already knew in advance from the super duper hospital\nHe knew in advance who's going to do a radical surgery that wouldn't cure the cancer he would leave all the cancer most of the cancer behind you know positive margins and within weeks it's all growing back\nWhat good does it do what good is it due to the foreign this woman cut off or left side of her face and closer high in her mouth doesn't work into\nThe phone from her leg on what could and that's why so many people come to Thirteen Eddie for Broadway to understand to get a different perspective on what's going on [noise]\nI don't think anyone ever explain to her all the treatment options I think she thought she was so lucky to see the big chief of the big department of the big super duper hospital\nThat she accepted whatever he said whether it was beneficial to her or not and we know obviously it was not beneficial was never going to be beneficial I had no chance to be beneficial and even told her to go leave cats are behind\nSo why would he proposed that why would he have done a surgery that wasn't going to be beneficial that's going to be for me it was great for him and he benefitted in the hospital benefited and whoever else the nurses ... just benefit\nBut what's good for the patient did he go to medical school to help people or did he go medical school for other reasons I went to medical school to help people and I went to medical schools take a little bit like this and be able to explain what's happened to you and what's going on now what your options are\nNow unfortunately I Wish I could have explained that two months ago to her [noise]\nBut I Do the best I can that's what I Do every day at thirtieth for Broadway Broadway and thirtieth street where we see patients with newly diagnosed cancer or recurrent\nCancers and she already eight weeks later after the surgery after a massive to forming surgery pay weeks later has a recurrent cancer

they removed her breast and she was angry ever after that they cut off or breast and doesn't give her an option\nAnd as you know when I came to New York Ninety seven percent of the women were losing their breast at the big hospitals mastectomies for breast cancer whereas in my practice Ninety percent\nOf women were keeping their breast what a huge difference it was Ninety percent of women in my practice keeping their breasts at the big hospitals Ninety seven percent losing their breasts she was one of those Ninety seven percent and she was angry\nAnd then she developed a kidney cancer and she learned about radio surgery she learn to the radio surgery through a listener like you\nSo that's why I say listeners save lives because she had the kidney cancer or\nKidney doctor wanted to cut

drinking water all the time and meanwhile your water's low\nUh you're gonna that's gonna affect how your body's metabolism is going to work it's going to affect ah your muscle is like the engine of your metabolism\nAnd so if that's not happening um because your body isn't absorbing water properly maybe one of the reasons you can't lose any weight so we put you on that machine will be able to see if that's the situation there so\nI said and J died dot com it's only twenty seven dollars and you can schedule appointment come in and we'll get you're going on the road to health and on the road too\nShopping and different parties yeah [laughter] so I got you beat on that one what what what was your number your number one what three days\nAnd Bruce was sixty days fifty six pounds and succeed\nI got you beat on that one I got I'm yeah I'm a I'm ashamed to say well I'm not ashamed to say I don't really know his first name because he's in Brooklyn officers moment [laughter] and and so and I I Believe that his pictures has the foreign actors actually on our website already a sixty four pounds and sixty days\nOh yeah I Know you're talking about sixty four pounds and sixty days yeah yeah and he took a great profile picture of himself this gentleman is wearing a white shirt and tie and so the profound pictures fantastic so if you guys get a chance definitely go to and J died dot com and take a look at that profile picture sixty four pounds of sixty days is very impressive\nMan and woman it doesn't matter how old you are I mean it really is that um [noise] it's an\nAt an astronomical number in my opinion\nAnd officer Amos I I think something to this effect again I don't know what the patient personally because I don't go to the Brooklyn office but ah you know this is just staggering number and really just the health benefits is a vast officer\nHe's chasing criminals around it but you can do it much easier sixty four comes down I Would\nThink so I definitely I think that's probably a much better situation for them especially in this heat and we've got going on so I asked them\nSo we improved we've we improved\nThe safety of our city this yes that's correct if you can chased on criminal yeah ... yeah ... ... yeah when I went wow ups yeah when when\nOne at a time right so but you know that the pounds a great but I think that um a lot of what we see in our office is really the health benefits of what happened then um\n[noise] you know just losing ten twelve or Fifteen pounds can make such a huge difference in how you feel and\nUm what you are a blood tests are and where your numbers are so we stand who are just um was in and he's on day thirty three of the program he went from two Seventy one to two forty four\nA which is a twenty seven pounds in thirty three days which by the way is not a tremendous number for a man typically you know for a man that um has a lot of weight to lose you know in thirty three days we'll see anywhere probably anywhere between thirty six to forty pounds however and all over town however his\nA health uh results or hit overall uh health um benefits have been ridiculous so his blood pressure is now one of four over sixty four\nWhich I Would say probably a little low [laughter] when I write his cholesterol ah when I'm Down to one oh nine\nFrom from two twenty eight wow so his HDL is at forty six in his LDL is at forty two down from Ninety seven his triglycerides are now a hundred and seven down from two fifty\nEight this is day thirty three of the ... well\nI mean I I Would think well that's basically what his doctor actually said too because I guess he had a doctor's appointment like\nThirty three day and to the program which we usually tell people you know wait until you're done with the program and then go to your primary care physician and kind of do the blood work and all that other stuff but his appointment was already scheduled so he figured he'd go why not write so his primary care I fell off the chair absolutely\nJust blown away he asked him what he was doing he was like I don't understand he's like you were a couple of months ago you know your your numbers were a disaster basically you know and these guys I can understand I so much energy I'm doing this and doing that I feel so good\nAt you know but that that's really what's cool I think right thirty three days in and\nLiterally um he's basically almost off all of his medications trauma or it's tremendous tremendous um so I think that those are the coolest results right and we talk about that in the office you find\nThose to health part of it is the best part and I and we're able to do that because of the personalization of the of the of the system and\nPeople come in with his hair and saliva or we use blood work analysis we use DNA Analysis as well and from saliva and uh we were able to look at you know blood work in a functional level and and then to\nSee what supplements with support people need and and it's so everybody gains weight in different areas for a reason\nThe body is generally trying to protect those areas because of heirs hormone\nA disruption and so you've got the different body types who got to be with the floppy overhanging belly fat or could be an internal issue protruding hard belly fat deliver 'em the day that that ... issue with the apple shape apple shaped generally thyroid every imbalances\nOr the pear shape reproductive imbalances doesn't really matter\nOr it could be a Ninety number of things are and so we're able to\nUse the buyer energetic scans that we use from parents lobby used blood work assessment tool or to see when a functional level to keep to keep a to to keep the body functioning better not so much diagnosing disease\nAnd so then personalize the system personalize the supplements for each individual to help get that one person or into fat burning and unable to\nBasically get people\nInto the secular state of fat burning and then the body starts bouncing self out body starts detox of flying itself\nThe hype and found this which is the uh the main hormone controller and the main thermostat of the body starts resetting itself so when people are done they're not going to put the weight back on because the thermostat as basically re set at a new number just like a house thermostat you punch in Seventy two phases Seventy two\nSo that's what we were able to do the problem is that the reason a lot of times people can't lose any weight\nTheir thermostat is set a two fifty and no matter what they do they're going to say to fifty so then we get them their bodies bouncing good I'm Down to let's say two ten than we set the thermostat a two time you're going to say to tech\nAnd then we give everybody tools going forward as well so if you're going to you know if you if you will give you ten different ways to eat if you're waiting pops up by two or three pounds would tell you how to what to eat that day drops the weight back down so you should never really be above two or three pounds over a year you know day forty or or day sixty earned a program weight\nSo it you know to the system it's personally from the beginning of ... at the end at the end we also use DNA\nTools or we do a DNA test\nAnd so the DNA shows a different eating a types or exercise for each individual a central the need for a central vitamins and minerals or ... different or metabolic factors are assessed so we're looking at over forty different genetic factors\nTo help people not only help keep a blues the weight but also how to keep it off going forward so\nIt's basically all encompassing from beginning to end this personalized to each individual because everybody's going to be a little different camping one\nUh can't be a one or what one thing that fits everybody so it's got to be a little bit different thought one size fits all sir able to switch these things up and get the people get people work and get their bodies work in the right way and then when you lose the weight and bodies bouncing than health problems start to go away as well so\nIt's really uh it's all it's all about getting that weight off it's all about getting healthier\nAnd so the number to call for that is one eight five\nFive five and J\nTwenty five five five six five\nThirty four thirty eight and that's the schedule of free go over the system in one of our local five locations and in Europe tri state area\nOr the best way to do it I think is to go on line and you go to and jade diet dot com and that's normally Ninety nine dollars for only for only twenty seven dollars right now you can come in and we'll do a body company an appointment with us a body composition and now since we're going to look at not just wait\nHow we can look at body fat percentage were going to look at body water percentage were going to look at your ... your your metabolic age so you were going to look at your basic metabolic rate and how much your and your daily caloric intake so those two numbers needs to be close to each other\nFor you to be able to lose weight we've got people routinely coming in and they're burning off let's say two thousand calories a day but their bodies function which are taken in three thousand calories a day and they're only eating Fifteen hundred calories a day and they can't figure out why they can't lose any weight because at the end of the day you stole all calories\nSo once we get the body work in the right way to get your metabolism reset a little bit than you\nYou know plus or reading on the program so losing one pound to lose ... pounds thirty five hundred calories we routinely see people losing a pound a day plus or eat it so we are talking about the body burning anywhere from four thousand\nAround four thousand calories a day minimally\nA ... to to to lose the weight uh so you're not you we re route where your body's basically using for fuel your body's just using your own toxic fat for fuel so to\nTo get that done it said five five five and Jay diet won eight five five five six five thirty four thirty eight or that's ... to schedule an appointment or for free\nGo over one of our officers now when you're calling and you're talking to the folks at the at the call center there they're just an appointment they're set appointments right so they don't have all the answers to your questions I can guarantee that uh that's why we were moving all the ... just come in and get a check up get a get a check up and all that\nUh and so just don't get mad at those people were people yelling at the time all the time uh and so just come in and\nAnd and uh and the U.S there and uh but you can also go on line A N J died dot com and that's for only twenty seven dollars normally signing nine dollars only twenty seven dollars or you can um come into the office\nWill do an appointment with one of ... with one of us are you also will do a body composition analysis will take a look at your weight will take a look your body fat percentage your body what percentage of visceral fat writing your metabolic cage or basic metabolic rate daily caloric intake we're looking at a bunch of different things\nA body of water so important that should be closer sixty percent\nOr if you're in the forties you can't lose weight and you're wondering why and you're walking around with a bottle of water all the time you're drinking a hundred ounces of water and you still can't lose weight\nI guarantee your body isn't absorbing it the right way you have a mineral or electric light imbalance we see these imbalances with things like yo yo dieting you'll see it with digestive issues or you'll see it with certain medications like directs that are used to control blood pressure or because you're overweight\nOr you'll see it with a with a an acid medications a lot of times you'll see it a lot of times with the antidepressant medications it's one of the reasons they cause weight gain or and so\nYou know that might be one of the reasons you're having a problem so we take a look at that and then we can personalize the program for you and you could still lose that twenty to forty pounds more than likely you are not going to need the blood pressure medications and some of the other medications as well so we see this all the time we've seen people come off of all types of different things so there's no limit\nTo what the body can do when you get it working helpfully ... body is a is a wonderful healing organism sometimes it's just has some a lot of barriers that it can't overcome on its own it just needs a little bit of push it needs to a few dominoes to be kind of tilted in knocked down and then the body will do everything on its own after that so\nUh starts and end with the customers Asian the personalization of the of the program the ... scans\nA parent's live a sample for that or blood work functional ... assessment a DNA testing or that shows us over forty different metabolic factors that we assessed ah to help you use the tools going like a blueprint going forward on how to not only keep laid off but also had a stays healthy as possible so\nReal easy and J died dot com or when a five five five A N J diet or I wanted\nTo tell you about a Sondra are we talking about sleep I guess sleep\nWith some some started a lot of people coming in with will sleeping issues and you know I Wonder why people are walking around with trouble to triple ... lattes well sleep it off he's from God Knows where\nHe just sleep deprivation causes sleep deprivation and having like a to take our stomach you know I Know and that was uncomfortable and one of the most awful thing you can ...\nYeah but like so people are coming in I guess they ... they're sleeping and you know they don't tell them necessarily some sleeping issues it when they come in but\nUh you know when they come when they're done with the price what's cool about the program like people come in and they're very they're they're very very skeptical but they are even going to lose weight and then they stop focusing on the waiting to start thinking about how their health is improving a center came in a thirty nine year old female\nOr she lost ... severe sleeping issues she was she was a having a lot of getting up trouble falling asleep trouble staying asleep waking up early tossing and turning just having a ton of issues sleeping\nA and a lot of times it's a neutrino adrenal issue with cortisol levels and and things like that and you know the quarter solo so important uh they're supposed to you know they're supposed to cortisol as grades it's a\nIt's produced by the adrenal glands and and so it's supposed to during the day help you burn fat and the night help you sleep and if your adrenal exhaustion issues a lot of times you'll see the opposite you can't lose you can't burn fat and you can't sleep\nOr and so she came and she lost a twenty four pounds in forty days so you know ... you know great usually see twenty five to to thirty five with women so she was just a little bit on to that but what's great about it is that she ... she says that after the first seven to ten days at a program she's basically been sleeping like a rock\nFalling asleep eleven o'clock she goes to bed will on weight syrup at seven she says she doesn't even realize she's asleep anymore she's just kind of goes to bed wakes up boom rich already started day\nRested feeling great no crashes in the three o'clock in the in the afternoon and much less need for coffee in the afternoon which is great which is going to help her sleep say see when you get this thing going in one direction it's going to stay going in one direction [noise] I'm\nTwenty four pounds sleep in like a rock she came in we did the hair and saliva sample or a ... blood work functional assessment we gave her a hormone support type of family support we also gave her dream of support um got they got the body work in the right way and uh now we've got the results that we say\nIt's not surprising either right around that age right around the age of thirty nine forty I hear more and more of that ad right between the ages of like thirty nine and forty one\nI'm a lot of things change in the women's um body yeah ... and cycle right and so it's really\nIt's interesting that every ten years right it's kind of way ... so I think that it's interesting that um you know you brought that up a speaking of at the health benefits so we've had this happen a bunch of times in our office but this just recently happened again\nUh Michelle I'm who am I Believe she's in her mid thirties and she lost eighty pounds she did to round yeah I mean really really a lot of weight eighty ... eighty pounds well what happened was and she had some trouble getting pregnant with her first child and so get a lot of\nYou know um hormone therapy type staff and ... and ... and\nAt ... and all these other things and all of these drugs are really am known for and they'll put on weight I'll put that tell us a ton of weight on yam white him and really just create all sorts of floating in the body and um all sorts of very unpleasant things but you know she got a baby out of it which is really a great positive because of that\nAnd she had gained not only a bunch of weight before she got pregnant but also while she was pregnant and then\nAfterwards really hard hard time taking it off so then she tried to get pregnant again and again more hormones and more and you know are these procedures and unfortunately her second time was not as successful as her first\nBut she was about eighty pounds heavier than she had started out before so she came to us she did to a forty days around which basically means she went pound for pound and both of them um and\nAnd you know ... it's common because this was not her regular weight right this was wait put on with our mind right so that's why she went pound for pound because nobody really needed it really needed to get rid of all it's great\nFor pound for pound a pound a day for a man is impressive pound for pound ... pounds a day for a woman is absolute\n... we had a number of nearly ... ... so anyway so she\nComes and she comes and um and she says she goes you guys wouldn't believe she came in for ... saliva test I'm just one after the program and she says you wouldn't believe what I have to tell you she says I'm pregnant oh no hormones great now at\n... no ... no nothing on she says I guess my body got rid of all the talk sense of all the extra hormones I dropped all this weight she says\nAnd now it's a really great story but you know we've had this happen at you know how many times I Would say yeah half a dozen two dozen times where um you know but she by the way completely didn't expect that I mean her her her and her husband\nFully like just you know\nWe're settled with one child and happy and the baby healthy and so\nNow she's about to have a second one and she says I Can't believe I'm going to have to lose weight again but you know what I think it's going to happen to be honest with\nYou is probably ... now they're not exactly regulator bodies more regularly or probably gain she'll probably ... has\nNot gained a ton of layer already and she even said that with that with the first baby she had gained so much during the first couple of weeks and kept gaining and she said with this one she feels completely different she feels so much healthier and really\nFeels good not as much knowledge that during the ... really she says it's just a whole different experience for her she feels like herself and it's really great and congratulations to her and uh you know looking forward to meeting that healthy baby\nYeah that's that's awesome we had a chill off so I had a somebody came in was telling me the same thing uh Joe came in and she's thirty two years old she hasn't had a a regular cycle in years she says it was she would come and go heavy bleeding\nFor days on end and it wouldn't than a it would go for weeks than it would stop for months and completely inconsistent\nAh and she came in and I'm similar situation you know she said that it it then the ... cycle totally stopped\nThat's true I'm Shauna came in and she was down ... shot at it or to the program she kind of did it in a weird way she looked at it for thirty days than she had a two week vacation\nSo she did the program for thirty days stop the program two weeks short before a vacation to get her little ... to get the ... couple of days and then she came back in and to and she did another twenty days of the programs to set a total of fifty days are and what should the cool\nThing is she was away so she stopped the programs for thirty days or lost a bunch of weight\nLoss of twenty five or thirty pounds or something like that in ... in the thirty days went away on vacation for for ten to fourteen days and days and put any of the weight back on all while on vacation which is awesome and then she came back and did another Twenty one days of the program so basically she had fifty days at a program\nAnd lost so fifty six pounds total in the fifty days\nThat's pretty impressive yeah that's great to vacation in ... in the middle said you must you must have customize that one for her\nBut yeah we have to add a little added ... so she had a she says you know she had a vacation plans she had been away and look I'm not going to tell somebody not to go on vacation so we just customized before we played with it a little bit did it the right way um and what's great is she no more thyroid meds\nAre no more no more sugar medications a siren levels are normal so she doesn't need that Geneva Farid medications anymore uh and when she came in we we were able to do we did the hair on saliva by energetic scans\nGave her a hormone support gave her the pirates support she needed tankers support also\nAnd she lost she lost that way or the DNA we're going to do the DNA is going to be used also to help keep the weight off to keep her ... to keep her as as healthy as possible uh and you know when your thyroid ... you know is really important when you're talking about people that are coming in LA Times with mineral imbalances in and things like that\nUh that affects the thyroid a lot the thyroid really that I dont gotta get bind with sodium to get into the cells of the thyroid a teach for each to even work so that's why you know if people have a sluggish thyroid a lotta times you'll see weight gain and the problem might not even be with the thyroid problem might be but the fact that your body's not is has a mineral imbalance and the and the uh\nThe the the I dye may not be with you get into the cello the thyroid gland so you know that conversion the tea forty three is really get that that that sort of the the gas pedal to the metabolism so to speak and if that's not happened the right way so if you're if you're having a hard time losing weight you have a mineral imbalance unlock trade imbalance\nA meeting your body isn't absorbing water properly before because of that you'll be affected on the weight loss ... end of it and now if you're if let's say the thyroid if you've got thyroid issues\nAnd you're not be able to lose way a lot of times we'll see the thyroid not being able to get to even the chemicals the minerals into the thyroid to get the the whole process going so that'll slow it down also so it's all important your body is just a\n... an amazing amazing mechanism but unfortunately here and there will see\nA few issues come up a few imbalances come up and that's all it takes really is a few imbalances in getting it going the wrong way and you're going to stay going the right or wrong way and then\nConversely speaking you get it moving the right way it's just the body heal so great on its own then once you get it here on the right way uh you're going to be able to keep it going that way and and and get on the road to help them stay on the road health so\nReally the one eight five five five and Jay diet a one eight five five five six five thirty four three thirty eight that the schedule a free go over in one of our

thirties um you know he ... he was having some issues\nYou know he had that typical like a belly fat going on a he was on um\nHe was put on a med foreman already uh unfortunately hold up early thirties um and so the sugar yet I buy the sugar yeah for the sugar exactly and he was not diabetic get you know it was just like a\n... pre diabetic ... diabetic I'm so twenty three days twenty points six pounds down alright everybody ready body fat percentage down in twenty three days from thirty percent or twenty six grade muscle mass went from twenty percent to thirty percent\nCool water went from fifty six percent to fifty nine percent which the ideal numbers at sixty and his blood sugar used to be a hundred and Seventy in the mornings which is why his doctor put him on met foreman clearly\nThe empty stopped his medications because now he's at Ninety two every morning correct those are pretty cool numbers right early thirties this guy is\nI cannot imagine and about what the body to come into the body fat went from thirty percent or twenty six percent\nTremendous tremendous writers were twenty three days or ... right so you're he basically replace ... percent about what was right body fat he replaced it with two percent body mass and a muscle mass excuse me and a two percent or more than two percent water so\nReally that's exactly how those numbers it's supposed to work\nThat's exactly what it is yeah the muscle weighs more than fat that also has more water in it uh and so when you get rid of the fat race are you taking the fat out replacing it with water and

shouldn't have either one shed a rectal cancer and it's so dangerous when the doctor tells a person what they have without making an informed statement about that\nAnd we've seen it time and again just because the average thirty or woman does know rectal cancer doesn't mean that everyone has hemorrhage or everyone has fishers that is why it's so important that if you have bleeding or symptoms

are back I just want to talk about this ongoing scandal because we so often talk about the big hospitals and how it's so different than our cancer treatment center where we work for the patient there's been a big scandal over the last month has been ongoing and with a chief medical officer was pushed out\nIt was a man making a million and a half hours of one of the biggest hospitals have been the hat and why was he pushed out what wasn't because he was on six other boards getting three million dollars when Dr works for the hospital it gets a million and a half dollars you'd think that his responsibilities would be for the hospital\nBut then he's on the boards of profit making companies so when you're on the board that means you're supervising the company and that means that you are destined\nTo see that that company makes money or your financially responsible for its losses so someone sits on the board doesn't just got a big paycheck\nBut he or she has responsibilities to make sure it's profitable so what do you do with a doctor is making a million dollars in one of the big hospitals in New York and he sits on the boards making millions more\nAnd ease your doctor and let's say you write some medical articles and suddenly someone finds out\nThat at all his medical not all but Ninety percent of the medical articles he doesn't right that he has a conflict of interest that he's writing about a topic that he has a financial interest in\nLet's just say he's writing about drug acts and he says how fantastic drug acts is well that's one thing if he says well he's a big shot in the big hospital you must be true and honest but it's different if he says drug access so fantastic\nAnd then you know these getting paid by the company that makes drug acts and if you're a patient going over there to a big super duper hospital wouldn't you like to know if your doctor is on the board getting kickbacks from the company that makes drug acts before he recommends drug acts\nAnd that the same doctor started speaking about drug acts to his peers to other colleagues other doctors about how fantastic this drug act's was\nThe same day that there's a big company canceled drug acts because the day there was so disappointing\nSo how would you explain to the doctor saying how great the drug was to his colleagues when he himself knew the drug was a disappointment\nHimself must have known the company was pulling the carpet pulling the plug on this drug because he was on the board of the company it was on the board of the company was promoting the drug even though he's supposed to be a doctor taking care of human beings\nHow can you do all three things how can they take care of the chair and take care of you was getting paid a million dollars from the hospital probably ... wanting the responsibility and promotion of the hospital and\nThen these on six different boards getting money millions of dollars from those companies so where's this loyalty to the companies who are paying them billions of dollars to the hospital is paying them a million dollars on giving them a huge position he's in charge of the medical care and all the hospital\nOr to you the patient and it was a big scandal and he was forced out because he deceived other doctors he did not tell other doctors that he was getting this money\nFrom the companies and then it turned out to be a whole scandal in the hospital do including this week the chief executive what are the biggest hospitals is resigning is seat on the board of two other drug companies this is the chief executive is making\nSix point seven million\nHours a year so we often talk about the crisis of these companies and these hospitals and [noise]\nHow chemotherapy is so expensive and we talk about so many people getting chemotherapy even if it's not helping them\nAnd I keep on questioning why do so many patients get chemotherapy if Assad helping them there's cat scans to show the cancers growing\nThe patient serving toxicity the pains in the hands of pet and feed the low blood counts hair laws\nAnd the doctors keep on pushing came over here with us and work and then you see well the ... head of the hospitals getting six point seven million dollars\nPlus he's getting millions from other companies where's the loyalty and these are supposed to be for charity facilities for charity facilities well it'd be for charity ... facilities where the\nPresident's making six point seven million the chief medical doctors make you laugh million dollars doesn't sound like charity to me those dogs any charity charities they don't pay taxes I'm like you and me\nThey don't pay taxes these hospitals don't pay taxes when I buy a piece of equipment I pay tax on a sales tax for it I don't know tax exempt status like these charity hospitals\nThat are making millions and billions of dollars and pay their president six point seven million dollars what is it why is that why are they able to get off with this of looking trying to look for holier than thou\nWith their doctors are giving billions getting money from companies kickbacks about telling people not telling you or me or others that they're working on the boards that they have conflicts that they're taking billions of dollars from these companies to me I think it is quite a fiasco\nAnd one doctor another one who was just discovered this week course on thirty one boards that in the hospital one of the New York hospital so I'm thirty one boards didn't tell anyone about the boards and then he said well\nI Apologize for the inconvenience no\nThey should be

got to investigate that it's just so on and on everybody that I talked to about it's the first thing I says about the nature you've got to get on it it will save yet\nI just can't [noise] can Dr Howard enough he's brilliant\nWelcome back to our show we just heard our top success stories of the week and I want to invite anyone listening that also has a success story to share it with us by going online to balance of nature dot com or by calling in at eight hundred two four six\nEight seven five one that's eight hundred two four six eighty seven fifty one\nNext we'll listen to an interview that I had was Dr Douglas Howard the founder and formulate or of balance of nature [noise] this is a conversation you don't want to miss as we discuss a variety of important issues related to health I Want you to ask yourself\nHow can better nutrition improve my life\nHe's a doctor of chiropractic he's also director of Medicine He's a leading researcher insight on nutrition he's a good friend and he's the man who created the product that has changed my family's life and so many others\nDr Douglas Howard a balance of nature hello how you it's great to be here again it's wonderful and I'm also so very glad\nTo introduce the very original health coach of balance of nature a a a wonderful title because it's something that's so unique to this company will be getting into that as Well hi Suzy Hi Laura good to be back it's great to hear your voice it's become quite familiar to\nPeople all over the country in terms of uh encouraging people to take their fruits and veggies everyday\nDr Howard this is really revolutionary and yet it seems like the most simple concept in the entire world where did you come up with putting fruits or vegetables into a capsule and why\n... actually years years of study you know it's interesting other companies now are starting to think they can catch a fad we're not a fad\nOr something that for many years of study and research and figuring out how to do this has made it happened and I always ... me when I hear other companies now they're starting to say oh we have more fruits and veggies in ours and blah blah blah we have fifty instead of thirty one and I'm like\nThey don't get it is not how many per se it's how they interact with each other and we're not just a business it's trying to get on the shelf and convince people were about results\nAnd that's why we offer like you said at the health coaching for example that's why we offer that is to help people accelerate the results there's no extra fees there's no extra charge for it infects business management companies have said oh you need to get rid of that department it just costs you money no that is what we are about results\nSo people say to me often oh I take vitamins um I don't think I Need to take a balance of nature because I keep I I'm such an advocate now because I've seen and I'm One of those that actually feels the difference when I don't take my balance of nature I Am so sluggish and\nFuzzy and when I take it and this is literally on a daily basis I can literally feel my body pick up at my my thinking gets clearer me so I'm One of those people and I my parents are as well because they tell me about that fact but when people say to me\nOh no I take vitamins I don't need to take balance of nature I'm telling them you you need tend to eleven servings of fruits and vegetables per day and they're most potent and nutritious like Ninety nine point nine hundred percent of ... like a raw vegetable almost\nAre you getting that a and B\nThey are not a vitamin and in fact you can it's just not true Dr Howard you can forego some of those multi vitamins big companies put out here and just substitute it with nothing but the fruits and vegetables is that correct\nYes in fact I'm going to reverse a little bit you you don't you don't substitute vitamins just they're they're all of its there plus hundreds of thousands of other chemicals that buffer and assist those chemicals to make them work hundred fold and that's what's important about it\nWhat the reason people take vitamins is because they know that their diet is substandard\nIf they were sitting down every day and eating more than ten servings and in variety of thirty one different fruits and vegetables do you think they would even think about taking vitamins no I think they would though because that's why I'm already marketed as\nTrue and let me tell you every time you extract a chemical or every time you you consume an isolated chemical there is a side effect is one of the first things you're you're taught and pharmacology in medical school is there's a side effect every chemical\nBut in a fruit and vegetables and fruit or vegetable then there's hundreds of thousands of chemicals that counteract those negative side effects consistently and there is a side effect fruits and vegetables\nGood help [laughter] yeah so a lot of the so called lifestyle diseases I've I've heard you mentioned before and I've read on your literature that ... a lot of the life\nStyle diseases that we know today can be prevented from the taking of the fruits and veggies on a daily basis how and why is this\nWhat I Want to go back to one of the thing really fast is because sometimes on on the vitamin aspect sometimes there's even a point where we're help coach will be working with somebody and they just aren't giving the progress that they would like to be happening and then they find out the person is taking\nA whole bunch of vitamins on top of it the somehow they missed that hopefully not but [noise]\nAnd then we'll talk to them and say you know what let's start taking off some of this other chemistry so the ... the chemistry from real fruits and vegetables can start doing its job and they start seeing the results that were really wanting to to progress with\nThe reason being is the chemistry from the fruits and vegetables has to go in and counteract some of the chemistry that they're\nUsing the ... the extracts and so they have to use some of the chemistry from the fruits and vegetables to counteract some of the effects of those vitamins that aren't necessary in the body so it actually most of the time works better without that no there's not a danger you can continue to take your vitamins if you want\nBut frequently and most of the time to get a better result if you drop the multi vitamin\nAnd I just asked myself as see which one smarter guard or a scientist ...\nFor those that are just tuning in I'm Talking with Dr Douglas Howard the formulate or of balance of nature's fruits and veggies and fiber in size\nAnd I'm just amazed at what it is doing not only for me personally and my family but for so many others before we continue we're going to take a short break but before we do that\nLet me make sure I give the phone number so that you can receive a special discount on your very first order of balance of nature the number to call is one eight hundred two four six eight\nSeven five one that's eight hundred two four six eight seven five one or do on line to balance of nature dot com don't go away
