Connecticut has been losing people in fact they've lost billions of dollars of new revenue now or\nIf they had grown as the rest of the country the last eight years they wouldn't have a deficit they wouldn't have these problems and ... being an outsider to businessman has a plan that art Laffer and Larry Kudlow helped and devise to cut taxes to grow the economy against to bring jobs in a jobs and people back to Connecticut and or\nThe Democrats will say and do anything\nThat running is that that we're going to eliminate schools and close every emergency room in the state it's unbelievable that petrified that Bob's got to beat them and they should be because Bob Bob Bob and ... are in a statistical tie right now and they got a clear choice between\nBob stuff and ask is going to cut taxes and yet ... who's going to raise taxes he's one of these progressive liberals I just think you can keep raising taxes all the time\nYou're stepping out of the key is the guy you want to vote for however a lot of these Connecticut the experts told me even if you win in Connecticut you might not win you know what I mean the votes for\nBritain order can't find them for two days that kinda stuff\nAll that happened that have an eight years ago that to a fully what he ran the sentiment\nManufacture so we got to avoid a close election every if you're attacked spirit Connecticut and you don't want to pay any more taxes he needs to get out and vote and not leaving in question you've got to vote for Bob stuff and ... and he's on a Republican ended independent party line he's on two lines yeah\nSo uh so you can vote for money to line and ah but it's the only chance they have of stop and tax increases because with ... you're going to get more of the same which I had over the last eight years which has\nBeen a disaster hey what about the Florida they got a governor up against this crazy socialist guy but what's going to head writer\nWell right now it's very close and I tell you one of the things that I'm concerned about because we have a lot of candidates in Florida that we worked for a down there [noise] uh but uh the panhandle Trump\nRemember on election day people were saying we're going to lose in Florida and when when they started counting the votes were down fifty thousand and I I remember telling the people in the Trump campaign tell them banning and Kelly in and the rest of Jared I said don't worry the panhandle closes in an hour when the panhandle closes we will go up\nAnd because we are going to win the pan handle two to one so the panhandle about six percent of the typical vote\nAnd Republicans usually went to the ones who get four points to boys all the polls have Rick Scott the U.S Senate candidate dead even they have they have ah the governor's race dead even for descendants and yellow but there's a hundred thousand people still without power household still without power in the pan handle\nThose around voters they're not they're so ... you know the president has done a great job marshalling federal resources to go to\nThe panhandle and to south Georgia where the hurricane hit [noise] uh but uh we really need to make sure that that those people are taking care of I've been telling my friends in the White House the president needs to go back and visit the panhandle and make sure that progress is happening because that could determine the statewide outcome\nWe're talking about right now we're determined ... extending the vote for like a week in the panhandle just so they could get back and vote\nBy they probably could I Hope I Hope they could do some you know if it was a Democrat that extend it for a month [laughter] but ah [laughter] says you know they they'd try that or what they did in two thousand when they said like you know like I worked for for CBS Radio\nAre doing their election I stuffed in two thousand and myself in a Democrat Jeff guarantee that we can't make calls to close Dan Rather went out and called for Gore\nOff [laughter] so uh I went home really got a few seconds left what about Menendez of New Jersey could he be beaten\nYes he's in big trouble I mean he is really a doozy has among Democrats for them I Do a lot of work in Hudson County and he's from originally from Union City but then he moved to Hoboken moved around a there is no enthusiasm for him and he's got a big problem has the Democrats are all\nYou know I I've seen polls in New Jersey where any targeting one Grasso racist losing\nI hate to say we're out of time but what ... what's your website McLaughlin online\nMcLaughlin online dot com\nCheck it out and vote for ...

O. R.\nRated number one seven\nDaily video evidence of this invasion and what it looks like this is what got Donald Trump elected this is what propelled Republicans to victory in two thousand sixteen\nMuch is the Washington establishment would like to deny it much as they would like to change it it is still the issue that keeps Donald Trump in the forefront of his supporters minds so I've been studying the media to try to get a handle on who actually might be behind this\nAnd here's what I found today CNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent may okay even if it's just sixty percent of their time on your shoulder you better not focusing on the care of him\nThat tells me\nIf the caravan wore a Democrat idea designed to embarrass Trump that they would be covering it and building it up and with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories there'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is\nAre they just want to come to America and that may yet happen down the road but CNN is ...\nIt was not wall to wall but they are predominantly\nFocusing on the show Gabe\nAnd of course whatever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's look and see wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid terms with the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this\nIs happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hint hint it never was going to happen I don't think anybody's ever known weather's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was that the media narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born of any evidence that couldn't be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the election hasn't happened yet\nEverybody wants to rely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand sixteen and the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put sort of things in perspective on this\nAgain the way to look at it is is as a a\nMicrocosm of what's happening every day at our border every day this is what's happening\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what's been going on for decades and it needs\nTo stop and Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf there are behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\n\nAnd blaming that on Trump maybe what they're hoping is a Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard down but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated families the border and how Trump didn't all white that narrative and didn't want it to last and so he did what he couldn't to change it I\nI Do know this\nDespite everything that you think you would know the common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans at look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs elected still there are so you're about peace yes they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject of illegal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that led the ... they're not publicly saying this but I Know that there\nMay be the Democratic gamut is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not going to do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya if Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what did you think that wouldn't do the Trump\nThere's one issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his do voters beginning to\nI don't no doubt is the right word but they would be my only disappointing particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this caravan is not going to\nGet it if if if if some\nRepublicans are behind this than than it is obvious uh but I just somebody has to be\n\nSomebody has to be making this happen folks we're talking with we we've got how many two thousand miles\nStop and think of this from Honduras to the southern\nBorder of the United states assistance and Arizona is around two thousand miles\nSeven thousand people one day\nJust decided to start walking to the United states\nTwo thousand miles\nI also think if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and if you want to start trying to analyze will what could their politics in this be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role in transportation\nBut there has to be political involvement here too because the money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this\nSo you've got seven thousand people who all of a sudden and decide all of a sudden because nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word of it\nSeven thousand people decide to start walking to a thousand miles we don't see\nPictures of of of where they're using the bathroom we don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it\nI mean look at random video you might you might see some people really think of I mean we don't see how this is being handled we don't see the port a potties we don't see and are they just urinating and rivers and streams and what would the environmentalist wackos think about that if that's happening\n\nWell it [noise] I guess you you may have a point welcome to San Francisco they could already be accustomed to it especially they definitely ... in the street I mean it got maps in San Francisco for the tourists come and boy the piles of human feces\n\nSo how long would it take to walk two thousand miles how long would it take\nRemember they're vowing to get her I just hit the southern border of Mexico they're vowing to get here by mid term election day\nSo I don't walk enough to know how many\nMiles a day you could walk if you just start walking and you take a periodic break and after twelve or Eighteen or whatever you stop or slow down and rest for the next day\nThat people tell me that they would have to be walking something like twenty miles a day\nFor one hundred days I mean if that makes sense to a thousand miles twenty miles a day for a hundred days without any rest a hundred days for those will be on the Rio Olympics that's over for three months\n[noise] and the objective is to show up\nRight as the polls open on mid term election day [noise] so if they had been walking for what two and a half months\nHave we seen video of the walk and it's beginning\nRemember the caravan was originally thirty five hundred or four thousand people now it's swollen just seven thousand and the word is it may become ten thousand [noise]\nAnd then of course ah ladies and gentlemen the caravan now has been joined by a second the caravan than we are just hearing about Fox News ... ... S P report that the second the\nCaravan of illegal immigrants has formed in Honduras and has already crossed into Guatemala\nThey're hoping they catch up to the main group\nAs the massive migrating

political motivations of some organizers of the care of it by the way the [noise]\nThe details on that story are from the uh oh here's one from NBC and they are literally outraged over what ... saying sectarian saint palm pale raised the stakes last night as thousands of Central American migrants invaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into may go claiming they were inciting violence pump pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated leaders\nHow was it raising the stakes\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how was it raising mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media in a party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative about these invaders\nRight mind would want this who in their\nRight mind would want any of this illegal immigration who in their right mind would promote this wants this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the boarder who in the world wouldn't want that and why\n\nIt makes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for America\nWhat every bit motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo\nGoes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake once cakes\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and four of you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intended across the border illegally they're all criminals but in the world is so damn hard to understand about this [noise]\nI think it's a classic illustration of how soft this country is getting and one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything\nTo the young who haven't lived long enough to know what's best are being driven solely by emotion govern solely by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because of some odd quirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to help them benefits from the wisdom that comes from having lived a bunch of life and having amassed a bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\n\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just to raise the border and said to the world come on in\nBecause that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democrat Party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket than there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democrat Party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who think that because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want almost as an entitlement\nWe'll political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning\nAny thing in the next elections there is not a single reason to vote for these people under any breakup commonsense\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting it defies common sense\nImagine

impartial soundbite and made to make it look like I was trying to make the case of a shell game\nDeserve to get killed because he was an ally of Osama bin Laden I never said any such thing I said that in fact the exact opposite so yeah yeah\nA lot of people worked up about that here on the other side of the glass I'm going to get to it or in due course same thing on this transgender business the Trump Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert by again bill hammer\nOutward concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned\nAbout this ... saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people trying to force their way\nAnd it's called an invasion and thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like this but I don't know our constitution that Governor thing call out military troops to stop an invasion\nAnd I've heard people on TV so called experts say where you can use the military because a positive comments out of ... that normally prevents military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military does stopping invasion from another country so there's nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president doing what we do a Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces their way and\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it\nYou know you you you he may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman Gohmert says there but there's no law says he can't\nThis is what is one of seven thousand Russians were about to force their way into the okay what uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their wife or the southern border\nTo try to affect the mid term elections what if we can make that case what do you think people will be demanding Trump do stand aside and let the seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks at the junk you never know who's listening\nI'm just asking you what if it's seven thousand Russian communists think always trying to get in an\nInvasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all doing good\nAnd I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump\nBecause of the optics are I don't care if you're militarized is the border if they bomb rushed the border like down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back in the emergency session and doing national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or do what pass legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that short\nI mean you you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the obstacle that if Trump soon as a military down and he started cracking the heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is whether people playing this thing\nExactly and that's where it can try to deal with this on his own she leads to put everybody else or but on the line and get them on tape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer\nAnd Pelosi stand up for letting these people in any way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a it's a dangerous situation but it is in a whole lot of different ways will be back my friends that we will continue as we always\nHave to get off\nTo Russia by be Mitt work\nWho do you

midterms in the blue way about how it's looking less and less likely and more and more toss up up for grabs as Republicans strength is surging in places that it was not seen earlier\nAnd this is shocked and surprised the drive by and their polling handle is that I'm here to tell you again I don't believe this I don't believe this is the way\nThings have many can\nYou know for individual voter to individual voter but when you're talking about blocks of voters it just doesn't make sense that the vast majority of people back in December we're we're all intending to get rid of every Republican make could cause they have a Trump made a mistake voted for Trump knew it\nAnd then nine months later changed their minds but this is what they ask us to believe and that's why I Do this polling nine

thousand\nPeople are\nLining up twenty four hours in advance of folks a little common sense and this is Texas and remember to drive by she told us that Beto O'Rourke was\nThe answer to me in the origin rock rib conservative Ted Cruz Beto O'Rourke\nHe's love by everybody outside Texas thirty eight million dollars he raised in a quarter except there's a problem and that is it Ted Cruz has been creeping ahead in even in the polling data and it's it's being acknowledged by the Democrats that that it is real\nAnd yet they have continued to maintain that Beto O'Rourke gonna be the guy\nIt can take a Ted Cruz has anybody found a hundred thousand people trying to get into a Beto O'Rourke event\nYou have a venue that whole Seventeen thousand people you have anywhere between Seventy five thousand in a hundred thousand people who want to get in\nThat is not the kind of thing that happens with the ... a political party that is losing losing favor losing support losing elections every where Trump goes these rallies\nYou know I'm not opposed this Rush Limbaugh dot com I have some friends\nAre out in a in the Phoenix area\nAnd if the Trump rally in Mesa, Arizona they thought about going into it until they got there and found out how impossible it would be\nThey sent me a video that they took their iPhone tennis max\nDriving along the entire a line in order to make the video fit\nTo be in a size they could email it to me they had to run it at twice normal speed and it's still thirty five seconds long it never ends and then there's a note this is that this doesn't even\nShow the people ... through the parking lots to get in there was a mile long line\nOf people to get him to see Trump in Mesa, Arizona the media is not reporting this aspect of the Trump rallies\nThe media is not telling you how many people want to get in are trying to get in how many people are showing up and standing in line because if they did local media may I don't know national media CNN PMS NBC ABC NBC CBS are not showing this because if they did\nIt would put the lie to the notion of the all the energy is on the Democratic side meanwhile there's not a single Democrat drawing anywhere near\nThese kinds of ... these ... these kinds of people what the Democrats are doing is continuing to show up where Republicans are having dinner and harassed\nThe turtle and his wife or in a restaurant in Louisville, Kentucky and some mad cap asinine\nProtesters shows up and just start shouting things a turtle just sits there doesn't acknowledge him doesn't move doesn't say anything\nThe other patrons in the restaurant or just watching all this go by but this guy's making a spectacle and I watched him talk about this on Fox today\nAnd they were talking about such a weight loss of loyalty and so forth and this isn't this isn't about civility this is about what I brought up three weeks ago this is not how decent people behave\nAnd I said decent people don't know how to deal with this kind of in a decent seat which is what we're up against the on the Democratic side whatever you want to call a lack of civility in decency whatever it is it is not the things you associate with winning\nIt's not the kind of behavior you associate with good times good vibes\nPositive outlook these are people enraged and angry disappointed depressed what have you\n\n... the contrast here is striking and that's why you do not see any news coverage of the size of let me tell you something\nThe ... the number of people the size of crowds to get into a Donald Trump rally\nIs ten times the size of this mob\nThat is invading the country currently coming up through Mexico you've seen those pictures of the media is happy to show your those pictures\nThe media can't wait to show you this so called caravan of seven thousand people soon to be a thousand people and they claim might end up being ten thousand they'll show your pictures those people all day well here's what you need to do when you see that\nPicture a seven thousand people or what is said to be seven thousand people multiply that times can that's the number of people trying to get into a Donald Trump rally in Mesa, Arizona and even more than that at a rally in Texas\n\nI Wish they'd use AT and T. stadium it's Jerry Jones palace where the cowboys play\nPut a hundred thousand people in there\nSo you think that Democrats can get together a mob of seven thousand people have march jumped through Mexico mad walk out there you are those people are really and we're supposed to sympathize with it they don't show you the thousands\nUpon thousands standing outside lining up twenty four hours in advance to get into a Donald Trump rally and I'm telling you that kind of thing does not happen to people losing elections were about to lose elections who are losing favor with the American people it does not happen\nNow available in stores everywhere they have not been evaluated by the FBI this product is not intended to treat to prevent any disease\n[noise]\n\nOkay\nBack to the phones we go to a certain voting\nIn Macon Georgia great to have you with us on E R B network Hi thanks for having me on Russia appreciate you about well it's great to have you here\nHe thinks the reason why I called it with a lot of years and military are retired from the range than older we are very good a lot of things we're not good\nAt basically civilian type a non lethal warfare we've gotten much better at it since Afghanistan and Iraq started but that is one thing throughout the years we not be good at so this situation and look I'm I'm One hundred percent for putting a military all the war but this one's perils and we have to be careful\nWell\nWhen when you said the military is not prepared for an invasion you're talking about this is not a military invasion of talking about a a human way of uh invasion of people that are largely are going to be thought of is starving thirsty poverty stricken this kind of think simply demanding\nLife what am I gotta let it play\nIn the military is not used to standing up to people like that certainly not inflict thing and yeah and the harm on them is that what you're saying\nI think the difference is you know when it comes to ... we're very good at that when it comes to less lethal we that's just not something we do that well we are the individual what you're sort of very good at it but\nThat wouldn't be enough okay what about this what about just the presence here is the U.S military standing at the border you will not cross\nOkay what happens then if they do and whether or\nNot the problem that's the peril is part of the problem\nWe're but you don't you and your like your your your ears bullet you use ah one of the dummy is called I forgot about the use you use some kind of force but not lethal\nAnd we have a quality of the things you but you know all it takes one person going down and squeal and like a pig and then it's all ... we just have to hold up I don't see anything good coming out of this but the presence would be tremendous\nBut the president's would be okay so there's ... ... you think the military showing up is let me just put words\nIn your mouth and you tell me if I'm right or wrong in interpreting you you think the military showing up as a Lewis Lewis proposition\nNo I think initially is a great idea but we have to be prepared for the next\nWell but you say we can't take your next step because the next step is not what they're good at they're not used to it don't know how to do it\nNow that still terrible you know I ... I think we should but we'd have to be prepared politically and militarily wild and what is it what's the proper it has to be read have to be prepared to use deadly force like\nOkay well let's let's let's let me give you a scenario then okay I'm just doing this in the interest of time I'm not it may it may sound\nInsensitive don't mean that they hold the line I hold the line\nProvide a visual presents a visual obstruction they send the signal not welcome do not cross there will be constant warnings but somebody dies and they have to shoot one or two then what happens\nWe'd have to shoot one I'll tell you I think you see a lot of people\nOne liner probably what Bush talking about members of the immigrants illegal aliens but we'd have to be prepared to take that one or two it's terrible but that's what it\nTakes you don't think if one or two got a ship that it would storm that caused the mob in rain storm the military just in and and and it it essentially stormed the bullet storm ... you'd think they would cease and desist\nI think they will cease and desist I'll tell you there's a lot of times you guys have a tendency to hold up when they're met with equal strength and we just have to\nBut even if there is a casualty or to the drive by their story Trump Jerry fires on harmless or an arm to help ... people\nAnd they're still peril yeah okay so the alternative is so let me\nKnow know apt to hold the line and and like I said somebody you know what the Democrats are always saying hey somebody's got to tell you one for the the legal sleep it's unfortunate but this is what they what they take it all by taking there's just\nYou know hey man right so the responsibility for what happens to them has to be on them you would think the media is going to allow that said this is um [noise] I left I I look I Can't start another thought because I couldn't finish it got to take a break\nLimbaugh making radio again you're listening to the network can double you

happen\nTo political parties losing favor it does not happen to the candidates losing favor ad about to be overrun by a Democrat blue wave in just to remind you Tom ... on CNN Today the chairman of DNC no no no no we we always knew this election was going to be close [noise]\nWe always you if you know the right places to look the drive by and the Democrats are really walking this back\nNow I Know a lot of you think rush don't get sucked into this they're just doing a rope a dope they're trying to make you think that they've lost count but they haven't this is just I don't believe that smokes\nThese people are not rational right now\nThey haven't been rational for a long time and their irrationality really was jammed up\nAfter Trump won but there's a companion story to all of the people showing up for Trump and that is not enough people showing up providing the Democrats are sending Joe Biden out\nTo try to draw crowds for various Democrat candidate and it isn't working now by showed up to do a rally for the Democratic candidate for governor of Florida Andrew Gillum who as an aside and he'd debated rounds of census last night on CNN [noise]\nAh this this this guy Gillum for those of you who live in Florida I I Know he\nSeems attractive to some of the when an Obama like way a would be the first African American governor ah is is supposedly just filled with love and compassion the guy is a full fledged\nLeftist Marxist that really makes no bones about evil just talking about Florida as a collective that's communist ... she was talking about Florida as law or all collective\nHe hit it would be a disaster for Florida right now it's all like anybody like this guy\nBecause of what he will do\nIn racking a growing economy do you know the Florida and Texas economies are growing like gangbusters ... and it's not just because of of senior citizens moving here from other areas of the country it's about tax policy\nFlorida and Texas have no state income tax as such people are moving here in droves and businesses in Florida are growing left and right and this guy wants to shut it down\nThis is this guy is a ... is Andrew Gillum is a ... classic modern day Democrats leftist who doesn't want there to be in the private sector success\nBecause the private sector is corrupt it's unfair it's it's illegitimate\nI and and it it's it's not everybody's treated equally in so far this guy wants government in charge of virtual for his express purpose of determining outcomes based on what he thinks is equality in fairness\nHe doesn't know about running businesses it's like every other Democrat in the world that's never run one has want an open criticism for them and the people around them and the people who found them and the people who start them has a deep resentment he's part of the Elizabeth Warren Obama crowd\nYou didn't build that you didn't look that up a\nWould just be just bad news horrible knows a thing that worst time\nFor anybody like this guy to be elected governor\nOr in in Florida Rick Scott the outgoing governor gosh I Hope this guy beats Bill Nelson he's running for the Senate down here and here Rick Scott\nIs one of these guys self made and as as a has become very successful and as governor he tackled a whole bunch of emergencies and disasters in just came through with flying colors and and and Nelson has become a just a static flat line\nJust a walking echo chamber for whatever left his leadership in the Senate wants done whether it's uh\nBenefits to Florida or not but the sand just would be great defense as a as a regular night conservative Republican who happens to have a good relationship with a with Trump a but Andrew Gillum ... this is the exact wrong decision to make there's nothing\nHere and it's not just Andrew Gillum this is no time to be electing people\nWho want to put the brakes on what is happening in this country right now we've got more job openings than there are people to fill them we have people getting raises getting bonuses businesses are growing left and right the economy is rising we've got trade practices coming back into balance now\nWe've got people feeling more optimistic about America at least ... surveys then they have expressed in quite a while\nThe trend is constantly upward people have have are exceptionally positive thoughts about the future and electing me\nExtreme leftist Democrat as governor or senator or even as as president in two years would be an absolute disaster\nIt would constitute rolling back every\nAchievement that has been made in the past two if you want to go back to flat line the economics of decline where the president tells you this is as good as it gets and you get a better get used to it because America's greatness in the past really wasn't deserved\nWay way stole a lot of what we had we mistreated people all over the world if you want to invest in the idea that the United states is the problem in the world and not the solution then you'll elect these Democrats I Can't\nI Can't imagine people who are engaged and thinking about this and living lives actively involved when ... in any way want to put the brakes on this\nAnd for what reason because they don't like Trump tweeting because they don't like Trump's manners because they think Trump is goldfish or whatever some of the silliest stupidest reasons that's not why Trump is supported\nTrump is supported because he's in the last line to hold off\nOn this attempt at transforming America into being something that it was never found it to be if you want if you want America to actually be determined by shaped by like this this mob seven\nThousand people demanding entry into the United states and demanding benefits from the United states because they are deserved because America is responsible for what's going on in their home countries if that's what you want America to be then you got to vote Democrat\nBecause that's what the Democratic party of today wants to happen successful American needs to be punished whatever else is going on it still boils down to an age is old argument over philosophy and it's this\nAre you better at running your life or is the government better at running your life\nThe Democrat Party believes your not capable of running your life and they don't want you to learn that you can\nThey don't want you to learn that you can be self reliant and achieve great things they don't want you to realize that you can be happy and content on your own the Democrat Party wants people to believe all of that is only possible\nIf government makes have happened or let's have happened but more and more what leftist actually want government to do is punish the Democratic party has become a party of groups of victims\nAnd these victims have turned over to their own futures to the Democrat Party they have decided that life is too unfair and to me and and they can't overcome any adversity without the Democrats running interference without the government running interference and so more and more what they want by voting for Democrats they want Democrats to punish\nThe successful\nOr anybody that these people believe is responsible for their unhappiness\nThe Democratic party has become a party of mean spirited\nExtremism the Democratic party has become the home of people sadly what psychological disorders who are demanding that the political system of the country address those disorders and normalize them\nAnd that's not the purpose of the United states government and it can't succeed any way\nI mean this is just hands down in this Andrew Gillum personify is personify the exact total wrong direction to take at any time but especially now let me go to these photos put but one of these up\nOn the digital camera if you're watching this is Joe Biden at a rally for Andrew Gillum the media is trying to hide the fact that nobody is showing up that is one view of a ...
