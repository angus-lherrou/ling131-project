and in many ways this was one of the agenda objectives of the Obama administration wants to do it in a stealth white Obama couldn't come out and say\nBeyond that his policies were transformative uh he couldn't define what that meant a\nThere would've been a revolt that he wouldn't have been elected to him he'd been honest about what transforming America man so why did he claimed it man was taking on issues like climate change and health care for everybody and all this transform America but what they really want to do is transform America away from\nOur unique founding converted to a socialist democracy\nSome of the radicals even want to go further and and and have this country become totally communist fact look and there's a poll out here today this from the Daily Caller they Paul is a buzzfeed news thirty one percent of millennials\nIdentify as democratic socialist according to a study that has been taken a [noise] you know you'd like to not believe this but the facts on the grounds as to what you see [noise]\nEven though it may be anecdotal evidence indicates that a lot of them have fallen for this millennial men were far more likely to identify as some kind of socialist and women a total of forty percent responding affirmative late to the question now how would they held can that be\n'cause there's one thing or something just doesn't drivers socialism you know what it is self reliance\nSelf reliance taking yourself seriously standing up for yourself believing in yourself relying on yourself\nBeing a man just does not jibe with socialism\nSocialism does not work well with self reliant people socialism and communism attempt to her race self reliant people self reliant people people that do not need do not depend on anybody but themselves their immediate circle are a huge threat\nTo socialist in Congress or how the hell is this happened\nHow is it forty percent of millennials men have become socialist more than women it ought to be the exact opposite\n\nWell hello modern era feminism which has had as one of its targets the the masculine\nAs they should have men and they've been very open and honest about that they've even conjure up terms for it toxic masculinity dangerous\nMasculinity they are doing their best to erase mailed natural male characteristics\nFor as many young guys as they can and since guys want there pal around with women whatever women want is what many end up doing on balance I mean you have individual exceptions of course\nYou got Clint Eastwood's or you've got James cons tell everybody to go to hell when they're told how to live and how to act but on balance men do what women want them to do if the big book as famous and hot women did get men are going to go say they're reading it or try to become conversant and it's\nJust the nature of things and so they're being highly highly successful and targeting America\nAnd its founding not just targeting capitalism it's targeting the concepts of individual liberty and freedom and targeting the concept that government is the institution that needs to be limited most\nIn a representative republic that the emphasis of government the getting government out of people's lives just the exact opposite with communism socialist so I have an evidence base here\nNot just slapping my gums there's a New Yorker story by Michael lift up a guy\nPublished yesterday the cheers of Brett Kavanaugh is its title [noise]\nIt is a horrible peace and it does exactly that which I had been warning people it goes all the way back to the founding of America the trash white men that reminds me\nHang on here you need a grab an audio soundbite here it's a bit of that but I Do but it would you be every bit of six and seven [noise]\n\nPoke quote Kavanaugh has no avenue of appeal do except his own hurt feelings he's in touch with them as he was taught to be and so he seemingly weaponized crying the way a little boy does when he's in trouble\nAnother poll quote But Kevin last performance last Thursday was something entirely different distinctly contemporary it's combined the post war attitude that men should be in touch with their feelings to the point that they make crime with the intrinsic American ideal of white\nMale privilege because Kevin is accused of sexual assault and may be denied the career elevation he has long ... he blah burned like a newborn\nHe has plot ... his career you'll see he hasn't had\nA series of goals and achieve them all all that guy is a dangerous schemer he has plot and they get on the Supreme Court where he can to rule\nA I realize a lot of people think that that's what's so that's that's what's in store here\nAnd of course I'm hearing I'm just going to happen I'm hearing from droves of you who say the proof is the timing\nThat she's going to do this after this program and I\nMean it means Russia can't being thing you're going to like I'm getting emails that say you think that's right too certainly is absolutely thinks that's right as well well we'll we'll see I'm not I'm not going to withdraw my uh acknowledgement but I think she did the right thing [noise]\nBut I'm going to get to the phones because I've um I've gone to many first hours this week without getting to the phones that changes today especially being open line friday so we'll go to Pleasanton, California first with Chris hello\nNow however that rush a good to talk with you [noise]\nUm this Monica McClain who you were just to speak you know the person they contacted\n'em as Kaiser on trying to get her to possibly change your testimony ... uh she she's the same person that the boyfriend or Dr Ford mentioned in the letter he sent him talking about how a sheep in those coaching going on but Dr Ford on trying to get somebody to handle the polygraph\nProbably yeah that's another story by the way the boyfriends letter has yet to be reported in\nMainstream media nor has the story of Monica McLean pressuring Leland Kaiser to change your test those two stories have not been reported ABC CBS NBC Washington Post New York times Associated Press people have not heard either um\nAnd there's other things like for example a Dr Ford mentioned in her son it I mean on her and the testimony she goes she mentioned regal Delaware was where she was that and that's the last known address of others moniker McLean\nCorrect yeah there's a ... absolutely that's when they wrote a letter when when when balls the Ford wrote the letter that's where she was she was at a ... a Delaware with McLean yeah\nHere's my question there's there's an emerging picture that there might be a lot going on but beyond that behind the scenes here that hasn't come out yet [noise] uh I'm Wondering is not is it is the Democrat oddly enough or not better off holding this vote now before more of this comes out\nA way that's\nGoing to go through at the last minute change one of the people that things are going to vote changes it was suddenly it goes down and a quarter and then because all this is about to come out\nNo it's not about to come out that's the whole point\nYou know it but it's not going to come out it hasn't come out yet it's not going to come out now one thing it has the the ... a pressure to change your testimony that is in the FBI report the Democrats have seen that Grassley referenced it and Grassley said there's a lot more\nThere are many more examples of balls before and witnesses being pressure to change your testimony and Democrats have seen all that it doesn't change is going to change anything this is not about the evidence\nIt never has been about the evidence\nAnd if those two stories miraculously made the front page of the New York times website in five minutes and it baby CBS NBC began to report on this if it wouldn't change one Democrat Senate vote\n\nDemocrats can't delayed about anyway that's up to McConnell the turtle\nWell the question is why when Republicans make make a greater effort for it to come out [noise]\nWhy would I mean whatever to ... uh uh [noise] uh it's in the FBI reporting to Republicans and Democrats can see it it's the the the Monica McLean aspect is in the FBI report they discovered I went\nTo my knowledge none of the senator grassroots so forth are not mentioned but we were just talking about\nNo no they're not I can't tell you why they're not mentioning okay thank you you bet I'm Wondering myself [laughter] um well\nI Know your questions are entirely legitimate and they're rooted in pure common sense\nYou were sitting there thinking if I don't know this it would change everything it shows that the Boise foreign side is willing\nTo commit perjury ... born perjury pressure witnesses to change their stories which then couldn't be sad to conclude that there's not anything that ball Z Ford is saying it's reliable\nBut those two stories have not been seen by the American public at large they've not shown up at Yahoo News the Associated Press New York Times CBS NBC CNN and they want\nFor ... reason the stories are being suppressed but the Democrats in the Senate and now it doesn't matter it's about the seriousness of the charge it's not about the nature of the yeah but\nIt never Rochelle Mickey I be worse than doubled you\nWhen you put a safe and you're home what will you put in it\nWhat are your most valuable possessions well there's just one

is going to see it [noise] but not faced to back that McLean\nPressuring Kaiser change your story [noise]\nSo he got a female so call conservative commentator on MSNBC admitting that there is such a thing as a female time of the month ... men are acting like they're having won but you're not supposed to say these kinds of things\n\nYou know you were you what Trump allude in any way to women's

the ... mentioned does Senator Grassley the chairman of the Judiciary Committee he has um I've never seen him this animated I've never seen the turtle is animated\nThis week the turtle and Grassley has been fit to be tied Grassley deal Grassley sent a letter late last night Grassley said his letter at four AM today\n\nTo uh I I I guess he sent it to Schumer you might've Senator Feinstein and in this whether he calls out Mazie Hirono the senator from what I eat and Feinstein by name\nAnd let me read just a portion of grass what his letter indeed if the evidence supported your clients allegations you will surely would produce it as quickly as you could\nBut you have repeatedly refused to produce this evidence to the Senate in doing so you are preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial Dr Ford's allegations\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw for your refusal but with the withheld evidence but the the withheld evidence does not support Dr Ford's allegations in quite the way you've claimed\nThis is the polygraph he's talking about the notes with a polygraph and the therapist notes Feinstein and the Democrats have not produce those even though balls the Ford admitted that she took a lie detector\nWill her warriors did and that she had seen a therapist and the grass has been asking for that evidence and Feinstein and the Democrats have not produced it and he's saying you have repeatedly refused reduced this\nYou're preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to Dr forge allegations she passed elect attacked or we want to see it\nThey won't let him see it\nDon't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support her allegations in quite the way you have claimed\nIt's a reasonable thing to say they're out there saying she's not a lie detector that she passed the lie detector that she told all these details tour therapist well let's see that stuff and they won't producer\nAnd Grassley saying you must be you must have something to hide then he writes I urge you once again now for the third time in writing\nTo turn over the therapy now it's the polygraph materials and communications with the Washington Post that Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence\nIn addition to the evidence I requested in October second letter in light of recently uncovered information please turn over records\nAnd descriptions of direct or indirect communication between Dr Ford or her representatives and and I am following one US Senators are their stabs protect Italy the offices of Feinstein and Hirono\nNumber two the alleged witnesses identified by Dr Ford Leland Kaiser mark judge Patrick ... my ... and fried that'd be Ramirez Julie sweating represented what what what grass means getting at here how much consultation if you had with his witness\n\nSenator Feinstein senator her own owes them they are how how much time spent with this witness discussing her testimony\nOr coaching her whatever I mean he loaded for bear this is the kind of college out of the violation and I shouldn't call it that these are this is the kind of decorum that you you don't see broken\nSenators don't challenge each other they don't call each other out it's almost the Senate rules\nAnd and Grassley yesterday during a joint Republican press conference he kept running back to the microphone don't intend to the Senate or are they\nThe media people as [noise] using by us and so forth in fact grab audio soundbite number five\nThis was [noise] I don't know if this was at a press conference or not it may not be exactly what I saw but it is an example of a grass with his finger on the pulse here this is I'm not it's not what I've seen this this morning and\nWash it but let's listen to what we have learned is the reason is that has existed since the day after the November twenty sixteen Elijah is centered right here on Capitol Hill they have encouraged mob rule\nWhen you hear things about get in their face bother people at every restaurant where you can find a cabinet member they coming from public service that oughta setting an example of civility in American society and it's been made worse by what has happened to judge Kavanaugh I Hope we can say\nNo to a mob rule by voting to confirm judges Kevin ... before that\nWas during his ah southern for remarks today in favor of capital he was even singling out by the way Maxine Waters\nFor promoting this as he calls the resistance but he's he's calling them out here\nAnd\nChastising them for encouraging mob rule\nAnd that the resistance leadership is actually right here on Capitol Hill and he's right the leadership of the resistance is the Democratic party there resistance is over the Democratic National Committee and in various\nIssues and offices of Congress members of the house and so forth he I've I've never seen this before I've never seen these guys on our side call out the Democrats\nLike this I may have to be tied now I think I have something in my relate to it I got an email\nLast night from Salinas Ito who has made a name for herself\nBy traveling through all of these blue states during the election campaigns season of two thousand sixteen she went to all of these places in blue states that were going to vote for Trump and she learned anything about these people she could\nShe took them seriously\nShe went and met them and talk to them learn about them nobody else in the drive by media has done anything like this\nBut she wanted to find out who they are she lives in Pittsburgh she had a sense that something was happening out there that the Washington establishment didn't see and rather than gas she actually wanted to find out who these people are she went to a lot of small towns\nMedium sized town spent serious time they're getting to know these people she has stayed in touch with them ever since the election she has written a book about it if the Democrats in the media wanted to know who has been voted for Donald Trump all they'd have to do is go get her book they haven't they don't read it they don't care to know who the Trump voters are\nThey're not interested in appealing to them they're trying to find out ways to make Trump voters irrelevant or keep them away from the polls they want to separate Trump and his voters from themselves but they're not interested in finding out who they are so as to maybe convert them\nTo what never Trump or is there an anti Trump presents an amazing display of arrogance\nAnd by the\nWay the same can be Senate Republican political consultant so they don't care who the Trump voters are all that matters is that they are left at impugn didn't made fun of so I get a note from last night\nAnd she is explaining to me what the campaign on hearings have meant and what has happened out there\nIn these areas she has studied and she made essentially two points\n\nOne that something has needed to happen after the two thousand sixteen election to keep the coalition that voted for Trump together\nNow a lot of us of assumed that if people voted for Trump in two thousand six day that they did so for very specific reasons among them Trump is alone in fighting the Washington establishment that Trump is alone in in in pushing back\nAgainst Democrats and the so called Washington conventional wisdom and then the assumption is that if people knew that in two thousand six day and that they would not forget that and if they would realize the need to continue\nTo vote in ways that would continue to support and unable Trump to be successful\nAnd she makes the point that it doesn't work that way sadly\nThat after a single election with the known results something needs to happen besides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand sixteen\nAnd

going through all this is ... ... Ford is is using people that are tied ... hip and the heart and the brain to Democratic Party activism from the FBI to the department of justice to the Senate Judiciary committee\nNow Monica McLean lawyer happens to be a guy named David Wasserman according to the Washington Post David off men helped oversee\nThe investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server problem which she was exonerated\n... also helped oversee about Russian interference in the Trump election or campaign in two thousand six neat so how is it that ball\nFord ends up in the home of a woman\nWho's tied to the D.

obviously nervous about because earlier today Lisa Murkowski was a definite no on Kavanaugh and in announcing her definite no she said he is just not the right man\nFor the Supreme Court right now just not the right man\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nSo Kimberly stressful now she changing you're not changing she is saying that our minds now made up\nThe link is a Reuters story and it says essentially Murkowski has not\nMade a final decision you could have fooled me it sounded awfully final to me this morning when I read it\nBrett Kavanaugh is not the right man for the Senate right now\nNow she's saying it's not her final decision [noise] something is happening in that regard [noise] here Kimberly ... tweets in the first one here well they're they're both right on the money\nJust to be clear yeah I'm trying to apple five days I'm I'm trying to make sure more people hear about these tweets and then we'll see them yeah absolutely it's worth it\nKimberly straw so Wall

rules\nLisa Murkowski has made quite the statement these are two devastating\nTweets as they are right on the money\nLegitimizing in signing off on the most despicable tactics ever standing with Feinstein Cory Booker Kamala Harris who is in a class by herself\nIn men dastardly and Anna number of other things just just [noise] not much redeeming there but more importantly Lisa Murkowski has voted to leave Kavanaugh's subject to claims of perjury and impeachment\nAnd then leaving the court if he's not confirmed accord stays up for for a deadlock what the ... the reason that matters is that in a way if the court votes for four on any case then the decision prior to the court hearing it is affirmed nothing changes\nAnd that means that the Ninth Circuit court of appeals would be the highest ranking court\nThat could make decisions\nRegarding fundamental aspects of life in Alaska her own home state\nIt is it would be to put the night if you're a Republican and by the way she does believe in property rights and development and gun rights and to put the Ninth Circuit court of appeals with a bunch of a leftist in charge of those issues in her state they're just shooting herself in the foot\nAll just supposedly be\nIn unison with me too movement [noise] so I mentioned we had a couple of photos\nOf Dianne Feinstein it looks like she has cornered Murkowski I don't know when the photos were taken presumably\nThey are recent we can find out we just have checked Feinstein's wardrobe on a particular day of hearings\nBut go ahead and Scott put it in the sweat you're for those of you I'm watching the digital camera there is a picture and stand by 'cause we have a close up there is a picture of Dianne Feinstein literally when Lisa Murkowski up against a\nAll in a hallway of a Senate office building\nAnd they are chatting with each other and Murkowski has a pain to look on her face Feinstein's looks like she is\nA picture speaks for itself it it it it would that hand up she got a cornered she's got her hand up on the wall framing Murkowski\nIt's an aggressive move it allows lines times are leaning in to Murkowski\nNow let's switch to the close up of that photo for those will be watching on the dental camp do you\nSee the pain expression on the face of Murkowski and the expression\nOf in hand\nSeriousness and you better be listening to me\nOn the face of die for\nNow we'll have these photos up at Rush Limbaugh dot com to I'm not trying to leave it buddy out but I Want to you're watching on the digital camera to be able to see these that's\nThat close up is the same shot just to close up of the previously televised photo is that right well\nJohn here looking here's this why Feinstein sure does look like a bully and Murkowski looks very uncomfortable does she not\nMeans needs to be a really pained look on her face and\nIt it looks like Feinstein is running this relationship it looks like Feinstein is giving her what for\n[noise] [noise] I don't know when the picture was taken and I will acknowledge that our interpretation could be wrong\nWe we have no context here other than the hearings and the way this has been going\nWell I wouldn't call that romantic I take that back ah one of these is from California and romance there has all kinds of shapes and form so you could be right or it it could be a romantic amateur load I certainly what's\nThe old saw it's not for us to criticize who loves who and why [noise] so\nUh yeah it can be a ... bat lovers quarrel we don't know\nGood afternoon rush thank you so much for taking my call anytime\nOlder anytime\nLongtime listener and first time caller it's an honor to speak with you today um would like to discuss this Murkowski briefly with you um\nI Believe it was during the bill Gorsuch earrings that Murkowski went to the administration I Trump and bargain her votes for exploration writes in Anwar\nAnd I worked up and Trudeau I Know what that's like the revenue that that field brings to the state\nIs correct that's correct you're right I remember that you're exactly right and well I I think I Know where you're going this is a hell of a pay back [noise]\n[laughter] yeah well you know it's not what a certain resistance is Sarah ... is is there a way to get the gotcha back on trial or why hasn't that card been played back to her to say with the stroke of this thing panic and all go away um you know just something that makes you go the other\nWay way way way way to wait a minute the stroke of a saint pick what could go away\nWell if the stroke or the pen can but Anwar and fight for this day\nOh oh you mean Trump couldn't cancel and war as pay back the Murkowski for going against capital [noise] Yes sir it wouldn't do it\nWell OK\nI'm too many people will be hurt too many people be hurt by your right but that that means a lot for her and her day so I don't know\nUm the other quick question that I have for you as you mentioned earlier that if the Democrats regained the house that almost immediately impeachment hearings which started against Trump\nBut it would most likely include Kavanaugh what does that did it for Neil Gorsuch does that put him back in play again\nThat can play you mean to be impeached as well\nAbsolutely sir\nNo no no ... they wouldn't buy that much off um get rid of capital I'm getting back off the bench or install Trump's next nominees when the White House and twenty twenty now I in fact I think my guess is that they would go after capital first\nIn terms of impeachment proceedings\nFresh and everybody's minds go after ... heard juror rainy and sexual harassment\nNot\nI mean serious serious things for which\nA conviction could ruin his life as well and then after they get ... then they go after Trump as the guy knowingly who nominated and capital then they added all the other things on Trump is my guest that they would go after Kavanaugh first but then that Gorsuch they would leave alone that Gorsuch\nShift the balance of record
