{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "Uh respond to the cabinet stuff was really bad it was awful I'm In a lot of different ways but one of the things that happened afterwards or the day he was confirmed was there was a ... foot out by a writer on the ... program do you remember the ...\nYeah and I just said the tweet said alright Kavanaugh's confirmed but at least we ruined his life yeah\nAnd she was never I never writer\nFor cold beer puts I'm going to submit to you that no one on your staff and certainly no one on my staff could put out a tweet like that and retain their job\nNobody because we wouldn't put up with it was cold there apparently is okay with that because the guy still working nothing happened to him\nBut he imagined you know at least we ruined his life and by extension of course his children and his wife and his mother and his father yeah we got 'em all [laughter] and that's that's an evil thing that that guy did it's evil and\nBut you know in America now kind of getting used to this rhetoric and the search and destroy stuff our like it I think people have got to really snap back and start to challenge this stuff\nAnd let me ask you a Donald Trump question because you know I'm as well as anybody he gets the job done in the end he wins he wins with Stormy Daniels he wins with NAFTA he wins he wins but he is kind of noisy about it he does a rental everybody's cage he does say those things\nAre but I went into left going to figure out you just have to accept that he'll get the job done in the end\n[noise] he'll never accept him\nNo matter how good the economy is no matter how ah ISIS is you know what\nHappened ISIS I just got All right\n... where's ISIS All right and that was ... that was a defense secretary did that but Trump picked maps so I'm the level never accept them\nUh the people living on the Upper West side of New York city I'm no matter what he does they'll find a way but I don't understand and I haven't talked to the president while I'm not I don't understand why he does stuff like\nOkay he won the Stormy Daniels thing and that's good because obviously Stormy Daniels in her attorney want\nMoney so they want I Want money might give me money money money money it's all what it's about not nothing else other than money\n[noise] okay so the judge sees that clearly throws a case out and says hey you want money well now you've got to give it a Trump because you've got to pay all the legal fees [noise] um I applaud the ruling the ruling was fair on the law but then chop instead of saying you luck I told you this was bogus and I told you these people were not honorable\nWhich was certainly within his purview to tweet he tweets out well Stormy Daniels\nHas a horse face yeah I mean why why why\nYou've known him for years he was always like that he just said yeah but\nHe wasn't president that yeah so I'm sitting with him about\nSix years ago in Madison Square garden watching the next lose another game and uh we're talking and ... it was really interesting to go to games with Donald Trump because he knows everybody and I learned a tremendous amount just by his comments [noise] so ... turns to me after taking my popcorn\nAnd say oh I'm thinking about running for president and I look at him and I go of what country I thought he might have bought a giant golf course in Bolivia sentiment echoed over I never in a million years and I said this his ascendancy to the presidency\nIs the most stunning political story in the history of this country\nOwe us money that a guy like that could do this but now he's president and I don't know if you want to call people horse face I don't know if that gets us anywhere\nI can see two years from now you'll be reading the book killing the swamp futile baby\nI mean we you know it's possible I Know I Know as you pointed out I Know the president I think as well as any journalist knows him yeah um and I have insights into him in and why he does what he does but I'd never kissed this but\nAlways told them what I thought was the truth and when he asked me questions I I tell them my opinion I tell them why yeah no never never

tomorrow with ten right here on seven ten W O R\nJunior logical trace apparatus in this country in the Mormon church out in Salt Lake City has one of the most advanced\nRespected documented genial logical praise organizations that you'll find\nI have I've seen their work and it is [laughter] it's amazing and that the story I get is that many Native Americans have been very leery of granting DNA because they're leery of how it's going to be used\nThey already feel like they were discriminated bunch of people but on the same token there are some benefits that had been extended to them as a result of this\nAnd they just don't want to upset the apple cart so they don't even realize or utilize DNA in any of this but the the media of course has a role here because everything they reported about this turns out to be an abject lie except for this inclusion by the Boston Globe that there wasn't any Native American DNA\nAnd by the way this is not what\nTrump that her anyway Trump that her that she would have to take a test from a little kid with wandering around you can you can do a very rudimentary DNA test\nAnd he wanted to present herb ... hammer take the kids take the take the test of this kid's using it in a debate\nThe future debate and that's what he meant that she wouldn't do and he kept that she wasn't show up as the Indian if she did do it but you talk about talk about a meltdown and its Trump\nThat is causing this Trump is literally causing these people lose their cookies compass causing them to go in the same and I think it's happening throughout the Democratic party and for out the American left and I have I have developed\nAn even greater reason for it and it all in all relies on things that I have previously known and told you about\nAnd most of it is related to my curiosity here and my suspicion and my my dubious a nature when it comes to this blue wave business we've been hearing\nFor the past how many months that there's going to be a blue wave there's no question about it there has been no question about\nThe Democratic party is poised to retake everything they can in this next election why well the media tells us the American people are fed up after two years of Donald Trump they realize the mistake they made they wish they could do it and go do it over\nMaybe take back their vote for Trump and this is going to be the first chance they've had to actually do that until the Democrats are going to retake the house and a massive landslide and at one point we're going to take the Senate but if you look at\nThe reality\nOf voting patterns just in the past eight years let's say ten there's nothing in the world using common sense that orders for a Democrat sweep or blue wave\nThe trend in the past ten years is Democrats losing elections left and right and it all started with Iraq who's saying all in two thousand ten\n[noise] do you remember how many times I reminded you that during the first six years of Obama give go through the two thousand four team in terms\nOf the Democratic party lost over twelve hundred seats nationwide seats in the U.S house seats in the U.S Senate state houses a governorships\nA you even go to a local often like mayor or town councilman if you if you factor all of those races nationwide the Democrats after six years of Obama had lost well over a hundred seats\nThey were losing everything after the two thousand sixteen election they continue to lose even more and the and the dance that lock to women in a landslide Hillary Clinton got beat in near electoral landslide electoral college landslide [laughter]\nI'm not I'm not sure where they were going to sweep big never going to wipe out the Republican Party once and for all Hillary Clinton was going to be this winter they had they couldn't they had it any better this guy Trump won the Republican nomination\nSomebody did know when he was doing a gigantic buffoon a walking set a gaffe they thought this guy would be easily swept away they believed older polling data\nAnd we know what happened they continue to lose to the point that after the two thousand sixty eight elections\nThe Democratic party had the least amount of power in terms of elected office is held in Washington DC since the Nineteen twenties\nNow the two thousand sixteen election was only two years ago\nSo from two thousand ten the first chance people had to vote after having stomach two years of the Obama administration which you want to talk about people wanting to get their votes back you want to talk about people wishing they can do it over you want to talk about people wishing they haven't voted the way they had to go take a look at the two thousand ten midterms\nFor Iraq Obama singlehandedly my friends has destroyed the electoral prowess of the Democratic party\nNobody knows it because of the things I just told you are never reported instead what people hear every day is this coming blow away this gigantic Democrat landslide on what evidence is this going to happen what is it that has stopped the trend\nThe people in this country had been voting against Democrats in ways\nUnprecedented I mean to having the fewest number of electoral seats since the Nineteen twenties is pretty astounding it means a lot of people had been voting against you so what is it that's happened\nThat is going to cause this gigantic one hundred eighty degree shift\nMake people stop voting against Democrats and vote for them why it's none other than Donald Trump so says the media so says the Democratic party\nWell on the basis of what if you take a look at Trump's agenda and the economy and policies and so forth is no reason to vote against it\nIn common sense there is no read Trump hasn't done anything to worse than anybody's lives quite the contrary and in fact there's a story\nFrom CNBC today that you're not going to see widely reported we'll see [laughter] probably put CNBC ... survey soaring economic optimism points to no blue\nWave in two thousand Eighteen is this is the NBC poll or survey\nAmerica is experiencing a record breaking era of good feelings economically speaking optimism about the ... do you know that there are seven million jobs open in America today actual number seven million one hundred thirty six thousand job openings in America\nFor context the U.S never had even six million vacant jobs open until April of two thousand Seventeen\nNow we have an historic seven point one million jobs open that means employers are looking to hire that many people\nThat you will say roaring economy that equals no problem getting a job if you want one with that\nMany job openings it is an employee ease market if there's that much demand for employees the employers can set the terms based on their level of expertise and experience on whatever it is they're applying\nFor none of this in the world of common sense suggests that people would\nUnhappy by or about it and want to reject it and yet that's exactly what we're being told that the American people are sick and tired day hey\nBut Trump brought him up and he got one and he got it precisely by holding steady in the spine on Kevin I'm telling you Trump is\nWith the assistance of the Democrats treatment of Kevin all the Republican Party not all of it but it's it's it's moving toward unification at least in terms of opposition to the Democrats the Democrats are not\nUnified and twenty four of them\nSay they want to be president now [noise]\nThe voice of New York [noise]\nSeven ten W O I\nWe've got fifty one degrees at twelve

lot of people who are and then the Twitter verse that's considered a meltdown when you tweak twenty times in an attempt to persuade people\nFind the time attempting to make your case it's considered to be a meltdown and again the big news about all of this is that the media is making fools of themselves right along the way by lying right along with her\nThe Stanford University researcher who studies to focus on us this DNA\nDid not actually use samples of Native American DNA the Boston Globe quote to make up for the dearth of Native American DNA Dr\nCarlos ... samples from may go ... in Columbia to stand in for Native Americans now\nShe's out there touting that it's true is she's an MD she got one one thousand twenty fourth [noise]\nAnd there wasn't even any Indian or Native American DNA tested in which she could be said to have in common or compared to\n... minutes laughable it is pathetic and I think\nThis is what Trump is doing to all these people Hillary Clinton was making a fool of herself each and every ... they're saying\nThat what Bill Clinton did with Monica ... no no no no no it was not abused that doesn't qualifies me too because she was an adult\nSo Hillary Clinton is making the answer of herself an absolute fool of herself in the midst of the meat to move but she's on you're cutting it\nAnd selling it out in order to save both herself and her husband who or soon to be barking on what\nA stadium tour go Oh yes bill\nAnd Hillary aren't going to mark a nationwide stadium tour where they are going to go and hopefully draw crowds of twenty and twenty five thousand to do the bill and Hillary show onstage\nBecause of course they can't let Trump upstaged doesn't like this I mean if we can do what they can do it if Trump can do and anybody can do it they're going to try to get in on it\nThere's one thing missing one key ingredient missing nobody cares what they have to say not like people care what Trump has to say there is no\nInterest in what Bill or Hillary Clinton are going to say there is all kinds of interest in what Trump is going to say\nThere's just the it factor\nThat Trump has the Hillary certainly doesn't they haven't never has had you could argue that Bill Clinton to an extent had it when I'm Talking about this type of charisma\nBack in the nineties when he was running for president in shortly after the first term maybe he had and they believe the aura was expanded a bit by the fact that he was president but neither of these two are anywhere near\n\nThe wing of Donald Trump you know what does it like it was it like the Democrats trying to come up with an answer to me in the first ten years in the spring and Gary Hart parents\nSome ... some ... the state treasurer of Texas they gave her radio show Mario the pious they gave her radio show and the media\nHighlighted every one of these Democrats radio talk show who had never done it before as the rush killer every one of them was anointed end inaugurated as the Democrat that\nWas going to steal the limelight away from this program then Air America came along and uh and they did the same thing and it never has happened\nEvery attempt to supplant take over\nRelegate this program ... has failed abysmally and just like the bill and Hillary stadium tour is going to fail abysmally\nThey're going to end up having to pay people to show up\nTo get the kind of crowds and the one that you may think rush them enough rabbit Democrats out there that will show up just to create the image that there's all kinds of interest folks you may think that\nWhat we're going to find out common sense will tell you\nHillary Clinton could withdraw fly just do a book selling party she couldn't draw applies to a campaign appearance that's why she didn't do very many of them it would have been embarrassing how few people showed up the ones there were big crowds they did in fact most people\nIn the country's not clamoring to hear from the Clintons companies not waiting\nWith bated breath for what they have to say but look I Want to I Want to return just for a brief moment to this\nThis notion of the of the blue wave and go to a couple of audio soundbites

stops talking to the watch maybe twenty or twenty five yards at most of which would be Seventy five feet on it\nCops on the outside sixty feet more like if there's no way his watch was recording anything and transmitting it anywhere so there there can't be a recording of what happened to it besides that the Saudis would have seen that watched by taking it off\nA and they would have needed the

really thinks about things like gun control because she might not get elected\nWe can't\nOpenly said that says one of her age we got to soundbites here the first one is McCaskill herself and her staff
