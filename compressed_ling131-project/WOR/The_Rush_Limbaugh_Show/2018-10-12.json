{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "And let it roll and so like decide where the money should go 'cause he's the best guy to handle this stuff\nThank appreciate that uh the president's doing these rallies every night how much of a difference is that your great to watch but how much does that really help\nWell and then and then the base and if you're going to go out to sit and watch it as a speech for a couple of hours and take a couple of hours to get there and many of these places are uh it'll it'll motivate you to go out and\nGrab a neighbor and go vote to and that's the key thing here is make sure all the Republicans all the Trump supporters itchy low turnout though a lot of times people vote in a presidential election is about a third drop off in the mid term elections and usually\nIt goes against the president's party at this particular case we got to reverse it\nYeah I saw her work do drugs but Enron as you've been in the White House with a lot of presidents explain how borough president if you look for a chance to get out of the house to go meet people you kind of locked up in there\nBut we are locked up that this president like president style you know Reagan kicked in the late to get out with people like to basically a deal to deal with that crowd and and and Trump thrives on that Trump is obviously someone who loves to meet\nThe crowds loves to talk to the crowds are uh gives them energy and this guy's got nonstop energy ... I think he sleeps four hours a night and for that as a Seventy year old man or a thirty year old man he has more energy than anybody see yeah though when he gets out there and those crowds he gets revitalized and and marches forward\nSay uh just switch subjects the journalist Jamal ... show gave this looks like the Saudis may have killed him tortured him a little bit but we do hundreds of billions in business with the Saudis what what can we really do about it we can't cut off or relate you gotta\nYou gotta rattle the sword you've got to basically say that kind of behavior is totally unacceptable and there's consequences to it and you just can't do that uh and if you do it we're going to put sanctions on your under slept with you that I mean I understand they are basically uh uh trading partners and important to a certain extent but she just can't let that kind of behavior call\nAnd it just an addict addict cup is done that tropical can you do that\nYou have if you put the sanctions and all you're saying is don't give us a hundred billion for planes give it to the Russians\n[noise] well I think yeah I think there's some truth to that that the end of the day you have to have some some responsibility to the world community and obviously cream of the ... this was a guy basically ah ah what was writing for the Washington Post or that they may not like what do you write but you can't kill people well we'll support murders\nNo we don't but listen we know probably what the Saudis do we we do what ... and probably does she gee paying great relationship with the president but who knows what he has to do when he has to do it\nAgain you got to rattle a sort of the apes acceptable\nSo hey we'd love to see Jeff Sessions gone and the new attorney general obviously not before the midterms but do you think something will happen after the midterms\nAbsolutely there's no question that it's such a way to resign oh a basically will find somebody that was present some of them\nNow from our money there will be there and New Year's day [laughter]\nSo that's good news that the president can take somebody already in the administration who's been confirmed put them in their temporarily right\nOn and an acting basis which can be a substantial period of time to clean things up a a powerful nation fight right now would be pretty hard so my sense is take take one of the other ... that have been confirmed I'll put them in an acting capacity it laid there for a year or so clean up the show\nAnd the ...\nI Know there's a list is and under secretary of state they like there's a there's a couple of people that they could put it in the ... what can a person who can be fire Rosenstein and clean house\nOr they didn't do whatever they want to have all the power to the attorney general uh and and the only reason goes and has his powers as sessions isn't there so if you had a new attorney general acting or for real of each he runs that apartment he could fire Rosenstein he dealt wheeler show me what you got a abolished that that\nUh the special counsel if there's nothing there I'll give them a deadline to wrap it up in a month or whatever I mean take charge of the department which sessions has not done in a year that he had been there for two years and\nSo an original color and say let me see what you got\n[noise] absolutely just you know that he's acting on behalf of the attorney general yeah it's it's not an independent I but he he basically there's not an independent counsel I always used to be at all now he is acting on behalf of the attorney general justice Oregon and he's representing the viewpoints should be represented to be ...\nSo you know a new attorney general comes in and says let me see ... even ... for two years is there anything real here there's not any we'll hear let's cut it out\nWow so this is done\nOne of these fake news though the sentences of the Senate will never confirmed will never allow the president put an ally and his attorney general what President didn't have an ally in their attorney general\nAll you have a ... a lot of the Kennedy was the brother is Eric Holder who just does was to protect her everyday but that was a little bottles so uh you know the reality is uh\nUh the president has a right to have his own people illustration an attorney general is critical to post thought had someone in a real capacity central personal centrist are ready to let the president wants to create a time so it's on that gets fixed\nWell Ed Rollins brilliant as always now if you want to if you

but\nJust rank amateur on professionalism but the reason I played this is is not not to mention this guy because while this guy is jumping all in my chili\nListened to this story this is from the federalist papers liberal professor says hurricane victims deserve to what thank God because they support Republicans now do you think these\nClowns in Boston with zero in on something genuinely deranged like this you know they're going to make up the fact that a bunch of people like me who know oh that climate change man made climate change is a hoax\nAre somehow responsible for people having lost everything including risking their lives\nDoes University of St Thomas engineering school in Minnesota thermal and fluids sciences professor Dr John Abraham he's a professor actually believe the Florida Panhandle residents deserve to get hit\nBy a catastrophic hurricane become elected climate deniers here's the headline\nIn an article written by this guy was published in the guardian and not some obscure little rag or penny saver this was published in the guardian\nOn Thursday victims of hurricane Michael voted for climate deniers elections have consequences denying science has consequences and we are reaping what we so\n\nPeople just like this are teaching your kids and they're being paid a lot of money to do it this is the logic could my reasoning that he is teaching these engineering school the guy is doing range this is this is hyper political partisanship disguised as science\n\nHe thinks that voting for Republicans causes hurricanes to hit red states and the people in red states who voted Republicans deserved to get wiped out by hurricanes for voting for Republicans and his name\nIs Dr John Abraham a University of St Thomas engineering school in Minnesota\n\nDespite the lack of science to support his case Dr Abraham blames Michael's intensity on manmade global warming there isn't any evidence for it it's not the most intense hurricanes ever hit the panhandle\n\nYet he blames the intensity or manmade global warming are needing to his subsequent claim that southern voters brought this upon themselves\nBy voting Republicans into office\nIt's how one or the other states like Florida which will get pummeled by Michael couldn't vote for somebody that denies climate change this doctor wrote\nPointing to governor Rick Scott andme to Senator Marco Rubio on the his argument is that in the last Republican climate deniers or voted out of office\nThat more hurricanes will bring more death and destruction ... so this clown who is disguised as a as an engineering professor literally is saying that if you want to stop\nDestructive hurricanes striking where you live vote Democrat he literally this one is what he said\nIn an unrelated story a bunch of which is somewhere are putting a tax on Brett Kavanaugh this week and I'm not making that up\nAnd they are disguised as Democratic Party activists are hacks on Capitol I'd I'd I don't know what the nature of the ...\n[noise]\nI mean this [laughter] if if if it weren't so irresponsible it would be funny meanwhile you have the entire left now attempting to destroy Kanye West\nAt what Kanye West\nDan is simply venture off the liberal Democrats plantation that is a no no if you're African American you venture off the Democrat plantation they are going to destroy your meanwhile idiots like this professor\nA professor of engineering literally tells people that if you want to stop\nHurricanes from blowing up where you live vote Democrat it's because you're voting Republican and and denying climate change that these hurricanes are coming after you now do you remember after Hurricane Katrina you people might have thought that I was joking there were people\nIn the leftist medium who literally weren't trying to tell people in New Orleans that George Bush wanted that hurricane to strike Louisiana he wanted it specifically the strike\nOrleans this is why there weren't any warnings it wanted it to strike New Orleans because Bush knew that residents of New Orleans would have to abandon the city\nAnd go to Texas\nWhere as Democrats they wouldn't be absorbed and wouldn't affect any political outcomes but in Louisiana you can turn the state Republican if you get rid of a bunch of New Orleans Democrats and sort of people out there saying that Bush\nActually wanted to hurricane to wipe out New Orleans so that residents would have to leave\nWould have to go to Houston\nThere were some even saying that Bush was doing when he couldn't just steer the hurricane that Bush was responsible for it because Bush told the weather service to downplay the warnings\n\nWell I didn't want to mention it but I'll go ahead and mentioned there were some that now these were not mainstream media people but they did repeat this there were people out\nThere talking maybe ... takes on the Internet who were claiming that Bush was steering the hurricane\nRemember that\nThat Bush was steering that hurricane Bush himself the president was fearing the hurry and and what this guy\nIs professor at the University of ...\nOn every particular issue that's why they

problem is I mean\nLike Oh yes the ... the problem is they're trying to scare everybody into signing on to this because it's it's classic if you sign on to agreeing on the whole premise of climate change your dream to a lot you're agreeing you are to blame\nAnd that's a big one\nBecause when you agree that you are to blame then they hit you with but you can fix it you you you can make amends and how to do that you agree to pay higher taxes you agree to become an activist you you and read and start criticizing everybody else\nSo they get you to accept blame then you also admit that\nGigantic organizations are the only way to structure our lives and to protect everybody so it's it's simply a waving guilt people into accepting\nWhen they don't even know this is being done to

it folks I I've got two more stories that focus on the insanity of the left I mean and I'm not using the term loosely [noise] here's another one Susan Glasser staff writer at the New Yorker she writes a weekly column on life in Trump's\nWashington she writes a weekly column on life in Washington in Trump's war what life in Washington has become because the Trump once a week\nOf his piece the headline I listen to all six Trump rallies in October and you should to some had it's not a reality show it's real it's a long piece but do not misunderstand\nThis lady Susan B. Glasser listed in didn't watched six Trump rallies\nAnd she is up set that they're only on CSPAN she's mad that Fox is stopped covering them that CNN is stopped covering them that pie MSNBC uh stop covering them because she thinks they are damaging to Trump\nShe thinks if the people of this country saw these rallies that it would be the end of Trump She points out how Trump lies all the time how Trump exaggerates all the time\nShe totally miss understands the purpose of the rallies she does not exactly yes I predict that she does not get the connection or the bond between Trump attendees after rallies Trump supporters and Trump\nShe totally does not get this she\nDoes not know how to listen to prompt she does not know how to uh empathize with Trump\nRally at ten days she has no ability\nTo relate to Trump has his supporters do she watches these things and she is\nAppalled at Trump personally politically he lives all the time he ... he mocks people he makes fun of people he's meanwhile people at\nThese rallies or having the best time of their lives it's the highlight of their week to go to what Trump rally and this woman is studying him she's watching six of them so far this month\nAnd totally does not get it she\nIs missing the purpose of the rallies she does not see that this is Trump's mechanism for getting past the media she does not see that this is how Trump net gates and goes over the drive by me to something Reagan also master\n\nTheir masterful they are formulaic even though everybody thinks they're improv and Oscar if they are formulaic there are segments in every Trump rally and he follows them to achieve what he says differs in some cases\nBut the point is here's a drive by media specialist studying and totally doesn't get it\nIt's the exact opposite if these rallies were televised nationally as they used to be\nThere wouldn't be any talk of a blue wave anywhere except New York and\nCalifornia Rush Limbaugh cameras could use the word\n\nMy friends like you I Am thankful every day for the brave men and women to protect our freedom and our country now is Veterans Day approaches I Want to announce that my friends at Mahendra\nAre holding their fifth annual military salute give away the winner will receive a hindrance retriever utility vehicles that's right a brand new read my Hendra retriever one thousand gas model\nLast year's winner army captain Robert forty of Ohio is loving here's my handwritten you could be next\nSo frustrated at what she doesn't even know Stephen Miller she is just being told a bunch of stuff about it but maybe what he's doing now [noise] so I don't know what the big deal is saying he ate glue um [noise]\nWhat [noise] but she put it up and of course the media ran with it and they've had to withdraw because she had to withdraw because it wasn't true\nAnd it it's\nFairly common that these people on the left\nEngage in this kind of storytelling insult mongering here it is John ... never Trump or John ... the Democrats blue wave is drying up oh is that would be a disappointment\nDon't conjure elections before they're hatch that's the lesson of the past couple of weeks or so called fundamentals that supposedly govern the twenty Eighteen mid terms\nStill point do a good a great night for Democrats there the out party the out party generally does better than the party in power\nBut\nTune generic polling question this week have Democrats up twelve and Thirteen points respectively that would suggest a so called blue wave in which most house and Senate seats in play will likely to Democrat and it's in line with the twenty ten of Republican numbers around now\nYet yet we\nPointed out that all of these national generic polls show this gigantic way but if you go race by race\nIf you go into the state's district by district you don't see this way you don't see the evidence in the polling\nAnd people have been asked well how can this how can this disparity be how can you have a generic ballots that shows a Democrats plus proper plus Thirteen but then you don't find any single congressional race that shows Democrats plus twelve or Thirteen well it must mean the generic ballot doesn't mean much Muslims it's\nHow could it generic ballot dilemma name on it by this time when you start pulling people a month three weeks away from the election you start asking questions about how they're going to vote without a name and the question what do you think the result is going to be\nState level polls over the past two weeks showed no blue wave certainly not in the Senate\nThey suggested Democrats appear to have almost no serious chance of winning\nThe ... Senate that would require due to pick up three Republican seats and the whole ... every other seats if they have they held by incumbents that at this moment it's far more likely Republicans are going to pick up one of their seats so [noise] it's [noise]\nLet me go state by state the show where this is all happening and but the evidence against a blue wave is primarily in the Senate\nBut [noise]\nThe the conventional wisdom here is not rooted in specifics but conventional wisdom is rooted in just that conventional wisdom and hope\nThe left hope that this was a\nTraditional year party out of power wins big that's what they're hoping they've got their generic ballot polls which say that's exactly what's going to happen but then you go into the state's state by state race by race and you don't see it see why to close races some that could go either way\n\nBut they're still hanging on to hope they are reporting the hope they're reporting hoping hoping that reporting the hulk will turn the hope into reality\nNow before we get too much in the hour I Need to tell you a little bit about a movie that is a opening tonight it probably has opened in some cities all reading of certain theatres it's God's Nell\nThe trial of America's biggest\nSerial killer now ... there's an abortion doctor who got away with the ... murders in Philadelphia got away with the wanted murder\nOf thousands\nNobody can get the media interested in the story even after he was charged and convicted and put on trial and the reason is that correct guys know\nWas the worst thing that ever happened to people who want to keep abortion\nOf and categorized as something other than what it is\n\nThe media wouldn't cover it and nor the trials very much there have been a lot of people who did covered Michele market was one of the leaders also people at like ed Morsi an hot air was was hot on the trail of guys and I think they rolled over a hundred and sixty different articles\nSo the trick has been how do you do a movie about this how do you get it made me in\nMovie equals Hollywood how'd he get stars and again people start at how do you get money to finance it how do you get it made and how do you get a distributed and how do you find theaters\nThat will exhibits that thing how do you do or and they they ran into every predictable problem that you can imagine\nBut they ... and they got it done and the way they got this ... this is a movie about the trial of ... guys now it's it's it's a\nIt's a procedural moving like a procedural crop cop show crime in a cop show on TV meaning it follows a formula\nIt doesn't get overtly political it doesn't it doesn't want to limit the audience by getting political even with a trial this movie has a rating of PG Thirteen and it's about wanting abortion murder there is not a lot of hardly any\nAbhorrent Gore and violence in\nThe movie and it's to pick them in a in other ways it's not meant to shock it's meant to entertain and educate it's an attempt to you is a movie\nIn a responsible way to do things in movies are supposed to do entertain entertain entertain enlighten maybe inform it's not the political movie that the left would make\nAbout a story like this it can avoid the politics but it is exceptionally well done for the subject matter you're you're not going to be if you go see it you're not going to be watching people advocating for a cause\nYou're not going to see a movie designed to separate you from your money in terms of political fundraising you're gonna see Hollywood professionals who happen to be pro life producing a movie about something that really happened a mass murderer\nHe was a mass murderer of people in the room that nobody on the left wanted anybody to know about\nWhat he did Kermit guys now was despicable but he was a charming guy even engaging smile and laugh and even and this trial it was said that he was charming people now are oh buddy Nick Searcy\nDirected this\nAnd I don't know anything about directing movies but I can imagine some of the challenges in in a movie like this you don't want to preach and you don't want to make your movie target but you want to be truthful about it and you want\nThe message to be delivered\nBut you don't want to turn people off you don't want people to think that you're being they're they're they're being preached or any of that and so the\nWay I looked at it I didn't I didn't see Nick Searcy use a bunch of special effects or other things to distract you just let the story tell itself and it's basically the trial there some set up\nThe story itself is all anybody needs to know the number one mass murder in America which he was never referred to as as because of course the\nLeft abortion is not even human it's a viable tissue mass or what have you uh it's got\nStars people that you know people put their careers on the line to star in this movie the odds are that they're going to have trouble getting cast and other movies having been identified with this deem Kane is one\nOf the ah the actor who plays a guy's now himself as a as an actor and I think ... commercials name as Earl Billings and for somebody\nThat's only widely known as an actor in TV commercial this guy does one heck\nOf a job it's probably the finest\nRole that he's played for the best performance that he's had a I Would guess a as an actor but I just want to let you know that if it if you're thinking about going to states PG Thirteen we're not talking ... we're not we're not even talking\nOurs here so you're not going to be immersed in a bunch of\nRepulsive Gore and again it's it's thought that they don't need to do that tell the story the story itself tells itself\nThe trial of America's biggest serial killer there are a lot of people who have\nMohammed bin Salman known popularly my friends is NBS he's thirty\nTwo millennials got all these reform plans that July August show he didn't think he really means and think they were true been very very critical juncture show me want to get married\nHe had to get a legal marriage license or a document chose to go to the Soviet sorry Saudi consulate in Istanbul and nobody has seen him since he went in and now the Turks say they have audio recordings\nThat prove he was murdered in little side the\nPresident of the United states has talked about this and it's a very serious thing but says look we have an outstanding deals with the Saudis that we cannot derailed just because of this\nIs this outrage the media even though Trump\nWas initially very hard on Saudi Arabia claiming if this happened than if it was proven this is very very bad and we're not going to look beyond away while here is it about Lebanon and this was this [noise] this is one of the things I shoot myself I should figure to wait for not having predicted this yesterday when I told you the story [noise]\nWe have a tweet here from a guy named Daniel Klaidman now he's the editor in chief at Yahoo\nYahoo News here's his tweets\nA close friend of Washington Post columnist Jamal ... tells Michael is a cough and me that the\nSaudi crown prince Mohammed bin ... may have felt emboldened in parentheses to murder the journalist\nBy Trump's anti media rhetoric Trump hates journalists and he would not react if we kill one journalist says colleague indeed ... fury [noise] and so now with democracy all gave\nThought to have been murdered and dismembered\nAnd by the way they think now that he's been buried in a plot of grass in the console the back yard and the console is not leaving when the console as their Turkish officials cannot get in and search\nOr to dig up you know the old diplomatic immunity thing so now Yahoo News the American media\nIs attempting here to blame Donald Trump for this Donald Trump and his open disdain and criticism of the media\nIs said to have made Mohammed bin ... comfortable with the fact that he can get away with murder and journalist because Donald Trump made him think it'd be okay this is what the American media is now [noise]\nBeginning district you know this is just a tweet from a Yahoo guy quoting cough but this don't be surprised\nIf there starts

the headline with his face legal abortion is vilified by the pro life cause no movie which inadvertently shows the dystopia of a post row America so whereas we have a bunch of journalists trying to blame Donald Trump\n\nFor inspiring Mohammed been so long to murder a sort of a Saudi\nJournalist [noise] now we have this NBC piece which is basically saying\nThat what this movie is inadvertently showing is what will happen if abortion ever becomes illegal guys like God's noble spring up everywhere that guys now could not have become the mass murderer he became\nIf abortion would have been the legal which is a crock he did his murder\nRing after abortion to become legal [noise] but they're trying to say everybody you know you better you better not get what you wish for here because if you
