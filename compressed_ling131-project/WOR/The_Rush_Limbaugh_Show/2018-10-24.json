any sense to show so much hatred for Trump to try to overwhelm the system and what's so much apparent hatred for Trump and Republicans\nThat other people joined up other people decide they've got to

average American voters\nPerceive it\n[noise] okay let's get some of the election analysis them in terms are\nThirteen Days away two weeks ago from yesterday\nTom ... who was cofounded real clear politics and it is a it's a website that many political scientists political operatives\nA political experts cite constantly what what real clear politics does among many other things is average all of the so called response civil polls out there and do something called a real clear politics average of polls\nAnd political experts from across the aisle site real clear politics and trusted as an unassailable source so combat and cofounder of this place was on a C Fox Business network today\nHe said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point meaning it'd be building we'd be we'd be seeing the top of here and Tom Bevan sat in all the polling data that they had a real clear politics and analyzing it's not there is no\nCrafting there is no blue wave if a wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't\n\nBut on the other hand the generic ballot is holding\nMeaning the Democrats are not running away with it they still have a depending on three to five point lead and the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage ... says but they're not building on anything there's no way and that's gonna wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how he described it\nHe forecast that Democrats might win the house that they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of Seventy competitive races\nAnd the range of pick up as they look at polling data now is anywhere from Democrats picking up ten to forty one is seats they're projecting a democratic\nPickup of twenty five and a half seats which given the slightest bit Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house the range of the pickup according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats\nThey project a pick up a twenty five seats twenty five an absolute two and a half seats more than they need but with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races there GOP can hold the house [noise]\nSo all of this synthesized and stripped away and I went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave there isn't this blue wave that's going to sweep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing\nThe generic ballot is not moving in Democrats' favor Trump's approval numbers are rising\nAll her on the Senate side that Ben and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats two weeks ago they were predicting no change\nThe Republicans wouldn't gain or lose any two weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the past month we've gone from Democrats picking up a couple two Republicans gaining a couple and that's the momentum and that's the trend\nAnd he made the point that it's a whole new world with Trump\nGender gap education gap the rural urban gap all of these things don't mean mean nearly as much as they have in the past

know that they're on sale at every event here yet but I mean the Clinton sucked on anybody's radar right now\nI mean the closest that happens is you know when Trump goes to a rally and they start talking about the deep state and Hillary and her ... and the FBI trend the shaft Trump on his phony collusion story the lock her up lock her up but I mean the Clintons are not considered political opponents right now and Obama certainly is and\nI don't know I ... and and now with somebody left us tweeting this is typical this is Donald Trump has engendered\nSo much hatred and so much anger wife in the mirror here's not say that just it's just too packed\nIt it's just it's it it it's too obvious it is becoming what\nIn form ... and a educated suspicion about this wouldn't tell you that it is

sure the drive by spin on this will be that uh\nWe have a dangerous dreams right we're out there putting these bombs in the mail [noise]\nYou know if that really were the case where it is a redneck right wing hillbilly which I'm sure that's how this will be run by the media where do they go about getting a mailing address is already George Soros Hillary Clinton Iraq saying oh\nYou know that that information out there for the masses to obtain you know there was never any country to use devices to make their way to their intended target whoever put them in the mail\nAnd I don't know if it's right on me to point fingers at certain de but my gut is telling me this is a left wing smokescreen wanted for them to be discovered\nThe Democrats they've proven time and time again there's simply no load that they won't stoop to everything from they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and might video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to they'd even gone so far as to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't do something that well it ...\nAlong along those lines if you want to look at it\nThat way it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning these elections just makes no sense\nTo do this is going to be\nInstant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and our history there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flip\nThat flip that around\nWould it make a lot of sense for a democratic operative word Democrat in cocaine and a lunatic to do it because\nThings are not working out the way they thought do not forget this is why I'm spent so much time dwelling on this today\nAnd the psychology that's that that's attached to this this is not going the way they have assured us for the last nine months it was going to go more importantly it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe their lives remember they believe their pollsters\nIf the pollsters telling there is a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and they believe it and they start reporting it and they just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trek backfires and these mobs are backfiring they are not achieving their objectives\n[noise] so if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab Lee a tweet here it's really strange ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nMake it did U.S Russia a truly an honor to speak with you so well I was holding for you a couple of things popped in my head and I'll get to the point two seconds\nThese are all deep state leaders that these quote unquote bombs are going to Hillary and and you know and and homo and all these guys and then Brennan the deep state\nAnd this is right out of the play the Clinton playbook if you ah go back in time to I Believe it was two thousand eight when Hillary was going against uh Hussein Obama\nThe uh iron my shirts folk started coming out I don't know if you recall that or not I'm sure you do with your memory\nOh yeah and I think I'm responsible for that because of a joke I used to ...\nYeah and so Michele milk and you know put that to bed as far as it was you know it was a plant\nWill tell people what it was ... tell me because I stepped on it tell people what it is\nOh sure sure so back in two thousand and eight or in order to garner sympathy and empathy for the health of east\nUm there was a gentleman or series of gentleman that were walking around the Hillary camp for president campaign of two thousand and eight with signs saying iron my shirts iron my shirts of course because of you know can have a woman for president those you know those sexist Republicans\nRight watcher of born to do Hillary and be a domestic beer housewife an iron my shirts didn't fix dinner and got my slippers that kinda thing right\nIt was a point it was a plant it and it was all it was all nonsense to garner apathy in\nSeparate it was already planning to go to waste their was Hillary's plant there was nobody legitimately anti Hillary doing that right correct\nThat's another time telling you I gave them the idea but anyway I don't want to step on it keep going with the story\nSo so anyway Michelle melting came up with a good teeth and basically but it's a bad from a follow up that this was a plan\nAnd it was all a facade like everything is with the Clintons at great professor called the ... rush she taught me one time with the ... there are no coincidence is and there are no ah you there's nothing that's set in stone with these people not everything is manufactured everything is made up\nAnd so I don't trust them look at Nancy Pelosi down in Miami\nFor someone who was quote unquote running for her life millionaire Nancy was taking her time walking down the stairs or somebody who's open the door for her while she shouted at I Believe that's a set up I don't want to sound like a conspiracy care steer but take a look at it it's a bunch of nonsense\nAnd I don't trust the
