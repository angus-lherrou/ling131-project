{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "Um to this day the one thing I Wish I had done\nIs make note of the make and model of the ATV and asked them how did you get past the road block how did you get that ATV back onto this road\nThe two girls there's no way they could have lifted any weight and even to adult men that looked like lumberjacks again they look just like the people in the Bronx and paper towels\nWould have had a hard time picking up a like a four hundred pound ATV and somehow getting it over this huge trench in mound of dirt\nThey looked at me odd they said they were up there scouting areas to hunt the two twin girls in the backseat\nLooked like they were in their Sunday Best church clothes I Can't remember this was a long time ago I Can't remember specifically if they were wearing dresses but I Swear to goodness it looked like they just came out of church they might have been in dress is not what you would expect for going out scouting hunting\nAreas in the rain forest in the woods [noise] um they were like blonde hair blue eyes again just like of aliens came down here and said how do we blend in and looked like humans\nIt was like they were too perfect not a flaw not expected dirt know dirt on their face their hair was perfectly comb their clothes I didn't even see a a a single wrinkle the cloud shirts were tucked into their waistline not seem like you would expect out in the woods in the middle of nowhere\nSo they just comment you were looking for a place to go hunting as they're driving by or did they stopped to chat\nThey kind of stopped and chatted they they see me they see me coming down the road and so they hold off and they kind of parked a little bit and I I stopped in I I chatted with them probably\nProbably two minutes probably two three minutes of course I was on my way down to the lake\nAnd like I said I've got this logical brain that seems to just kind of reason away anything and all these weird events that I've had in my life sometimes don't sink in until after the fact and you know I started thinking about it well wait a minute how did they even get that ATV\nOnto the road that show [laughter] alone how weird their appearance was I mean I was struck by how odd it was at the time but um\nYou know I just kind of reason to the way that well there are people but I tell you up in those woods there'd been some strange strange events uh I I called in a while back I talk to you when you talk to the big foot researcher that the records their their sounds\nIt was in those sim woods where I heard this ah ungodly sound that couldn't be any other animal and I don't think of the best opera singer POV raunchy could have imitated the sound\nAnd I'd encourage you to find out what coast to coast did with the audio tape they used to play of this a legit big foot recording ten or more years ago George ... used to play it\nI think art bell used to play it hasn't been played for years but I heard that up in the shame woods it's a unique recording never heard of it before\nI'm starting to buying more and more to the fact that these big puts might be dimensional\nMight have a a extraterrestrial connection these humanoid that I saw in the woods the more I think about it there's\nI'm Ninety nine point nine percent sure those\nBernard humans and hindsight I'm just glad they didn't take me whatever they were doing up in that area\nWell we're glad to cause a ... you wouldn't have been able to call in presumably thank you Jason for sharing that story that's a that's a pretty strange you need to start carrying some recording equipment with you wherever you go thanks very much try to get one more caller in close to home here Brian in Las Vegas hey Brian what's on your mind\nOn a couple of comments on the on the Michigan for one one one on\nPrevious callers and maybe to get the story in real quick\nUm I had kind of a big good experience and it wasn't until he played this year sounds like coast to coast they realize that that's what I heard was that um the Willamette to for national forest a lot of ill between um non bachelor and a three sisters in Oregon\nAnd um it was up there a late night watch the stars and hanging out and then they'll likely music stuff sometimes I just kind of hang out more which were quiet and there's nobody around her hours up there and went down at looking at stars through the ...\nAnd I heard that same sound that he's talking about as best as I Know what he's talking about [noise] um and it at a weird psychic effect I don't know anybody else it had this experience but um it was kinda like hey what are you doing up here and in\nA second guessing but oil and really far away and the you know maybe I'm just imagining that and\nSo I kept hanging out and look at the stars in about ten minutes and they closed oh I'd say at least three five miles in maybe ten minutes and it did the same sound again only the the impression or psyche can personally at all it was like hey I'm coming at you\nAnd me I jumped in my car so bad and got out of there\nAnd you know I never really piece it together when it was you know um my girlfriend and I will do a lot of reading was one of the coast to coast and when they're theorists down it was like oh my God that's what it is it has a musician so I listen to overtones
