this portion of our first morning news ... by ... care well President Trump gave a wide ranging interview to CBS or sixty minutes last night and joining us lived down\nTo ah talk a little bit more about that NBC Radio corresponding my ... my given all that he said last night on an interview is there one thing that stood out more than another to you\n[noise] well I think the main thing that stood out was it was a very defiant President Trump spoke to sixty minutes last night he was defined climate scientist intelligence specialist and and probably\nThe one that stood out the most me even his own defense secretary uh there were times where he Leslie stall sort of verbally Sparta at one point the president saying I'm the president and you're not a but scrutiny of facts aside one of the big things that I found interesting was how he kind of um had\nIn his opinion more knowledge than General Mattis did when it comes to the world of late when asked if the gentleman just sat down with President Trump and\nPresident Trump concerned about paying for a NATO and being the one who's telling the line for all the other countries involved general Madison asked\nHim or told him to actually that this was a set of NATO was in order to prevent any future world wars president President Trump said no that's not true he said I like General Mattis but I think I Know more about it than he does he also said he wasn't sure how long that it was going to be sticking around in the Trump Administration and that he called mad as a Democrat\nAt one point in time uh that seemed to be one of the bigger takeaways that I had from the interview\nAll right and uh on the matter of the Russia investigation or you're really kind of really didn't answer the question about whether or not he's going to shut it down\nHe actually said that he wouldn't pledge to Leslie stall that moment that he would he would call it safe and that it would continue the investigation he said he wouldn't pledge that he wouldn't floods that to anybody at that point but then he had no intent at this point are shutting it down\nOkay very good I mean the radio natural corresponding my ... thank you Mike is now five

either the media Research Center says in the past four months the booming Trump economy got only fourteen minutes\nOf positive network reporting by the way in order to Republican president will be

didn't create a surging economies said you'd know how they didn't even think it was possible\nIt does not take a magic wand it takes real world know how and an understanding of economics in
