additional Jill until then be said for\nOh ride more on Kavanaugh allow and for that let's bring in our national corresponded my bar and a might Kavanaugh he is a Supreme Court justice he will be joining the court today\nAnd much is being made just about how bruising this process has been so there has to be some healing or outside the court of course but within the court as well I think things might be a bit dicey\nA on a personality bases inside the court on these first days\nI think there's ... that you have to be seen but yeah I think that's going to play a part of things as well especially in the seems to be the case for people who are of former Supreme Court justice and you're seeing this as a people form the law school Yale Law school former dean of yellow school saying that they believe that there's a possibility that there\nIs a concern in regards to cabinet and his poise how he will remain poised on the bench will remain poison the bench they seem to be going back to his parents in front of the Senate Judiciary committee as a point in time where people need to\nBe concerned about a person who can keep his cool and that's what they're really looking for when you're looking for somebody to be a Supreme Court justice under very tough situation somebody who can keep their cool\nWe'll have to see if that's something that the Supreme Court justice can do\nWell keep his cool and yet at the same time I think the attacks on him and his family are seen by many many on the Republican side as having been unprecedented so he's being forgiven at least by those people in the Republican side for having a essentially lost his temper\nYeah that is definitely true but there is if the the point that people are out on the Democratic side are trying to make here is with that um\nThe ability to get on the ... on on the Supreme Court\nYou have to have this ability to be even\nHanded they're saying that you don't you don't want to hear it on any level as if you're bringing politics the table which is very difficult to do when you've had judge Kavanaugh screaming about the Democrats coming after him and his family and screaming about the Obamas screaming about the Clintons all of that\nElement of things is is the image that we're all seeing in our mind which is why you've had not only a Supreme Court just the past but you also had chief justice John Roberts over the weekend receiving more than a dozen judicial\nMisconduct complaints in recent weeks against Kavanaugh centering on statements Kevin I made during his Senate confirmation hearing so while the Republicans are running this off to somebody who is just defending\nHimself and his family I think there are some other concerns Ali judicial level that will need to be addressed as well\nAll right
