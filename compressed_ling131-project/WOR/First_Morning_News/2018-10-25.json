joining us live NBC Radio natural corresponded my power or let's talk about the second one was supposedly a second one coming from what El Salvador is that really mobilized or not\nAnd then what we're seeing Joe now is reports possibly even a third one coming\nSo you've got the massive caravan of striking in Mexico right now still more than a thousand miles away from the border but other groups are following in her footsteps you've got the second one is form you know Salvador editing another migrant a caravan of about two thousand people expected to each Guatemala City\nAs a Wednesday so and then there's this third one of migrants expected to leave Central America within the next week they're using what's app\nHas it been collecting point to have discussions about where\nTo gather what to wear those kinds of things as all they're all trying to escape poverty and violence and that could be a total of about ten thousand people that may be making their way to the U.S border over the next week here so\nI'm not getting the president's ah suggested he may send the military oh he ... his last name was well let's see what happens\nYeah and we're we I think he wants to see what some of these countries are doing in the meantime right so we do that in Mexico seven units several units of the Mexican police our company in a caravan for security reasons but\nAh that same spokesperson that was talking about those groups also said that um the there's been a an unsuccessful attempt by the military and police to stop the people advancing Guatemala the government said that it was adopted measures to stop the entry more migrants from Honduras and El Salvador but the attempts does far from Guatemala and Mexico\nThey haven't been able to stop the flow whatsoever in El Salvador uh the president completely taking a different stance they're criticizing President Trump for announcing that he would cut a dead El Salvador\nEl Salvador other Central American countries for not preventing the immigrants are leaving so right now nobody seems to be doing anything from those countries down there to prevent these people coming forward I think the president just wanted to see what that official word is from those countries sarin\nAnd is there any explanation for how these people are fed and cared for along the way\nIt would seem as though along the way a lot of this and again they seem to be collecting through different techniques technological aspects now they've got phones where they're able to a new WhatsApp\nAnd other areas they're collecting talking finding places we do know that there are a religious groups and organizations along the way that are feeding people a priest that are taking care of them as well it seems to be a collective\nUh as they stop in certain areas or they're talking amongst themselves to let others know that in this area of this church this organization is taking carrying a feeling that seems to be the way that they're going at

wintertime with snow fall now if this was January\nWe'd be having a different discussion of God or either way it looks like Saturday is gonna be a mess a strong onshore flow strong winds forty plus miles per hour some gusts that means coastal beach erosion coastal flooding heavy rainfall at times the good news though is that it is progressive\nMeaning that it will move along some more details on that at the bit this morning a little show on the air there's a light northwest breeze most of us have temperatures in the upper thirties to the loaded with forties it's inside and outside the city in the five boroughs\nAnd with a light breeze it feels like loaded with thirty so man maybe a little bite in the early also clear sky mixing with clouds and I think to go through the day sunshine should win it but only around fifty cold I thirty eight so even cooler in the city than we are this morning or so that naturally would mean the suburbs of even colder\nAnd then friday will start to see the clouds increase from South west to northeast fifty two and then the windows start picking up friday night with the rain starting to come on and most of our rain though I think comes in the first\nHalf to three quarters of Saturday So periods of rain and windy sustained winds east north east Fifteen twenty five miles per hour gusts maybe over forty miles per hour and temperatures only and below fifty Saturday\nSo picture it raining and some windswept brain Joe at temperatures in the low fifties I'm staying inside\nAnd then on Sunday thing grew away so Saturday quick mover cook shuttering some heavy rain and spots impactful but still it's going to be going by Sunday another week system will try to come through Monday what some rain showers\nAnd hospital stay in the low fifties and I think that's ever going to trend next week Joe oh probably staying a little bit below average might be a little brief warm up as we get in the first couple of days of\nCan't believe I'm going to say November late next week but uh own all looks like the early part of the week we're still going to stay in the low fifties and we should be out are just about sixty this time of year aren't\nVery good major Rogers race stage with our forecast find three fourths of the time President Trump says federal investigators will find out who mailed those suspected explosive devices to the media and several high profile democratic figures\nThe president called the actions despicable instead of a major federal investigation is underway noted there's no place for any kind of political violence in the U.S

correspond to build them for has been looking into that or who the suspect bill\nWell I'll tell you what Joe right now this investigation is very wide open of course when you look at the people who received those these are devices in packages you would say that uh it hey this is easy to figure out that these are all people that President Trump has lashed out against\nAnd has made targets of his criticisms a and a ... and that could be the reason however a there is a theory out there as well but those on the left\nOr maybe doing this in order to put the Republican Party and the Trump Administration\nIn the crosshairs and and set them up and there are those who say this is merely again and attempt by someone to disrupt the midterm elections in some way\nSo right now the investigation is looking at a wide open possibility of who may be responsible but I'll tell you what Joe uh right now the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia is looking at these devices and due to the fact that none of them detonated none of them went off\nThere is a treasure trove of information from the packaging to fingerprint information possible DNA information to the devices themselves all of
