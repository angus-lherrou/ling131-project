that there is a lineage going back that would indicate some form of Native American blood in her history now what that blood is what tribe that may be none of that is indicative of the DNA test you don't find out any of that information it just says\nThat at this point possibly even going back into the Seventeen hundreds\nIt's very possible that there there were probable that there was some form of Native American blood in her family so\nAt this point President Trump is you've heard saying that he does not over any money in fact that there was sort of some details in his speech it needed to be brought up which would include her getting the nomination or that he was going to have her tested and now he's saying that he will only pay the million dollars to a charity of her choice if indeed
