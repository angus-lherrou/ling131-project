some fringe effects because a friend come until it from the west and that's going to bring our best chance for showers and thunder storms now\nAs we get into tomorrow afternoon it's kind of tricky because depending on the forward speed of Michael and depending on where the location of the front is Joe and they actually look like that some of that moisture from Michael's going to try to get drawn into that front so\nA little tricky but either way we're not going to get wins the tropical storm force and certainly in expecting any flooding rainfall at least not at this time so\nSouth of us and we're talking like South Jersey probably even further south that we will see some impacts from a powerful category for storms could make history Joe yeah they haven't had a category ... storm ever

Carolinas where they're going to get more flooding rainfall\nIt's going to be moving quickly so um we're not going to see record rain but enough to cause additional flooding me there's flood watches lined up all the way from the panhandle through the Carolinas and southeast Virginia too so um some of the tropical moisture as we said may try to get drawn into the front it's approaching so um it's going to be close and as it comes on then to organize some great weather coming up\nAs we look ahead towards the end of the week are still little ugly out there this morning clouds them some breaks
