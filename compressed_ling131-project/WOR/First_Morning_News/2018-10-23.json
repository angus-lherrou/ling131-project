war soldiers but you could still have these types of operations\nAnd I think that's really a one of the most fascinating things that I go over in the book because a lot of people have these experiences and then people kind of go well no one guy there that did that so you must be mistaken or maybe somebody was traveling through or this or that\nSo I Hope that helps them sort of get a better idea of what could be happening in that situation\nLet's go to Chris in Columbus ohio Hi Chris go ahead\nOh Georgia since you're a gift there has been a in Ohio northeastern part yeah I've got to ask I Believe he did a show from there the man's bill reform and tore\nYep we sure did and every time I go there and there's something it's electricity and if I could I'd like to share a love story\nWith you sure okay my mother and full blooded Cherokee of call been quite a few times\nA follower ... but anyway uh my father died and three months later my mom she's really depressed\nDidn't know how things were going to work out you know to put two kids and just before daylight woke up my father was there became in her bedroom sit down on the bed mom set up\nYou have your kids through and said honey everything's going to be All right both beautiful and the strongest power of everything is love and I was going to share that\nWith sweet mhm\nThese sometimes these stories are just emotional is will they do\nYeah yeah you know I mentioned a little bit before it's these aren't negative experiences for the most part it in in my in the ... and the accounts that I go over with these people that have people I've met over the years\nYou know sixty sixty seven percent I think are more positive than they are negative\nAnd it's this idea of someone coming back saying goodbye saying you know it's okay um ... you know these are positive experiences in their life changing\nAnd they ... from the connectedness that you had with this love one and and these are important things in life we talked about before it could heal some sort of psychological wounds and help you move through the grief process\nSo this phenomenon could be used as a coping skill and there's a lot of research out there that says that there's sometimes paranormal experiences are used as coping skills um so you know I always shutter when it's always negative negative negative negative goes goes goes scary scary scary\nScary right not like that in real life so to join the Bronx side Joseph going hey George how are you Joe\nGood I'm Brendan yeah I wanted to ask you a question then maybe you really a story about a full up origin or seen um [noise]\n... um the question is do you think that there is some luminal undo channel of communication going on\nBetween the go see a permission and the recipient of that goes to experience um maybe perhaps subconsciously there's this supplemental um communication to weigh communication going going that precipitate the uh goes we have permission appearing\nAnd I had a full reparation experience or after my brother passed away um I was ... and and I was having writer's block on his song and I've really destroyed before on coast to coast [laughter] um my brother comes into the room [noise]\nUm he looks the way he did when he passed away in the hospital\nI'm short of 'em and uh it's it's during the day or at the foot of my bed he walks by and he speaks to me and says just get it done and then disappears into and all\nThat um can you may be elaborate on what could have precipitated this\nOr does your does your brother pass away or who he was he a this was after he passed away how long ago that he passed away\nA city a ... before you had the experience maybe maybe maybe maybe uh fourteen years\nOkay All right I'm while answer your second question then we'll get back to the first question will quick so I I think it's kind of similar to the what we talked about earlier you know without the husband saying his wife and then the wife kind of says hey check behind the workbench and he finds a pumpkin there\nThis is an idea where you sort of gather information from the environment\nUm possibly connecting are resonating with his consciousness and communication is is happening in other words he's saying get on with a complete your song those types of things he's giving you the motivation because that's something you need at that point it's like that guy needed to find that pumpkin you needed some motivation\nSo you resonate with the consciousness of your brother and I and when you resonate with something\nIt's not just information it's the visual stuff as well\nUm and the idea you talked about before as far as that I'm unconscious communication between people there's a lot of cases out there like that there was one case in my book that I go over where a I'm a guy wakes up in the middle of the night and he has this\nFeeling like his dog is in trouble and he has this visual operation of a dog you know laying in the water and injured\nAnd you can't communicate with a dog but he could somehow I feel like the dog is trying to communicate with him and they're kind of reading each other's emotions and then then he you know wakes up cars finds a dog and\nThat type of thing so you know why there isn't physical communication or words there's some sort of like I'm understanding or telepathy or reading a mind type thing\nWhere do we get the book to go study sprinted\nAh the go studies is available at Barnes and noble odds that Amazon dot com if you like listening to books on radio or I'm In a car you can
