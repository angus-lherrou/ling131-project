said it's in my book consciousness inhaling he talks about how the ancient mistakes didn't develop fees\nMeditation practices in order to do better in a board room or relieve stress from the busy lives we lead but really to get to a state of enlightenment and and a personal\nRevelation and I think that's what you're saying there are these traps people get almost virtuous around you know I've done this or that or the other thing but it isn't you know completely reflective of the grounding that's essential as we live into these insights\nMaryland do you think the believer is a little happier than the non believer\nThey say that I mean optimism is more prevalent with people who you know have this kind of faith and in the future of faith in society faith in each other\nWell somebody like Michael ... who's a skeptic so he's looking for evidence you can't find it so he doesn't believe a easy happy within themselves\nWell I you know if you asked Michael and I did a he would say yes he doesn't think that it's necessary to have\nThis more enchanted world view in order to feel happy that he approaches his life with a great deal of purpose with a sense of marvel all wonder\nUh and at the same time he you know has developed this line of where he is willing to move and and part of it I also think happens when people get overly identified with a particular position\nYou know so you are in that role of the ... the skeptic or you're in the role of the proponents and it doesn't leave a lot of space for that interplay of curiosity and just you know questioning\nIt's almost five

Pfizer reincarnation someone or if or most of these people who had this experience\nBecause they believe in God and that if it changed your opinion are swayed it one way or the other I Would be under the impression that if most people have felt that they had been reincarnate or that they had a um a near death experience but it it would I Would definitely justify\nWithout ... without a doubt that yes there is a higher power being called dog cheeses whatever the person's religion may be or a ... to ... to come up with the thought that\nWe're continuing on and on for a reason of other that yet we cannot understand but yet if that is a plan there is somebody in a grand plan and make her who has this all worked out ahead of time it it's just not like you say there's no such thing as coincidence\nThat's exactly right what do you think of that Maryland\n[noise] I Do think that people who have these kinds of experiences begin to reflect on a world view that is\nMore imbued with meaning and less reduced to material is um I think that's really important and I think that um you know the mystical world view are engaged in questioning a wonder you know love\nA doesn't necessarily translate into a conventional story around one is God I think that sense of reverence for the mystery maybe a good way to hold\nThat sense that there's something more reality and that there are different story lines from different traditions that can help us to explain it\nIf you went out and pulled people and simply said do you believe\nIn life after death what do you think they'd say\nI think the majority of people do believe that\nYou think so and I think it would also\nDepend on where you ask the questions or if you're in India for example it's kind of a given if you are I'm In a

transit has now and did\nYou do have to raise it on a path train's Newark two World Trade is one of the journal square and thirty third that is because the trap work over by journal square on the north side of the New England freeway Ninety five heading into theaters street things in front of downs of construction in the process of being cleared away your I found\nScientists looking okay and no problems on the freeway heading in Westchester County across the\nBridge George Washington bridge and down up or the left lane is posed under the new the apartments that fat construction should be wrapped up at any moment of Lincoln ... kind of okay I'll take my parking rules are in fact I next traffic updates coming up in ten minutes on second hand on the last\nFive eleven we'll get to the weather is just a moment but our top story this morning a procedural vote expected today on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court has joined the NBC Radio national correspondent my power to see where the votes are are the votes there to get this thing through Mike\nThat's a big question just the FBI ... released its report yesterday in regards to the investigation of the sexual allegations against Brett Kavanaugh to you know you saw drama huge like going back to who shot Jay arguing and for those millennials when courting car dash and refuse to be in Kim's video games\nOr what we're looking at here is at this point to one clear cut of the swing vote\nHas says that she's one hundred percent not going to vote in favor and that is the red state senator Heidi Heitkamp she gave an emotional no they're still for their senators that haven't said where they stand at this point Susan Collins really just saying that she thought there was a thorough investigation that had been done Jeff Flake sort of mirroring what Susan Collins said\nBut said that he was going to continue to release Murkowski\nHas had her car's a bit closer to the chest owning she's still working on reading but then yesterday met with dozens of sexual assault survivors from her home in Alaska and then Joe mansion or as yet to offer any sort of definitive take on the FBI FBI report and said that Heidi made her decision I'll make mine so right now still up in the air on those swing votes\nSo I mean if you had to happen now that the votes or not there\nIt doesn't sound like it yeah even when we had the call yesterday for the cloture vote for Mitch McConnell kind\nOf seems like the votes weren't there if the votes happened yesterday you definitely would not have the votes now they're still leaning here right Susan Collins may be leaning towards the plus I think that there was a complete investigation from the at the same thing with Jeff Flake they could\nBe leaning that direction the question is going to be how are they actually get a vote they may actually still vote this morning that they are in favor of moving forward to the main four vote for judge Kavanaugh but then to say that they're still undecided in regards to that do so but it's still a lot of drama that could happen this morning even when at nine thirty they reconvene for the procedural vote\nAnd there's also heard that there's a some senator I think from Nebraska who is not going to be there on Saturday because he's at his daughter's wedding so he's\nLooking again one of the senators from I Believe about than it was so they are yes from Montana who said that he wasn't gonna be there 'cause his daughter's wedding but he would still be there to cast his vote no matter what he was going to be there to vote for cabinet on some level if needed\nA very good All right thank you might get NBC Radio national correspondent my power five Thirteen is our time\nLet's get into the weather now meteorologist re

with prime minister Shinzo Abe's and their foreign minister should be a good friendly meeting talking about regional issues as well as a issues between the United states in Japan then it's off the north Korea\nOr this was thought to be the highlight of this trip he will sit down face to face with Kim Jong on\nAgain talking about that ever elusive denuclearization and yes they will talk about the second summit between President Trump and Kim Jong on trying to lay the groundwork for that\nThen he goes down to South Korea on Sunday and Monday and meet with President Moon Jae in and their foreign minister again North Korea will be a big topic there but they'll just got the other things as well now\nThen he goes on to Beijing on Monday where he will meet with\nQuote Chinese officials were not sure even if he will get to meet with high level Chinese officials we know he won't meet with President G.\nI. and this comes in the wake of not only a U.S allegations of election meddling and illegal drug peddling but yesterday vice president Mike Pence delivered just a scathing speech\nAlleging that uh what China is doing is nothing or or or well past what or things like Russia is doing in the United states or they came out of already responded and saying what the vice president said yesterday was ridiculous and deny a anything involved in that\nSo there should be a very
