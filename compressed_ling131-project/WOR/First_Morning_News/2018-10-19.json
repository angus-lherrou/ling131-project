the southeast is water every other night and read it comes up pretty close now we have had and I don't I don't know by memory but\nI Know in El Nino winters we've had some of our bigger snowstorm so\nWe don't correlate warmer than average with less snow or you know what I'm saying it's warmer than average but it doesn't really tell you by how much you know if we could do that but you know that's the trend and obviously that's just an outlook it's Ninety they outlook um\nWe'll have we do with three days but yeah that is at least\nWhat you've got trouble with three days I Know how you

bill\nYeah I think we may be able to have this off Joe uh Mexico has reportedly come up with a plan that sounds viable uh they're asking the un high commissioner for refugees\nAre due to help them and what they're going to be doing is setting up shelters along the southern Mexico border we understand that some of these carbon members are already reaching that southern Mexico border they're going to set up shelters there where the un will help them identify legitimate asylum claims\nSo when the people arrived they're going to be interviewing them trying to determine if they have a legitimate claims\nAnd those who who have legitimate claims will be allowed into Mexico those who are rejected would be sent directly back to their home country Honduras Guatemala or even now people from El Salvador joining this caravan as well\nSo it looks like we have a plan in place of course whether that can be executed remains to be seen those who try to evade this system and I can get around it and
