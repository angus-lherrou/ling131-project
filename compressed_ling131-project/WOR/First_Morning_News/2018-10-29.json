this Monday morning and welcome back and re from the weather channel more than ... you know so over the weekend\nThat Saturday day lose your brain how bad did it end up being was the flooding just a in places where it normally floods ... people were were the people see surprise waters in certain\nPlaces and some people might have been surprised to me so saw some coastal flooding there was water in Long Island in some spots I think it was more the areas that were prone to flooding during these east coast type snowstorms I didn't hear of any surprises I'm sure there was a couple of people out there there were but\nHey we're saying there was going to be an impact all of the weather service had coastal flood warning out so the timing was right between twelve and three PM on Saturday we had over an inch of rain fall um lifted its way a not a bad day yesterday some leftover shower some gusty winds at times and now\nWe're seeing a second weaker area of low pressure swing through this morning Mitt is bringing a few thunder storms down the eastern half of Long Island so I'm\nHeading that way to get out of your ... you're going to be driving pretty fast to catch them if you're coming out of the city having on ... but\nThe bottom line is we're going to see the showers this morning and even if you're thunderstorms especially east than even as you get into Connecticut\nAnd then this afternoon mostly cloudy still chance of showers however uh the temperatures are going to stay in the mid fifties\nMost of the day and most of the range should be done this morning and there's really not going to be all that much except in the previously mentioned areas\nTo break up the clouds forty two city thirty suburbs tomorrow mostly sunny and about fifty five and the Halloween more sun ... dry and mild Halloween in the mid sixties in the afternoon most likely falling into the upper fifty sitting here sixty\nThere in the evening hours and then Thursday class and upper sixties without a chance of showers again until maybe\nA friday so the book adds dome of this week today and friday got showers but in between you know the bulk of the story is actually pretty good\nAnd we get fall which we haven't had real yeah thank you very much All right You're welcome thanks for\nDetails emerging about the life and possible motives of Robert Bowers who is accused of opening fire on the Pittsburgh synagogue service Saturday morning killing eleven people investigators say ours was active on some fringe social media outlets where he expressed his hatred against Jews and immigrants ABC Matt Gutman has\nMore hold that he didn't conduct any significant surveillance on this particular synagogue or in this area [noise] um but this is obviously one of the biggest and most well known and longest established synagogues in this area that has many synagogues and\nApparently he chose it because it was the biggest the most well known target\nYou know we're learning more and more about him NBC Radio news radio national correspondent bills him for his joining us on the news making more than bill\nHey good morning in ... this is really another sign of course all this really came into the spotlight\nOr where the incidents not only in Pittsburgh and of course the the the bombing incidents last week the uh the devices that were found\nBut and it really has brought to the spotlight the number of hate groups there are in the United states and those that are spouses those views there's a group called the Southern Poverty Law Center that tracks all this\nThey say there are nine hundred fifty three hate groups that operate in the United states right now a and forty eight of those are in the state of New York many many based in New York City for the ... yeah they a law enforcement started tracking hate crimes\nIn Nineteen Ninety two and that seems rather recent but that's when they started ... a tracking this\nIt spiked after nine eleven as you might imagine a hit an all time low and twenty fourteen but since then\nHate crimes have been rising once again and interestingly enough there was a Ninety two percent spike in hate crimes and the two weeks after the twenty sixteen election and we've been going up since then\nUh it has been a something to to watch and are is rather disturbing another interesting back for you there in New York City are not only do they categorize hate crimes they also a look at the motivation for hate crimes as well and right now in New York City the number one motivation for hate crimes\nAnti Jewish motivation which is of course I came to the forefront over the weekend to Pittsburgh when\nThey're in the right place right there's a lot of Jews in New York City if you want to hate them they're they're they're probably down the block from you good\nChance absolutely uh yeah but the continues to be a disturbing trend that we're seeing here and on any given day you might see as many as twenty hate crimes across the United states\nYou know people want to make the connection between there are people who say they want to make the connection between President Trump's political rhetoric and this up tick in anti Semitic events and others are is there a correlation or is this been going on long before the president took office well\nYou know the rise in hate crime started before he took office and I you know I think part of the problem is not so much the rhetoric but the divisiveness a political divisiveness in the country that has separated the or the conservative and liberal parties even farther and farther that you're getting to your fringe elements really on both sides\nUh and I think that that is part of the reason for the increase in the hate crimes now does the rhetoric help I don't think so uh but you can't really draw a result of the rhetoric to the increase in these hate crimes or it it just really puts it in the spotlight once again\nOr at NBC News radio correspondent bills in for thanks so much for joining us this morning rabbi has on Jeffrey ... was actually conducting the service at the synagogue where the shooting took place on\nSaturday somewhere mine they're all beautiful wonderful good decent people\nPay

visit Pittsburgh in the wake of this massacre the president called for unity in the face of violence\nABC's a chief White House correspondent Jonathan Karl said something has been missing leaves in his opinion from the president's message since the massacre in Pittsburgh on Saturday morning\nPresident did not mentioned the victims no mention whatsoever of the victims he did praise law enforcement and he didn't make his comments about about armed guards\nBut he doesn't do that compassion that thing that we saw Ronald Reagan do after the challenger went down that we saw Bill Clinton do after the Oklahoma City bombing that we saw George W. Bush to after nine eleven that we saw\nBrock Obama do after the uh the Sandy Hook massacre or or Charleston\nThis is not what he does\nThat we see sort of the blame game uh begin does the blame all fall on the shooter or with the influenced by somebody of course everybody will have an opinion on this the leader of the Anti Defamation league says the shooting in pits", "show_name": "First Morning News", "year": "2018", "city": "New York", "day": "29"}
