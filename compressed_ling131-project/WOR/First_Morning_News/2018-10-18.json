out Cho okay anybody in your ... gonna hills so anything I just I'm just said oh it was an impossible as the colder air gets in here\nNow are we record cold they'll certainly not there but it's certainly a change the record for the date for a low is thirty five or less at Nineteen Seventy four the average lowest forty nine were a little bit below that forty nine so as I said not extremely cold close to the average and we are record\nFor different and as we go through that ethic difference a good word for it will be plenty of sunshine so that someone will help offset the chillier air forty eight of the high temperature but they don't feel like a good forty tonight good forty year old ... we might take a few degrees off so instead of\nForty three or forty four which is where I

western north will be the flurries and the rain showers\nAnd then early next week I think we're low fifties ... warm up mid week and looks like we're loaded with fifties most of the early part of actually believe in the city may see some numbers down into the upper thirties\nLater next week does look a little bit milder it does look a little bit milder and then as we get into following the last week of October already can't believe it oh yeah it looks like we are going to see a little bit of a cool down again\nA solid although we don't see any big big big freezing cold down here for the city but over the next seven days more cool and below average that we will have above average very good meteorologist\nRace they did with the forecast this morning our news brought you today by

caboodle with that being said Saudi Arabia's fence a very important ally of ours in the middle east\nAll right well uh it's coming down to this uh in ... officials apparently are pretty convinced\nThat the ... was killed at the behest of the crown prince and the question is how does the U.S deal with that let's turn to NBC Radio national correspondent bills in for kind of a very delicate situation in terms of the diplomatic process here I think bill\nYeah you know ... we've been here before with Saudi Arabia through some real rough spots in our relationship I mean this is a this is a different world than it was in Nineteen thirty eight when standard oil first struck gold there in Saudi Arabia\nI mean we've been through the OPEC oil crisis in the embargo in the seventies uh we've been through nine eleven when a Fifteen of the Seventeen attackers were Saudi nationals so we have been through rough spots before with Saudi Arabia and survived however\nHaving said that this is a different world now for Saudi Arabia no longer are they that\nOil a country run by a a Muslim religion and a royal family they are now trying to get into the ... really into the twenty first century with Mohammed bin Salman the crown prince\nAt the controls or they have something they unveiled called Saudi twenty thirty which is their vision for the future reducing dependence on oil based economy a branching into many tech ventures in fact there was a whole branch of their state oil company now\nDedicated to investing heavily in tech ventures in the future they also want to dominate trade in the middle east because of their a strategic positioning between the Persian Gulf and the red sea\nSo this is a whole different relationship between the United states and Saudi Arabia and the one that is in hanging in the balance now just look at next week scheduled public investment\nA conference that has the organized by Mohammed bin Salman already dozens of world leaders have pulled out of this and is this a sign of what could happen in the future\nBy the way Joe one other interesting development this week", "year": "2018", "show_name": "First Morning News", "city": "New York",
