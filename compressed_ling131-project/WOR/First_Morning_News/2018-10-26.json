her lawyers but um at least they were at some point in time expecting that would make a shift over to news doesn't see like NBC wants to make that shift with her and she is going to be gone\nFrom NBC altogether is a whole and rumors that maybe she would go back to Fox News but the statement that the Fox news made was they were extremely happily we happy with their entire line up\nSo it doesn't look like there's even opening for her to go back to Fox this point\nIn time and there's nothing else that NBC is going to have her doing apparently so be it would be interesting I look at it I I
