I was born and raised there um and I moved here when I was about fourteen and I'm I'm also a Gemini and I'm a few years younger than you do it so I'm I'm the deal even second ladies\nYellows your law yeah exactly\nAnd here's late when I tell you I remember you said once before so this is the perfect time to call\nYou said once before you were interested in people who have seen spirit ... and I haven't been seen them I I did and I I totally agree with you George how you feel about the lead to court I I actually I wanted to start\nWith that analysis in about sixth grade but when ours around twelve I started seeing the earth and the first one I saw and and I do have a question trade barriers on that real quick the first one I saw I Will never forget because it was completely unexpected\nAnd it was in the doorway when I was getting ready for school it was a\nCat it was actually half of a cat but frankly have an average cat dragged itself across the doorway what was the other half\n... uh well here's what I don't know but it was ... its legs were going way far out in front of it like dragging itself across\nAnd it was clear as day and I soon learned after that I actually contacted one who am I had a name for real weird name I\nWasn't going to say it on the air but I Will quote quote down and I actually named the cats after ... graders but I saw these every day and I even which show all my friends and\nWinds at the YMCA in St Louis I wanted to tell you that George\nI don't know if you remember the YMCA\nI when I went in that way back then there was a\nStairway that was all dark and I set the Delaware and had all these kids sit on the stairs and I asked this that spirit to show it so it was it was like this big fell that appeared right like on a movie screen\nOr did you have that and yeah so I mean many I I once I had a girl I took her and it's always better when it's dark I took her in a closet and\nI spent the night at our house and I asked them to come and that spirit started shaped shift state and I remember it within India and then it was a I I remember the Indian real\n... you know it's kept shaped ship is still following you Julia\nNo no no I I'm I'm really really I'm concerned about keeping myself and that's a good thing you asked that kid is leading and then my question\nWhich really have a minute for ...\nOkay I'm very concerned about keeping myself in a positive\nI ... you know I I pray and communicate with my angels every day and and here's the thing I've been told and very psychic I've been told them a medium but when I was about Nineteen I caught myself off from that each has I didn't want to deal with any real negative energy [laughter]\nSo I feel like I'm not using my gift\nAnd I'm just wondering your take on it\nShould she be afraid of negative energy is a minute left Bruce\nShe uh she should be very cautious and when you when you get into the spiritual mowed the connection I always say something like I'm opening up by I use the star trek thing I'm opening up a hill and frequencies to all good and kind spirits and would my spirit guides also helped me\nSo called gatekeepers to protect to protect me from any negative energy so you have to say that right up front that ... to it it pretty much bumps them out right away or we do have power over them unless we invite them in so you have to be very careful to right up front\nPut you know have have your bouncers get get rid of him what are you doing on Halloween Bruce\nAh on Halloween we are just handing out candy and I'm not even a Norwegian ...

salmon den W O R good\nYeah good morning I'm that seems to be the indication that there was a list that could have been at least a hundred targets that were put together by now what does believe the ... the bombing suspect\nSay starts out he was in court yesterday a facing a five federal charges could receive up to forty eight years in prison if convicted what I found interesting was his lawyers made a whole big speech yesterday saying how he remained remains innocent and nobody has been able to call it a lot to say that\nThose bombs were bombs that he said although when asked by investigators seemed like he could have had a list of up to a hundred and he may have even indicated that there were more bombs\nComing so then we see the bomb package that was stopped before getting to CNN Atlanta yesterday it just kind of raises the question as to how innocent is this guy supposed to be before you actually stands any kind of trial\nAnd also asked the question begs the question how slow as mail service at All right I mean I think this guy sent the packages a week ago but now they're just got one yesterday almost\nA Pony Express are they actually bringing them in a horse power these things getting there does\nSeem like there was a little delay and that so that that kind of work but the question yesterday while the package allegedly looked exactly the same as the others with the the big bold print on the on the printed up homes are labeling as well as the number of steps on the side of the kind of appear to look the same or was this possibly somebody who was copycatting\nOr what we were seeing from say aka so that question brought up but they do they believe at this point not only have they taken the remains of this bomb to Quantico for investigation they believe it all has everything to do is say that it's not a copycat at all\nTalking with NBC ... radio national correspondent Michael Bauer so the fact that nobody was hurt does that make a difference where my will you spend just as much time in jail\nI think that would have been had somebody been hurt or or or killed a then that would have been a murder charges are certainly on that front but I think at this point the highest\nGrade of a penalty is going to face a ... will have everything to do with the fact that it's a terroristic act right and with that according to go back to what is the director Christopher Wray said we're looking at bombs that could have exploded they were built with material a that was flammable that under the right circumstances are right amount of heat temperature\nEnergy would have exploded on some level so even though they didn't and even though they didn't appear to have a trigger\nAnd even though it seems as though the defense is starting to be built up that he was going to do this in order to instill fear and the people who are receiving these packages there was still a possibility that they would've exploded so they're still being called ET's according to the FBI Director Christopher Wray\nSo one description of Caesar yesterday was that he was bowling in the courtroom accurate\n[noise] that's what they're saying it it was it was oddly of an odd difference between his a sentencing yesterday and the one for the shooter in Pittsburgh\nWhere it seems almost within moments you had a seizure ... kind of climbing there weeping while he was in the orange jumpsuit hair pulled back into a ponytail and then just to differentiate between the differentiation between he\nAnd Robert Bowers who was sort of stone faced silent not say anything except for the short answer is that he had to give to his lawyers yes or no yes or no it was out in moments in the wheelchair there in Pittsburgh\nYeah Robert Bauer seems sort of confident whereas the or at least that way the description was that he was confident and uh he was speaking with is an intelligent way with the judge and his lawyers um you know ...\nAnd sort of expression listen and then when you when you just kind of use that and see what you had with south who seemed really emotional almost from the get go crying as soon as he sat down and certainly when the when the hearing began and and then the judge began speaking that kind of threw him over the edge and cause them to cry a little bit harder\nAlright uh NBC radios Michael ... thank you so much for joining us this morning
