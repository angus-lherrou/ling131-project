Chevy ... and didn't want us better not really doesn't matter but the fact that he ... in fact that he said it was all there since ... well now you're saying now he's saying is up in a new GM\nNow if the new GM wants to spend money but that's the thing out you know you can't hide behind the next yet at the end you know what I mean\nThat's a good point yeah a ... I don't think the next guy is going to come in and say I\nDon't want a more robust analytics department I don't want more money to be able to commit a payroll I'm\nNow mostly you know that's what Wednesday energy [laughter] but you'd hope not as in six at the change in in the ... need to\nSee that from ownership the organization as a whole that there's going to be a commitment to winning championships and the Mets they have the opportunity to do it they had enough go right over the last\nTwo months of the season that you could see how this team does get to be in a competitive team they need help behind the plate\nAnd it's got to be one of the areas that they look at I think that's where we all pretty much agree now Kevin porky okay see then he could be part of the solution\nBut yet the pair him with somebody else I ... don't have grand I'll play a hundred games employees sixty you know it's a kind of position where it's good to have to\nReal solid options and you're not going to have one catcher catch a hundred and fifty games anymore I'd like to see them find\nA center fielder back to go get it and that can make some place and he got a trade for that guy\nThat you dangle Pete Alonzo maybe the red Sox need some help at first base and Jackie Bradley junior becomes somebody you can grab\nMaybe the Minnesota Twins are looking for that kind of help they got Logan Morris in there but Alonzo would\nBe a potential long term difference maker and know what they shake loose Byron boxed in one of the top prospects in baseball a couple of years ago has it had a whole lot of big league success and really was jerked around over the course of this year may not happy about that and oh by the lawns and it was too happy about not being called up at the end of the year\nBut those are the kinds of things that I Would look at and they need help\nIn the bullpen and a big one bad to go out and get a legitimate closer and they need another top notch reliever beyond that\nThese are things that have to happen this off season\nFor them to be a a true contender I felt like last\nYear we talked about the needs that they had well they gotta get four or five guys and we named the positions and they filled with them but they did it and an underwhelming manner and none of those guys really paid off\nTodd Frasier at the best year of that free agent group and he wasn't much of a difference maker overall and spent some time on the disabled list for the first time and his career\nJay Brazil miserable first apps he look better over the last month which is at least encouraging looking into next year\nBut in these wars act was hurt often Jason Vargas the last eight weeks now it's standing was awful\nSo you know they they gotta fill holes but it can't just be build these holes that gets quality in there and that means you get up to pony up\nThere's a lot of these players get a lot more expensive you know Jacob ... making a lot more money this year many made last hour takes more calls coming up eight hundred three two one zero seven then many Schmidt covers the jets for the daily news will chime in on their one and three starting now they're young quarterback is developing right now and is up to\nYou on TALK station you rated number\nOne seven Gen W O o voice of New York and I hard\nWhy they don't turn the ball over mine said anything rained uh you know probably long before this year and even though Donald had turned over this year or last year I should say nobody nobody at that position wants to turn the ball over so I think that kind of goes without saying I don't believe the jets have been heavy handed per se in that uh\nUh it's just something that Donald wants to be vigilant about ... wants to not be reckless my position has always been the season\nTwo thousand and Eighteen is really about developing Sam Donald and getting comfortable with the pro game so that he can hit the ground running for lack of a better phrase in two thousand and Nineteen so I don't want to say that wins and losses don't matter I don't think that's fair to say because if you're a player and a coach they obviously always matter as a ...\nEditor but I think if you're you are not part of the organization as I'm not and you're looking at the big picture and what this season really is all about it's about cultivating a\nCenterpiece of your franchise for the next ten or Fifteen Years and so if that means taking some chances and getting some turnovers then so be it and I know that people often looked at\nPeyton Manning the year that he was a rookie they went three and three with the with the Colts he said uh\nAn NFL record for interceptions for rookie he ultimately benefited from that and I'm not saying that Sam Donald going to become Peyton Manning but I think that\nIf you're a big picture of goal is to\nGet this guy is much exposure and experience as possible as a rookie so that you can benefit as a franchise in his second third fourth fifth and beyond years that I think it's okay\nFor him to make mistakes and learn on the job uh it it's a tenuous situation because people are fighting for their jobs as players people are fighting for their jobs as coaches\nSo there is a fine line and it is odd that the jets are trying to win and develop a young quarterback and that's a very difficult balance it's a difficult ah\nYou know a way to to handle it but again\nYou know Todd Bowles isn't guaranteed anything right beyond two thousand and Eighteen so he does want to win games but you also a smart enough to realize that this kid is the future of the organization so he's going to have to to learn and when he learns he's got to make mistakes and if he makes mistakes the team's gonna it's gonna contributed losing so ... it's a it's an\nInteresting situation because typically you would have a rookie quarterback paired with a rookie coach much like you had in two thousand nine with rex Ryan and Mark Sanchez\nA this is now a rookie quarterback paired with a fourth year head coach who is not guaranteed to be around for three or four more years\nWhen we're talking to each man of the New York daily news about the New York jets now is not both handling the hot seat that he is on right now\nI feel like Todd Bowles [laughter] you know in some form or fashion and then on the hot seat for like three years as a job I remember people calling for him to be fired or in the media in two thousand and two and a sixteen believe it or not I ...\nI remember after the Colts law at home and which\nI think they were losing twenty eight nothing thirty five nothing at the end of the first quarter the whitewashing if he I'm sure you remember that in that light stadium I remember people calling a including including colleagues of mine at the time calling for him to be fired and that was two and a half years ago so\nI don't think it's necessarily anything new I think you know when you're looking at Todd Bowles and if you're going to be fair about the situation and realized that he's working with a rookie quarterback or it's not fair\nTo to make a snap judgment or any kind of declared a statement about him until this season is over because Christopher Johnson has said from jump street that he wants to evaluate this season or not necessarily a\nBy whether they make the playoffs or by by win loss record but by weather but but but how\nThe young players including Sam Donald but other guys as well how the young players developed a throughout the course of this season and the last time I checked in with a sixteen games fees and not a ... game season so there are twelve more games left to to see the aware of this team is headed in to see ultimately what they look like\nAt the end of December and at that point the ownership will make a decision whether you know they want to bring back bowls who's\nHe'll sign through twenty twenty but that doesn't necessarily mean much in this league or whether they want to\nGo on a different direction and I can't say right now definitively whether it would be a mistake to keep or to\nFire Todd Bowles in in three months because I Can't predict what's gonna happen here in the next three months so I just think that you know frustrated fan should keep that in mind it's been\nFour games after the first game I don't think anybody was calling for Todd Bowles his head a threat to you know the start of the second quarter of the season let's see how they're these remaining twelve games go and let's see how the young players like Kamala Adams markets may only played one game Leonard Williams or\nA Sam Donald let's see how they this core group of young players develops and progressive or regress is over the next well if we\nFooled you may Johnson becomes part of that core group now to even though they signed them as a free agent that was their big move this season burned by Dante mockery this past week and a dumb penalty would Jarvis Landry and the browns game that you know things up or Cleveland or what you know one of the jets thinking of their ... their big investment those\nUh he hasn't lived up to the money that you know I think if you're being fair and objective about it that's pretty clear ... it's been four games again it hasn't been a full season he plays like this over the the course of a season and then I I think that's extremely alarming but it's certainly not\nEncouraging ah but ah it through the first four games I mean they paid him what the market uh\nBaird he was the best quarterback available on paper this free agency was a star quarterback no he was not a star quarterback there was a reason why he hasn't been a pro bowler or all pro in his first five years\nBecause he is not of that caliber that that's not my opinion that's fact\nBased on how his career is unfolding now is he a good player absolutely\nIt is very good player you know I think at times it can be very good player is he\n... his in his prime or Richard Sherman in his prime Patrick Peterson jailing Ramsey or is he a player of that ilk no he's not and he's never been a player of that ilk do if the jets or their fan base thought that they were getting that kind of player simply because they paid him\nA what they paid him a\nThan they were mistaken because that was never the case he's a very good player in my estimation uh uh he has been prone to lapse\nIs a you mentioned to the touchdown and gave up the DVD Westbrook completely inexcusable that that is completely inexcusable if you watch the tape that play Westbrook ran a goal rap but it wasn't even a goal rabbit full speed it off to snap\nWhat book is probably going I don't know sixty percent of his capacity he's a burner so you know it might be fair to question why you would have to remain thoughts are on a burner but that's not why he got beat on that play he got beat on that plate because he had\nA a lack of focus and that's really the best in the simplest way that I can describe it it's inexcusable for for any quarterback let alone someone who is supposed to be your number one quarterback so has he played well to this point\nThe jets publicly will say that they're fine and they're happy with him but clearly has not lived up to what they thought he would be but again it's only for game samples\nOr just at the corner here and sometimes it's a blessing sometimes it's cursed well more jets game the remaining new year and a obviously a vital games for ... is he tries to develop into a big dumb NFL quarterback management at the New York daily news always appreciate coverage finished thank you\nBack they take care of you to a management or take jets calls coming up eight hundred three two one zero step and then also will get some your reaction I talked

dominance\nAnd I yeah I I think they do a lot better than meds and Rocco as that second half their ... and then you've got a lot of both and work to do as well and the only thing that you're you're right at the Mets were going to be a two hundred payroll two hundred billion dollar payroll kind of team this is the kind of all season that we should be talking about I I just there's nothing in the recent past\nIs the best and and not that from what ... said on Sunday to suggest they're going to go to that level [noise]\nThat's that's the way it looked like they are\nMuch more than anybody does she have any indication they're human interest\nAnd they they should be and they should be finding out what it's going to be at the very least to block it from going within the division I Am telling you the Philadelphia Phillies are going to end up I think what Bryce Harper or many Machado they're going to make a big move this off season and that could start to tilt the power\nIn the ... that's going to happen I'm guaranteeing you the Philadelphia Phillies\nAre making a big move this off season\nSo for the Mets here you want to try to block that you want to try to keep up with the Joneses these kinds of things you got to do much out to be great for the Mets and yeah\nAnd you want to force themselves to shortstop cares playing that short stop and you can move Rosario to third you can move Rosario to center you can find a way to make it work you can move or oh sorry to second and McNeil over to third base whatever it is you you do you have to do for a player who is special\nLike many Machado but knowing the Mets look if they're going to go out and pay Machado thirty thirty five million dollars per year that's all you're getting\nThis off season and unfortunately that's not enough they need help behind the plate All right so if you have a ... you could do it cheap behind the plate so be it uh but you need at least two top notch relievers brought in for this team to be a true competitor\nThose guys aren't cheap anymore and we saw this past offseason those are the first guys off the board we're all those relievers never getting paid\n\nSo that's a plan to me where you're looking at it can be Jay Bruce and Todd Frasier on the bench and look you're not dealing those guys you're not shedding that money\nThat's a major market kind of move and it's just I Know it's New York but it's just not the way we've seen the Mets operate in recent years\nSo Jay Bruce has to be in the mix in some way shape or form and it is to be fair I Do think Jay Bruce could be a productive player\nA tad Frasier can be a productive player\nBut they have limited upside me much rather the upside of ... obviously Machado\n\nSaid to me you know it's kind of two ways to look at his off season now how it should work\nIn utopia and what the actual limitations of ownership and the Mets\nAnd to me I I think your best plan is to spend behind the plate spend in the bullpen and trade for a center fielder played Jay Bruce to first base I think that's a solid team now that the Milwaukee in opening day and say all these the alleys champs\nBut teammate expect to be over five hundred and give you a chance to catch a little lightning and the bottle and you'd have a little upside with what you want to ... might be able to give the team with what Michael could photo might develop into with a normal off season\nAnd obviously you know what their starting pitching is still capable of\nAs I can be tough for them at least the big four to top what they did like uh this past year beyond just cinder guard making more starts but that's going to have to beat the task or they they have to get better in a variety of areas and especially in that boat that\nEight hundred three two

R.\nYou heard about the nationals the cubs the Dodgers two of those teams or at home now uh as the cubs sees it comes to a quick end and that's what's on the life\nOf the ... the Yankees tonight the Yankees don't expect to be knocked out after one playoff game\nTelling you know it's a tough match up to the ... the age of a ton of power just like the Yankees do in a Yankee lineup is deeper than the AIDS\nBut with the A's have is a tremendous bullpen avid saying this for years when it comes and will be play on your predict this stuff find the best both to find the hottest bullpen and ride it\nThose are the guys that when these games it's not just starting pitchers you can't depend\nOn these ... not in a night out as the weather starts to change and you're going up against better pitching staff\nIn October ... wins for you in the post season is your pen you better be able to protect the elite you better be able to extend a tie game the Rockies both I was not perfect last night ... gave up a run in the eighth inning but they held down the door from Iran\nOn the door Thirteen to ... to ... you have to have the ability to do that the A's have a tremendous ... ... is deep and they're going to go to it by the second or third inning tonight\n\nAnd the Yankees fall behind it won't be like last year where it's going to be easy to work their way back in and you better get after Hendricks early it might be the\nMost terrible picture you see all night though he has had a lot of success in this open a role where they are a a top job or two in the month of September or started quite a few games for Oakland\nWhere you're going to hear tomorrow especially if the Yankees looks\nIt's not fair hundred wins and it comes down to one game and we lose to the A's fair it's absolutely fair it's banks but it's fair when your division\nThat's what it's about that's your number one goal for every team in baseball and the season starts when your division you play your division rivals more than any team in the league you had to play these teams Nineteen times a year\nIf you don't win your division you get stuck in this mess up again you get stuck with the emotion and nerves in one game to\nDo or die your entire baseball season six months of work and go down the drain in one night one big mistake one hung slider\nCan Andy your dream of getting to the world series\nBut it is fair\nYankees had a four game series at Fenway Park\nBack in August\nAnd that turned out they lost all four central difference in the division when they lose by eight games the red Sox I think it would be\nI feel worse for a team like Boston who wins it's division has the best record in baseball at a hundred and eight wins and if they get knocked out the division series do seasons of failure\nYou wander division you won a hundred and eight games you did everything you're supposed to do over the course of the regular season and then you get knocked down invested five series that I think that's taught for I think that's worse to deal with it I think that's more unfair\nBut if you don't win your division a life raft give it to you this is a bonus you get to playing this game and try to make your mark in the post season so you'll hear it\nTomorrow and I ... I liked the ace tonight I always say take the best bullpen I liked the Rockies last night I liked the AIDS tonight they do have a tremendous Ben I'm at the age they win tonight\nGoing to beat the red Sox and I think handily if that's the match up I don't like the red socks that all going into this postseason they don't have\nWhat you need to move on which is a great book then they got Craig kimbrell and nobody else they could trust they got a knuckleball or is there topper labor\nSo\nTomorrow if the Yankees do lose and you hear all this whining about it's not fair it is it is absolutely fair and it's entertaining as hell for everybody else maybe your team and they're it's not as fun and all the cubs Iraqis bad last night I'm having sex heart attacks biting my nails to nothing\nWe all did it with the Mets back in twenty sixteen but when it's not your team it's fun I enjoyed\nI had fun with last night's game and the best part is that enough to hear go cubs go at the end of it\nI Can't stand that San Marcos don't you dare play that song I owe a whole night without hearing it I don't need to [laughter]\n\nGo go go go [laughter] God ...\nSay work just as well for the rocky their works just as well for the old rocks man they'll get the brewers and the division series and the brewers Josh hater I think\nWe all the difference and that division series wherever you can grind these both arms night after night multiple innings you have extra days off in October the game totally changes and\nThe benefits the themes that you know cab had those deep and have a lot of guys they could trust or out of it and boy you look at what Oakland has between Blake training\nAnd Jerry's Familia being a part of bangs\nOr to Fernando Rodney I'm mayor deep Sean Kelly no reason he's there is because he drew his glove down against the Mets that game that the nationals one like eighty two to five against the Mets Kelly threw down his glove and the night betting was designated first time it by the national zoo when Oakland\nThey a lot of arms that they're going to be going to deny their use all of them\nI should be entertaining to see how that plays out ah tonight's going to be a big night though\nFor the manager these games the managers get killed when they don't win even Joe Manchin who just ended a long drought for the Chicago comes a hundred and eight year drought\nWe weren't sure if he was going to be back until today because everything gets picked apart in these wild card games big night for Aaron Boone and we'll get into\nThat when we come back eight hundred three two one zero seven than the number Adam Fisher S.

I'm just curious if your thoughts on that one of the things that ... a ... had to say on Sunday\nI think it was a total recommendation number one and number two and how we have somebody on board\nYou know I really don't want to answer those questions will come back to what more information once we have somebody and we lay out a plan but until I Know what the new GM is going to kind of suggests has a plan and we hire that person to to go forward that plan it would be premature to ask where\nYou're basically saying that uh\nThat's not going to the top of the free agent target was part of the recommendation of the previous front office at him\nWell I I think it I think it depends on how you frame it I don't think uh I think there's thirty teams out there that don't really want to spend at the top of the market and you know for the Sandy is really you've been quoted saying that second what we call second generation contracts which I think are\nA good way to put it you know players who have sort of been out there a little bit in the ... whatever it may be they may have signed um a couple of years outside of their arbitration years Thirty years old or whatever\nThose types of contracts are generally bad investments that Sandy thought and I think there's thirty thirty teams out there that would agree with him and uh you know the proof is kind of in the putting in this last\nFree agent market um but you know there are certainly the types of players that are kind of no brainer for any team\nAnd I think you know actions are are kind of kind of speak louder than words and for me with the mess particularly I'm interested to see sort of who who the new GM is well I guess taking a step back I think someone like many Machado or potentially Bryce Harper someone that Sandy all their son would have no trouble going after you\nKnow when you're in a rabbits and canola went out to dinner with him\nYou know I mean you know that that type of thing I think I think so it really just does depend on how you frame it and I mean I I'd be I'm not a big fan of spending at the top of the market either for guys who are over thirty you give them six years I mean\nI've been trying to cross baseball sure yeah and that's and that's where it's going in that direction no that's just generally bad investments but you know there've been some players one example that we did do with the Mets will back with Omar Carlos Beltran ... you know a guy who's twenty eight years old seven year deal no one ever wants to give anyone a seven year deal but when you're twenty eight\nYou know it it's a little more attractive and that turned out to be a pretty good overall deal I mean the at the end the day we still did lose about a year and a half\nTo injury but Carlos Beltran is probably the best center fielder and Mets history so I'm you know it it it for me it's about the age of the player and uh I don't really think\nI guess the ... again guy like many Machado Bryce Harper comes with his own words I mean who knows if he can fit in in the New York market he's not coming off the greatest year he's been pretty inconsistent for how talented he is even though he's been very good um\nWhat what were you specifically about Bryce Harper\nJust well I mean just his his media interactions I I think it it could be I mean we've seen there have been some some situations where he's he's sort of see it down in recent years has she has I mean I I don't I wouldn't be against talking to ... I just would have some hesitation um I\nThought it was really weird did you watch the last series the Mets play it in Washington where Harper he was hit and fly balls and just walking out of the box and you just hold on to the vast it was like ... held on to that the entire time but that that that\nAnd all over the course of this year is that the manager's job does he get credit when some guys get better on his watch would you think we could ask overall what you thought a Mickey ...\nFirst year I'm you know I think um I think the manager does deserves some credit the coaches some of it is just getting experience for a guy I feel like forgot like members are it's just getting experience he just needed at bats a Jeff McNeil\nUm you know he was pretty pretty good I think the player development system deserves ... the the lion's share of the credit there in terms of way did a double and triple A. and but the double play stuff Gary do you start seeing my nose kind of been much maligned as a as a bench coach this year he deserves some credit for helping him with that um\nYou know I think it's it's a mixed bag with with Mickey and and and the jury's still out I mean when the pressure\nBut there are a lot of facets this year where he struggled and I think he would he would admit that I'm you know wasn't he made some some comments to the media that weren't great we had some really big mishaps over the course of the season in terms of gay management\nI just I really struggled with the NFL game any as you mentioned these are seen uh he didn't have experience in the national league Calloway I'd never played or coached at a National League and even at the end of the year he talked about a series in Boston they said it was like having the weekend off it's only world and ... really is\nAnd I think you could you could ah I think in hindsight you you you know there's a there's\nWe don't really have we don't really have the ... I mean you know documented whatever I'm just I'm deserve or just like you in this case I don't have sort of the documented proof that Gary ... who was a good or bad bench coach but I think\nIn hindsight it would've been a good decision to get him someone with an all experience and help them out and really you know they played well in the pressure was off I mean at a historically bad June\nAnd um we don't really know we don't really know going into next year so I'm you know I think I think it'd be good to give ... shot I think he deserves a shot a second year um to sort out some of these things but you know now you got a new gym coming in and\nHe's gonna have to decide\nWho he wants and what he wants to do and he may have his own guy I mean I unfortunately dealt with that as an assistant GM in Atlanta you know someone comes in not necessarily any judgment they want their own guy so we'll see what happens\nAnd that's part of it and we saw what rex Ryan and John ... with the jets it's not always perfect when the coach is already in place but if you were part of a new administration coming in let's say would your recommendation be\nHey you should hold on to make it ... I think that he can develop\nI'd give them a chance I think I Would give them a chance but you know if at the same time I okay I guess having observed this season I I think it's really hard to go on and done with the manager and especially in this market in New York\nHaving said that if I was a general ... if I was a general manager coming in and I was getting my shot and I had my guy had my eye on this guy and that's who I Want is my manager and that's what I Would do so that that's that's kind of I guess that's sort of a\nSort of splitting the baby there but that's that's my two cents on it\nAnd we're talking again with Adam Fisher and the Mets of course hunting for a general manager will get your idea of what you think makes sense in that seat what the med should be looking for\nAs it appears they're looking at everything uh right now as a jet well up on called the ... traditional candidates in a very broad search at this point is it begins in earnest with the regular season now done a it's a sports car they on the voice of New York ... double you all are\nIn a sour Pete envoys list\nPrice dealer probably still be happier if your car shopping you've probably heard these terms\nWhat do they mean it's so confusing well it was confusing not anymore I'm telling you about true price from ... it's a price it actually means something because it's the exact price you pay for the car you want including season accessories and basketball you'll know if you're a true prices competitive because ... shows you what other people are paying federal uses\n\nGoing down with the MacArthur you [noise] were hanging\nOut with Adam Fisher formerly the mess front office now and then why knows how things work or knows how this game is played and the Mets of course in the hunt for\nA new front office or at least to a new head man as far as the general manager goes Jeff well up on you know did say a final recommendations are going to go through him but uh that maybe there will be a little more\nPower given to that ah that GM and that'll be one of the big things to see how it shakes out are curious Adam how\nWhat kind of candidates come forward that are eager to become a part of this front office and if there will be some concerns about\nJust the the the the way the franchises portrayed and and well how much financial freedom\nYou might have yeah I think I think all of that is fair you know there's a lot of stuff out there in the media and um if I'm a gym candidate who doesn't really know a whole lot about it I Need to get to the bottom of it and understand kind of how much\nHow much I mean if you remember when Omar got got hired though I mean this this has been a sort of a a theme you know uh\nFor you know Twenty years or so um how much control does does the gym have with the Mets and um and you don't remember that quote from Omar control with Fred total control\nAnd you know we did for the most part for for a number of years um but ah but yeah I think I think you have to investigate because you want to be your own person\nUm and you need to find out kind of what the situation is I think every\nTeam has different dynamics and there's a lot I mean ownership is involved with not to sort of fall back on that again ... every all thirty teams cliche but you know the owners on the team they can do what they want and you have sort of different levels of um involvement\nWith all thirty teams some very heavily involved in some not so much and you know you have these media reports that that just sort of had to ah had to kind of um discuss in his press conference and uh you know if I'm a candidate than I I Want to ask I Want to I Want to ask them it's a two way street\nYeah not just the Mets interviewing any other way I Want\nTo ask them up front and I want understand kind of what the what the layout is what is the blueprint for kind of how things work with the with the ownership and and um yeah I I think that's that's\nIt's not really a a Mets thing I think yes there could be some hesitation just based on um the franchises history over the last\nFifteen Twenty years and kind of kind of what went down over the years um but I think that's normal or for any GM to come and you need to get the landscape and understand what type of control you're going to have 'em and you know how much leeway\nYeah ... and some of the names are starting to come out now that the Mets will be interviewing got about three minutes here today at the top of the hour let's go rapid fire throws names at ya and you know do you like them and and how they might fit Doug Melvin\nWell you know he's very experienced T he and he's he's a well respected he fits he fits sort of what maybe what Fred ... kind of been been a reporter to be looking for although I I'd probably be looking for someone younger you know with fresher ideas buck Showalter\nAbsolutely not why not I just you look at his history of wearing out his welcome wherever he goes and I think it's a bad mix to put 'em or put them back in New York Gary Little Rock\nUh you know Gary Gary has done a a darn good job with with the cardinals is Gary someone that I worked with a ... when I was with the Mets and uh you know he's got a lot of experience another sort of um older school guy that may fit kind of what Fred will upon his is looking for or at least what's been reported Kim and\nKim's approach she's been she's been she's been around the game a long time now um I think it would be awesome to see a female GM so I'd I'd be I mean I'm not\nI don't know him particularly well I Know she's extremely well thought of both not just in the media but within the industry um and uh I'd be interested to see how she does and the interview process and you know she liked to see her get a legitimate shot to be great to see a female Jim ...\nBen is is is a great guy um and uh [noise]\nYou know I I really like Ben I think it would be interesting I\nWho knows how to ah work work with the media and um and understands the arbitration contracts and an administration\nWho we take some calls zero with Adam is well eight under three two one zero seven Dan gym in Yonkers gives us a shower sending my gym\nA couple of the one that is a secret metrics going they select the G and I think it's great we only see a little progress so rose like it was aerial Neal but it occurs to me that somebody who could really help build\nThat Orange County where I Want to get your take on that\n[noise] ah well I mean I think I think it's really the the the the ... and and ownership are open to to analytics I think it's really a whoever comes in whatever\nVision they have um you know I think that's kind of what Jeff is said I I think uh they they do have a small analytics apartment right now very capable people um and uh\nI I as I've said kind of on the on on a on us and why they're kind of middle of the pack I guess you could say they're sort of treading water so if they don't get better or more people with regard to super metrics they probably will fall behind\nWhat do you miss out on a I mean the teams are just doing stuff that would blow your mind you know\nAnd the Dodgers and Yankees have like twenty guys each I don't I mean I'm\nWith everyone have a different project are studying different part of the Dodgers\nYeah I mean I I you know there just to get a get an idea um those teams are looking at how to for example you know we hear all about spin rate right and um you know set Pluto has this great spin rate on his curve ball those teams are\nAre openly using technology to try to figure out how to spin is created\nSo they can get their pitchers in players to do it they can teach it to them\nFeel like Houston seems to have figured something\n... teams that have figured that kinda thing out that's the kind of thing you can do when you have when you really invest in technology um you know in in the book the arm or by by Jeff passing a one of the interesting things there is a a ... I think uh I think you know where I'm going with this there was there was a um\n[noise] I I don't know if you if he had a degree in can use theology or whatever it was he he had studied alternate alternative therapies for Tommy John and alternate rehab and before he could even do anything with it the Dodgers just hired him\nIt's like something that could help the entire sport yes now one team comes in takes his\nExpertise and just uses it for themselves yeah exactly so that's that's one of the twenty guys the Dodgers have right there you know so um that's what she can do with it and and in reality if you don't do it right now the Mets have three really smart guys\nBut as these teams get you know the Marlins to for example\nDid nothing for years and years and still are\nBehind many teams I've heard they have in the last two years of higher than our six guys so the Mets are still ahead of the of a team like the Marlins because um they have such a huge head start we've been doing that we did the since two thousand four you know but uh at some\nPoint it's just going to get its it's where the game is moving and it's just getting is just going to get get out of control and they won't be able to catch up so that's something to think about I guess we kinda got off track for as\nLong as that your expertise with analytics\nI'm I aspects of it aspects of it I I kinda I guess you could call me a Jack of all trades okay um I I've overseen analytics I've overseeing scouting\nI'm done administration and contracts and that kind of stuff I great opportunity to kind of do everything with the math um but I I have a real good feel for the anal ... Iran analytics for I guess four\nOr five years and I have a pretty good idea of what the technology is I'm not I'm not a number cruncher I'm not a programmer okay but I I guess you could say understand baseball and baseball technology\nBut that's the thing I mean it goes beyond just be the number of crowd that a lot of people here analytics and that's what they think of the excel sheet senator manipulating the game and different ways but as we've talked about there's a lot of different projects that you could have gone areas of the game to study and and improve\nNo doubt it can just be investing in understanding and this is this is what I did for a while with the Mets um I mean I I've done plenty of analysis um over the years but a a big thing was just understanding what types of people and what types of technology to invest in you know and how can we\nHow can daddy someone's background and how they fit into or just a general audience\nI mean you just sort of hiring smart people who have an or analytical inclined maybe not necessarily know who you're talking about players or offer an office people intern program over the years we we we've turned out for example David Stearns\nOkay came through our intern program but ah but understanding kind of who we are to really smart guys are really TJ Berra who's overseas analytics he he's the one who deserves the credit for hiring those guys I was very ... very small level involved\nUh of course paying and Joe Lefkowitz really smart guys but but for me more uh directing\nWhere to spend the dollars in terms of what technology to invest in um that was\nMy I guess my biggest sort of uh impact um with a with the Mets we're one of the first teams to use track man which is now widespread throughout baseball uh there are a number of analytics companies that we invested in a using their products and technology and we were way ahead of the curve\nFor a number of years but that's not the case anymore\nWe're talking with Dana Fisher right now you know something interesting I remember ... saying the season ticket holders this past spring or was about Eric Campbell that he had great exit philosophy and it was something that you guys bought into but\nThat is one that got into that maybe they don't\nKnow no I'm joking I I was a ... I was a a minority faction that wound that never a big\nThing to me but he said well we didn't consider launching idle at that time so you get hit the ball hard right it would be on the ground or a line drive that would be at somebody and he\nLied we ... and that's why I didn't like him I mean it you know ... it was it it didn't go anywhere because it didn't have it didn't have the correct angle um\nThat's why I say to me I'll alright so you're you're standing in a fad genius about it I just watching Eric Campbell and you know what kind of adds watched the eyes tell you\nBut he did there's no question and it was a debate that he hit the ball hard and you know yeah the more you study this stuff and that's what's kind of makes me chuckle like you know there's nothing wrong with the exit Philo is just another stab just like hits home runs and\nJust like ... for our on edge it's just saying I imagine and you know and\nAnd the same thing with with the with um the launch angle I mean it's just it's just how what what angle does boggle off the bat and we are getting smarter there's no reason not to embrace getting smarter and how you're able to watch and analyze the game I think\nThe ... on one side effect which is unfortunate as you would argue the games getting boring\nI'm you know there's not a lot of action I think\nFor one thing I guess to to really the grass digress here what's really fascinating to me is watching kind of a push and pull between progress [noise]\nUh and the excitement of the game yeah you know it's like I Am all for competitive competitive advantages and using technology and trying to move the game forward but at the same time you're\nThis year whose barrier or was it was pretty barren sometimes just an ebb and flow well they said they were a lot of injuries that triple a it's like they were dealing with him at the ...\nI mean ... he lost out on a major opportunity [laughter] um you know priced brands\nWas nice pickup rate raid the after spring training and he never got healthy um so they did try they made an effort I think you know you just have to get layers it can be a real challenge push and pull between okay how much playing time you have for everybody even that triple a\nBut you really want to have layers and layers adept and that's what a team like the Dodgers\nHas shown I mean look out look how deep they are you know I'm I think that that's a model and to be more aggressive on the waiver wire a you look at these some of these teams in what their bullpen looked like\nThey they find guys off the waiver wire and the Mets and we we did we did find find some gyms I think as more of the trade or for Josh smokers and nice one but you just always want to keep being aggressive and try and find more and more\nYou know you look at max Muncie and LA and yet you can hit by the Mets did it not that long ago with alright Dickey just minor league invite to spray somebody hit\nKnow Marlene ... I'm going back a little closer I mean a a veteran who found found the fountain of youth Marlin bird we're able to to turn him uh you know when to dose in her and Vic black Vic well obviously but up until ... when we\nThe energy Bruce so yeah it it stuff works and those are things you got to keep on grinding through as we chat with that um Fisher a real fast postseason I I just think it's best bullpen wins I think it's real simple when you get to this time of the year is there a team that you love that you think the set up for success here and that's all just one big crapshoot\nI think it's it's a one big mess that's not fun I Know it's not fun I'm Sorry that I Wish I could I just say I like I mean and that's not really a both and that you can count on I I still\nI still really liked the Astros but there that's not a pen you can count on so and they start ... into starting pitcher yeah but he got outstanding starting pitching may have they still are the most talented team I think so I think you know watch out for them um I really at one point like the Yankees but not\nI it's hard to it's hard to\nKnow if they got to get through this game I'm I'm not for one hundred and eighty a winning team the red Sox their pen is often I don't like them at all so that's tough it's like OK so who do you like I Know I don't like\nAnd I don't like pretty much every ... every playoff team seems the national league I mean I like the brewers with Josh hater or they could just walk right out on you know interesting they just happen to have the worst starting pitching yeah so it's like jeeze [laughter] you know pick your poison ... most bounds but they also ...\nThey they're so maybe the the cruise the entire year you know they're actually coming out of I Believe Jason's darker an article about it and I don't know if it's still true but that's the worst division ever\nThat team the other team that division or I think a combined one hundred and fifty five games below five hundred to step up there last year just to just the titles are going to have to they're going to get their feet to the fire for the first time what do you like tonight [noise]\nI liked the Yankees fan Yankee sorry uh I just think\nThat the better team but I but I Do I Do ah they both both teams have outstanding bullpen and you know the Yankees are on the dice was Severino so that's going to be I think it's going to be a fascinating game\nYou liked the strategy here is I Do you buy or into the fire\nInto it especially in a game like this where it's heart makes it harder to game plan and the aides don't have a good really good option so for me it's kind of a no brainer um by you know I\nIt's flip a coin but I'm gonna take the Yankees so yeah I Hope you're on edge [laughter]\nAt a Fisher a S. N. Y. or formerly the Mets front office and a lot of expertise you were able to land here tonight at him and I really appreciate you coming in is awesome\nThank you Pete thank you for having me and you know I Wish you the best I Hope we get a chance to do this again I Know that ah I Know that they're a lot of Mets fans out there that ah they want to want to hear you keep doing this with the Mets and the ... uh I Wish you the best wherever you land\nAppreciate that Adam right well we'll take the Mets calls following up eight hundred three two one zero seven ten it's the sports down where people car the on the voice in New York seven ten W O R\nActing that W O R sports when they look All right [noise]\nYeah I was going to get some insights in you know what analytics is actually all about I learned a lot about that um you know it's not just manipulating the numbers and shifted its studying all aspects of the game and that's why it is such a competitive advantage for the Dodgers and the Yankees and the teams that", "show_name": "WOR Tonight with Joe and Lis", "year": "2018", "city": "New York", "day": "03"}
