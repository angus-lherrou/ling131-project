{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "You end up with some bad blood he'll feelings in the stands and in some Boeing and that kinda thing and uh it all builds the drama of what has already been a wacky postseason so who knows what the heck is next what kind of\nStrategy you could have from Milwaukee side or Los Angeles has died and the Dodgers they are the kind of team you would expect to do it Milwaukee did uh in in game five got started guy for one out and then poem the Dodgers one of those teams there ahead of the curve they're willing to experiment and tries to different things\nBut it was the brewers then ended up\nAh going to that extreme in game five ... Wade Miley ready in game sex and everybody will be ready to jump down the brewers throats if\nThey don't win that game uh and uh you know for how they they handle things but listen uh two games isn't going to prove their strategy right or wrong I doubt as creative but did a and\nDid it work and when they didn't work they did hold the brewers off the board or to hold the Dodgers off the board until the fifth inning when they scored a run they pushed brand and ... and ...\nAnd even they were planning on they're expected to have him out or after the fifth inning cording to Ken Rosenthal a and they kept them kept\nThem going a little too long gave up an extra couple of rounds but the problem with the brewers was they didn't hit Clinton\nGr Shaw scores and runs do it's like you know they gave up the house in those first\nFew winning so I wouldn't say it didn't work\nAnd they you know made the Dodgers ... bench they got David Freese out of the game and now the Dodgers were ready for it they didn't start a totally one sided line up as far as the platoon go uh so the you know the strategy continues to to build as the brewers and that's a team\nThere is trying to get twenty seven outs any means necessary they'll use any pitcher and any spot starter are leaving a reliever starting whatever it is\nA it's all hands on deck and it's like a full team effort eleven guys trying to get twenty seven outs each and every game and they didn't get any favorites that extra inning game and you figure they struggle playing three days in a row without having a ton of trust that arms and that pen\nAnd and that's the way it went down but they get today to rest\nAnd then just two games and you could grow the kitchen sink at the Dodgers were the Milwaukee Brewers now and Josh hater he's ... he's going to throw in both of these games if it does end up going seven or eight hundred three two one zero seven ten or ... with a big win last night just a good day or\nSomething or we'll get into that are coming up here on the show with Mitch Lawrence so Forbes in in serious XM NBA columnist us we'll look forward to that sports don't people cards on the voice of New York's evidence W. O. R.\nW. or sports though with McCarthy I'm Seventy says W. R. [noise]\nNone of the next last night opening their season with a victory against the Atlanta Hawks one twenty six to one of those seven the next court forty nine points\nIn that second quarter ... who who who don't know the hawks are terrible so keep that in mind and the next playing at home or the first game of the year\nBut one thing you do notice with the Knicks is they have some speed or they can get up and down the floor and they played bashed last night uh they're also the youngest team in the league with an average age of twenty four point one\nOr so a couple of things in the next ... as far as that goes wherever they are going to play fast brand uh basketball up and down the floor\nOf it not going to win a ton of games but there'll be exciting or at least more exciting playing that kind of basketball and you want to see what are some of these rookies can bring to the table as well that's always a part of it\nAnd some of the ... the ah the rookies you know show themselves are pretty well here to Alonzo tree or the\nOn drafted free agent at the play the night with that huge slam\nAgainst the land as you split through to defenders basically facial bam a he scored Fifteen points and you know it's becoming a good problem for the Knicks they will have to eventually removed somebody else from the roster to keep him around Kevin knocks the first round pick out a Kentucky with ten points in his first NBA Action\nOr so she's a good thing for the next overall they get themselves a win on the board against the team that they should be able to beat they showed their better\nThere but don't get the wrong idea and they're not ready to compete a and you know this is a team that is going to have to develop\nBy probably stinking this year getting that high first round pick trying to hit that and then\nMove Kevin ... or whatever big free agent you got your eyes on a to come to New York and in that way it's the same old story as it has been for years and you keep waiting for the next not to try to cash in their chips in the wrong guy\nBut they got to convince one of these guys to come to New York and that is\nWhat a lot of the season is going to be about eight hundred three two one zero seven than the number I'll be joined by Mitch Lawrence Forbes MBA Ryder when we come back right now and it's up to\nNew York says Fox feels rated number one seven\nDo do a lot about 'em but I guess you had some off court issues that's why wasn't draft they're not drafted I wherever you went um you know the thing that the next year in a position where\nThose type of players they want to see if they can catch the lightning in a bottle see if they can develop these guys you know the Knicks have also as you know was moody a or you know these guys who are\nPlayers who are Kassoff they want to see if they can develop them and do something Mario's oh just see if they can get out of them with their previous teams didn't so this kid is in the same type of predicament and that's the thing you want to see how the ... and his staff\nCan they do a good job in terms of player development which is you know that's that's one of these things when you have a\nWhen you're building and you're going to win you know and the gang game somewhere in the twenties you want to see if you could also develops on young players along the way in the ... keepers and the guys were keepers you're keeping the guys who don't really give you anything or they have the same problems that they had in previous stops\nYou let them go on their merry way to turn to somebody else the whole thing here is you've got to ... get some more players and really do you know to me in my mind is the big picture for the next is they need an upgrade and talent poor thing is the most talented player and then after that\nYou know there's a big drop and so you've got to get more talent some way or another whether it's in a another high picking a lottery Mitt whether it's a free agent whatever that they'll send you on your way right now you're looking at guys who aren't you know obviously they're journeyman types and they'd be reserves on really good teams if they're even that good\nAnd we are talking again with Mitch Lawrence right now Forbes as well as serious XM Charles Barkley opined today that the the Knicks you just you know let poor zinc sit this you're out loses many games as possible and get that topic would you buy that as a viable strategy\nWell uh you know what that might happen we'll see how it shakes out I mean you know but forcing us might want to get on the court and play at some point we'll see if his knee allows them um yeah that that you know what part\nHe says isn't anything new I think I think one of the things that the the Knicks are looking at is you know you get a guy like Kevin Knox as a lottery pick and then you need to add another lottery pick now you know what I'm\nThere are ... well when I heard somebody told me that you know the Knicks were talking about you know we're going to try to attack there and I tried it like the argument saying because they don't have a lot of talent so the draft going to really the positioning of address will take care of itself and we'll see if forcing us does come back and if he plays it might be important for him to come back out there and play we'll see but\nYou know uh Barclay says isn't exactly an original thought\nHow about you know as far as Boeing free agents goes you know we always talk about the gardening is being this a mythical place but it's been awhile since the garden was truly the garden and\nThinks that tells you Andy Dalton stinks you can't trust them anywhere yeah the pick play at the end of the game that worked out the Steelers but still he doesn't put teams away they don't have you don't have that kind of ability I loved the chiefs here yeah heart ...

least compete certainly they can\nAnd the thing you like is it the quarterback had his best game last week against the Indianapolis Colts I mean would it be complete eighty percent of his past is one was the last time a jet completed eighty percent of his past is at the quarterback position you got to go the way back I think it was like a dozen years ago throwing the ball more than thirty times at least not we're talking you know for for five or something like that\nHe's getting it he's getting more\nComfortable the players around him are starting to do their part Chris Herndon the rookie tight and who they were very high on getting them in the fourth round they felt it was a steel out of Miami he was mixed up a little bit in training camp it in the pre season so maybe he fell behind a bit now he's starting to get in the mix he scored his first touchdown last week and\nThis is receiving corps that's going to be banged up here coming up this weekend because no Quincy canoeing more for a

titans\nLed by of course Chris turned in to be able to contribute and helps and Arnold and company move the football against the defense which we know can be pretty talented here\nAnd certainly is dangerous enough on that side of the ball and offensively cousins to those receivers feeling and digs um they are going to pose problems I think for the jets even so I Would expect a lot of points again on Sunday out at ... stadium so we'll do a little bit on that before or the night is through for us here but we'll start with baseball\nAnd congratulations and it's becoming almost all right but congratulations to the Boston Red Sox would win the American league pennant for the fourth time\nSince two thousand and four and I'll extend congratulations on the air to our producer re who we know is a diehard Boston Red Sox fan and I mean like I said it's just becoming old hat for him see the funny thing about re because you know he's he's a Red Sox fan he's a patriot fan\nFor probably the first half of raves sports life he had nothing to really make him happy when it came to baseball and football baseball and football I mean yeah the Celtics\nI mean that was good enough for you but I mean in terms of the socks and the patriots yet nothing yet eighty five they went to the super bowl probably didn't deserve to be there you know they they were a wildcard team they won three road games and then the eighty five bears destroyed I'm forty six to ten\nThen the next year you have the red Sox and they gave me the ultimate heartbreak of course in in losing to the Mets which was a good thing and like the only championship but I remember\nFor many of my teams but my ... your living it since the calendar turn to two thousand\nThis millennium you are living in pretty good in that respect\nYeah it's been it's been a pretty good uh you know Fifteen sixteen years feeling pretty good you just want to leave it at that pretty good thing but great let me tell you oh my God how many seriously how many Super Bowls since two thousand and one you won five of them went to eight and ... and they went to a Super Bowls\nEight superbowl's in Seventeen years getting close to being you know twenty percent of the super bowls of it on my team I've asked you this before and I'll ask you again\nWhat does it get old seriously does it does does it just like get old at this point you have one of the super bowl not one bit never gets old I barely sniff the Superbowl couple of times close when you're about one eight times just in this millennium\nI'm Still mad at Desmond our tells you about Ninety six stop stop Desmond Howard but Brett Farr five is one Super Bowl well you\nJust one other one after the next year I went back he went back they probably should have won that one too but they didn't but anyway you're living a charm life in this Red Sox thing hey and the odds are in your favor right by the last three times they've gone they've won\nThey get there they when\nShe might be celebrating again in a couple of weeks it's unbelievable I was thinking unbelievable\nToday for years they've in in Fifteen Years have gone four times before that yeah since ... forty six eighty six they went to four in those forty years and didn't win any of them yeah and from eighty six to ... for\nNothing zilch and heartbreak\nAnd the year before yeah the ultimate heartbreak their game seven Aaron Boone but you know you made up for it I I just can't believe it and I will say this though and congratulations right of course for your team getting back because it was all me about a lot to do with it absolutely the strategy everything but it just reaffirms again that this is gonna be the\nEighteen fear\nThat you're not going to have a repeat champion in major league baseball and it just shows you again just how difficult it is to win\nTo weigh in here in in Iran and that's why you know when you look back at what that Yankee team did winning four times in five years you know the late nineties there and into two thousand\nAnd that's darn near impossible I mean baseball a hundred and sixty two games and you know what the ... to me\nThe best evidence of that would be this Houston Astros team this year that was the team that was the defending champs\nBattled injuries of course you know they hit those interrupt there in August a little bit the dog days when a lot of their ... contributors were hurt but when the regular season was over they still want a hundred and three games and yet I called it the quietest one hundred and three when season like we've ever seen in baseball history\nBecause they kind of just flew under the radar and then they started to play good baseball and then they went out there and they just dumb mom wished a Cleveland Indians team that\nI think it's pretty darn good in their own right and can pitch as good as anybody and I actually thought would go to the world series and win the pennant and they smoke them and they were the

a number chit chat\nOr really are going to be given serious thought as to whether or not they're going to be given the opportunity to run the organization I I\nI look to your guest is is that people have asked me what do you think the GM search is going to go how am I supposed to know\nBecause you're hearing different stories from different sides and and honestly I don't know what they're looking for\nYou hear that one part of the ownership wants to be more analytical ... driven the other owners and part of the ownership of course wants to be a more into just scouting and an old time baseball evaluation\nThat's great if you can get a combination of the two I think that would probably be the happy medium and then oh by the way what do you do with the guys who had been running the organization for the last few months when I'm Talking about the trio of\n... of J. P. rich already of John ... co are they going to be evaluated are they going to be at least briefed on what the search has been like and ask for their input I I mean\nThe whole thing right now is a complete and total mess let's be perfectly honest and I don't know if you should necessarily be losing sleep over it I Am not for one you know when they get a GM they get a GM ... there's some work to do and I really don't think\nThat as far as to bounce in the Nineteen is concerned that this roster is going to look dramatically different than the one that you saw and two thousand Eighteen because I think no matter\nWho's going to be given the title of general manager or cheat baseball's czar or president of baseball operations or whatever you want to call it they still have to report back\nTo the guys who signed the checks and at the end of the day aren't those the ones who are going to have the ultimate final say that's my full autonomy and all I mean that that's a nice term it's a nice concept but does it really have any way do you believe it doesn't have any sort of merit whatsoever I don't believe it\nStill going to come down to the will pawns an ownership and what they want to do how much they want to spend\nYou know jump opens going to sit there on the last weekend of the season and say well we didn't spend money because sand the oldest and told us not to I I don't believe that necessarily and guess what from the people that I've talked to around baseball they don't believe it either\nAnd it's so many ways that was almost throwing sand the under the bus a guy who is well respected in and around the industry a guy who is probably a borderline hall of famer with the type of career that he's had\nSo this thing could go in one of a million different directions before it's all said and done\nAnd I have no idea who's going to be the left ones it's like a game of musical chairs musical GM chairs right now for the match I don't know who's going to be the last one standing\nAnd as I said a couple of minutes ago I don't know if it's going to make a heck of a lot of difference this is a team it's still going to be rooted in pitching yeah I have the guys at the top of that rotation who you're going to want to build around you know at least for the foreseeable future into grump synagogue we'll learn yeah I guess you could throw mats in there\nNow but the rest of that everybody line up maybe with the tweet during the week there it's going to return pretty much intact\nYou know they'll they'll they'll change up the bullpen\nWhich they have to do but you're not going to look at wholesale changes they're not going to be in the market for many Machado they're not going to be in the market for Bryce Harper that's not the way that they're going to do business regardless of who the general manager was gonna be\nWe'll talk some jets kick off our two right now here's the news update\nYour small businesses boxing you rated number\nOne seven ten W O o voice of New York and high\nSo but they're kicking way too many threes and you have to start putting sevens up there especially when you play the better competition you're not going to beat them would feel goals you're just not so when the jets get their opportunities inside the twenty against the Minnesota Vikings and really old ... opponents they're after gotta put the ball in the end zone\nYou know when that's on the quarterback and that's something that often you have to score touchdowns\nBecause you're playing with fire if you're just gonna keep kicking threes and it's going to put more pressure on your defense a defense by the way which yeah they have their lapses every now and then and yet they're susceptible to the big play and we know that they're hurting in the secondary they're going to be without your main Johnson and buster screen again this week\nSo it's going to be incumbent upon those other guys to step up the Darryl Roberts of the world in the ... and you know are sharp Robinson and the Vikings can throw the football\nYou know they can ... the ball around they go they are a dangerous outfit when it comes to passing the football\nBut this defense has done an incredible job this year returning teams over they really and truly have I mean the jets the force Fifteen turnovers already this year you know how many they had all of last year twenty and we're only six games into the season\nSo that's conducive to announce ... led by young quarterback who's still learning his way your work with short fields you improve your field position that's just going to play right into your hands you hope\nBut you have to take advantage of those opportunities I think the jets are a good football team I thought at the beginning of the season I said ate and ate All right this team could win a games are they still on target for that absolutely\nBut this is one of those games that possibly allows you to maybe just accelerate that growth curve a little bit more\nBecause Minnesota's legit and you're showing that you can win at home and you can take care of business at MIT life stadium\nYou know to sweep these three home games would be absolutely huge for them it really wouldn't be and I know you still have a lot of season left after the nine more games and he's still have five games left against your division you haven't played the pets yet you haven't played buffalo yet\nYou still have a trip down to Miami and your loss to them first time around so there's still a lot of work to be done and even if they somehow when on Sunday I don't think that it's necessarily grounds to throw a parade or throw a party and say the jets are going to the super bowl or the jets are going to the playoffs no it's just one more step\nIt allows another game later on in the schedule like in December to be that much more significant because you're chalk it up these wins in the first half of the season so you still have something to play for after that\nBut just take a stock and look at the AFC East right now I mean buffalo is going to be starting Derek Anderson in Indianapolis Derek Anderson you don't like Derek Anderson is starting well yes because Josh challenges hurt that's number one but because Nathan ... is awful\nIs absolutely atrocious and they actually wanted to start the season with him but paramount is so bad that they signed ... off the street for crying out loud and said not only are you going to be part of the team you're starting buddy congratulations 'cause you know what we have no other place to turn\nSo he's getting his start in Indianapolis he liked their chances I don't get we just saw the Indianapolis Colts that's the team that can play some decent football when they want to they're dangerous enough on off into what Andrew Luck they can move the football\nNot to mention that last for in a row when they do I think the bills\nWalk into Indianapolis and lose that game dolphins on the other hand our home for Detroit and they're going to broadcast one of the starting again and that was one of the weirdest games you could possibly see between the dolphins and the bears last week so I mean fumbling the ball at the one yard line I mean you can scripted stuff\nBut I was really broadcasts why they're going to be your answer and there's reports now that tannahill might be done done much for the year like we don't see 'em again because he's that banged up here Adam gays didn't want to talk about it after the game you say you Adam days by the way referencing hippo laws\nAfter the game talking to the media about why he won't discuss wind down the hills injury I mean if you ever heard of head coach go that far so there's something going on with the dynamics in that room where\nIt might not be too peachy keen and now you're down to ... who is essentially a glorified salary dump not too long ago\nI don't think you're winning consistently within one shock me if Detroit goes in there and beats them on Sunday patriots or a different story right patriots you know what to expect from them\nDoesn't matter how well Brady gets no matter how many guys they lose around them you expect them to still go out there and play in a high level which they're starting to do as evidenced by that went over the Kansas City chiefs last week which by the way\n\nYou know you're talking about a game like that and both teams are lighting up the scoreboard like fireworks and teams are just going up and down the field bing bing bing bing bang you know all these yards all these statistics I Can't get worked up at that\nAnd it just bothers me that you have like young people out there who don't remember football the way it used to be and they see something like this and they say oh yeah this is what football is is the way it always is so you look at a team that's generating all these statistics you'll get a quarterback throwing for all these like Patrick moms for example you got some kids out there the pride\nYou know the only been watching football for the last five ten years and they could punch mom's is the greatest quarterback they ever saw\nBecause he's going out there and thrown for big yard edge\nBut this isn't the way football used to be always\nIt wasn't always this easy like it actually used to be a challenge to throw the football and guys that were able to do it for three three hundred and fifty yards of pop on any given Sunday those were the special ones those were the ones that you're bound to end probably are sitting in the hall of fame right now and you know what a guy like homes may or may not\nGot a bright future but I didn't like it used to be anybody could throw this football around now and chalk up big yards and if you're not shame on you write shame on you in that regard\nBut the jets have a chance to make a statement here on Sunday it's going to be a close game I don't think it's going to be a blowout either way and it's probably going to come down to the fourth quarter\nAnd it's probably gonna come down to apply here or play there that's why protecting the football is going to be of the most important you know Donald is going to have to make a play or two\n\nAnd then that defense is going to have to get some stops and you know the Minnesota when they were looking at film all week on the jets they saw that's secondary and they saw how banged up they are and they said we're going to attack here\nYou know whoever's opposite ... clay born that's where they're going to attack that's where they're going to look for the song spot in the defense so those young guys that I mentioned they're going to have to step up to the forefront and\nPlay a big football game and I think they will learn a little bit more and know a little bit more about this team\nAfter this game on Sunday and it doesn't get any easier you know I don't want to make it also sounds like they've arrived if they win this game it's just one game one step Kobe Minnesota\nBefore you concern yourself with everybody else would you still have to deal with the remainder\nBut the schedule that's the task here if you're the jets\nWinnable game for you if you want to be taken seriously go out there on Sunday in front of your fans in front of the green out the color rushed jerseys are going to be on display everything on hand go in the game\n\nAnd you know what it's funny too because a lot with the current cousin stuff burn the jets use them for leverage on and on I still think it worked out pretty good for the jets\nRight I mean I'd rather have sand Arnold for the next ten Fifteen Years than I Would cook cousins but the next three\nIf you gave me my choice that you could say well if you didn't make the trade you still have your draft picks you could add cousins who else you were gonna address yeah great but how do we know her cousins is going to lead Minnesota the promised land how do we know he's going to lead them to the super bowl we don't\nBut right now all roll the dice and I want to wait and see what type of future that Sam Donaldson the New York jets often says for the next decade plus because it looks pretty good\nAs of now and probably only
