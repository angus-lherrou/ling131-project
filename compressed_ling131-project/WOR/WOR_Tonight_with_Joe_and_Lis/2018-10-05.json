...\nAlways opens the postseason for them even doing that every every time they qualify to two thousand nine um I think there's some just kind of makes sense because you could put each of them on an equal five days rest going into the play offs of course I Would have started game one he would've been a four days rest and as you know watching Clayton\nShe got older he the Indians have piled up on him one extra day of rest could be valuable to claim Krishna going into the post season\nAnd then you know the I think the most important thing about all of this and that\nEven though of course are starting to he's going to be eligible to start a potential game five you would be on his normal for days rest for game five which is going to be seven days from now so it really doesn't really change anything except for the fact that maybe clean crush I Would be a little bit bothered by this which I wouldn't be surprised that he's a very proud guy\nUm he wants to ball to start the play offs and you know listening to him and his uh in the interview interview room today you know he didn't really you didn't necessarily quell any thoughts that he might have not been happy uh with the decision but I think the Dodgers just thought that this was best just from a strategic logistical standpoint\nThat I guess the next question to Albany is how has the emergence of Walker Mueller who we saw pitch so well on Monday and the ... how is your lives emergence kind of allow the Dodgers to take some of this load up occurred Shaw\nShe I think it's big it gives the Dodgers a legitimate number two starter sort of similar\nTo what they had a huge garbage going into October last year ... and maybe one of the best starting pitchers in baseball period um his fastball as electric but his pitch makes its just what kind of separates them any as we saw that tie breaker game he's not afraid of the big moment um he's a very confident guy\nUm and you know the Dodgers have all the confidence in him they are going to ride in as much as possible along with clay\nI think one thing that you're going to see though that you need a ... that people really need to pay attention to what the Dodgers playoffs they relied on clean courage and Kennedy ... a lot last year those two soaked up almost thirty seven percent of their any layoffs which is an absurd um out when you consider starting pitcher and a

the kinds of candidates that the ... should\nBe able to land here but you do have complicating factors up being really ownership how money resources are you going to be given will you had the ability to make final decisions and\nAh whether or not all those things are true it is almost immaterial as it seems that is the those are the questions around baseball and at a certain point\nReality\nIs what everybody thinks it is and that is something that seems to be harming the Mets years you had been sharing tin who is it on the level of a sudden the names that I mentioned before but he did make some key moves for Red Sox standing on a championship a twenty Thirteen\nAnd he takes himself out of the mix with the giants as well\nBut this is a guy has options she's going to become a general manager at some point down the line is that they all stay second in command in Toronto for now and and wait for a better opportunity\nAre supposed to be better than being in New York being with the Mets are meant he all through the record today reporting that bad levine who's the general manager of Minnesota you could give us a title bump up or the president of baseball operations in um offer more money make things attractive it's a bigger market\nAnd federal beam turn down the Mets as well so you have two names now guys that options that are either GM's right now or\nWe'll have another opportunity to be a GM maybe want to be choosy with how you're going to go about it the next time around if you're ... and those two have pulled their names out of the running and uh the names that we\nKnow reportedly know are going to interview aren't\nNecessarily top notch names you know Doug Melvin sixty plus years old yeah had some success in Texas are way back when\nWhen Milwaukee more recently but he's not one of these you know I'd be educating kids that seem to be having all this success when you look at uh the teams that are still play the eight teams in major league baseball for the most part it's a lot of those you know thirty something early forties\nUh kinds of GM's that are going to take analytics into account that are going to take the expertise to scouts and put it all together and come up with a full picture\nUm otherwise Gary Little Rock scouting background but\nHow much does she know the analytic side and believe in that aspect of it and and it works the except works she might not like bolt pending you might not like ships but you can argue that they they don't work its way you keep seeing more and more of them\nAs time goes on here a ... is an interesting name but she's worked with in major league baseball and hasn't worked with a team\nOr for many years now so is she a you know an absolute lockdown stood candidate I I think that\nIs a significant question going in but the Mets to me for where they are now they have Jacob the ground the top the rotation no cinder guard Stephen ... the star power there\nYou have enough to work with position player was with his team should be in a position to do at least be competitive in the next two seasons so let's say if you don't want to say that they're one big offseason away\nWell you should be able to be convincing the smartest brains in baseball to come here to be a part of New York to be a part of this fan base to be a part of the\nUrgency that is there and the desire for another championship or we saw how the stadium can light up in twenty Fifteen when the Mets went to the world series in a better example\nYou can out of the game a couple of runs that uh we're inherited by the bullpen and were able to score the Astros game seven to win over the Cleveland Indians to me that is the best of these playoff series right now and\nUh because they're matched up with Yankees Red Sox they'll all be afternoon games in that series for the Astros in the Indian so it's possible that a lot of people won't be able to really lock it and watch those games you're at work today the game started two o'clock it's over by the time you were getting out of work\nAnd it you know if you work nine to five and a four the Astros here or any any day and these are two of the better teams in baseball they really are both of these teams are more than capable of winning the whole thing is a huge match up to have in the division series that I think these two teams\nEven though they might not have the winds of the Yankees and the red Sox but both of them are more dangerous I I like either team that gets out of this series to\nNot only go to the world series but when the world series I think this division series we'll beside it and it's a shame it's only five game series and that's all get\nA but it would be a lot of fun as it goes to distance I think that it very well could I I liked the Indians coming in as a tough loss for them to day and one thing that's got a wrinkle you\nIf you're looking at Cleveland here is that Cory Kluger again it's not good enough\nHe gave up for runs didn't make it on the fifth inning gave up three homers\nAnd this is supposed to be the case and the guy who has been in the regular season at least the ace of their staff and it's not just a one off\nLast year against the Indians he was organist Yankees he was miserable in the division series an E. R. A. about Thirteen is he gave up nine runs in six in the third innings\nAnd that's now three consecutive post season starts where it has been underwhelming to say the least he's on that Clinton ... Shaw\nPath as of now where you start to get that well yeah you're great and the regular season what's going on in the postseason hey still not a bad postseason picture for his career I did pitch well and twenty sixteen on that run to the world series\nBut this is a guy you need to be lights out and he was out patched by just in Berlin or in a big way and I do that in a game started by to the better pitchers in baseball Justin Vernon liner and Corey Kluger they combine to get thirty outs and throw ten and\nThat's what they did combine\nYou would take ... Cooper Berlin seven innings easy both these guys ... soon as you get in trouble you're out even a guy as accomplished as Justin Berliner who's dealing today it's pitch count was over a hundred they loved the bases loaded in the sixth inning\nBut he's I didn't get pictures way out of that and they asked just gave up a couple of runs in that spot and you wonder why we see these\nBullpen just matters so so much in the postseason\nStarters at best the best the best orders are given you half a game unless they are near perfect as soon as as a runner and scoring position that managers out there ready to take them out right away\nAnd it works more often than not it has worked\nNow you know there are some pictures that are an exception like Jacob ... type we get him in a a big postseason series again\nBut you know even for guys like ... and ... they're not going very deep and these teams they love getting into that both and they love\nThrowing those guys out there that if the funky arm angles and deception they're all throwing Ninety seven plus miles per hour and those guys are decided this these series time and again\nUh that was the early game today one game in progress right now a that is the brewers and the Rockies and the brewers with one nothing late in the bottom of the six ... the brewers blue aid to run laid the ninth yesterday after\nUh the both of them was phenomenal Brennan what drove through three scoreless to start and they're able to work their way through went to Josh hater he was terrific they set it all up for Jeffress who's been great all year and Jeffers boy in the ninth inning last night but the brewers were able to walk off an extra\nAnd now today the brewers with one nothing lead in the\nBottom of the sixth inning ... a with a ground rule double the knock in a run us and the British trying to take a commanding lead on the Los Angeles Dodgers and the ... the my like out of the national league I think that's the team that\nHas what it takes to go all the way through so many power arms in that pen or they are well set up to go deep in a week National League and it's fair to say especially when you compare it\nTo the four teams that are left in the American league I don't think there's one National League team that I Would take over any of the American league teams have your ranking these I got the ... teams up top and the for NFL teams on the bottom\nAnd that's just out stacks up and it's a year where the national league actually finally beat out the American league in inter league play in terms of head to head record but you'll get the rosters of the teams that are remaining\nYeah it was kind of a wacky year in the national league where the power was expected to be the cubs the Dodgers the nationals and here we are with four teams remaining in the national league two of them are eliminated\nThe nationals are really struggled this year you know all about that the cubs get knocked out\nAfter losing the tie breaking game on Monday and then a wild card game on Tuesday\nTo the NFL or it is it's open it is it's not very good uh and I I really like where the brewers are and\nThey get past the Rockies here and he probably look at a brewers Dodgers I think everybody loves the Dodgers are there going up against the Braves and you check out that match up a and the Dodgers were the one oh series lead a as far as that goes and then you've got to night Yankees socks at seven thirty and\nUh the lake game will be the Braves and Dodgers after nine thirty so you got to action all the way through twelve plus hours of ah\nOf baseball and it'll be a probably a little less than twelve you would think I'm\nI'm One of the exciting days of the year and we'll talk about it with my ... of ... LB dot com he was fantastic have you checked out the alternate broadcast on ESPN two the other night during the NFL wild card game and an alternative to Alex Rodriguez and company and I saw I was a great broadcast a found out they were doing it in extra innings and\nUh it was great so looking forward to having Mike on the show and not only will they break down the post season but he'll give me the case why Jacob ... should be the MVP of the national league that's coming up sports don't people currently on the voice of New York ... W O R [noise]\nNow here in the W O R sports\nWe've layoffs in full swing right now of course the yanks ... starting things up and then one of the great baseball days of the year for a playoff\nGames all at once and uh we have men who is a locked\nInto all of it might petri yellow of ... LB dot com or joined us right now and this is the best at it you know right but\nYeah I mean it really is there's four different baseball games for meaningful playoff games um if you are unfortunately stuck at work I Hope you could find a way to get out and watch all of them because it's really a lot of fun and they all means so much because remember these are real short a five game series you know every single game has just so much importance and it's really a blast there's a lot of games oh today\nBy that definition goes wild card games as meaningful as anything and I switched over ... and the extra innings to the the alternate broadcast that you were a part of on ESPN do during the ... wild card game of the cubs and the Rockies I got to say\nI I Know is factually referred to as the nerd cast on Twitter they always phenomena you guys did a great job doing that\nI really appreciate that it was uh probably the most part I think I've ever had my entire life it was myself and Jason ... who does the White Sox games Eduardo for us\nTo spend a in baseball for many years and it was just so much fun you know we uh we position it as an alternate broadcast that was powered with ... that some metrics and that was really cool but for me to really be the main part of it was just to kind of take a different approach you know to\nUh enjoy the the way that baseball's played in the understand it and not kind of complained that things don't work the way they use new and we have so much fun and the feedback from everybody was just monumental I couldn't have been happier with the way it with\nAn advocate and it's something that you do notice and have noticed really all year instead he's on the broadcast it's always compared to what things were in the past rather than how things are now and explaining what that thought process is of the current decision makers within the game\nAnd as someone who has a statistical background does it surprise you just how rapidly analytics have changed the way these playoff games play out\nYeah absolutely I was famous the other day that it's only been two years since that Britain didn't appear in the wild card games can you believe that because it's just um think of all to think that that would happen today or not to poke a sore spot for Mets fans it's only two or three years since about hari came out for the ninth inning and none of those things are going to happen today it's it's crazy how quickly\nThat this has occurred it's only been a couple of months since the the race started using the opener\nAnd you're saying ... games in the playoffs so it's it's fascinating to me to see some of these concepts that have been bandied about for years not only happening in big spots but just happening so quickly is really fascinating\nBest guy you're the MVP\nYeah and you don't get me wrong I Know that is not going to end the MVP he's probably not even gonna get the first place votes um but I I think a couple of things are happening here first of all\nThe instructions to the voters are pretty nebulous you know it doesn't say you have to only select guys from winning teams that actually specifically says you don't have to worry about that and I think the tide is changing a little bit because if you look at the last two seasons\nWe have that you guys when MVP from games that were in the playoffs you had ... two years ago and John Carlos and last year understandably neither one of those guys are pitchers so that's another hurdle that stick around would have to clear up but really I just I don't look at it as a team award I don't care\nThat ... teammates got injured or under performed or whatever the reasons were the Mets had for not being successful this year I look at it as an individual award there was literally nothing more he could have done\nTo make his team better he could not have gone to Jay Bruce and turned him into my trip it just doesn't work that way so I Choose to credit a guy for what he can actually control and for my money ... is just the best in the entirely\nWhat is it about eight years ago you might not have even one that's our young a with a ten to nine record and now that's a given and we could talk about could he be MBP or and it it certainly is um\nYeah different ways of looking at things and and the game as progress quickly as we um you know get to get into a little bit here but that might petri yellow I enjoy your analysis or by give you a follow on Twitter ... and we appreciate the time tonight ...\nNegative stuff there from my ... my ... if you want to follow him on Twitter and you know as a as far as the ground goes it's hard to sit here and and argue anything against the ground with how great he was very fortunate to be able to I I watched all of his start since he came up at twenty four teen really and\nAh it sees development see how much dominated this year but I you know while he was so good when you're actually watching these games he also became\nAgain nothing to do with him but\nThe symbol his starts but the Mets blow or didn't score any runs for those were the ones that the gays that stuck with the all year and in some ways\nThe ground was the face of the futility of this myth steam because he was so great and yet still I wasn't able to push this team over the top not even for the whole season but in the games that he started\nWhere they had a losing record in those games and I get there's nothing more than he can do and maybe that's not fair\nBut that's not the nature of\nMVP I began BP it's got to be you know what were your contributions to win ballgames for your team and you know the Mets unfortunately the results at the end and those to ground starts weren't there it just doesn't pass the eye tests for me even though I Do agree there was no player in baseball better\nOr this year than Jacob ... phenomenal a eight hundred three two one zero seven ten the number to get involved or why John Harper asked in white on TV uh with the latest on the ... general manager haunt as well as\nA quick preview Yankees Red Sox starting up the division series tonight game one at Fenway Park is a sports on with the McCarthy on the voice of New York ... double you all are are\nBacking slowing down but we're\nNot on\nThis and the Astros game earlier again the Astros wedding Seventy two of the Cleveland Indians and when I think will be the most entertaining most impactful of all of these playoff series cheering and yang ... at the eyeballs we get all that but\nThe two best teams in baseball but the teams then they\nCan win the world series and will the winter of bad series I'll take the whole thing or that's that's the Astros and Indians and again that's just one Seventy two today about this uh an Astros fan\nOut in the Crawford Boxes out in left field he got up during the George Springer it back\nAnd said if George Springer it's a home run here I'm going to buy this whole section a round of beers\nAnd is that is a big thing to say and Springer hurt\nSo empty floor as according to Yahoo is the fan who said he would do it any lived up to it apparently spent over three hundred dollars buying beer for his section\nCouple of things one right way to back up your bet to\nThree hundred dollars like are you buying for the roe [laughter]\nThat's like twenty beers or you know maybe a little more than that bears twelve Thirteen dollars at least here I was there much cheaper it used to visit or you're buying a whole section worth a beer for a judge over three hundred dollars\nA ... where was I going to be in that section today and I say now you to say at least ten grand\nRight for a whole section section usually when you're twenty seats in a row and twenty runs\nAs a Crawford box so those aren't very deep so let's say it's maybe five rows it's a hundred people\nFigure only fifty of them are drinking\nI don't see how you're getting away with only three hundred bucks there not unless you're a you brought your own case it to the ballpark [laughter] maybe Houston's doing me falcon style a price and\nGum and maybe that's what they're doing now but I don't know that the falcons they're cheap on beer I just know that they're cheap on concession stand I think there are five bucks on ... is it five dollars a beer in Atlanta which is like cheaper in bars in Manhattan yeah I get down there that is like happy hour prices middle football game\nCan't beat that a good dropping\nProducer mark ah so ah the Astros hey not only get to enjoy your team won and but he gets beers as well and speaking of an update on a story we mentioned yesterday of course that athletics than you might have seen this video that went viral\nOr after the ale wild card game or an A's fan is all by himself and the left field bleachers Aaron judges don't run the first inning and some Yankee fans dump a whole beer on him throw the plastic cup or edits had\nWell apparently the to the people through the beer and the A's fan got connected through social media and they actually went out and hung out in Brooklyn last night pretty cool\nAh and are able to mend some differences I guess there it looked like they ah they had a good time with some of the pictures is able to say or an Instagram and\nThey even did a they were messing around that they did a fake thing where they allow the A's fan to pour a bunch of beers on the ah to Yankees fan he poured about six beers on him so he got some measure of revenge and I guess all's well that ends well and the the celebrity carries on\nA burden other day for that day span but that was pretty fun to see today mark\nSix beers or probably costs more than a hundred bucks why don't you can see\nThose worried at the ballpark so you can't do it up on a date or at the Fifteen bucks yeah it's fine when you're doing at the stadium\nAnd probably even doubt but beer that was bored at Yankee Stadium on the ... the other I don't know why you're wasting beer boring on people's heads you know then the whole event or has a ... a gate under three two one zero seven Gen John Harper outstanding columnist doubt as to why that TV\nThat yeah it does get interesting there because uh [noise] you know I Know personally ill Fred it's definitely more of an old school guy\nAnd that's one of the reasons ... organization and Fred had questions or for his friend authors about why are we doing a better job and it's got an apartment in in terms of the draft and things like that so um yeah I I I don't know exactly what\nScanty keep pretty close to the vest as far as keeping his own\nOpinions on things and go but um I Would think yeah he's more going to be more looking at analytical now and uh that's where it does get interesting but I think that comes back to your original question or are you going to get the best of the best is out there is GM's or you're going to have to settle in some way because\nOf the reputation it's been out there for a while that it's not the easiest place to work because of their perception at least\nThat you know threat was for Jeff will print in particular is very involved in a day to day operations and a French still send a degree as well\nAnd settling would be a shame because they are the New York Mets and so many people around baseball grew up bands and the ... people are in high profile GM positions where\nYou can offer him a a title bumper or whatever it might be I Would ... and you have a a rabbit his fan base of course it's dark for a championship on a big and there's a lot to like about\nThe ... to some degree where they are and there's some talent to win over the next couple of years but uh\nYou know they they should be in a position on when one of the top names in the game like the Dodgers getting Friedman Epstein to the cubs are you on the red Sox with them ... to a little bit of a lesser degree but and the Mets should be on that kind of level now\nI yeah I agree uh they should also be going out and try and Simon Child that's a different story uh yeah uh but you know you know these guys usually executives now the especially the guys you already have a reputation for being really good and the game they are going to want that\nFreedom to make decisions on their own ... every every GM has to deal with ownership at some level mhm um but\nI feel I've seen you know is making the call he's doing things you want the way he wants to do\nThe perception is that the Mets you can't necessarily do that and ah maybe that somehow has to change maybe in these interviews Jeff will pond or whoever has to convince whoever it is that you are going to\nThe guy I'm not sure that's going to be possible but I mean they're going to get a qualified candidate no doubt that they could listen they could do worse than\nStick to what they got already with John ... he's a qualified guy and the people that had working there but I think they do need to bringing or fresh ideas fresh mindset and try and go from there it's just a matter of\nYeah how is this going to be hashed out in the interview process things like that to me Mickey ... should be up for a for a talk in terms of whether he getting back to I Can't imagine a new guy coming in\nWho saw well paid attention to what was on last year necessarily want mixed chow away to be his manager I'm so that that could be an issue right there to start off with\nMickey said he would be on board if there's someone came and wanted him out well I guess he gets it or you know you say that my name is\n... if I'm if I'm the Mets I'm Talking to a buck Showalter one way or the other you know I think he'd be graders manager or they could use that kind of attention to detail because that's been an issue in recent years especially this year and then if not then maybe some capacity is it\nIn the front office the guy is a dream baseball mind of and so I think\nYou know they the message talked about being more creative with this higher in terms of maybe even higher and a couple of people at different levels so those are the kinds of things I I think they really do but of course I mean if you're going to bring his show us or\nEspecially as mad as you're going to have to pay and that's another issue is because that's a trend in the game where a lot of teams don't want to pay big money for managers anymore so at that that could be an issue as well\nAnd we're talking again John Harper best and wide on TV moving up in the man's Yankee socks game on tonight up at Fenway Park ... he's been banked up over the last couple of months shoulder information the Sox been saving his bullets essentially for a night like tonight game one what kind of expectations do you have for ...\nYou know I that's that's that's the question I think all I don't know I don't know what to expect me and he comes out and he ... that first fast balls Ninety miles an hour is going to be aghast at Fenway Park like oh no ah because that's what he was throwing in his in his final started a year after all the shoulder issues\nAnd ... and he they are saying it's more related to his mechanics and things like that we'll see\nIf he comes out throw in Ninety six Ninety seven if that's a totally different story and I think he's the obvious to me the ... series if he's a Christian wiccan dominate the Yankee by that he can pitch

even have a football\nSeason or the met just wrap things up on Sunday and so if you are all in on the baseball and of course in the Yankees are still going here and then you wake up and you know like All right what's going on air\nPretty uh New York football right now you have the jets at one and three expected that there would be struggles with a rookie quarterback the youngest starting quarterback\nOr that are in in many decades in the NFL see you expect growing pains I learned about defense as well which has been frustrating because that's not the part of the team that should still be growing that Todd Bowles has had this defenses defensive\nOriented head coach or for now the his fourth season or you want to see better from those guys ... those are the browns and the road was terrible some of the penalties that led to that were incredibly frustrating but overall not completely unexpected that the jets are sitting there one in three and it's not as if they were\nExpected to compete for a playoff spot the giants and the other hand\nThey not only\nWere expected to be in that mix they have\nTo be in that mix with the decisions that they made this off season they went into this off season would they'd Gettleman thinking that they were closing in on being a true contender because all of the moves they made were built for the short term\nTo win with Eli Manning still as their quarterback\nNot with an eye for a few years down the line they went in to win\nNow and they're not doing it there one in three\nThe schedule is been tough undoubtedly you saw their schedule when it first came out and said boy those first six seven games the rough there brutal\nAnd the question to me is the giants last year we saw this team splinter when things went the wrong way\nAnd it's easy to point to bend Mac and do it and he didn't have control now you have a new head coach and pat ... where are you still have a lot of the same people involved you still have a lot of the same players in that locker room\nNow when the going got really tough last year they didn't buck up they didn't figure it out so I think is very interesting uh oh the outback of junior who\nFor the most part this year has been under the radar both on the field and off the field he hasn't had the explosive kind of place that we're accustomed to seeing from him\nHe is limited by an op ed wine that doesn't give Eli Manning the time to go down field is limited by a quarterback that can't extend that clock in\nExtend the player makes some guys missing the backfield Eli Manning not doing that in his late thirties\n... basically some quick slant and and you hope you can go and and that's what he has been left to on the field and off the field he spent under the radar as well he hasn't made a whole lot of headlines he hasn't had any penalties are big issues on the field\nBut he had a very interesting interview with ESPN which excerpts came out today and the full interview I Believe will air this weekend a but listen to oh del back um junior and what he had to say today\nHow can we can sort of off more than twenty hours how can we don't attempt to try to sort of off more than twenty oh those are questions that we have to figure out for [noise] for now I Would say this is a horse so energy is this what we bring who rely on before the game\nAll of the house\nThe two major issues tobacco one being I think the most obvious they can't throw down field they can't make him\nThat deep weapon that he should be and he just pay them a ton of money to be back guide me a break or if he can do it all of his own as well and catch a you know as quick slant and take it to the house we've seen him do it but you want him to be able to\nSpread the field a bit and extend the defense\nAnd really they haven't taken advantage of that at all and you can hear my motel Becca junior that there is a frustration building with that\nAnd then you have the losing one and three and now calling on his teammates to show more heart\nMore emotion and he feels that he's bringing that but he expects more from his teammates\nAnd will be interesting is if you're a teammate of bowed out back a juniors
