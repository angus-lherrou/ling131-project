{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "Or a judge blaring New York New York as he was leaving Fenway Park after game today and bring it up at all but when it was time to celebrate in the red Sox clubhouse moves on the speakers\nFrank Sinatra New York New York\nSo ah you do have\nTo build up maybe I'm a little dislike between those two teams and\nThe Yankees Red Sox always got thrust upon us but I think you're talking about Yankees Astros Red Sox Astros any teams there will be meeting up in the foreseeable future in the playoffs you like there to be some history and a a genuine dislike\nI think it's going to build up with the Astros starting out but a big way or the sales yet\nMayor or not\nThe most popular team across the league\nAnd while baseball fans Evan necessarily rallied against the Astros their cocky bunch and they're willing to tell you\nAs much ... than a is willing to run his mouth a little bit which is good it's good to have some villains in the game I think the Astros there poised to make a warriors like run and\nBe in the crosshairs year after year competing for championships year after year and if\nThey had some success doing that like the warriors you might ask them likeable guys on your team but eventually going to make that he'll turn and you're ... you're going to become the bad guys and every team in the leagues be gunning for you I think that is starting to happen with the Astros will\nHappen as you know these playoffs go along what was going to be a fun match up against the red Sox Neal yes but the games more exciting when you do have some genuine rivalries when you know the Mets are getting chippy with the Philadelphia Phillies right\nEspecially divisional opponents where you're meeting up so many times over the course of the year I may get a little bit of that between the Yankees and the red Sox after the events of last night\nYou know as far as the jets go or you know you see that there is some talent around Sam Donald they are not a playoff team yet they can take another step though in Israel does the whole team this weekend if they can actually\nHandle prosperity come off the when an emotional when a thorough when this past weekend against the Broncos and do it again and they just haven't been able to do that over the years\nBut this is a chance for them to do just that against the Colts team again is right for the picking near\nSo you know that's the challenge for the jets but you saw on Sunday they have some talent there is that they put it altogether that opposites of wind played a tremendous game on Sunday\nOr are they capable of doing that a second week in a row Leonard Williams huge game racking up sex pressure on the quarterback\nIs he able to do that two weeks in a row\nSecondary did the job even without ...\nCan you follow that up and do it again the hit some big place Sam Donaldson ... and a couple of times or any of these are the things that yeah it's great to prove you could do it\nIt was eye opening against Detroit and the opener and its eye opening this past Sunday against the Denver Broncos\nWhen it till you can string things together it's not really a quality of your team and the jets Thirteen that can play really well\nThat doesn't get you very far in the NFL it's nice to have a ceiling but you got to have a level of consistency and there's been an issue for the jets going back to the rex Ryan years they're constantly\nUp and down and up and down and very little consistency week to week and that's something that you'd like to see settle in change here you have an even keel head coach judges publicly and Todd Bowles about is even killed is you could possibly be\nBut that hasn't transpired to consistent play and that's\nWhat you need to see a from the jets here especially if they're going to take advantage of what Sam Donald can give them over the years and it is not about this year\nIt's about putting the building blocks and the foundation in place so you can build on Sam Donald and make sure that you're not wasting his prime like Andrew Luck might very well be wasting his in Indianapolis\nA interesting conversation with

either you know even to do with Clinton there's three games going on at once would you be dangerous but\nHe uh went over to the other game for its which is a modified Fitch gave I heard he hit a whole lot over there I don't know for sure I heard he a home run but in our game he goes back over and he says they put me in the field and it's really getting it started and I don't want to like\nChange the game too much bad and major league or so as a good manager I Am I put on the right field and a second better up crushes one over his head\nOh no but\nDo you have a chance Judy made the play\nIt is it a scout the player man it is [laughter] that running\nAcross the field into another game what do you do launch once for the ...\nBut ah then he comes back over its we're at the bottom line up so I say hey what's up with him put him in the letter and ah he goes up well I'm told the guys on the team like I don't know if we should count it when he hit the homerun I didn't say it was like when you get all run swings\nEasy grounded a first ah\nAnd we're like on the up goes well now and I'm like well dude accounted so like no argue with the uh the major league players shouldn't tell or a\nA good

created gentle giants dog food at our special feeding in care programs to help all dogs and puppies live longer healthier lives dogs eating\nWait a couple of Super Bowls now in his\nMid to late thirties is that still there because even playing as well as you did against Carolina on Sunday might not be enough for this Giants' team\nUh they need him to be superb and I I I think there is a big question you know just how good can you live be it it feels like every week we look at him and judge him like we would have rookie quarterback\nWell he showed some science well no it's focused on the positives with what Eli Manning was able to do\nAnd he's earned that to some degree with these two Super Bowl rings but it's been a long time since he won those brings you talked about over six years now and\nFor you I'm manning and for the giants they're going to keep their seasonal live oh we know the quarterback is the most important position on the field it's not all of it it's not everything but\nThat's a spot where the giants have to start beating some teams and they're sitting there at one and four\nAnd can you tell me that he lie manning out played\nAny of the opposing quarterbacks that and the giants have lost to over the course of this year I think you can in and out play a guys in the games that they lost\nSo if somebody does have to fall to the quarterback position and and what's happening there and\nThey need a you know that kind of a throwback performance tonight because let's say the giants lose tonight the division is so bad it's not as if their season is over\nBut\nYou're right on the brake and this team showed last year that they can fracture and\n... junior and and the giants could say there are tighter than ever after he gave his apology on Saturday and spoke to the team privately\nBut that's only going to last so long you drop to one in five once you're playoff chances are washed up guys started playing for themselves and we saw with this\nAlmost the same exact team last year the difference being the head coach and that's a significant difference with the first year head coach and pat ...\nBut this is a veteran team that for a second straight year is expected to win\nAnd\nHow are they going to rally if they're not playing for a\nPostseason birth men are playing for the division is this a team that will go into the tank the way that they did last year and that might end up being the best thing for the giants as a they're probably going to need a quarter back next season matter what and having another high draft pick would give them that kind of opportunity\nBut I think Eli Manning guys to quiet so that talk even and just to show that he could still be great\nThat is a guy we're talking about earlier this week is almost certainly going to end up in camp and he's almost certainly going to be a hall of fame quarterback you start to judge him against his parents do beyond the superbowls and where they are right now well Ben Roethlisberger still playing at a higher level than Eli\nUh Drew Brees you're still playing at a higher level than what he lives at now you'll all those guys that are in that hall of fame conversation ... in the pack as far as his current day performance and things have been perfect for Ely me out bits of on while much improved of late\nIt was a big problem for him last year in early on the season Eric flowers is gone now in that aspect of the game has picked up\nHe has weapons right now last year he lost just about the entire wide receiver core after that lost to the chargers right now the receivers are healthy nail beds of wine as giving him some pockets to work with over the last couple of weeks\nOr they've changed the head coach they have put everything in place around you lie manning they'd given him\nA running back that is boom or bust but that has a lot of boom potential and sake one Barclay and allowed you lie to\nTry to win now that's been the goal when with Eli\nAnd tonight tonight but I think ... got a reward that kind of faith that the organization has shown in him But Dave Gettleman is shown in him and have a\nHave a game where you throw in for three hundred and fifty yards have a game where in the fourth quarter if needed you're bringing that big drive and yeah he did a couple of those things on Sunday against Carolina else up there to picks\nAnd I think he just needs to have an elite quarterback kind of game and that's how the giants are going to have to get this done and you can talk\nYou got a sense that um and you know I kind of won that battle in some ways and it's not as if he even had to fight it himself but the people made the decision to put 'em on the bench band Macedonia Jerry race they were gone\nAnd Dave Gettleman comes in and I'm sure when the giants were interviewing candidates one of those first questions as well what do you think of Eli\nAnd get them and said apparently we go in with them because that's exactly the kind of path that he has taken with this franchise since he took over and they were giants ownership wanted to hear that's the easier route to\nAllow he lied to play it out until he's not good anymore to not go out and draft\nHis replacement and have what might be an awkward season and an uncomfortable and\nBut guess what it's always going to be an uncomfortable and for the great players\nNot many get to walk away like John Elway or Peyton Manning holding on body trophy and even for Peyton even though we went out as a champion uh he was hardly the quarterback that he had been previously and and everybody knew that the one based on its defense so\nYou know it's going to be a rough one way or the other it's going to have some awkward moments but this is\nWhat\nIs always so dangerous for teams is you have the guy will means so much to the franchise who's one for you if you want to do right by who you want to be able to bring back in the future and you don't have the trot out for the halftime show and you know wave every body when you were retiring his number honoring a\nThe championships or whatever it is\nBut you don't want it to come at the expense of your future and that's where the giants are right now\nThey don't even have a future quarterback on that roster that they can go to if this season if they end up let's say one in seven and their chances are making the playoffs are Neal there's not a guy to go to ... it's going to be rider die with Eli for this whole season now\nSo again I think tonight is just huge for him I think he's got to prove it to\nThe fan base to the league to his teammates say he could still play at the high level that we've seen him play out in the past and this is basically a playoff game for the giants and that's when the allies played at his best\nTo nice to kind of night that you need one of those performances\nFrom him and you know as much as last week on Sunday all the I's run hotel back them after the the interview gave the ESPN tonight I think it's much more about the quarterback and you know can he still\nRise to the occasion and provide a moment and provide a victory really that's what you're looking for or against these uh Philadelphia Eagles and the eagles having a rough go of it of course now their quarterback Carson went ah coming off\nThe serious knee surgery tours ACL last year\nHe hasn't been able to get things moving the same way a lot of talk about a Super Bowl hanging over there in Philadelphia and who knows exactly how that transpires if they could suddenly just kicking into gear\nOr do you have some issues you know they relied on their run game a lot last year now Jay GIs done for the season lane Johnson's expected to miss denied scam the outstanding right tackle for the Philadelphia Eagles it's such a big part of that run game so\nYou know with uh the eagles are no right to be had and it's always difficult on a Thursday night to\nGo on the road and pick up a when\nA so the giant steps to things to their advantage to night\nAnd you know they got to be able to utilize that are in order to um you know keep their season alive and and that's a really what's on the line for the giants here ... ... s N Y with us or coming up\nUh give us so you know the latest what's happening game day here uh for big blue and then we'll get into the Mets in general manager hunt and we can talk baseball are coming up in the seven o'clock hour and we'll take some more of your calls at that point\nAt eight hundred three two one zero seven ten it's sports don't repeat McCarthy Honda voice in New York seven ten W O R men can get what you\nWere to go with the murder [laughter]\nGiant eagle Thursday Night Football ... with the Bush rejoined by ... covers both the jets\nThe giants at S. and why and uh obviously focusing on the giants today Ralph how are you\nA good how are you I'm\nGood how's it looking out bears that does it come down a little bit as far as the rain goes\nNo so raining pretty good here are the result of the field or out practicing a kid a still raining I can see it's slashed and the ... and it's supposed to be like this all night long so it'll be a mess\nAnd there'll be a mess and ah it's been a mess up for the giants as far as they enter one in four but I still with a chance to to salvage things because of just how terrible or this division has banned or is there are you a believer that the eagles or the team that's most likely to figure things out here\n[noise] can I think so based on talented wise and and just the way their team is built you know you can\nReally accounts for the super bowl hang over whether that's affecting them or not it doesn't show up at stats such just cut to the you look at the way they played the season ended up putting up the numbers they get a good pass rushed they\nAre the quarterback playing well they have weapons but they just look slept and obviously if that continues that'll be a problem as it has been for many championship teams over the years but um you know based on the way they're playing a in or the talent they have it done in the past I think they're the most likely team\nTo go on a Ron I'm just not a a big believer in the cowboys are often said at the Redskins seemed to be be it'd be very mediocre up and down team a you know and the giants actually they may have more talent that a lot of these teams but there are no one for a whole might be just too much to overcome\nYeah and they lose again it would be one in five and even if nobody takes off obviously it's a tough spot to be but not only that for the giants uh you know there there's just so much swirling around it seems around this table do back in junior high his comments this weekend the ESPN and\nAh he lie manning uh being picked apart here what do you sense that if the giants lose tonight how much drama is going to follow this team over the next week and a half\nWell it's a good question to you know I tend to always think that the trauma is more outside team than inside the team I I think we're all more bothered\nBy that comes interview in two players ... father because it's you know in a welcome distraction\nUh but you know a lot of the players shrug it off\nThe problem is you know did you get to one in five it's sort of becomes a test for sure you know can he stopped\nPlayers from griping about officials can you stop them from doing interviews like go back and did a you know there becomes a lot of brush fires to put out because the players can sense\nThat they're not stupid they know they didn't want to find their ... over in somebody and this division is going to get at least eight made and there's no indication that the giants the capabilities of winning seven of the last ten games it really didn't need more than that probably so uh you know you do on the risk that there's going to be a lot of brush fires to put out\nEspecially when you get players you're sort of no you're not only the season's over but hey this could be my last year with this team\nIs faith and Eli Manning amongst those brush fires that can be popping up\n[noise] I\nYeah it's possible um I think that that again is probably more outside the team to inside tea and I do get the sense a lot of players respect him and understand that\nUh you know that this is a quarterback he's on pace to throw for about forty four hundred yards and be sex fifty one time and uh the idea that it's on him is just ridiculous to me when you've got a line that can't block grant and they can't even bought the why she called Barclay\nAs great as everybody thinks he's going to be is not on pace to rush for a thousand yards so I think the players get frustrated and he becomes an easy target\nHe becomes more of an issue\nBecause he's thirty seven years old and his team was built with the idea of winning this year or next year and obviously it's the other one and I you know it's not going to happen this year next year becomes a question and you start to wonder\nWhere do they go from there do they move on from the light you know we'll take a look at ... at some point this year and it's a lot of questions that you know yes some people in the locker we're going to be asking you know what comes next\nI think there's been some improvement from the opposite to blind over the last couple of weeks to do you see the same uh you know even if it's not perfect for Ely certainly been better\nWell improvement with this offensive light is all relative was atrocious for the first couple of weeks I Do think there's been some improvement um I think the giants have done a better job of designing place to get the ball out of Eli Manning's hands a little bit quicker\nUm you know they get kicked down feel shots or the Caroline and protection was pretty good that is true\nThe run blocking still pretty terrible though you know get sick on Barclay\nHe's being hit 'em ... stuff is tough my head but he's up there in terms of running backs were hit\nFarther behind a line of scrimmage than any of the other I ... I think you're in second or third in that something like almost two yards at two or three hours on average behind the line of scrimmage um his I just said it had the um on Twitter earlier today was he has four runs\nFor a hundred and fifty yards he has a hundred and fifty yards in his other sixty seven yards combine its dot\nAnd nobody thinks it's a lack of talent from him were ability it's obviously there are not hold their he's getting pummeled a you know this light is improving but it's still to me one of the bottom five or six in the NFL and until they fix that uh you're not giving Barclay Eli or oh too much of a chance at every kind of office are able to get out of it is a small miracle\nCity to feel a heck of a lot better about yourself\nAnd then the schedule really starts to lighten up they get the Redskins at home after that a a by week and then it's the niners the buccaneers the eagles again on the road the bears Redskins titans Colts a cowboys\nYeah there's a a decent team or two in their ah if you believe in the bears the far and you know certainly going to Philadelphia but a heck of a lot more winnable than what the giants have faced early on this season as their top as games their schedule was front loaded\nAnd we've seen that in the results are those far but they got to win some of these games against tough opponent do it at home against the eagles you get the falcons next week on a long week you get a week and a half to prepare for them\nAnd while the falcons might be justice desperate uh they're missing a lot of key players on defense and you know the giants are capable of trying to resuscitate this thing\nBut it's really hard to see that happening if it doesn't begin tonight and it's just a it's just that big is now the giants and they're not accustomed them back to back seasons are looking at high draft picks but they lose tonight that's exactly\nWhat they're going to be looking at and if you're a giants fan it'd be paying a lot more attention on Saturdays to what's going on with the college quarterbacks than you'd ever reason to pay attention to what big blue is doing on Sunday\nEight hundred three two one zero seven ten get eight hundred three two one zero seven then I'll preview the NBA playoffs get it to the uh the ... general manager hunt a little bit\nUh update John what's happening there why Danny no blur a with us in the seven o'clock hour bleacher report so a lot to do as we roll 'til nine o'clock tonight it's the sports on with the McCarthy on the voice of New York ... W O R\nEight hundred three two one zero seven ten so a guy the giant eagle the course tonight huge game\nFor the giants and then I Will get into the jets much more with Bob was shoes in the outstanding a radio voice of the New York jets coming up a a little bit later on in the show but as far as the jets go here against the Indianapolis Colts are potentially\nA some rough news for them is Leonard Williams who had perhaps the best game of his career this past week\nOr dealing with the a bit of a back issue and so he's on the injury report now a but a a ... for a guy who was a first round pick of the jets are and he's the guy who fell in the draft as well huge expectations in Williams you always hear eats up lockers and\nHe's able to do some things but he doesn't necessarily put up the big stats over his years with the jets frame that had the kind of\nGame that he had against the Denver Broncos where he did pick up the stats where he did know racked up since ... on his total and then\nUm you know I have some kind of injury setback would be you know certainly disappointing and and you feel for him in that situation but you know the jets they need it every piece that they can have on on deck here as\nA they get the Indianapolis Colts this weekend and you know it should be a winnable game the Colts have problems in Andrew Luck is not quite look like the Andrew Luck that we saw pre shoulder injury pre shoulder surgery ... missing an entire season which\nHas to be a huge factor\nIn some of what he has struggled with it but for the jets and they get three consecutive home game feared they won the first against the Denver Broncos they get the Colts on Sunday then Kirk Cousins in the Vikings come to town and the following Sunday\nAnd it's not as if the AFC East is that much better than\nWhat we've seen in the NFC East and we've talked about the giants division being so bad that it is still winnable for big blue even with the one in four start that they have endured if as far the season\nOn the jets side you always looking up at the New England patriots but\nThe patriots don't appear to be invincible or they have their own issues they're dealing with and you know maybe they're strengthening and as the last couple of weeks are are going along here uh but they have not exactly dominated they don't have the great wide receiver record that word cussing and seeing them in the past\nOr certainly Miami showed so well the first few weeks the year including walking at ... stadium destroying the jets offense of wine\nAnd winning that game but the dolphins have been underwhelming since so they got club up in New England and you know another last last week then you add the bills I don't even know how they want to games but when they're lost his they've been absolutely terrible and they have one of the biggest upsets in recent NFL history\nWhen they beat the Vikings on the road\nA few weeks back since there's nothing in the AFC ease beyond the patriots that really um you know rouse the up either in\nBoth of these divisions are are struggling or they both have you know a key team a team that played the super bowl last year but that's not off to a perfect start and obviously eagles having more problems than the New England patriots are so\nUh you know the the jets have some kind of opportunity and you know to some degree their season begins when they first face New England and an ad that game and had that mile marker to find out exactly where they are at\nBut this is one on Sunday that is certainly winnable in a big way jets are favored going into this game against Indianapolis and now ... you have a little bit of a home field advantage in that you can rack up consecutive wins and beyond that and the bigger picture that you could\nDevelop and take some of the the next steps that you have to take this defense is still as a lot of young pieces are obviously they got a rookie quarterback who\nYou know it's been okay and you want to see him steadily improved throughout the season the armpits of wine coming up to eight phenomenal performance against Denver\nAre they able to do that again or do they shrink or to the level where they were a couple of weeks back\nUh you know these are the kinds of things that the jets have on the line this Sunday and will ah will dive into some NFL packs and have the lines for a little bit later on the show 'em off tomorrow so I Will do it on Thursday night\nWe'll get into the Mets and the seven o'clock hour or you got the Arizona fall league starting up the other night and Pete Alonzo uh the\nReally the the top prospect for the Mets right now certainly the most major league ready\nAh he had himself a night again as all he has done is produced everywhere that he has played every big game whether it be the\nSeason finale Las Vegas this year where you had to walk off home or to end the season or the future scam or in a home run last night in the Arizona fall league which is features some of the best prospects from all around baseball playing against each other\nA it's a my level competition and it it's a real good sign if you were able to you know have some ... success in that kind of lake especially for you know big time slugger power a guy like Alonzo it proves that maybe you can have some success against the better pitching\nI bet you see in a leak like that so uh ... just for the Mets as far as that goes uh we'll get to the latest on the GM hunt a and take your a Mets calls and baseball causal but later as well eight hundred three two one zero seven ten will chat with Danny no blurt bleacher report about the playoffs at large coming up right now in his uptick\nYour smoking is as far afield rated number one seven ten W O o voice of New York Hi\nIn ... home run off Austin role by the ... although the scores fourteen without a whole month and a\nYou know and that's they they obviously JD Martinez had a lot of home runs this year ... a lot of home runs this year they're capable of hitting home runs just like every other team in baseball now it is but they are also capable of doing other things\nYeah and you did see that as a difference in the Yankees unable to really take advantage of their bullpen and the way that they needed to and so ah the yanks are done here and we're left with the red Sox Astros in the American league as we chat again with Danny Noble or a bleacher report so with\nThat with this series and these are the two things one of the most the American league one hundred and three when astro steamed the defending champ the red Sox won a hundred and eight and it feels like everybody's trying to position themselves as the underdog going into the theory [laughter]\nYeah I don't do that either of these ... and the underdog right now one of the defending World Series\nWhat a modern day games they're both\nIn a lot of they faced each other in the playoffs last year uh obviously the Astros got by the red socks that time in kind of a series like what the Red Sox Yankees play the series that went for games and at times kind of felt close but really in the end wasn't a but\nThe red Sox got better certainly after last year adding JD Martinez and even this year\nYou know we'll see what the impact is going forward but this round the impact of getting Nathan evolve even\nA during the season or the Astros no question they got better they get better during last year when they added Justin ... but they got better over the winter when they add it gets cold it was their number to start or right now\nIn a lot of ways they could be a better team than they were last year there's other things that maybe go the other way and Carlos Korea I Know is there's some questions about his back he hasn't been as big an impact guy but they're really really good to both these teams\nYou talk about chasing greatness these two teams are right on the way towards greatness or when you win a World Series and get back to the ... the next year in the case the Astros when you're when a hundred and eight games\nWent back to back A L east division titles in that case the red Sox we're seeing\nA as close to greatness as baseball gets right now the ... even though the national league teams are bad I think these right now you are a good argument can be made that they're the two best teams in the sport this year\nThis is the class or here in the American league in the end if on match up with your finger the Astros the red Sox the Yankees are these three teams are going to be facing each other into big\nPlayoff series quite a bit coming up you know we notice the Yankees and the red Sox as much as their history there in the fan bases don't love each other um you know there wasn't a whole lot of this like between these two teams do that started to grow as the series went along a little bit and whether the red Sox bothered her not by air and judges\nBoom box a belt in our New York New York ah their Fenway Park I bought the Astros and the red Sox is there any reason for there to be some this'll bike or between these two squads\nWell none I mean in fact a scorer was the bench coach when they won the world series last year and ... and we learned a lot of them was very excited about working with age eight inch er during that\nTime [noise] so when you have to managers work together we've had that sometimes before when you have that it's hard to them feel like it was ... there's going to be a ... a lot of animosity between the two teams\nAnd there wasn't really any of that came out of the playoff series they played last year I think you're absolutely right that going forward potentially these two and especially the Yankees Red Sox again given the not only his the rivalry\nBut the both teams are really good that they met in the playoffs this year and that going into next year you know we'll see what happens over the winter in terms of moves and and things but you certainly with the young talent on both those teams\nYou have to figure there's going to be a lot of pennant race is between those two games and potentially more playoff series between them so there's\nThere's room for that animosity to grow although you're right at the moment it's nowhere near the level\nIt was say in the seventies or in the ... in a decade ago by a decade and a half ago thrill or when they play it and not not among the players and I don't even think really among the fan base\nThere there were a few of the of what will say Boston stinks chance the other day there was certainly a few of those Yankees big chance\nOr even when the Mets were in Boston or the end of the season but the the there's not a player on the Yankee team that gets the red Sox fans I are really up and same thing on the UC hurting the introductions the other night before game three of the stadium ... the the only real\nReaction to the red Sox are being introduced was the the funny cheers for David praised for having a bad game in game too but that there there was no a few boos for joy I but of course he wasn't even on the active roster you know it was no though David Ortiz like there was there's no a ride on the other side\nWe miss those villains and one guy I kind of see step into that role a little better now I'm sure his blood where he plays but what about Alex Brecht when he's willing to go out on a on a limb once in a while\n[laughter] absolutely no he he's a fun player but ... ... no question if you're on the other side you could definitely not like a that he's still brash and and that's great I mean it's great for the game but yeah I I don't know if at this point the Astros have a real\nRival the rangers would be if the rangers were good right now\nUh but the the rangers are a little bit forward building mode and it's hard to say that I don't know that any team out there just hates the Astros are but if there were there would probably have fragment I agree with you on that\nWe're talking again with Danny nobler bleacher aboard right now uh as far as nationally goes a brewers and Dodgers it there's a difference is between these two things the brewers are they haven't been in this mountain a long time meanwhile the Dodgers they seem to be here every year or so you know for the Dodgers team especially\nI think anything less than a World Series title is disappointment or how are they handling that\nOh I think that's absolutely true I I think at the\nThe when the years started and they had the injuries they did\nThe big one the this you're being Justin Turner breaking his hand right at the end of spring training and missing the start of the year and then when he came back not be at the same guy I think there was a little feeling okay well we maybe this is the year that you know it goes a little ... says a half step back and then they go for it\nYou know into the future but then they started playing better the division open up for they make the trade for many Machado who's a rental player but I really really big time star and Walker bealer came on the way did Turner came back and became\nI think they started thinking yeah this is the national league's opening up for us they have no reason to think they can't be the best team\nIn the national league and once they get to the world series if they do\nThey're going to feel like they've got to win it ... if they do we talk about teams going a long time without winning and you know every team has their own thing and it it it is for the for the Dodgers that idea that they haven't won it since Nineteen eighty eight to ... Kirk Gibson year I mean you know think about\nMets fans winning the world series in eighty six eighty eight we're only talking to two years sooner\nMhm it does feel like a long time it is a long time and I you know the same way you might hear from its players that they get tired of just seeing\nYou know the the highlights of of eighty six on the eighty six players well believe me Dodger players have felt the same way for a long time about seeing Kirk Gibson's homerun and they would love to have something new where there's another championship and you're right\nThere's going to be a feeling like they they are supposed to win and and one of the things that made the playoffs this year fun is you out a lot of teams in that situation but the Yankees whether we think they had a real reason to feel that way or not\nCame into the seasons and definitely even into the playoffs chicken they were supposed to win\nAbsolutely the red Sox lot that way and even more so after winning a hundred and eight after winning it last year and getting better the Astros no question felt that way maybe not the brewers but now that they're there I'm sure and they've played great I'm sure they're thinking why not\nSure hey you talk about the the mindset of the Dodgers I mean it feeds right into Clinton ... as well right where he throws a scoreless against the Braves is I well that's nice but until this guy there was a shutout game seven it's still going to be a post ... know Bumgarner\n... and also you know he's been there through this time and he's part of that they have one since eighty eight I mean he's been there in play offs and the Dodgers all they have a one since eighty eight they've been in a lot of\nDivision series and championship series where they thought they could have one and they didn't and Kirsch as part of that and he's got the opt out of the contract at the end of this year which we don't know what's going to end up happening with that but there's always the thought is this the last go around I think you're absolutely right there\nBut there's some pressure on al ... and it does it's part of the interesting part of the series is at I'll see is that when we talk about the birds we don't talk about any starting pitchers all at the Dodgers\nWe sure do and we talk about not just ... but we talked about Walker deal with it that kid coming up being maybe that the next ... Shaw or them and we talk about even ... engine route who's really been good going down the stretch uh but yeah I I Would say criticized\nThey'll go out and grab a Jackie Bradley junior from Boston who's a very solid to a player can you go out and maybe take a chance on a Byron botched energy fallen out of favor in Minnesota guy with a lot of talent that they left in the minor leagues at the end of the season and you hope you can put it together with his second team former number two overall picking the draft\nA guy thinks that you can look at and I I'm fully willing to no chance that maybe you do really regret move at somebody like Alonzo who has all this power in ... ability\nBut I think in the national league until we see I'm really and I haven't seen him defensively a whole lot and we have heard about various players in the past that Michael could for it I Would struggle in the outfield and\nUh that Don Smith was going to be tremendous at first base and all these reports have been wrong Jeff McNeil then he didn't have a position and\nLook terrific at second base a when he had the opportunity of the last couple of months of the year you know with all those things being in the mix I I'd want to see a launch at some point at first base but you might not get that opportunity if you're the Mets and\nIf you can go out and grab a centerfield there's going to help I'll always take center fielder over first baseman analogue that might be a great back maybe ... in the American league and as a ton of success there but uh you don't know exactly you know how he's going to fit in at first going forward a and with that\nYou know again if you can capitalize on that I Would really really look into it but\nA ... either way when you want to keep Alonzo potentially move Alonzo the Maury hits the better he does the better off the Mets are and you know that'll be one of the key decisions that the Mets front office and whoever it is that ends up as their general manager\nWant to make over the course of this off season what age beat Alonzo if any American ... first basement of the future\nAre you able to move a Jay Bruce or a Todd Frasier and make some room for him somewhere you know these are the kinds of things that they really got to figure out and you're going to have a philosophy what kind of team you want to be Sandy ... philosophy we know what it was he wanted sluggers he was a big on defense he want to power pitching\nAnd the Mets at times it was good at it wrote them to the world series of twenty Fifteen\nOr but as the team aged and uh you didn't stay as healthy as they needed to pitching wise the last two seasons have been pretty rough to watch um\nI think you need more of a balance there and some more defense being involved there's no doubt beat Alonzo you would be the ... player\nA don't worry about that they slap my first base hope you get to thirty five home run even as a rookie I think that's the kind of number that you could reasonably expect from Alonzo uh but you know what will be the\nPhilosophy going forward here Mickey Callaway of the as much saying things certainly sounded like you want to see a lot more defense and athleticism and some different kinda hitters\nOn this myth steam going forward and you know that it's something that I Do agree with Mickey Callaway on and it's good you know drive it the whole conversation about\nAnalytics and what kind of players want up there at the plate I Know the there's been a big conversation around the Yankees and John Carlos standing and are they to power a oriented we talked ... before as well\nI really think it's about situational heading there are times where the home run is the way to go and let a rep and there are times where that's not what you're looking for and you want to keep the line moving\nA and I thought Jeff McNeil was the perfect example of that kind of hit or that you'd like to see in this league at times he had the big swing he was looking to put it in the upper deck and good for him\nAnd there were times where he's looking to move around her second or third but not just giving up and out but trying to get a base it to the right side and hey if it's a ground ball the second base so be it the guy gets over to third you need a fly ball man on third less than two out get the fly ball put the ball and play make something happen\nThose are the things that you appreciate you know strike outs don't matter when there's nobody on but there are men on base your demo right they matter they matter and a big way that strike out John Carlos stat and had the ninth inning with two on nobody out it kills you\nAt least put the ball and play and try to make something happen and that's where\nAre you do see you know some of the the situational heading I think fall by the wayside and that's it's harder to you know look at it and the numbers are not going to show up overall for the season but you know different situations you got to have different approaches and I think there are too many guys in the league that had the same approach\nEvery single time they step up to the plate\nEight hundred three two one zero seven ten again eight hundred three two one zero seven ten\nUh what would you like to see the Mets do this off season we take some calls on that well the NFL packs coming up a little bit later\nAnd we'll get into these are two Elsie as series Astros Red Sox brewers Dodgers and how they're going to set things up game one on the I don't see us tomorrow else yes on Saturday it's the sports don't repeat
