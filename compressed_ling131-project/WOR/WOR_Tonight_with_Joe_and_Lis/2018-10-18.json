I Can't go round and round the track on this so that's how you know what I'm going to give up to ...\nAnd got me in the newsroom and I'll probably get yelled at like Ohio she yelling at you in the newsroom because\nYou know uh because ... shouldn't be able to do that so women thing you\nActually has not doesn't really badly actually had an opinion that suffer\nNever heard this before from Natalie in I have opinions so tell us what do you think you really are you offended by what Trump said to Stormy Daniels\nWhat bothers me is that he has different standards than the rest of us in like a half a show called somebody and if you call me that name and I went to HR and said you know what I was at the ... that killed called me of course faith in the office\nKill probably get in trouble well the president and the president has some prerogative is yeah you can get away\nWith the rest of it but this is\nMy son called it a girl in his class of ... he would get called down to the principal's office or\nGetting a little too sensitive exactly he got available time here and stone's may break my name's never hurt me well what am I\nWrong is that a maybe we are to be censored I agree with that point but kept the world we live in now so why doesn't he have to live in the same standards the rest of us\nBecause it's refreshing though it's refreshing we all have to go around everything these days you know this is called\nPretzel shaping and real and Bartlett do it all the time whenever the president of the land I live and let me tell you that the press away agree with you know we give out the other day with up there and our big three the friend that on halls Stormy Daniels\nAnd now you can\nAlso in the ... on\nThe latest on the apparent murder of the journalists the by Saudi Arabia Congressman Peter king had joined us earlier\nWe um we had a ... report from Istanbul so we're all over that story on the show rounding out the big three are no winner in may go last night uh friday's jak pie grows to an all time record of eight hundred and sixty million but I I did the math Michael\n... million if you take the cash option\nAnd after taxes you're only going to walk away with three hundred million so it's really hardly worth ... ...\nFantasy lottery winner Len Burman over here already already figure with the money\nGo to our favorite White House correspondent John Carla and Washington for ABC News a John I I'm just a or to do is roll my eyes a one week it's Kanye now it's horse race it must be a thriller minute to cover the president down in Washington\n[laughter] well we were just a a look crunching the numbers here at the ABC White House or both the president\nFor the past ten days we believe has gone on his door Rick media blitz I don't think we have seen a ten day period and all of American history and I'm going back to I'm going back to George okay all the way back\nWeight or anything as George Washington yeah for president as\nTaking more questions\nFrom ah the news media than this president has I mean there's been an rolling nonstop\nPress conference saying all kinds of things I mean he's he's he's just openly pondered where his uh attorney general is he's attacked his a row quite quite strongly is that the fed chairman that he nominated Stormy Daniels space\nThe uh the the whole escapade with um with a Kanye West in the oval office but it has been it is it it's been impossible to keep up\nWith John Wayne and by the way during this\nPeriod we haven't seen Sarah Sanders [laughter] I mean there there there hasn't been any sign of the press secretary so the theory that we're working on here is it they have hired a new press secretary here at the White House in his name is Donald\nTrump could well be let me ask you do you think that ah one of the reasons he's out and about so much of that he's getting more and more confident that the Republicans might exceed expectations in the midterms\nWell I think that that is part of it he certainly did this all starts after Kavanaugh's confirmed\nSo clearly first of all feels really good about that victory um a he feels that there's he has been shown some good news for the Republicans in terms of the midterms especially I'm On a ... and the Senate races but even the house races you here\nYou know ... ... ... the ... the Democrats will win the house but you hear even from Democrats a wheel a toning down of the expectations\nYou know the ... that the when the house but it will probably be narrowly I mean who knows I mean they've got a lot lot can change in this world in three weeks but there's no question that the environment has improved for Republicans the president knows that and uh he feels like he's got the wind at his back and he is just out there everywhere\nWell I'm Glad we have you on the line John Carl NBC News White House correspondent 'cause the president tweeted seconds ago and you can interpret this for me I don't know what he's referring to he says a P headline was very different from my quote and meaning in the story they just can't help themselves fake news now which any idea which have on he's referring to here\nYeah that's a good question I'm I'm not I don't know now the AP story the the the lead out of the pie story was that the president compared the situation with the the ...\n... to a dip in the ratings last year I didn't believe it I said it has to do with competition and games well the games have been there been some terrific games high scoring\nMany of them one in the last second on a field goal the big names of stepped up and hug Brady into Aaron Rodgers new stars of a reason like I'm a pet homes in Kansas City\nAnd I and I just think I'm a as for the ratings are up so uh and and you know another thing when it comes to television\nOne other no don't want to give you is is a story out that's saying the uh you know the MIT terms\nYou know when it comes to television coverage of elections obviously a presidential election gets the big big coverage yeah well they're saying all the networks are treating the midterms like a presidential year well it's a big big election coming up well\nI'm ... I'm Wondering if you on the right thing that's because the left the networks and they're going to win the house and that's why they're treating it with such importance ABC News is saying uh this uh this is going to be an event of seismic proportions\nWell the whole question is if the Democrats get control of the house then they have subpoena power they can hound the president they might impeach the president that's a historic moment and it's well worth tuning in for what's interesting is\nThe late night shows are going to go live yeah\nSo a ... it's even called bear who often you know he'll go live during the president's election so he's gonna he's gonna go live a let's see who else is Seth Meyers on even later on NBC is going to go live the uh the Daily Show will be alive so I guess yeah\nBut you have to say the other thing is going to drive the ratings are there is genuine excitement surrounding this election when it looked like the Dems had a sure fire shot at taking a house I was probably going to be tuning out but now that it's gotten closer since the Kavanaugh hearings it's going to be a cliffhanger you're even you might stay up past your bedtime and watch it on\nWell don't back on his own bed on that [laughter]\nSo you who who let me set up this next story 'cause because ... basically thinks the royals were a waste of\nTime he's not a big fan of kids and then he walks into sport he says oh there's this this video this little kid and with Megan and Harry in Australia and I'm saying is this what what did you like take the wrong pills this morning when he woke up\nI mean well I was I was channeling my inner soccer mom when I was looking at this video and I thought well Natalie do if she saw this video and I've had ... ... you go that's so cute it's a video of a kid a Megan and Harry are down under there to New Zealand and Australia\nAnd are they met this kid I think it was in Australia where there was a drought\nAnd the part of that ah the country suffering so they went to try to give some comfort to these people and is this cute little kid and he goes up to Harry and he plays with Harry's beer but just you and then he hugs Megan he won't let go of\nRight and they just ... really hurt apparently somebody said he he loves Santa Claus like most children Dale and appeared reminded him\nThe ginger Santa swat was this kid oh he was young I Know ... why are the issues for like mall and making it was just a little kid what\nShilling infamous fiction what I Would say is that drought has it had a dry water in a week\nDid you see the new pictures of make an inherent today\nAs she got the baby bump no matter who was telling me that it was raining there\nAnd she and he was giving a speech and see me ... ... holding the umbrella for him\nAnd all of us are sort of why wasn't millennia holding it for some reason why I\nSaid that's the job of the of the check out his speech the chamber of ... famous guy well you know you're going to the side by side pictures of that that's right well you see you could see that video on our website write them a little kid Oh absolutely not been ten W. O. R. dot com slash lent and Michael you can see the kid playing with hairy little beer\nAnd I think it's a completely appropriate that she was holding the umbrella that's the way it should be exactly get back in the kitchen and cook's sub soup here right so [laughter]\nI don't think making them they cook on my soup such trouble surprise the president and interview with Fox News last night you know he's a very big fan of Michael Bloomberg witty\nLines are spending your evening with our replay of this morning show just for a brand new ... in the morning tomorrow from six to seven then wor\nEverybody's got a little a political news for you know you may have heard and I guess we\nProbably told you 'cause it broke when we were on the air Michael Bloomberg former mayor of New York city he re registered as a Democrat leading people to speculate that he may be running for the presidential nomination on the Democratic party now what Trump was asked about that on Fox Business I think\nYeah well he was on Fox Business a shocking in an interview with Fox he did\nWhen he doesn't seem to threatened by a little Mikey Bloomberg he does not\nMichael Bloomberg might be running that's good\nYeah I think it'd be easy though is I don't think he was trying to get to the Democrats and I wouldn't be able to do anything in the primaries where the party I think I think the Democrats will feed 'em up\nThey'll eat 'em up those Democrat yeah Pocahontas all scalp him\nUntil the Gulf this fits right and I got I got an email from a listener ... hello Helen so we're high on my mother's name some partial to then I'm so obviously we're talking about the uh the Trump news where he called a ... a Stormy Daniels or space\nYou said your co host doesn't see anything wrong with President Trump calling people names he does the same thing like when he calls you an idiot he defends from 'cause he identifies with him why did I call unity it\nUm I don't know on a regular basis [laughter] I don't look at it today are not like I called you in India Today no I just rolled my eyes at you but I Will unity of that but I I Do know if you call me ... you you do that with love absolutely I Will tell you and I guess I ...\nI I shouldn't let does concern me at all but I mentioned on Facebook I don't do a lot on Facebook I really don't they do more on Twitter at Len Burman sports you want to follow up but I Do a little bit more but I Know very little on Facebook and I but I posted a foot 'em over ten below\nTen with all of it was so oh I Know what no so I did put my thoughts first on Twitter\nAbout the horse race which I thought it was inappropriate as soon as I posted I lost for followers that like we don't want to hear from this guy so then I went over to Facebook and I said you know this I find this interesting as soon as I say voice an opinion about a president using the phrase horse race and I\nI also use this phrase you know he smashes through the glass basement every time you think he can't get any lower ego smashing through the glass base with very cleverly in any way I thought it was pretty clever so and I should have a sound effect for that anyway crash a nobody says effect would be the\nArab ... posts on Facebook and that happened to see it I got such a vicious response is going to repeat some of them it's amazing to me you know I thought sports fans were kind of rabid yeah they have nothing compared to all these these political you should\nDo that with some Broadway fans will boy really they don't like the reviews though yeah they go on chat boards and several you\nI'm telling you I thought you were pretty good on Facebook you know social\nMedia that's going to happen because people feel like they're hiding behind their computer or their tablet or their phone in you could say whatever you want\nWhenever I wrote a negative things about Broadway celebs at or below that people would just show me on\nAnd let's see that's to suit is that to see it as a kid you had to show us speaking of Saudi Arabia the president also\nA spoke about that with Fox Business last night\nAnd Saudi Arabia looking at her show and it depends on whether or not the king the crown prince who knew about it in my opinion [noise]\nNumber one what happens whether or not they knew about it\nIf they knew about it that will be bad\nIf they didn't know about it stings bad things can happen\nI think it's pretty obviously going to know about it I mean the times had a pretty good piece today about how some of these people had direct contact with the print so I think there is you can connect the dots so when the president said that would be bad what's he can do about it I mean that's the big issue for him\nBy the way going back to Bloomberg what do you think his chances of if he decides to run up getting the nomination are do you agree with Trump that he's going to be alive by the other Democrats or do you think he could to fend them off and go after\nTrump will there was a poll that came out last week was had him very low among Democrats ... percent or something yeah the big favors by ... All right so I Would think Biden may be tough to beat on the Democratic side a ... kind of a likeable guy I Know is age listen Trump's old too but I mean I it's\nI think I'm business the mold Biden I Know by and this email that he's seen as older\nYeah no I agree with that but I think a Biden's likeability factor his connection with the working class I think right now he's the favorite I think\nThe Democrats really need is for someone to come out of nowhere the way Bill Clinton did the way of ... just boom and all of a sudden the ride on the scene I don't know who that person has it could be grossed Saturday in LA I I don't think Hillary grow up her book or I don't think it's any book or I don't think this can become Harris I don't think it's I you know and it's not going to be Pocahontas\nNo no I Can't use that name seriously I I Can't use that name I don't know but I got a little grief from someone at home for you it's a lizard with Warren [noise]\nSo I don't have to put up with that at home thank God I can call her Pocahontas all I Want to do but I just don't think any of them really have much of\nA ... I think the hardcore left in the Democratic party their standard bearer is going to beep Pocahontas that's who they want they think that she's the one who can tackle trumped take him on go down to his level fight him with the sticks and stones that he fights everybody else\nAnd I'm not sure she can carry Massachusetts against Trump what do you think you I really think will be a total landslides romp runs against Elizabeth Warren I think it will be but\nShe uh she crushes them with a hammer which is ... my mind is my mom's pot roast month ... other religious right Steve ...\nI started cooking

managing that right field line ran out and said nope fan interference\nAnd so it goes to replay and you take a million look it looks at this thing and to me Joe West got it wrong or it's not fan interference in that spot ...\nEver so slightly going into the crowd I don't think any of the fans are blatantly reaching over a that\nWall in order to interfere with bats to human reaction you got a baseball coming at ya\nYou got to make a move to catch it but I didn't think anybody was going out of their way to impact player or reach over that wall now is it a thousand percent conclusive not on the camera angles that I saw last night I couldn't tell you a hundred thousand percent\nThat that was the case but I think looking at everything there and trying to use some common sense that they shouldn't be anything wrong with what happened on that point it should be a home run that should be the ultimate call yes bachelors interfered with but\nI at that point he was in the fans territory and once you're in the fans territory it's not baseball interference it's just you know you get knocked around a little bit you got to fight in order to make those kinds of catches and\nTo me uh your job west gets it wrong on the field and then I actually wasn't supportive what happened with the replay where they did not overturn it to me reply it should be absolutely clear cut definitive if you're going to overturn a call and the game\nAnd that's not always the case and I find it frustrating when it's not because replay isn't there to you know read legislate all these places and go over it or sixteen times the players that I Want replay to get right or the bang bang plays at first base wherever they might be where it's clear\nWhere you could freeze frame it and it's clear that the call is wrong on the field a hundred percent no doubt about a bang bang done if you got to watch her play sixteen times they try to figure out if it needs to be overturned it probably doesn't need to be overturned\nAnd last night while I Do think Joe ... got it wrong\nOr it's a tough call and\nOverturning it on replay in my book would have been the wrong thing to do\nAnd replay should be for the extreme blatant errors and I think where it does go wrong is when people are trying to parse hairs and um you know go frame by frame and and really try to split these things apart and\nYou know that's that's not what it's about get the obvious calls right when the umpire misses the call and years ago Joe Mauer hitting the ball down the line and it's clearly a was a fair or foul and they called it the wrong way and you see two seconds later and everybody in the stadium to see the two seconds later\nYou can't have that last night\nThe replay is not the issue the the original call is what\nI had a a problem with there and uh they gotta\nOh they did um and that's just you know partly commonsense to\nThe guy is clearly going into the stands to some degree\nAnd and people have to react I don't know what you expect the bans to do in that situation but their hands in their pocket and wait for the ball to hit him in the belly like you have to make a move one way or the other the ball is coming at you if\nYou are in the front row last night uh there in Houston and one day I I found interesting is the band he's already been named and in fact has been doing a newspaper interviews in his name's choice\nCalled well and I use state is that the town that Chicago is baseball wise and it was it a game seven and things like that but the really the really want you're connected to that and\nYou know shortly somebody's got to identify your friends you know who you are right but I given interviews and talking about it and ah he's saying you know to the Boston Globe I don't understand even what happened I was over the ... and\nAnd the ball had I had my hands out you could see it I got like eight hundred pictures that are it came to me\nBut I'm over the line I put my hand out and the ball hit my hand they keep saying these over the line um but I think he means he wasn't home line I don't want to try to parse it too much but is he later said I never touched the glove I don't understand why it wasn't a home run\nWe're we're I'm this is where I Am not a hundred percent when I watch the replay why don't they they should have overturned it he is he jumped before the fence is moving backwards and he's reaching backwards so it is unclear to me\nYou know if he is all the way into the stands in that situation a\nYeah he's also coming across says he's not like it's not like going back and jumping up against us and he's like making a kind of the line off your back back in two years left\nYeah I mean it's possible it is possible in the situation that both the fans are over ... over [laughter] and then when you call it ...\nIt well and and that the camera angle that were lost a security guard yeah that that would have to agree on a one way or the other that would have shown it to me that I just think\nThat you had a different angle and we've all seen 'em and he was definitive in terms of this call so you must have seen it\nWow he's going to be definitive no matter what you know that's his personality and and that's the job of an empire especially an old school on par aid even at the video says otherwise hey this is what I saw and you just own it\nYeah so I I think that's what you get out of Joe West after the game and it takes a\nCopy a you know as far as being as you know ... was that he got it right last night I'll be right we don't have that definitive\nAngle and that's true they had the definitive angle and there was a security guard standing in the ... of the angle that would have given us the best idea of what the heck happened in who reached\nOver the line and was in the wrong whether it's the fan or not that ... in the wrong here but at the very least that would change the call so um\nYeah I mean it's it's a tight call for all the\nCalls that Joe West is you know maybe blown over the years you could look at I think this is a really tough call to have to make\nBut if you're going to make you better be absolutely one hundred percent sure fan reached over and based on the video evidence that we have and not only the video evidence but you know the the common sense approach a bit of who's leaning over who's in the field of play I don't see it and I don't know\nAgain what you can even expect of a fan in that situation you're not reaching out trying to interfere with the gay and nobody's trying to save one for the Astros rip his glove off its natural ... it's almost a defensive reaction to\nTry to catch that baseball is block it from a hit me in the chest or Gary in Westchester which that Gary\n[noise] I don't even know show us was still on\nAround baby events Carter still playing ball a gel West is still a part\nThat said I thought it was his son when they said listen a lot of people\nI notice to the is when they describe something she on an instant replay with video\nAnd they do it on the radio I listen you listen to this I said the one Bruce and Bruce ... says well maybe they just go see a an orthodontist or something or ... whatever they call it got listen with throws you is Becky jumping up and his arm and glove is higher than the wall and then throws you but\nThe glove is even though he's in the wall his glove is still in play folks if you really look at it closely the kids chained is in fair territory hits ... glove prevention from catch the ball that was is the fear is there's a lot of people don't have really good vision detected out but if you really\nCall I Want I looked at the pictures of looked at the video I I don't I don't see it that way and I'm not alone\n... glasses or anything [laughter] we [laughter] if you don't really good vision\nWhat's that about good vision and you're staring at a computer screen it's right in front of you\nYou will pick it up unless you have real good I've seen people described faced with the is on the radio and I look at the video and saying this guy I was looking at something different people don't have that kind of visual you look at it\nWith rose you mean the obvious his glove is above the war but that is in play for the kid is leaning with his hand out it and it's the glove and closes batches ... you can't catch the ball\nThe hand is it the kids can do is play and so that's his glove that you gotta know being in church all the like the New York when that he goes back to New York I mean is that the only do they have more camera angles that we might oh no you know so\nThey they have with the TV has it's oh it's not a multi by\nA cameras multi broadcast situation so they have the standard cameras that was the TBS game last night CBS so that's that's what they're working with sea sexually we have all the angles and the best one is blocked by the security guard\nA and again I'm not going to say is the worst called Joe West has ever made because there are people who watch this multiple\nTimes and you know Gary is that the only one who's had this opinion but uh people of washes a ton and instead both boys is incredibly tough call to make it and maybe it's possible Joel was that the definitive angle that nobody else had or at least we don't have looking at the video but\nI don't I don't see any evidence of a fan reaching over\nThat line now I guess it depends too where do you where does the line start where where does the field began and where does a did that you know the stands begin if you have when you have probably two or three inches of padding that make up the fence so is that neutral\nIs that the field of play is that not appeal to play a and again I actually think that you have a case where everybody is reaching over that line of it's right on top of it so\nUh it's uh I'm not gonna say it's an easy call by any means but from what I saw and maybe I got to get my eyes checked again [laughter] but uh\nI I think it's got to be a home run\nBut what's crazy again if you were playing that in the street or play on your friends and there's no letter of the law you probably called a ground rule double right that would be the fairest outcome when it's so hard to determine\nBut it's not an option the rules are the rules are it's an out or it's a home run the fans get booted from the game that they boot the fan because the quote unquote reached over because that's the ruling that he reached into the\nField of play a set of this guy get booted from the game I don't think he did I read anything like that day but that that will tell you if he didn't that nobody really knew what the heck happened\nAh with this uh this given play but do you play in the series\nAnd now and he wasn't thrown out a producer a on top of that so\nYou know he gave the interviews Troy Caldwell I is he a pariah and used in probably not but he's definitely not getting the Jeffrey ... treatment or going going from here but\nHow do you avoid this kind of thing we can touch on that take some calls eight hundred three two one zero seven and a ... game five tonight and the red Sox can end the series though\nAnd they're gonna have a rough time doing that to nine to ... will spell out what their situation is also a plus ... head football coach of Rutgers be with us it's six fifty it's sports on with the McCarthy on the voice in New York ... W O R\nTo the right of the others he's standing with his hands left and on the wall on the ...\n[noise] he's perpendicular to the field almost completely which means that the entire with his body shoulder to shoulder is behind the fence is right or which is reaching out and touching the other hand is parallel to the fence practically perfectly so it's geometric plea\nImpossible for that call to be in the field of play\nBecause she is squared chew the fence and his right arm is parallel and it's touching the other's hands which means that they're at least\nNot along just stare at this thing Jonathan oh about five ten minutes [laughter] yeah\nYeah I I you know it's funny 'cause you use it perfectly staring thing for a while solve one way Gary stared at it sided another way and ah\nYou know it it's where they shouldn't have overturned again on replay 'cause it's not conclusive on the even the photographic evidence that we have now I see it the angles like you do a and I also see the fans they're not reaching out their arms or an outstretched their arms are bent as the ball's coming in\nBut uh not reach\nOut and and if anything a glove pushed into their hands rather than than reaching out it touches club\nI agree with that as well and and bets his momentum is clearly bringing him backwards or so yes he would have had more force going into them know that that still doesn't mean that their hands aren't already over but I don't think they are right and\nIt's a it's an amazing play because you can you know go back and forth on this a million times like I've said as some people say well why some people see it the other\nAnd um you know in in my opinion dude like what do you expect the fans to do\nIt this is the rule we expect them to go and and it's possible that they met right over that yellow ally\nAnd is that in the field of play directly over the fence or is that outside the field apply the ball can land on the top of the fence and come back into play or go over so\nIt's kind of in play but\nYeah it's a it's not it's confusing I think it's a very difficult thing to hammer out a I'm just happy that the replay didn't overturning and then you know like well what the heck did they see\nA that would have been a disaster a ball of all disasters I Do the some of the criticism of West while I I did that you got it wrong or is all over the top because this isn't a\nThis is it a me all about me Joe West moment this is a country Joe making the game about here\nYou can see what he thinks he saw and he's not throwing out a player in a big spot he's not showing right I mean he's trying to get this thing right and and he didn't get it right in my opinion\nEight hundred three two one zero seven ten Chris Ash head football coach Rutgers we'd comeback sports on what people call it the other voice in New York ... double you all are\nPacked into W O R sports\nEvery week we ... the head coach of Rutgers football crash into Rutgers has northwestern coming it's scat away\nSaturday at noon homecoming\nOr they're in Piscataway and a coach Asher plus you have you on again how are you today\nI'm doing great I really appreciate you guys ever saw each week\nNow You're welcome and uh as far as your home coming week what um I get locked into the game I'm sure but is there anything that you do get a feel for when uh it it is you know this kind of a special game\nYou know whoa companies always a special weekend on on on every college shift as this opportunity for former players alumni to come back and get together and hang out hopefully cheer on our football team to victory but it's a special weekend we've got off a weekend\nOr is that the uh on friday night and hopefully a lot of people come up to the game on Saturday I watch the football game\nThat Carli Lloyd the outstanding ah you know us women's national soccer player and be amongst that hall of fame class a self made fun of a a fun part of it at any alarms that you know of that you're looking forward to seeing on Saturday\nUh you know I don't know what the list of people are killed I'm sure there'll be a several in and get a chance to bump into some either friday or Saturday before the game\nThis past Saturday at thirty four seven loss to Maryland and you know rather than kind of do the same questions what are some areas where you feel the team has improved over the course of this year\nWell I really like our special teams right now and I know that's you know a little bit a different answer but our our special teams are very very important to us some are involved in special teams and it's a really a good indicator of the culture we have on our football team or we've really improved on her kickoff team were number one at a big janitor\nPunching continues to rise to get better each week a week kicked longest field goals and in the history of writers ... this year and our our football team is really bought into it and I really liked that because our first year we were off all special teams that were really worked hard to prove that area\nI really just like the growth maturity in the development of all the young players were playing\nWe have played thirty a first or second your players or football team we have several uh guys that are being you know potentially red shirted\nOn a defense lawyer that they're going to be really good players in the future but I've really enjoyed watching those young guys are proven develop as we go along also\nHow 'bout that kick off unit ... what does that tell you about a group of teams that are as a sign of ... what do you look at it as just attitude\nA yeah I mean that's where it starts to me one you've got to have a great kicker gets good Hank time and place which we do and then it just about having the right attitude and mentality or\nFewer kickoff unit and putting those guys on there but it's about the motivation you know we haven't recruited any of these guys\nAre to come to our our football team to run down our kick off you know they wanna play position officer defense and uh I think we do a great job of motivating these guys are getting ready to run down there and and they'll try to get a pet them inside of twenty five yard line and our guys take ownership and that and they have a lot of fun with it\nIs there a player even beyond this year maybe ... years prior that excelled on special teams and then was rewarded with some some added opportunities after that\nUh you know we've had one he's kind of been injured this year in ... and he's been able to do it since the first couple of weeks we've got a young man named Larry Stevens who was a walk on force or your ... your runs out uncovers that kicks on a kickoff stand up pumps and he earned a scholarship because of just those two units and\nThat's the type of unsung heroes a lot of people don't know about you know for a walk on going to a scholarship guy because of the way he covers kicks and um you know we've got a few guys that are like that but Larry Stevens has really been\nYou know one of those guys if I've really been proud of\nA lot of ways to contribute and our cat what Chris asked the head football coach at Rutgers I read your taking a more active role with the defense going forward [noise]\n[noise] yeah I I started doing that last week against Maryland I'm it's no secret we we haven't played great on office and defense and there's a number of reasons why in his head football coach and a former defensive coordinator\nYou know I Want to get involved with the defense and try to help get some of the problem solve you know I sit and coaches meetings but uh I don't I'm you'll run the meetings with the players\nAnd and I've started to do that and it's really just to try to change up a little dirty and create some new energy\nAnd to have one comment voice or with the install and end up making the adjustments and stuff like that so it's actually been fun for me to get back in the room and coach a little bit of but it's really just an effort to try to clean some things up and get our guys are focused to do their job\nThey feel like you're starting to see some results from that\nYou know I I thought last Saturday just Mariano scored a story for points for 'em you we only gave yeah we had to mistakes that cost us a touchdowns in the past it's been four or five with two other than that we we took the ball\nOn the field in Maryland has the ball inside or thirty five yard line three times those are tough situation where our guys didn't complain about it they went out and they played really hard and I was so pleased with the effort that I saw some of them only on game day but on filled if we continue to do that we're gonna play better defense down the stretch your\nWhere do you see on a on a Saturday against North West or\nThe sort of got a Fitzgerald set a great job at Northwestern they just spend a model of consistency during his tenure there especially for the last ten years the office defensive remain the same they recruited certain style as a young man and\nOther smarter talked a dependable you know good guys that were looking for our program and I'm really impressed with what he's done this week they've got a senior quarterback Clayton Tillerson has been before your starter pointed at very high level um their clicking on all cylinders in the past game and we've got to do a great job match routes and get out the quarterback and trying to disrupt the timing\nFor ranked opponents in the games that follows that adds emergency to this game\nYou know every James or as got urgency you know when you're up\nWhere we're at right now every game is a big game and we're just trying to get their guys dropped play best they can and really the message right now is just going to have fun go have fun playing a game that you love with the guys you love doing it with\nAnd you know I think uh your early on I think some of the guys with a lot of pressure to go out and when you know they they set a goal of wanting to go to ball games I'll take that to put some extra pressure on them\nYou know I I just want to go out and have fun and enjoy it right now\nI Will have on this Saturday a homecoming in Piscataway against northwestern thanks couch\nThank you Chris said football\nCoach of Rutgers and you'll be able to hear that game right here on seven ten wor noon on Saturday right now and is that the\nNew York [laughter] we'll rated number one seven ten W O o voice of New York and\nYou go through a five six game losing streak and baseball and and ... ... is usually you got a lot of time\nTo come back and get yourself out of it you're one of five like the giants just think of this you have to win for in a row in a month and an entire month just to get back to five hundred and so that it's just awful difficult to do\nNow I usually look at ten and six is what gets in the door to the playoffs do you looking at you know nine and a nine to one uh you know the kind of a run the John it's going to have different\nAnd how much difference is they're really what do you think about it between six and ten and ten and six a lotta times there's not that much else close last year at a call goes against you crazy bounce the ball and that's what turned seasons in this way again and it just shows it just shows how close and competitive it really is\nAnd not only is it close to tie scoring this year as an extra five four to five points per game over last year in this league it's changed remarkably quick\nOh my goodness you know I was looking at some some numbers the other day and your ears one that just jumped out at me so far there have been\nFifteen quarterbacks that have passed for they're not different quarterbacks but there's been Fifteen games where a quarterback have four hundred yards passing ... last season there were eight the entire year\nWow and so like you said the scoring is just crazy they'll pass or ratings you've got eleven used to be great to be able to have a pass or anything of a hundred or war right now there's a Lebanon quarterbacks that are a hundred or higher better off was burger is already over two thousand yards patched it stood and so\nDefense you know earlier this week we have the buccaneers fire fire defensive coordinator that's one job I Would not want\nIn this NFL right now is a defensive coordinator because you're almost powerless against some of these ... and what the rules of the talented a quarterback so the receivers it's it's just really difficult to stop anybody on a consistent basis do you think of it\nEveryone's out twenty eight points that's a lot of points to say generally a you know so many things just weren't over thirty twenty eight points that's four touchdown but what do you think of it is for scores that's not a tremendous amount and right now like you said it's a it's almost like a RINO arena football cut in half\nFootball's arena football's fifty yard field so yet scores in the sixties and seventies yeah that's a hundred yards it it's a lot of times the thirties and forties and it's just a different game right now being quiet\nNow we're talking right now at Howard balls are the sports exchange either you can win\nDefense right that's the old axiom deep and running game playoff bad weather or whatever it is but can you actually win that way when what else can you do get defensive\nWell if you have a great defense you probably have a chance to win but it's hard to have\nA great defense anymore than again be because of the rules have personal past Russia is can be held\nThat's number one and they they call they call holding a very small percentage of the time then when he when he finally break through your you have in your head I'll hold my goodness I have to watch how I tackle or his quarterback well I'm going to get a big penalty and so angle bad angles get taken and it leads\nTo big plays and and so\nIt ... like I said it makes it very difficult on defenses but even if you have a great defense are really good one and there are some teams that do have that you still better be able to score points\nAnd it's just coming down I I don't know that that axiom holds up a anymore I don't know if it ever really did because he still has a score points but if you were dominant enough you could you could win games but uh and and win game maybe I don't know about a championship now when the weather turns coal in January to get into the playoffs so who knows how\nHow this is all going to happen and how it's going to play out but it's it's a\nObviously it's an office of game now it's reflected in the TV ratings and all isn't it funny we don't talk about\nSlumping TV ratings anymore because these primetime games with great quarterbacks a lot of points keep people watching when it gets to be you know midnight on the east\nCoast it's been entertaining not here and I don't know if this gained an idle do that [laughter] though that there might be the people look at all that one\nBut there is there's been some really entertaining games to watch so far\nTalking again with Howard balls are the sports exchange about the the Los Angeles chargers depend a lot of on field success this year but every game they play a home feels like a road game or you know what what do you make of their situation in Los Angeles right now\n[laughter] well I I think what happened there and say here's what's interesting they just announced their ticket prices yesterday\nAnd this was kind of a little note that's been lost on a lot of a lot of people the tickets for the new stadium but the charge that are putting on sale are actually going to be less expensive than the ones that they they have now\nIn in the small stuff up center because it was only thirty thousand seats so they had pretty high ticket prices well I think what's happening is a lot of the charges I mean they're sold out of the season tickets but a lot of those fans paying what they are for tickets they sell them to fans or the other team\nAnd so they they they make back some of their money and I don't know who you know who knows what it will be when they get into the you know twenty twenty sharing the stadium with the rams\nBut I just don't buy a lot of this gloom and doom and it's funny I'm sure you saw on everyone saw the story this week another leak meeting all these owners are concerned about the viability you know what they're concerned what they're concerned about the point I just may they don't like the fact that the charges aren't going to have expensive\nOr expensive game tickets and it's all of a sudden there's not going to be as much to share\nWith everybody else that's what some of what that's what a lot of this came from some owners grumbling about that but the chargers feel\nThat we have to be competitive with the rams the rams are gonna have ridiculous P. S. L. prices and and all that and the charges are going to be a lot more affordable and hope to build a fan base their\nTime will tell whether they can do it but I think this whole thing that it might be over there have been there for you know this is the second season so they're certainly not going to give up on it now I think a lot of this stuff is there's a lot of over exaggeration that came out this week\nOn a day or their mind to good football that they're doing their part on the field they're trying to get some people behind the the chargers there in LA ah about the jets this weekend they welcomed the Minnesota Vikings you that guy jets fan should be all over her cousins or this weekend considering he used the jets to maximize the situation in Minnesota\n[noise] boy that's the first time that's ever happened in the NFL is it for them\nTo play or an agent ... ... used another team to get a better deal\nOr somewhere else and actually just ended up not being a better deal but it forced the the Vikings to be more competitive and get closer to what the jets\nWere offering and you know you I'll tell you you wonder what would happen if the Vikings had moved that off or what what if the Vikings hadn't been as interested as they were maybe he'd be\nOr what the jets right now so I I think fans fans are going to be upset 'cause that's the way fans aren't I understand it but you have to just under ... understand that's the way the game is played whether it's leverage whether it's playing one off against another I'm sure every every every fan who would criticize that would\nLove to be in that position whether it's as a player or in a regular job where hey you try to get more out of the job you're at by saying hey I might be looking for something else unless I'm taking care of so that's just the way of the world\nYeah it is the way in the world but uh we have from where they kill a metlife stadium and it's not as different as you actually see this documentary that he put out\nA expressing exactly what's happening all at times it's unclear maybe gray area where he really wanted to go in this case it clearly want nothing to do with the jets\nWell no you know that and and like I said who knows if no one else has been interested he might not have had\nYou know a choice and I'm sure I'm sure that when they did this video and that whole thing I'm not sure that they had look close enough to know that they were going to play the jets during the season and maybe maybe he would have couched it in a little bit different way\nIf he had known that but I Am sure he's not worried about that they've got their job to do and ... when you go on the road anyway ... you're you're gonna you're gonna have fans that are against you so it probably won't be any worse than than than it is normally when you go on the road and misleading bottom line is\nHe's playing awfully well as the Vikings are and but I'm sure the jets from where they are right now they're they're in a good spot with Sam darnel or they got him for a lot less money and then in some ways it makes more sense for the jets\nTo to end it ended up and the and the you know have it ended up happening is this way\nNot no doubt because because they have ... contract had a very reasonable rate for four years and then you get the fifth year option if he plays really well apply renegotiate that before that fifth year kicks in but then the next four years\nYou've got another reasonable rate and so you have money available to do other things and hopefully they'll do that to continue building that team around him and he's been proven\nNow that we see more than a third of the season our duty thinks the best rookie quarterback in this class\n[noise] well I I ... I I still like Baker Mayfield a lot and he's going to have his ups and downs but I think what\nA John ... the the general manager of the brown saw in him was ... exactly what he has shown so far and the intangibles and all those things and just the leadership and all that and that's not the ... yeah I I Would put Darnell close behind him and I think he's still going to be very good in time\nUm but there's there's just that that something about Sam Darnell ... I mean something about her Mayfield and and look look at John ... I don't know that we've ever seen something like this\nIn the history of the NFL whereas general manager is with us a team one year when he was with the chiefs and they trade up\nAnd get Patrick my home and then he leaves the chiefs and goes to the brown and ends up\nEar but uh you know all of them have it only some level of uh of success or will maybe besides just challenge so far but he's banked up by anyway our balls or the other sports exchange represent the time our thanks so much coming on leisure man anytime nice talking with\nHoward and a well a follow up some of his thoughts their jets cousins or you know back and forth and uh you can hear it exactly how cousins phrase things when he was ah in the middle of those negotiations in our panned out I think for the best for\nThe New York jets we can take some calls to eight hundred three two one zero seven ten it's sports don't repeat McCarthy on the voice of New York seven ten wor not or\nR soy down with the McCarthy [noise]\nThe good old ... cousins come into town is Sunday to take on the New York jets and is there a reason to have animosity towards Kirk Cousins\nHe's negotiating a deal is trying to get what's his sympathetic to that with NFL players have a short career get what you can while you can ah\nAnd you're going to use other teams in certain situations and big picture as far as the jets are concerned they are are better off in how this\nAll worked out that occur cousins had become a jets signed a monster contract that would have settled their ability to add a pass Russia to add the other pieces of the team that they need instead as we just talked about with Howard balls are the sports exchange\nSam darn old rookie deal doesn't make a whole lot of money until later on in his career and the jets are going to have a ton of money to go out and spend this off season and this has been\nThe trend of the best teams in the league whether you're looking at the Los Angeles rams the defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles are these teams have done it\nWith young inexpensive quarterbacks and you could build a ton of talent around them and you just don't they developed quickly and they're ready to win as soon as possible patch homes in Kansas City with all the weapons that they have their\nOr even a team like the patriots were Tom Brady one of the things they benefit is they never really paid Brady market rate he's always taking less than they've been able to uh build around him in that way so\nYou know that's a big piece of this and for the Minnesota Vikings\nThey're not as talented if they were last year uh\nExcept for what her cousins gives them a quarterback and\nUh for cousin he's been solid this year but the way that he handled it and now you're going to ... teams against each other sure I get it but the way that he talks about the jets and the fact that he released this in his own documentary\nI think they should have jets fans fired up on Sunday\n[noise] mine just cold and the jets came up to their full Year's Eve freer Neal\nSo now you have\nWhat we want it might he just got to do the same thing when the Vikings 'cause he's got to get them from twenty five to one number is competitive with the jets off [noise]\nBut the fact that we have the jets offers huge because now it gives the other teams or reason to come up\nAs much as the overall dollars are important in a contract I think in my situation structure is as important if not more important we want the money to be guarantee my preference would be to get a fully guaranteed contracts or stick to one your deals [noise]\nLiterally for our limited for hours into it and we got to a number of people said we would never get [noise]\nIt just goes to show the free agency is\nDifferent it's a different deal when you're actually a for us\nNot have happened what you wanted just are not from the team you you'll wanted from initially and then you get a a no interest in\nTaking that contract from the jets it's strictly\nA to build up and a lot of you might think that's what's happening this employer telling you what's happened and then put it out on his own volition there\nAre exactly what the thinking is so I think just friendship I bumped up this upcoming Senate book a gang reinvest me pumped up anyway yeah two straight home games to kind of warm up\nThey've all been wins a each of the lies to steam is three and three are they on a playoff path\nProbably not but they won this Sunday you could start dreaming about it a little bit big game yeah I was disappointed when I was out it meant live a couple of weeks ago with how much orange there was for the Denver Broncos and as a ton of pay manic jerseys I Would not imagine\nThe Minnesota Vikings fans travel as well as the Broncos are that there's a whole lot of Vikings fans in this area but I'd like to see you know that stadium really brought a little bit the sun and I know ... does it get loud like gold giant stadium and like I imagine shade did win the jets were there\nUm it's a different kind of crowd\n... we know a lot of is the PS cells drove a lot of the the diehards away a but it would be nice for that to for them to develop a little bit of a home field advantage and it's something that you know saved Arnold just talked about this week and it's something that you want to have you want to be able to feel and\nUh the jets certainly haven't had that over the years I don't think the giants event much of a home field advantage that stadium either a it just it doesn't get that loud but you'd like to to to build up a little bit you know sometimes you need\nA team to be beaten down for a long period of time like the jets have been and then you start to see that light at the end of the tunnel now you have the franchise quarterback and Sam Donald now you have some pieces to play with to win some games with then you start to see the rise and that gets people going that gets people are pumped up\nTo be out there make some noise makes things happen and you know it's good to have a villain to on the other side and that would be a Kirk Cousins the ah the quarterback for the Minnesota Vikings uh this upcoming week so\nAh what you won't be picking the games that were later on the show the eight o'clock hour will benefit ... usually do it on friday but I Am out tomorrow so\nA producer ray and I'll go head to head tonight\nOr we will of course I'm you know take some of your calls coming up as well eight hundred three two one zero seven ten\nUh and it will go around that I felt a little bit more later but before the AOL cs or starts appears to thoughts on game five Red Sox Astros when we come back sports don't repeat McCarthy on the voice of New York seven ten W. O. R.\nW. are sports\nGame five of the A. L. C. S. tonight as it will be the Astros and the red Sox they're Red Sox trying to close down the series and a three one lead and the Astros significant favorites tonight\nAs you might expect when ah you check out the pitching match of Houston's minus one Ninety five's almost two to one favorite and uh it'll be Justin Vernon liner for used in who has been phenomenal regular season post sees more to pick up after the Astros last year at the\nDeadline for putting a guy in the uh on the on your roster and the post season they got him at the end of August up in the Detroit Tigers and\nA two point five to ... this season which are pretty well earlier in the series and he gets the Boston Red Sox and David Price will start tonight which is interesting because last night when Craig kimbrell came back out for a second inning of work it was David\nPrice warming up in the bullpen and more bang up with intensity he looked\nLike he was warm enough to get into the game not just be ready in case of emergency\nWhich didn't end up coming to fruition but that was interesting last night and now price will start today and while Alex score I had the crack today that this won't be a way mildly situation for Heathrow in one batter being taken out", "year": "2018", "show_name": "WOR Tonight with Joe and Lis", "city": "New York", "day": "18"}
