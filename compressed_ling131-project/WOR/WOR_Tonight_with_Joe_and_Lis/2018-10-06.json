Rutgers football it is Chris Bosh and a coach aspects coming on how are you tonight\nHello hey what's up coaches doing I'm great how about yourself\nYeah everything's good uh last week or you guys take on Indiana a twenty four seven team loss but uh did you see some signs of progress from your team this past weekend\nYeah a a a lot out of it to a football team took a lot out of it\nUm unfortunately we lost in a place that we needed to critical situations but we had a lot of fight a battle at us came back from down twenty four seven have had an opportunity to get the ball back with three minutes to go to see what could happen but the battles fought a just a critical situations\nAre we to play well enough ... and do we just gotta keep getting better those things\nWhen the games aren't close at this often been the case out of there with you guys winning or or more recently losing a how important is it ... to learn about your team in those pressure spots like ended up having this past week\nWell we we we have a pretty good idea where ... where we are have pretty good idea what would you to continue to work on and that's been our focus and uh you know that's been or a a desire to discredit\nKeep getting better and those critical situations especially up or down um but you know there's this team's full sight and the other guy keep working really hard we had a good week or preparation\nOr but we we know where we're at we did what we need to improve on and we just got to go do it\nWhat do you have to improve on from here\nOr we equipment or speed ourselves even Rutgers is beat itself the last few weeks um and that's that's what's hard to swallow for our our football team as they see it they know it but we just got to go get it done\nWhat a really worked for your defense the second half last week keeping Indiana off the board\nYou know just execution you know there weren't any different calls that we made there weren't a lot of adjustments that we made but we just went out and executed we had more focus more discipline and did our job but we did at one play at a time and you know when you do those things all up and do you guys do that together you have a chance for success\nIs is that something that you could build off of a a shutout and the second half like that\nYeah we we just got to do it for four quarters to me we we have a chance to be a good defense\nSo I Know it doesn't look like that right now but we're not far off we have about five or six plays a game that are exposed to places that we give up and you just can't do this play winning football and that that's an area that we've got to get fixed and that just usually it's one break down by one individual and it's a different individual from a different ... you don't want a different situation and that we just got to get that taking care of\nAnd we're talking again with Chris ... the head coach of Rutgers football and I'm sure ah the losses pile up or a bad here but ah what do you think about the way that your team has handled it and and maintaining the fight as they did last week against\nIndiana\nWell I'll just start to buy the first comment about Los ... ... that's part of the process of building a program or we knew that when we got here uh you know we've had some injuries we've had so much worse off the field you know issue it took some players all feel mhm\nAnd then we're going to battle and that's where ... where we're at right now today is not we're going to be with a lot of young players are good at playing time right now this play this this team has very tight it's that great chemistry\nOh they work extremely hard they want to be good they want to get better as well as we keep doing that process will work out in the will stay true to who we

so he can be proud of all the gray hair [laughter] I'll I'll stick\nTo my a color right now but we had to start play a lot better the grey hairs and show up [laughter]\nCertainly uh what now what what are some of the focus is a bet you're telling your team about this week against Illinois\nWell again the focus is on us and uh you know it's like I mentioned before but we have to stop beating
