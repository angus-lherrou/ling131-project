think inspiring to the fan base here a while Mel then he's perfectly qualified to be a general manager he wasn't going to excite anybody Melvin was the more the same kind of approach doesn't mean you can't have success\nBut it doesn't inspire you that you're going to do something\nCutting edge that gives you a chance to be the last teams standing at a thirty teams and playing it safe\nOften doesn't work in professional sports do you want to be the team that is eighty two wins hanging around five hundred every year or do you want to be the team that takes chances and\nSometimes you're the worst team in the lake and sometimes you the best team the league I think you want to be the last team stabbing that's ultimately\nWhat we judge everything on and in order to be the last team standing of thirty you're going to make some pretty brave decisions you have to be a head of the crowd on some things in the metric given themselves an opportunity to do just that uh with the way that this is developing so uh this is\nVery interesting to me and we'll have Anthony the komodo or who covers the Mets four MLD dot com on a with us it's seven oh five to give us\nA his take on what is happening here and how this process has developed a also we'll hear from Adam Fisher Avastin why former Mets front office member who is plugged in to the analytics and I could give us some more information on hind bloom and how he might fit and now\nThey're all that being said I was very disappointed not to be able to hear from blue and I understand he's still working for the Tampa Bay rays\nIt's uncomfortable to field a bunch of questions about a team that you might not end up working for and sharing your philosophies of the game publicly but I thought it was important for balloon to win over\nSome of the people that just year analytics and tune Tony out well you're a nerd your door you don't know what you're doing and I don't want that around my baseball I Want the the baseball man who have been around that played the game\nI get I Want any here Blum if he could explain his philosophy is in a way that Mets fans will be able to sit back and say that makes sense\nI like that that's a that seems like a winning philosophy or way to go about the game if he could convince them or maybe he wanted to come across\nLike the ivy league educated egg head and ah I I Can't stand this guy I think Mickey Callaway a had a hard time winning over\nThe lunch pail crowd\nOr with the way that that he goes about his business he's not outwardly passionate\nAll the time I he is measured\nIn in what he says and\nHe's not going to criticize guys are public you know really get that in the sport now anyway but I I think that to some degree tolerate a hard time winning people over when there wasn't\nThe a ruptured when the Mets lost seven games enroll at one point and had that disastrous June I'm curious about bloom how he would\nBe able to kind of maneuver some of that today I was disappointed it was blooms decision and you get where he is caught between a couple of different places here a bandwagon and the agent the same thing but either way the Mets go here\nIt's going to get really interesting right or\nThe Mets big criticized for having only three full time people in their analytic staff well now they could build that up and if you take that doesn't matter uh there was the lowest in the national league according to a survey put together by the athletic\nAnd the teams that are at the top or teams like the red Sox the Dodgers teams that you see having success and the gay uh so\nIt is these is a way to find advantages and it's not just when you Bonter don't bunt in situations and this is injury data that you can do some things with this is a actual\nPhysical things that you all over the years scouts obscene but now rather than trusting a inexperienced\nPerson's eyes you can actually measure what he is attempting to measure with his eyes and you get it to the exact\nNumber for instance or the spin on a curve ball that that might have been marked down in the past have got great spin\nOn now you could say the rpm are acts versus somebody else who's our parents might be a little bit lower and there might not be much of a difference to the eyeball test however\nYou get a measurement now to\nUm you know see exactly what that is and and now you got to figure out how meaningful that extra little bit is and and this is where there is experimentation all this might not everything that analytics expel ths actually does work on the field and I'd certainly\nAh tell you that much so uh yeah it's it's very interesting how this is developing I think most match bands belt or they're going to go with the safe choice is going to be more of the same it's gonna be mailed in and you're going to have more of this in between\nUm area gonna see them regress possibly as an organization the teams that have\nGone to old school quote unquote in recent years they haven't done it for a long because they haven't had a whole lot of success so I'm\nHoping the Mets here I think that you're going to get at the very least and inspired choice at the end of the day and I don't know if it's going to round up all the fans\nAre but I think it'll it's going to rally up quite a few that's what I see on social media and I'll be curious are you upset in Melbourne isn't involved anymore do you have a favorite between Brody bandwagon and hind blown\nEight hundred three two one zero seven and the number that I have an idea of what a home boom run franchise might look like\nI have no idea what a Brody bandwagon franchise might look like because it's been an agent and that's a big jump to make it is one that has been made successfully in other sports\nIt has been made in baseball um but we don't really know how he would go about team building but he he certainly have quite a bit of information on some of the players the Mets have to make decisions on in the near term as Jacob ... know cinder guard\nHis clients just to name a couple as there's a lot there are a lot happening with the match or again we'll have Adam fish are coming up at six thirty five and ... the coma covers ... dot com at seven oh five ... and try to sort out the different directions that this has taken a ...\nArgue open to utilizing data to make a logical decision and let's see if we can argue\nAbout whether or not the decisions that are entertaining because I hate watching forty pitching changes the game it slows the whole thing down a million commercial breaks I don't like it but I won't\nArgue that it's effective because it is shifting is effective it may have had\nChanges in the game were guys now are trying to launch home runs more often 'cause aren't as many hits to be had and we could discuss whether or not that makes the game of less entertaining than it was in say the eighties\nBut it is effective shifting statistically works and you've seen as much as we talked about well it's so easy to beat by going in left field where is that guy is like a handful of them and\nThere hasn't been that rash of slap hitter is coming up from the minor leagues in having a four hundred batting averages here right you don't see a lot of Tony wins in the game right now or even with that ship so you know there are some things that it that do work and you you see it in games\nAnd then you like your team to be a head of the curve\nAnd the Mets it would seem they're not going to bully teams around financially these days as they're not up with the Yankees the red Sox and the Dodgers in terms of payroll but\nUh you'd better be as smart as those teams if you're not going to have the resources of those teams so that you can compete and you can try to make your way back to the playoffs and back to a World Series\nI suspect some calls on you know when you think about this plot twist as it might be eight hundred three two one zero seven tend the number go to Robin Hoboken to start things off tonight what's up Rob\nThanks for taking the call and thanks for making my works quite delightful I'm just in terms of the ... general manager search while I'm a big advocate of looming I'd really like to see him take the helm of the organization I really think the Mets are going to do with why\nAre due to the fact that I think the key is is the will ponds a desire to keep that three headed monster but now I uh red co editor of cardio tax and I think what would they do is they had bandwagon and really handled much more of the business side in the negotiations are due to his\nHistory as aging and they have more the player personnel decisions which we know that will love me analysis maniacal Ashley scouting\nAnd they'll sort of the more the whole operation player selection process which I don't think is\nThat if you have special less than a group that can discuss it hopefully there'll be willing to change\nYeah I was you know I I like the power structure\nAnd what you said makes sense to have a team but it's like the cubs with the college coaches way back when I got the end of the day you need the one decision maker and I want to make sure that the decision maker\nIs a a baseball\nGuy right and it's not necessarily ownership or Jeff willpower and I think it has to be whoever you hire to be the GM that's great if you can utilize over ... rich already and John Rico and various different boroughs but I Want that guy to be at the top of the pyramid making the final decision\nThat say oh it's a valid point\nUm but yeah ... ... you know and you do you do spell out ... and thanks for the call Rob or how the the front office could end up looking with Brody now you know Brody bandwagon and I I don't\nKnow what his relationship is with with those guys are he has negotiated quite a bit with the Mets over the years and certainly Sandy ... on a variety of players the Mets are bad they sign you on assessment as Tim T. Bo\nUh over the years and they have Jacob the ground no sinner guarded and many others that are see a clients and Brody bandwagon inclines but that's one way it would work whereas with hind bloom\nYes if I was a member of the ... front office right now I'd probably be a little bit more nervous about him coming in because he might have very different ideas about the game then some\nAre that are currently in that run up and so uh yeah uh\nI Would think though that this is a good day for ... the way I think that he would fit under either of these two general manager candidates and we can get it to some of that a little bit more ... the ... been reporting on this Bram ... dot com love him at seven oh five and when we come back\nA we'll have Adam Fisher who has worked in the Mets front office he is plugged in to analytics exactly what they are and we get into that a touch but also you know what a hind bloom run franchise might look like so uh we'll look forward to talking to Adam when we come back sports on with the McCarthy other voice to New York ... W a war on zero\nW O R sports though with a guy on seven ten W O R [noise]\nShips potentially and the Mets general manager on if we're down to two and the way\nI Will have a ... of S. N. Y. with us in just a few moments and reconnect with him on on the phone or but yes that John ... sports are reporting tonight that Doug Melvin is out as a potential general manager for the New York Mets and it will be between\nHaim balloon the assisted GM with the Tampa Bay rays and Adrian Brodie bandwagon in and joining us right now at a fish or you can see 'em on MSN why formerly of the Mets front office knows plenty about these maneuverings and Adam uh it's great to have your board again how are you\nI'm good thank you thank you for having me on it it's a you know it it is your state evening with this news\nYou Twitter surprised why is that\nI you know I just ah I think I was I was going along with the industry speculation uh that that no that was likely to get the job a steak or from my standpoint I always did feel that this was a job for someone who had general manager experience\nYou know and I'm not necessarily that I favor\nAlvin but for that very reason I I kinda figured he would at the very least be among the the two finalists or so this is sort of a wild card for me you know you have a\nTwo guys who I Know and I think are really smart guys I'm but one guy you know it was coming out of Tampa which is you know may as well be Mars compared to New York\nUm you know and another guy who was who was an aged I'm so it's really interesting and ah and outside the box and the Mets have a a have a decision on their hands so which are these two guys are going to choose\nAnd will break down bloom and bandwagon and a little bit more with the uh in a band or but as far as\nThe Mets decision today to knock off as you said the experienced candidate when you're out in the past ah there was a report that Fred ... said he thought the Mets were to analytic over the last few years well both of these guys we would think would be more analytic then\nOr the administration prior we certainly know hind bloom would be it does this to you as someone who's been in the organization has an idea how ownership things does this represent\nA change in how they view the game [noise]\n[noise] well you know I think um\nIt's sort of declare I think to clarify an MP you and I talked about this the last uh last time I was on I think the\nMets have been not necessarily at the forefront but\nIt must have a good analytics department it just happens to be small\nAnd you know a particularly Jeff wells on has always been been willing or to explore analytics or I think\nSort of had an inflection point right now where they are falling behind the Astros and the Dodgers and some of these other heavy hitting teams the raise among them\nUm and you know if they don't beef it up now they definitely will fall behind I think what I Would take from this is\nThese guys got in the room and you know if that stuff is true\nI mean look I I've been in meetings with Fred will upon where he's been very open to explore analytics um but you know as the reports are that he sourdough on it over over the past year um but what I Would take away from all of this is when I Am and Brody got in the room\nParticularly with high I'm coming from the race it gave them a vision and he showed them or what analytics have done for the race and how they use it and how they operate with the race and uh you know the that that thinking may have all the little bit so I guess the answer to I said in a roundabout way a very possibly could be yes\nNow we're talking again with Adam ... formerly of the Mets a front office and various brown offices around major league\nBaseball is behind bloom is to become the guy what might that look like\n[noise] well I I think ah certainly you're you know you're talking about beefing up uh beefing\nUp the analytics department are doing or perhaps some more uh somewhere outside the box things than ah\nThan had been done in the past with the Mets are you know maybe being a little bit more aggressive on the waiver wire or being more creative with a with a smaller level signings I mean that's what they've done with the race I think the thing is you don't know what someone's going to do when they get in the chair I mean\nNew York is a is a totally different conversation so you know I'm I think when Theo Epstein ah got the job with the red Sox it was like\nKnow a sort of she said you want to become a flare development machine and it's like money ball with money\nPut him in the category of I Would just think of think of him as an exact a smart baseball executive not I think it's going to be challenging for anyone to make a jump from agent to GM but in my my experience any agent can do it\nIs Brody she knows the game is personable he has a really good presidents he's comfortable in this market this is where he's based out of the the it was the AA\nAnd he's got a large organization and these agencies are our shoes these days so he's managing a lot of people is managing players or she's he's managing just in general a lot of high level people so I think she can handle that uh and you know is ... she's one of my I don't\nHave any dealt with a lot of Asian they're not and that's what we have sometimes I have an adversarial relationship Brody is ... ... it's not my favorite among my favorite age it's just an upfront guy a and a and intelligent and personable and I\nI think he I think he can do the job I have some questions but but uh but he certainly has the intelligence and presents to get it done\nMotor some questions you would have\nJust stinks you know look yes like I said he's running a\nLarge organization but at the same time he's never been on this side of it and there's so many little things that that he's not going to be familiar with perhaps he could play catch up but you know particularly in this market at the steep learning curve to deal with when you're dealing with all these other things\nWe get a caller mentioned that maybe bandwagon it could make good use of the pieces are already in that front office like a ... a J. P. rich already a John break go could could you see him being the choice that\nMaybe he's the one who makes the final decision or is that the top of the food chain but it is able to utilize other pieces and and he's probably going to need some help if uh you know since he has been on the side of things before\nI think that makes a lot of sense you know is is they feel like they like rodeo the leader in a leader for the organization he certainly has a lot of people who can help him\nSort of a sort of take care of some of the question but I just mentioned a lot of experience many many years of experience there and people who can help guide him\nOr through that transition so I Do think from that standpoint he's got a good staff of people who can help them and I'm sure you know there are people that he's dealt with over the years with other clubs that's another thing that's very interesting when you know when you're an Asian\nUm you deal with so many different people and so many so many executives with other teams so he probably has a really good idea of who he likes from other teams and who could help him in addition to the people who are already there at the met\nLots of trades and you gotta think depending on who your clients are you have some insight dope of what's happening not just with his clients with the Mets but a potentially around the game as well so yeah I I think either way now or it's going to be an inspiring choice for many ... fans between either ... bandwagon and\nWe'll see what direction the Mets decided to go but Adam Fisher a always great stop at him and we appreciate coming on again\nThank you know it's it's always fun talking to you and uh that should be a\nIt should be an interesting a couple of days when we see they choose\nNo doubt at best you're S. N. Y. or formerly of the Mets brown office in a couple of other frogs is round major league baseball so you get you know the inside perspective on a couple of things there and we'll discuss when we come back we can take some calls as well eight hundred three two one zero seven ten\nAnd we'll have more coverage coming up Anthony ... covers the mad scramble the dot com or will give us a the reporting angle on all of this and you know what is maneuvering on what the miners are there at city field today it's the sports down with the McCarthy Honda voice in New York ... W O R whoa\nThe W O R sport with luck Ari [noise]\nAlways interesting talking with Adam ... and why and I thought you know where analytics to speak on this loaded word a in baseball it just makes people cringe\nOr does he broke it down in a way when you can understand and it's about taking advantage of all of this information that is out there and how\nDo you find useful parts of it and it's going to be experimentation they're going to be aspects of it that don't work but\nUh that don't fit the human factor or or the emotions that are involved in a game or or just simply work better on paper than they do in practice as we've seen with\nYou know the idea of ah you're closer by committee as one that you know what there is something mental being there in the ninth inning being met last guy and handling that role um so\nYeah you do\nHave to take that into account sometimes ... works on paper won't necessarily work in a game but it it's worthwhile through some trial and error to try to find out where you could find that advantage and again you know it's no surprise the teams that have embraced the so the teams that\nAre are ahead of the curves for the Mets\nAre they will have somebody that's going to have a different point of view than what they have had most recently or in their hind bloom or Brody bandwagon as their next general manager and I'll give you an example\nOf something that might not sound like analytics is not the way that you see it when you're watching a game but maybe as a factor or the Mets today\nAnnounced that Franklin ... he's the young pitcher they got in the Philadelphia Phillies in the ... deal\nHe underwent Tommy John surgery or today at the hospital for special surgery or so you can expect kill them I Will miss the entirety of this upcoming season\nAnd what I Would ask is is that bad luck or is that bad information\nAnd and that's where all of this could come into play and and as you know Adam himself talked about it could be health that is the next wave that analytics is able to find some improvement and think about of all the problems and that's a bad over the years a number one might be the injury prevention for this team they finally\nStarted her things in the right direction the second half last year they played much better\nBut injuries been a huge problem how to manage them and and these are the kinds of things that you can work on Anthony Tacoma covers the match for an lp dot com will share his thoughts on these finalists for the Mets general manager position coming up right now and is up to\nFor him to leave but\nYou also have to understand he's done this for a while he's forty four this has been his entire professional career as being an agent and people like eight to attack different things with active for jobs and the people like the idea of winning of building something from the\nGround up and uh you know I think anyone who has made the leap and baseball or another sport than there are a few would say that they wanted to go out and and they wanted to kind of be a part of something instead of\nSelling something you know what I mean they want to go out and and build a winning baseball even go to the world series and be able to experience that sort of thing it's a totally different job in a totally different lifestyle so\nI'm sure that's what's driving grows his own wagon and a little bit I think this might have been gone for him kind of as a curiosity like hey they reached out to me let's talk\nAnd now it's becoming like well what would it what would it be if I was just about\n... you know as an agent you drink champagne and the front office member may get a port on yet yeah that's right\nBut you're not in the club and that's a different do you help make it happen but you're not in the club\nOr attack again that he'd become a ... dot com\nNow are the hope was at least for me I really wanted to hear from hind bloom as part of the one of the key questions for him would be well you go from relative obscurity with the Tampa Bay rays the assisted GM to all of a sudden being the front man of the New York Mets how would you handle that\nMaliki for us he did spend some time today and he put out a statement saying we had a productive meeting yesterday there was a lot of baseball a conversation and I enjoyed the time we spent together endive statement\nTo know that they didn't tell you everything all your questions [laughter]\nWell you know brought the bandwagon and had some more pros and has we basically said as much when he had to stay but it was built in that I ended up are actually talking to us guys but the understanding what it is to be the general manager\nOf the New York bats and how you do have to put out some fires publicly uh do you consider that a a real key part of being in this kind of roll\nYeah I think it's it's definitely important I I don't think it's as important as it is for the manager even on the managers lower ranking the mantra does that every single day\nBut when push comes to shove you had the gym is a very public face of the organization you have to have someone who can speak publicly speak well publicly um who can do all those sorts of things now obviously high bloom has experience doing that it's not as if you're coming from some minor job he's one of the two top guys\nYou have to say and he has to be publicly as far as that I've heard him speak publicly in the past you know it seems totally normal and totally five now will work in New York\nWill know if you get tired and has to do the job I'm not sure as much as I also as a member of the media would have made my job easier to get to talk to him on a conference call I'm not sure we would have been able to answer that question from I've lived is standing there and and talking for twenty minutes and really to be honest\nNot answering all that much I understand why he didn't want to do it yeah um but I say you don't get this far in the process if you don't always have the ability to speak publicly\nYou get a feel you know if you're going to resonate or not for instance you know Mickey cow and that initial press conference I think did turn off some fans ways talking about loving the players and and things like that\nSure absolutely I you know I don't think Doug Melvin does himself any favors I don't think he you know torpedoes his chances to be GM or when he went on a cup of coffee I thought he handled himself fine\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] I I Would think that would yeah no that would make the job more attractive than otherwise but I got to think that part of the motivation of if not a lot of it is just a desire to be involved with the team to be a general manager and I'm not\nIt's so interesting to make a jump for being an agent to a front office person I don't necessarily know that it has to be the perfect situation because\nReally interesting do you do you really are a box but I like it yeah and and it it is out of the box\nAnd thanks for the call re a\nBut it has worked at some other situations or the Golden State warriors their general manager is a former player agent\nAnd you know that's a a decision that\nHas certainly paid off is Bob Myers is that a tremendous job now I Believe if I had the timeline correct he inherited Steph Curry but so much of the rest of that team was built a by Myers into a\n... a dynamo all of a a dynasty and\nOne of the things that are the warriors have been very adept at is amusing a added information they have they had the whole floor charted is even a good word but mapped out and sensors that you know we're all the players are going where they've traveled and then\nFind a way to take all of that information may make sense of it in a way that\nAh can help the team and and the easiest way to explain away the warriors and why they've had so much success is they're going to run you up and down the floor maximize their possessions and issued a ton of threes and they're going to start shooting threes in transition that kind of started that trend a few years back I remember watching them before they won\nA title and they were thrilling to watch it'd be playing like the blazers at ten o'clock in\nThe war is a slightly above five hundred and and they were an up and coming team you could see that when they were fun to watch I think they still are even if you don't like Kevin Durant and the way that he joined the team and that seemed to be the he'll turn in the whole thing or maybe dream on grand robes you the wrong way with\nA semi incidents that he has had\nBut the brand of basketball is exciting\nAnd it is\nInteresting is that is a key difference between these two sports at the moment where\nAlex or play everywhere right we just went through it with a to point conversion decision by ... and and the giants the other day but I haven't seen it really impact the enjoyment level\nOf football in basketball it's made it more exciting the basic\nAnalytical strategy in basketball is shoot a lotta threes and dumped ... does your two highest percentage highest efficiency a shots in the game\nThat sounds great as a fan you watch curry last night that the one points he's launching it from like forty peta ... feet out he's at the coaches line or want you to three pointers and you know coming down the court in transition and and send it up off balance a mere almost near Centre Court and these flushing these things in it it's unbelievable\nAnd the dunks obviously that's always going to get everybody up marijuana in baseball the analytics slow the game down more pitching changes longer games uh [noise]\nAnd the shift is not necessarily pleasant on the eye and fun to watch it results in\nA lot more strike out is everybody's trying to hit home runs a\nA N ... it has made the game itself less enjoyable but you can't deny if you're trying to win\nA lot not all but a lot of these strategies have paid off or go to Lou in massive ... do you want to Melbourne\n... yeah I I I wanted to do well there because look at look at the rose now it really is is that mhm they got a great\nFarm system they get a team or on the field right now and what I wanted them to do is I Am old enough to you know this should go against their will or spending policies but I Want to the uh the guy from camp but at of their lives on\nA chip you bold well I I think the problem you run into is is high bloom is not going to leave his position in Tampa to take the same position with the ... if he's going to leave he needs to be the general manager\nOr a you know with the analytic say you just a little bit of that I'm looking you know people are going away from starting pitching and building up a little ... and it's a class is Evelyn Milwaukee's got to say well I think we're looking to it was better than the ...\nAnd um but look at the reason why the Yankees lost is it's not only reliance on the whole run but um\nTheir starting pitching wasn't great and it still it wasn't even an adequate so the red Sox had much better starting pitching and although the Bolton\nWas a great it was adequate and they filled into the uh the books in which started\nHere with starters yeah and and that's that was really to keep the red Sox and but for the call Lou and it's why I picked against the red Sox every round uh because I I look at the ... you have to be able to\nGet out late in games and\nThat the red Sox did really they they defeated two ways one they move those starters to the bullpen they're aggressive with these guys even last night they bring in their\nGame three starter to shut down the eighth inning is that they don't trust those guys in the middle of the ... done a tremendous job in a Barnes is ...\nNow it's about stuff that happens here or there but for the most part they've been under the radar so far and part of that as they are losing record but compared to the giants the you know the jets they're no longer the dysfunctional organization they have clean things up to a point where\nThere are no distractions and it's just a matter of being healthy and up and down", "year": "2018", "show_name": "WOR Tonight
