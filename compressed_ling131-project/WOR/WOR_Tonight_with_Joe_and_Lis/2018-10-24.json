{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "Veteran leader he's been around for a long time and how it really gotten his moment in a sense you know he isn't really accepted by the emu he is a NATO member but he is not always really got to see that the table a\nAnd M. B. S. cannot have this new hot reformer thirty\nThree year old kind of flashing signs\nEveryone was so excited and then everyone never really warm to him and what was interesting about the speech today is that every one of elite his deference to his father king stomach because king is still the custodian of the holy month it still where ... is it is still wear Islamic heart of the region is and I think uh\nFor airline that still important um and so that makes the dynamics complicated I think politically speaking\nWhat we don't know geysers they're negotiating over right now there's a reason that air to one didn't come out with the tapes and the audio and and all the good today because he still wants something on his daddy I'm Still behind closed doors right now the U.S is that he's the Turks are negotiating but over what we don't know but it's quite clear that this is much bigger than the tragic\nLoss of life it's bigger than finding the truth I think it's bigger than finding justice 'em and turkey certainly hoping that they come out on top\nAnd all we have about thirty seconds left with Molly hunter ABC News and its doubles oh what's next for the world media that has descended on this ... is the story kind of over an hour or are you waiting for the body to turn up what's the next a shoe you're waiting for ... for the drops\nI mean what this Saturday is ... yeah it's interesting I mean I it is it crazy out here I'm outside the conflict um edited not I mean everyone in there you know every outlet from everywhere in the world is out here or within and credits morning where air to one actually so\nI don't think that she was going to drop anytime soon I think the Saudis have you know the Saudis Saudi play but for years has been silenced they don't respond or they just get away with things mostly because the U.S allows introduced that whether it of course as we mentioned the jailing of activists rounding up the business than\nUh the kidnapping is Lebanese prime minister at they have been able to act\nWhich sending unity and\nThey've been getting away with it by not saying much they really don't say much and we saw that in the last three weeks\nSo I don't expect us to hear anything out of his daddy's necessarily in the next twenty four forty eight hours I think the Turks have said at least but they're going to say right now until they get what they want\nSo guys I think we're heading home\nAll right thanks Molly Molly yeah thanks a lot Molly hunter in Istanbul All right when we come back to the city has finally cracking down and homeless

the transit authority Andy ... he's really knew what the job and he's speaking up on the issue and he says well it's not\nReally well you listen to what he says\nBooming up has one thing but uh being offensive of no system and onto socialist another ... when he proposed to tolerate\nSo he doesn't like the are the ones who pick up ... seats in their obnoxious and that guy so I think if you're just quietly staying warm if you're homeless you're okay what if you smell well that's a problem too\nI think it's a fundamental difference between someone coming in to keep will get it on sitting on a seat or maybe ... do you have a problem with that but lying across the seat or a baby and then on social mine are all making a mess is not acceptable\nWhat to do about it we all know yes and where

to a homeless people about how many services that get offered\nCuomo gets thrown in ... that that was your line that was it as long as I could live hum\nAnd by the way the mega tonight\nOne point six

is the mega millions director he was on the today show\nKind the ticket okay fine\nEtiquette fans keep in mind that little slip of paper is the dollar bill imagine\nThat [noise] yeah so you want to secure it and also become don't go tell it on the today show them that\nThose are the only that's not true and there's better advice but there's better advice you form um either an L. L. C. or a foundation and that way a nagging objected to all of the taxes yes\nYou called the Trump family lawyer yeah and you had them set up the tax structure that we said I Want someone who you wouldn't you wouldn't sign the ticket as an individual event I'm so that you to all the taxes run away with a good point Bartlett good point I thought this out 'cause we're gonna win yeah All right I'm In I'm In\nI'm In the five bucks All right let's do something about something really important we have the caravan we have ... Gutman\nABC News he's the chief national correspondent the president's challenge you to take your camera Matt and go find those eastern Europeans and MS Thirteen how'd you do\nI didn't find any eastern Europeans or middle Easterners or which I think is what he was in this day um defined a lot of misery I'm listening there might be as Thirteen I I Would be shocked if there weren't in in a group of seven thousand people were gang members and criminals um\nBut by and large we see a lot of families or at least two thousand women and children here\nUm people are going through some pretty difficult times here I mean there's no sanitation we've just heard from local officials in this town of weeks ago where we are that I'm twenty people were transported to the hospital um yesterday evening or waiting for word about an additional who've taken ill\nOr we saw one guy who sell off of a truck he was hitching a ride on and was crushed to death was heard that a small child was died from um heat exhaustion or heat stroke\nThe way just before reaching this town so it's getting pretty dire for these folks um mostly what we see is is misery here it's pretty shocking that they're going to keep going\nHey man what does Mexico decided to do just to let them march on through\nOver a long time Mexico did decide to do anything they they were sitting on it because they didn't want to clash with these migrants are there are so many women and children are so many families at the last thing they wanted the optics of having to fight off or corral and detained all of these people bought up overnight they drew a line in the sand the interior ministry here say\nIf these people don't register properly for asylum and seek these applications go through the proper channels they're going to be getting round them up they will allow them out of the state of Chiapas which we're in right now but that gives them grace period of at least a couple of days so I I don't think that they know exactly how they're going to deal with this because just imagine\nThe physics of rounding up uh seven thousand people how many the logistics of it how many buses you might eat how many police officers you might eat people are going to be scattering into the Bush everywhere or it's going to be a mess so I think they're trying to figure out\nWhat the proper way of doing this and there is no precedent because there was never been a migraine caravan of this scale or size before\nI was talking about a caravan room with ... ... ABC News chief national correspondent we've got callers we had one this morning and said well this is all organized by on doors and the Democrats and they're paying\nFor this this is not some kind of spontaneous caravan or what have you been able to suss out about that [noise]\nIt's kind of the loosely organized by I Would say council of activists but nobody there is a you know we've been with him for days now we we don't really see people giving them orders on on any regular basis people just\nWake up they clean up their little areas that they've slept in they act that ... ... they have they take some food I'm watching\nA locals from charitable charitable groups are heading out Somalis 'em and they set out for the day so it doesn't seem like there's really a central organization here maybe it started centrally organized in Honduras at this point it is not that\nAnd it has grown from three thousand people were two thousand people uh in Guatemala to seven Seventy two hundred now according to the un so people keep joining in clearly there is no such organization and that\nUm so you know it's\nIt's very difficult to say who's running the show I Would say that nobody at this point\nBut when you said it was a loosely organized by activists one of these activists want what's their political agenda\n[noise] they don't say their political agenda is to get people out of a\nMurder as countries like Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador places with the highest per capita murder rate in the world I'm outside of places like Syria war zones I'm that's what they say they want to get them out of poverty in and try to help them to get to their destination which they say is the United states\nEssentially they're just trying to help and they say to get a better life I don't think that in the cycle of corruption and violence and poverty in Central America that the um mid term elections the United states is something that register they'll look anybody here they're clearly not thinking about that they are aware however\nOf the things that President Trump has been saying about them about the caravan about Central America and it scares that uh they are frightened about what kind of reception they'll receive once they tried to cross the border into the United states\nThey're not going to get in don't they know that\nA lot of them are going to get in and people have been getting in for many many years the border is porous and some of them will definitely get it as just that's how it happens it's impossible to enforce the border\nThat long um and then in spaces that are this open it for a long period of time and if there are thousands to head to the border I Am sure that I'm not all of them but some of them will definitely get through\nAll right thanks Mad Max ... maybe see news and I'm sure we'll be checking my morals I appreciate I ... well I'm sure we can prize the proper papers but here's the he he referenced the president's so he's president last night in Houston speaking on the issue we want\nPeople to come into our country we have a three point seven percent unemployment is the lowest it's been more than fifty years but\nCaravan and he's blaming Democrats\nI think the Democrats have something to do with it and now they're saying I think we made a big mistake because people are seeing how bad how pathetic it is how bad our laws are they made a big risk sex\nAs the president last night in Texas you know when we get back move over judge Judy and judge jury is coming as in Jerry Springer\n[noise] this is a really wanting to today's Len Burman and Michael we'd all in the morning and get them live tomorrow from ... on seven ten wor\nFan and very good Tuesday Morning everybody in a big thank you to our friends at Dunkin' Donuts for\nBringing us in some of the scariest and sweetest donuts this season Halloween is right around the corner and Duncan has all the spooky treats you crave lend just had one that was a doughnut with a a\nA minor in the middle yeah I had to be at a mosque and plug it in a whole new spider webs on me as being an army and it was orange why don't you eat it 'cause I remember that who full from your key she had for dinner last night he builds you up there was no room for a donor\nWell I'm not a big donut either because you know maybe you eat a lot of donors you're going to donate around your tell me\nAbout you know I like donuts but there are there to addictive for me\nWell I if I had one I have three and that's going to be ... okay you had that made you have I just tasted one ... well they melt delicious they were writing I beg your Duncan I very much oh I forgot it's no longer Dunkin' Donuts is just dumped in the Congo name you betcha thank you dunk and speaking of Duncan you know it's been Duncan for two thousand four hundred years\nAn ...

O. R. voice of New York and I hard\nBut look you've got to look at the history here has a New England patriots underbelly chick ever gotten better with another team after ballot jak lets them go no the answer is no\nI feel like if you are like first of all you may have the peak of mount whoever it is named named the player in this case where we are talking about a a guy on the on the line is supposed to be tech protecting Brady the way of protecting you either way he was protecting Brady you might see the top of that mountain under\nBill ballot check you might get to see just the last year or so but the minute you walk away and walk out of that patriots uniform\nIt kinda feels to me like it's the same situation where a player is is demanding a trade in the case of Arizona where you got the Peterson is going I demand to be traded here at the trade deadline I Need to go someplace else I kinda feel like maybe you've peaked we seen the top of the mountain already and it's the downhill portion here\nWarner and also of course I'm sure it was easier to play with the Brady as a quarterback rather than Eli but that's the point I think it was you know you can point out\nA ... a okay he's still kicking but you know the patriots than put themselves on the whole with the ... so I think that's the point there and oh there's one other thing my I thought uh what about the play calling and the time management with Schumer\nA in that last drive\nThe giants drove to the one yard line drilling a by what was it a twenty three the twelve\nOkay first down at the first and gold at the one don't you have to spike the ball and throw three times in the end zone because the whole point is to get the ... score to point conversion and get the ball back foreign on science kick you can't do that and believe in yourself five seconds\nThat seems like an ... you don't think about it and when you just think about five second time frame like a I it it seems very quick like if I just think about five seconds here of solid dead air we would be shocked we would be stunned that would that sounds like but you're right that's way too much time I guess and the question here that I have is is that\nSort of the balls you played that we want to get from my head coaches that above the level of what you want to see we also saw something similar Tennessee right in the game in London you saw kind of that that last ditch effort to get the two point conversion there isn't do we want that as as an NFL fan is somebody who watches the game to okay\nThe team's doing what they can go for the win but then you don't leave the five seconds they're after\nA while but the tight I I thought that was great that he went for the to heck with the ... you know you overtime game look at the titans I mean I thought that was exciting that that you know the coach hey good we're going to win and we're not going for the overtime\nBut you can have he lie on two quarterbacks snakes and take up all the time and ...\nAnd five seconds left no God\nAnd and so the question here 'cause I feel like what we saw from Sharm or after the game a very defensive about his play calling very defensive about about being aggressive if you will but but I think that aggression and I'm all for that I liked that portion of it 'cause you know what's the opposite of that what's the alternative that we have somebody go\nLie could why they're going for three point say why are they doing why why are they just going for a field goal none of that works in this day and age and football we want to see somebody we always complain the fans we always complain that somebody's not aggressive enough so we're seeing that but is it ... idea of aggression\nGiving way to good clock management is that the issue no\nThat wasn't good that that was a regression he lie on two quarterbacks that come on throwing the end zone incomplete stops the clock a thought that was poor\nAnd so with that do you think and this is the the or perhaps even a bigger question or going into this or\nIs this do have we been watching and we certainly have for a period of time or the sort of the wrapping up if you will age wise for Eli Manning but are we is this we've seen the top of mount ... is this going to be from do you think there's a place for ... in the NFL do you think there's another year or two\nThat you can do anything worthwhile 'cause I'll tell you what there are other quarterbacks out there that aren't working right now that might be having as much success is Eli Manning is right now\nNo if if something happened to Tom Brady\nAnd the patriots offered the world to the giants on the line would be great with the patriots he'd say oh man look at is no I think you could play two more years but not what this team won six one six the last two years and you're you're going to be thirty eight years old and January ... get out [noise]\nWarner what is it ... if if you what would be the one move right now that you would make again not being able to go back and pick a quarterback in the draft this past season but what would be the one move now that you would make to try to try to make things better going in the season that is in essence of wash\nIs too late to what to do it one move is not going to help 'em they missed the boat didn't think that the future at all and the ship has passed\nAnd is that on the shoulders of the GM\nNo it's on the shoulders of the owner\nYou know what he can he can nullify anything when he started Gina ... Smith was the point of that you know let that Guy Davis whip play if he's bad he spent but at least let them play that was the dumbest thing I've ever as\nWe knew with Gina ... Smith was that was ... years the owner you you got to step in and you think Wellington merit what does that you know oh yeah sure Gina Smith or\nHey we need a quarterback you've got to have another one that's all there is Stuart you've got to have a guy to step in the giants don't haven't for years\nNow and it seems as though the rest of their laurels so much on Eli Manning and the you know ... whether you take away you look at the the rings you okay well listen he's always been able to find a way to make it work he's he's somebody that no matter the situation no matter how tough it is our guys coming out and he's always finding a way to make it work I think\nWe have to give that up for a certain period of time here don't we and say maybe it's time for that change yeah\nYou know speaking of change man I I either would have drafted a same darnel or try to make a deal with the browns I liked Baker Mayfield have you seen him play all and he's good man he's going to be real good\nAnd by the way it looks like the NFL messed up ... uh he was hit in the head with a helmet and he was sliding whether it was a close call sliding or not that's not the point it was it and I had no penalty was called\nAnd it would have been a first down at the uh twenty six yard line man what you're talking about a jinx team they played for overtime games in seven games ever heard of that\nI Can't even fathom that like you as it is it coming off of the aisle and sixteen fees and on top of all of that but yes and then having to go in and work that kind of level of heart and missed that call which the NFL as you said the NFL saying\nThat was a missed call we're wrong in that no good but what does it do now I mean aside for all looking forward to what goes on forward but at this point we can't do anything about\nThat now yeah by the way that you see the last play the game the bears patriots yes\nYou realize ... on the line of scrimmage with forty five but he went back to his own thirty five\nAnd threw the ball six twenty five yards in the air with a man in his face yes man now see here's what the bears did he didn't play right away no member Cutler played ... they ... they said OK use waste your time is the guy the future this guy is good for the giants should have done\nAnd what's the problem with holding a clipboard for a quarterback for a period of time let somebody get some training in there and watch what's happening and then move forward in the quarterback spot there's nothing wrong with that that's the way it used to be done well on the way here Warner a you have one shot at the end zone one score you need to win\nWhose hands do you want to get the ball and we'll talk about that coming up next year I'm a sports on the voice in New York seven ten

man is beyond beyond me go\nMean nasty handle imagine him when you get behind closed and he was guarded elderly\nItem Donald Trump mini me of Donald Trump who has decimated health care in this state taking health care for poor people cutting Medicaid cutting mental health services well\nWatch Mullen there was nothing that he ... he's a ... head of duchess county that devastating health care\nIn New York state it's absolutely outrageous and then for Cuomo to say that he's all over the the empty age all over the no governor has been more active in fixing the subways what he says oh it's a ... problem he is on line arrogant\nCondescending thug\nAnd he should be turned out office and I'll probably win with a huge margin I Do think mowing narrowed it was like oh you don't watch it but Marlene night said in Washington and your and your Cuomo you even watch I listen to it on the radio and all I I hear that voice of Cuomo and I want to from my shoe with the radio I mean that guy really rubs me the wrong way I should take 'em on\nMost somebody should I Know more narrow doesn't really seem like a nice guy and he's like a nice ... as well say like a fun time but then the then the semi fun\nSet is untrue and you can see him you know he can't talk to you don't make the rules of interrupted me every time I've spoken with\nYeah oh now should have gone over and slug to go like well this is Marsha ... come over and hit you don't make me punch you out she said you know what was that Obama would shut up\nMarcia Kramer don't channel does a punch overweight become over us then why not why did these moderators come up with these dumb question that what's your favorite kind of sausage well you know the question is that\nI I thought they gave a Cuomo too much latitude he pretty much ram that thing by himself\nWell that's because they're the mainstream media and they loved Democrats here in the blue state of and and so they cut the Cuomo's slam\nOn land I mean he did really run roughshod over that whole thing completely\nDidn't stop that's what I deal with this and they had to sit down and you know he had to be you know we need to send your next and that's\nThat's just the way he does but I'm not defending it I'm just saying that if you want to debate him these are the rules he's he's holds all the cards use the news the income that they the his accusation their Mona narrow put his wife on the payroll but company the contract she ... from what I understand she was on the payroll before the before the she got even Mary ... ridiculous\nRidiculous crazy I mean it's the end and he and he brushes aside all the corruption is next to him\nAll I take what is what I take from the debate this is the only thing that gives me hope there is I Hope Cuomo runs for president because he's going to lose big time there is no way that guy is gonna play anywhere outside of the state that has been brainwashed by Democrats\nAnd running out the big three is a very censoring six

talking about anything different are they worried and schools of this virus spreads you when you're in any of that yet religiously not because they are probably some kids who have little compromised immune systems in the schools oh I'm sure there are like a now I Know talked to that sets up a little hazmat\nSuits for everybody known and I had a scary out there it really is you know ...\nAll right
