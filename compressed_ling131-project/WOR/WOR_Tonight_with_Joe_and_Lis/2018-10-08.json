V. with whom Wayne at your side\nSomeone who's a true leader would stand up in front of the team if oh no Becca junior asks ... this week hey I got a message for the guys do you mind if I talked to the team\n... says no\n\nHe's going to let back them express what he wants and trying to rally the guys up and that could be a real positive but when you do it through the media it doesn't work you don't want to air your dirty laundry everywhere publicly\nAnd\nHe again he sets and things that were important that needed to be heard he felt that team responded yesterday but it it can just creates\nChaos around the giants uh your heard pat sure after the game yesterday he's still fired up about this even after the game was played\nPart of salmon after I was driving questions right now and I'm gonna go back to what I said All right I addressed without a doubt\nI addressed it with our team I publicly declared that I didn't agree with his comments and I asked anybody that was interested if they want a clarification go to do 'cause he's a big man [noise] no I'm not going to give the public of town to flush on this\nRight that would make me small not strong\nAnd these are the kinds of things in my opinion when you have the locker room that we have\nThat will help galvanize the 'cause the lock and they took care of it [noise] and that's what I'm saying on it [noise] faith though that\nThey do that would make me small not strong so when you've got to say that [laughter] but he put sugar in a tough spot because he talked about in the interview how they're not scheming him open to take advantage of what\nHe could do down field are you hearing the interview he doesn't take any responsibility himself for the struggles of this team and it it's all about the schemes so he's pointing to the coaching ah to the the quarterback and\nI just think if you want a vote Albuquerque junior wants to be a true leader on the team and he's got the contract to do it he's got the talent to do it and he seems to be working up towards reaching that level\nThere are ways to go about it ... it's great to get some insight as to what's actually happening with the giants and how an athlete like ode outback of junior feels about things but if his goal\nIs to win football games you want to keep this stuff in the house and not have it blow up week after week after week and these are the kinds of things that are going to run all the time to\nMeet with the team yourself handle that in your own way go up in front of the team and say you don't think they're playing with enough part and tried to rally guys in that way\nRather than do it publicly in and make a show of it as he did this week that's that's what you want to see I'll give you an example\nThe stakes for the money but because they had invested in research and development have invested in data\nThey're they're able to be more efficient with how they're spending their money in their resources whether it's\nYour actual dollars that or in the case of ... ... it was you already have your organization for someone who's going to help you out that a lot so yeah that's to me that's like a perfect example right there of the as you can gain a if you're able to look back and people who are basically just look at it with respect it\nWorks and we see it from so many of the teams that are still playing baseball this time of year including the Yankees recommend everybody check that out at the athletic and\nGame three of ... Yankees Red Sox denied you can read all about it in the athletic more correct appreciate about\n... it was great coverage mark\n... of the athletic and uh we'll dive into the ... general manager of ... and and the role of analytics within that\nUh but Steve Philips the Ford or GM and the Mets a serious ... what makes that ... job so unique and what might he tell\nCandidates are going in to interview to be the next GM of the New York Mets ... thoughts at seven oh five we can take some calls coming up eight hundred three two one zero seven ten\nNow getting some extra thoughts on game three between the Yankees Red Sox coming up this is sports don't repeat McCarthy how the voice of New York seven ten W O R\nO seven June W O R [laughter]\nSocks tonight at Yankee Stadium as a critical game three even offered\nOne I Do think a lot has been going right for the Yankees and the series those far as we discuss with Margaret the athletic last segment or not just the fact that they did split up at Fenway Park which is what you're seeking to do against the team that won a hundred and eight games last year bring back to the Bronx try to\nClose out the series and games three four aren't you got to deal with the gay five up at Fenway so be it uh but the way that these games are played out I Do think of showing the Yankees to be better built for the post season the fact that the red Sox and that game one\nEven a five run lead isn't enough or is barely enough as it was the case the other day\nAnd you know they have to depend on Craig kimbrell to get saves longer than one inning they don't have anybody to trust in that bridge area between the fifth and sixth ... all the way up to win kimbrell grabs the ball for the first time\nAnd that is something as we've talked about is pivotal in these postseason games because so often you're going to the pen early they went to the pending the second inning last game with David Price get shelled in the playoffs again\nYou have to have those innings covered in some way shape or form and the red Sox have no real plant no dependable\nArm to go to in those ... said they are depending on Nathan ... to go out and give them seven innings tonight\nThat's the way the ... Cora put it today pre game that's what they want to see no team even the best but you just a Berliner ... seven innings for the Houston Astros\nYou know you could look at the framework of the roster of saying okay well I like some of the starting pitchers but they all come with some level of unpredictability because of health like all of them or have some level of unpredictability I like some of the position players\nBut there's some unpredictability of health like I don't know what ... going to be and he's a critical part of it\nYou've got a poor outfielders for three spots you don't really have a first baseman the a and you know I think top praise you'd be better served as kind of the first base third base for backup and have an everyday player at first it everyday player third phrase review the guy that they'll those two guys and you do to capture\nA and so that's a lot of you know the end of the the closer to rebuild your rotation and even with all of that you still have some unpredictability withheld rotations but maybe you go for it but you don't have a real farm system and so we can maybe try to compete for the next couple of years\nBut if it and and even what that you've got some question uh that you're going to be able to\nBecause you didn't really compete last year you thought you might be able to and you don't really have much of a farm system to do that either so at some point\nYou're going to have to trade some guys to restart your farm system because if you play it out to the end try to work with every body let 'em go to create the then and then you're really starting ... years from now starting to restock farm system in your ears tracing your tail it till you get there so the Mets are interesting but they're also somewhat complicated\nWell though the farm it's not great but it's in a far better position than it was it said this time last year is it not\nIt's it's yeah I think there's there's some guys but it's not it's not the feeder system yet I mean that's the thing is it's not really the feeder system you're not anywhere near where the blue jays are right now is they're getting ready for the rebuilding they're ready to\nBreak in bladder grilled junior and I don't play poker shot at some point Kevin ... uh they've got the Danny chance to get up there you know they're not where the Yankees are with that sort of stopped right now or in so they have some some potential impact guys some of them a little further away but they like some other guys but\nYou know it's not really the feeder system yet it's not like two years now they've got this whole\nSystem the way you want if\nYou want to have waves of talent so you've got some upper level guys ready to hit the big leagues as they get ready to impact the major league level you've got that next group of guys to come in to be able to protect some of the other veterans are aging or to be able to trade some guys to fortify you're basically roster you need ... players to play for you in trade\nTo be able to supplement your roster during the course of the season that's the level of depth of the Mets don't have ...\nYeah we're talking again with Steve Philips a former general manager of the ... serious acts Sam ... as far as how the Mets are handling the interview process so the first interview will be with Jeff well pot as well as John ... general manager and then a down the line when their final candidates Fred will ... will get involved\nHow how differently would a candidate have to approach let's say Geoff and Fred in terms of their philosophies on the game to try to win both of them over\n[laughter] yeah I think it's I I think Jeff has probably more the guy\nThat will be breaking down the everyday responsibilities of the general manager and what his expectations are federal certainly have some of that but I think at this stage spreads probably more\nThe macro view of you know what your general philosophies your general sort of approach because I don't think France is false chapters on a daily basis ... or so ... got a lot to make sure you got a good represented the organization that you're going to be a good spokesman for the organization or that you're you know that you understand analytics that you understand people\nAre that you know I think they're going to look for war the hybrid executive not somebody who's strictly analytics\nIs a a strictly you know what I see is what I Believe or in some comedy too uh but you know ... and I think the other important question here is do they want somebody with experience or do they want a fresh\nMind a fresh voice so young guy who has done that just yet [noise] uh you know I think that that uh\nIt's easier for Jeff in his level of involvement if it's somebody who has less experience right\nBecause they can kind of grow together in in that role and Jeff going to have a little bit more input there are more experience guy will likely say I got it\nI'll I'll let you don't want to do it but I got it right now ah and it's a little different sort of relationship so I think that will be an interesting part of this right that it's easier to bandage on new guy a young guy like I was in\nOh do you have a say as far as whether he comes back and is your manager if you don't have a relationship with Nikki Callaway previously\nWould you want him to continue as the manager and while Jeff well beyond the season ending press conference said basically hey whatever comes in all have the ability to make these decisions\nHe also made it fairly clear that he wanted these guys back and and to be around in in some way so\nYou know exactly how much say do you have over a these situations even if Jeff want something or ownership want something does that mean the GM hey your opinion overrides and and you get what you want\nAnd that's something that the GM's have to find out about in the interview process it's not just interviewing hey who's the best GM candidate here who was the best plan for the Mets also it also cuts the other way\nIt's ... am I going to be able to have success here am I going to be a fit here uh I Do think that the farm system is in better condition than\nSteve allowed and I get they haven't developed a ton of players in recent seasons is we obscene it's Jeff McNeil\nA and you know next year ... will be in that mix it at first base unless they move in this off season you have Justin Dunn David, Peter sent a couple of first round pitching prospects that are moving their way up through the system\nAh Jerry ... is still a ways away but a very talented first round position player outfielder picked\nUp by the Mets this past season in ... salmon as it's probably the number one prospect in the organization right now I guess you'd arguing with Pete Alonzo uh and and him and his who knows exactly where he fits in as a middle infielder what his ceiling is it's not a ... junior type of situation but I think that the\nMiners have had a good run here but it does remain to be seen\nWho the real impact players are going to be and I suppose whether or not you buy into Peter ... as an everyday National League player that being someone who can defensively handle first base every day I could certainly impact how you view the minor league system overall\nA but this is as we've talked about a huge hired for the Mets an opportunity to\nHave a new voice new opinions in this organization to try to fresh and things up the Mets they don't need a complete facelift here but they need some adjustments big time they have to develop players better and have a system in place to do that they\nNeed to be able to go out and fill the holes that they have significant holes in the bullpen you've got to rework that whole thing\nUh you got to find a way to add some offense to this team as Steve mentioned it's a question mark what you on assessed but it's just going to be able to provide this upcoming season and how you're going to handle him going forward as he is under contract through the twenty twenty season\nAs yes that there are some difficult decisions to be made here but ... I I Am far more optimistic about this team at this point that it was said two months ago at the end of July or Jeff make deal locked down to spot I think he's an everyday second baseman you had a micro could Bordeaux\nBounce back at a big way and look like and play like Michael could for do they all start from the previous season over the last couple of months of the year and it was just empty numbers he did it against teams competing for postseason bart's down the stretch you had success against those teams they hit the left hander she did a lot of things right and\nIt was just a matter of him strengthening not only the shoulder but\nProbably his hands or you know he didn't swing a bat all went there he didn't have is normal preparation you didn't have a spring training and the fact that he looked like a star once again\nA poor tents picked that his team because they need a middle of the order bat that they could depend on\nKnowing that you on assessment is is likely to miss at least half of this upcoming season and even if when he does come back coming off\nSurgeries on both of his heels\nHow much is you really going to be able to give you that first year as you get to be able to play every day is he going to be able to start in left field are those are major question marks why I think you're going through the season assuming nothing\nFrom un assessed but as you want this organization to to take that next step in ways that we see the other successful teams around baseball do\nA bump up the analytics or be a little smarter about how you go about\nThe decision making process and these are all things the Mets have to uh get better I'd be better at develop better\nAnd become a team that once again could play deep into October and it feels like they struck by lightning in a bottle back at twenty Fifteen the way things went down that last couple of months the season and into October\nAnd they haven't been able to recapture this in twenty sixteen and wild card berth and twenty Seventeen twenty Eighteen certainly seasons where they win a ... in the seventies in terms of games and\nYou know a lot of flaws certainly coming to the surface over the last couple of seasons and things that they have to write as an organization and\nYeah that chain of command will be a key part of it and what you hope is or whoever this GM is they have that full autonomy they have the ability to make these decisions and build the organization the way that they see fit they're the experts\nAnd there's a reason I bring brought in in this kind of job and you know will the Mets allow that general manager to have that kind of power it's a it's a huge question the search and one of the reasons why maybe you do see a quite a few candidates not in a hurry\nOr to interview and you know get in the mix for this job and that's something that you know I think the Mets\nCan still do here is change that perception or at least attempt to over the um the next few weeks as they start this process or so you know in terms of the names you see now I don't think any of them is terribly exciting and you know Steve Philips has a good stuff to say about Garry Little Rock\nUh but you'd hope that there are some more you know analytically conscious guys\nUh that become a part of this mix and you know you don't have to be a total stat and I'm like that I think you could be balanced but you better have an understanding of the scouting of the analytics of the numbers and how they all\nMixed together those are the best GM's in the sport and anybody who's worked for the ... knows all about that and\nYeah you'd love to pluck somebody off that tree\nOr if you had the opportunity eight hundred three two one zero seven ten again eight hundred three two one zero seven ten where you take the Mets calls coming up uh otherwise so we'll start diving into the jets a big win yesterday against the Denver Broncos what'd you learn about Sam Darnell then", "year": "2018", "show_name": "WOR Tonight with Joe and Lis", "city": "New York", "day": "08"}
