Maggie from Kansas City there was the opposite to coordinate or they're brought him over the head coach still does have different things to you and they cover up basically Mitch ... limitations but ... still\nAt a big day statistically yesterday against New England they scored thirty one points they've got ... Mack the big time pass Russia that defense is a lot of pieces they were real impressive that first game the year against Green Bay\nAnd to go on the road to Chicago or that it it's certainly not easy and then the games that are probably truly decide\nAh the jets season as after the bears they play three consecutive divisional games they get the dolphins on the road dolphins are solid this year that's a good football team not great they don't have a a real quarterback their ... has been playing the blame\nBut the dolphins already went to ... live stadium jets just couldn't handle that pass rush at all and then the jets get the bells at home\nUh you'd think that would be a simple one considering the bills have been worse ... in recent memory especially when you consider that every body scores that today's game except buffalo five points yesterday in laws\nAnd then the big New England game and the patriots gonna down after Thanksgiving the jets to be well rested to that game with the by week coming in between but those are the the three games is the quarter that will decide exactly what happens with the jets um\nMy yesterday yeah it's disappointing that they lose a game against the good the Minnesota about I don't think the Vikings played their best game they haven't played as well as they did last year\nAnd there was opportunity for the jets yesterday even when you look up and they lost by twenty there is a tight game going into the second half neither team could put up a first down early on and that they're going to ask you a lot of opportunities up and simply for the jets and\nAnd it's amazing that they can't snap the football a that's a big problem that wins a became a little bit of an issue but now the drops just killing Sam Darnell ... and uh we'll get into you know some\nDecisions made by Todd Bowles that didn't put the jets to integrate situation and how you know this team is reacting to a loss like that and they had three consecutive games at home and they won two of them against the colds and the Broncos they lose the finale or against the Minnesota Vikings here and now\nPoverty and little opportunity um but the answer isn't not obeying our laws\nThat we have a an immigration policy immigration laws the first step if you want to ever come to America is to respect the laws of this land and respect America sovereignty and respect\nOur borders and that if you're not willing to do that basic most fundamental things and then at that point there are other people that would would be willing to accept that\nAnd doing the right way and they should have precedence over those that are lawless and don't respect our laws\nSo it's really really simple and you know I feel listen to the world America had the money you know we do so much already ... the tunes are billions and trillions of dollars were spent over the years to help other people in other lands\nAt some point we've got to take care of America First we've\nGot to take Americans out of poverty first we've got Americans that need help in this country that that don't yet have not fully gotten on board we need every American successful\nAnd those that can't take care of themselves they will be taking care of\nNo America's never lack for compassion just the opposite there's never been a country that has accumulated more power and used it for the advancement of human good around the world more than the U.S including paying the price and shutting the blood for the cause of liberty and freedom for many people around the world\nUm but it is it we cannot take on the world's problems either we don't have the money we don't have the ability to do that anyway eight hundred nine four one showing you want to be a part of the program Donna's in Iowa Don Hi how are

and deserving of being one in six and now the question\nStudents just continue to be there and there are no easy answers they're going to have to figure out that quarterback position a defense that was extremely good two years ago is now on the wrong side of things it looks like yeah you got a couple of pieces\nBut you do not have a complete defense and one that you know has some young pieces you can be excited about going forward um\nDo they trade Eli Apple today the ... been particularly good and sick while I'm Barkley listen he can be a star and this lady again he does everything you could possibly ask of a running back and there's only so much that you could do from that position to help the team out he's not a quarterback he's running back in and do they have some value\nBut ... most of their values when you're playing from ahead already and not just hasn't been the case often enough for these giants were barkers put up some yards and some games the it gives you a wow moment when you watch 'em out there especially when he gets into the open field\nIt only matters so much if you don't have the help of around him and you know the game last night gets clouded in the two point conversion discussion afterwards a which I Do think is interesting and we'll have a quickly here but do you want to make sure to express where this team is a as\nIf they're going to have to make some huge decisions of course going forward and they missed the boat not doing it last year maybe even before then but last night pat ... he's the one taking the heat for everything happening right now with so many decisions happening above his pay grade about whether this team should be able to win now\nAnd sharper down fourteen they scored a touchdown they had a long review it seemed like he was ready to kick the extra point had some time to think about it and then said you know what let's go for two in the spot and they didn't get it they were down eight\nThe falcons what kicked the long field goal of course the giants always give up the long field goal not much you can do about pat a bad luck but\nThey come back score again to point conversion okay but questions why are gone for two you're down fourteen at the time you scored a touchdown it's always conventional just kick the extra point played for the time\nAnd I thought ... at a good explanation after the game it was thought out you had some data ... numbers or a hundred percent correct but it seemed like it was backed up by people smarter than me out on Twitter and this is\nAn analytic\nDanger map involved argument that's been floating around for years that in that spot you should go for two and it it makes sense of you spent two seconds to think about it and don't get all caught up in the numbers where you get two shots at it and if you get the first to point conversion it's about a fifty fifty but if you get that now\nYou're six points down you scored a touchdown you can win the game and regulation you don't have to bother with overtime and even if you miss the\nTwo boys get version like the giants did\nYou have another shot in order to put it in that didn't cost the giants last night and I liked the aggressiveness I like the map making sense and backing up a decision\nAt bat sure he told you exactly what his thought process was and people's fear of doing something on conventional or look at the numbers of his situation my goodness\nJust because you do something that hasn't been done for fifty years doesn't mean it's wrong\nSometimes what's been done in the past is\nIs she in a high and blown a very young accomplished Ivy League a major like executive with the Tampa Bay rays over the last fourteen seasons\nHe will interview I Believe tomorrow and it sounds like a based on reports that he will meet with the media then on Thursday or at least to have a conference call\nAnd today was Doug Melvin turn it's three very different candidates that the Mets have here at the end I and ... is the accomplished guy as he's been a fairly successful general manager in Texas with the rangers tremendous ... there\nAnd then with the brewers in Milwaukee a were yes uh they never won the whole thing about a a small market team that did have some runs a memorable ones you remember what the the ... did for that team in two thousand eight before\nA signing on with the New York Yankees in how aggressive the brewers were and going out and making that trade and Senate seats the out there essentially ... every fourth day\nOr to try to get them into the playoffs which he did and\nUh throughout the postseason as well uh but Doug Melvin at me look at the overall record it certainly doesn't blow you away what he did in Milwaukee but you do consider some of them you know like a payroll issues that you have there are but he has been involved as a special assistant over the last few years and\nA nice run to the championships series one game away from the world series this past year\nAnd one big from Melbourne to try to separate himself the trend amongst within the game is to hire young Ivy League educated general managers these are the guys that you see all over the place in fact\nIn Milwaukee where Doug Melvin was the GM three years ago had a conversation with ownership he felt hey maybe it's time to take a step back and transition into a different place in life\nAnd the brewers at interest in hiring a younger person which he publicly agreed with that said it's become a a young man's job or a general manager\nWell the brewers did that melts it became a special assistant they brought in Stearns or is that a lot of success there with the brewers but now three years later Melvin has the edge and he talked about quite a bit today\nOh he is re energized and you can understand Twenty years being a GM maybe burn out a little bit and you say you know what I got another run in me\nUh and that's something that Melvin talked about today he talked about how the brewers were you know I had of the curve with some of the analytics one being they didn't jump into the shift maybe as early as the Tampa Bay rays did but\nHe said they were an early adopter of the shift and uh also pointed to a an article that was apparently in the New York times of two thousand four where he talked about the idea of an open or which became the trend this post season and this past year the Tampa Bay rays using it\nTo great effect this season so you know it's easy to put everybody in a box and say well hind bloom and he's the analytical whiz kid and then you know Mel then he's going to be the traditional scout type and and really not everybody fits perfectly into a box some advantages to Melbourne has the talked about today\nA he has managed in lead organizations before that's important especially in New York where you are the face of a franchise you up to express the decision making handled the crises when they do come up\nA ... you know he's a good people person enjoys working with people men touring and things like that but I think what Mets fans are concerned about is that what kind of beige India have for this team and I ask Doug Melvin if he saw the Mets are having the ability to have short term success\nIf this was a team that needed to be a total rebuild it with me here either team that's got to\nThe town of ... started fishing those standing so the ... name on conform to show up and there's areas that need to be improved upon those I identify some of them but I Do want to talk to some of the people in the organization if I get this job\nBut no I Want to win games and championships\nAnd that's what you want to hear somebody is going to come in and go right after this and the Mets I don't think they're in a situation where they gotta wait a couple of years to retool this thing\nWith the way things did develop over the last couple of months in the year there is some talent here to work with now you're making Calloway I thought you some proven as the season went along but clearly there is some growing pains with him and those first few months here's Melvin on the Mets managers future\nBut I don't know Mickey ... from the outside it they make you had to be a very tough situation for the sheer hell so Sandy and the John Rico stepping ended a great job of keeping things together\nBut the team but the manager came in and it was the first time as a manager and my feeling is that he's probably deserves a chance to do this again I Want to sit down\nIf I get this job and get a sense of leave with Mickey that see his philosophy in that but I think he does probably deserve a chance because he's been a good baseball guy\nAs a probably deserving Mickey ... way of coming back we want to talk to them which I think is a pragmatic approach got to make sure that you're going to be\nA team that can work together is TV paper yeah I work with anybody no problem well you're going to have to fight you can have a sub issues that pop up at a GM and the manager has to be able to work out and you better you know beyond the same page with how you see the game\nA ... Melvin hey this is a qualified general manager candidate\nI'm looking forward to hearing from hind bloom no\nI think that he's the kind of candidate that could just absolutely blow you away melted today you know what you're getting he's been a gym in the league for decades he's experienced he would be\nFine but Blum is that new age guy that I think uh I'm very curious to hear because I didn't go one of two ways where one he could be extremely bright which I'm sure he is and display that in a way that you know even dummies like me can handle\nA but too I I Wonder\nYou know you new\nYork is such a different beast in Tampa and now you're going to be the voice of an organization it is different\nAnd for Melvin you figure has to be fine with the conference call today a for bloom and how he shows himself publicly I'm very curious about because we don't we haven't heard this guy talk a whole lot over the years and you know he'll get a get grilled a little bit\nUh come a couple of days from now and I I think that is where hey\nThere's the high ceiling and there's the the low floor right that's where you have the potential ability to hit a home run and I know me with sports I'd always went for the fences because you've got to be the best at thirty teams the ideas not to be in the top half when you got to be the best of thirty yeah takes chances in order to get to that point\nMatty halted the record will give us his take on a Melbourne today and where the Mets go from here as far as their front office is concerned that's coming up it's sports don't repeat McCarthy ... voice in New York ... double you all are seven\nW O R sports though when you look on seven ten W O L [noise]\nBy the match general manager ... uh it it it approaching a and end up we would think as broadly\nBandwagon Doug Melvin and high a\nHigh end bloom are the three finalists for the position right now we bring in Matt ... hall of the record into Matt how are you tonight\nI'm doing well thanks for having\nA So Doug Melvin today conference call with reporters a you know what was maybe a key takeaway that you had a hearing Melbourne today\n[noise] um I thought it was interesting I think he really kind of went out of his way to make sure that hey he might be an older guy but he knows the value of analytics and I think you really pull it up which um I I mean let's say he's not going to be the most analytical guy in the world to a it's a different\nEra now I thought he really played up a collaboration fact though I mean I thought he really stressed the thing that\nHe wants his scouting staff to be analytics he wants his analysts guy to understand the scout inside he wants to work with people he likes the whole thing I mean he really came across as um like he he wants this to be a very uh\nUh is uh you know synergy and stuff like that which is something to remember Mickey Callaway a talk a lot about the Mets light so that was just something that stood out to be\nIn here is someone who unlike Brody bandwagon and high end bloom has experience at the top of running an organization and are dealing with the problems that you know ultimately have they're not always baseball problems a lot of times you know they could be people problems whether you're developing someone in the front office or the baseball player\nGuy that you've champion for for so long it you know one thing I that it's kind of one thing I thought with this ... I mean\nYou know ... is a smart guy he he certainly has the qualified choice it's a lot of baseball department Sunday but you know if the metro to hire and\nYou know with so many big guys will kind of conception do they have to consider the perception that create in the world but also around baseball at that you know like let's say he comes in and his first act is to get to glom paid\nWhich is certainly reasonable well do people then look at it and say something along the lines of light ... hey like equal came in and took care to see a guy or you know that ... his she ain't guys are really good but then you know how does that factor into the off season\nIn the sense of life you know if you're signing\nPredominantly Morsi a client's again people just look like well you know what what is going on here and certainly again I I think all of it I just say this is a lot of factors that would be considered a with ... but but as you said we also none of us had an eye any idea what kinda G and it should it be\nA you know obviously we didn't talk to him and he you know he is not\nA he is not a baseball executive right down the other two are you can talk with people readily and get a sense of what kind of like shelter that love what they're going to do with ... just speculation\nYeah is there any reason to really talk deep into baseball with the you know Brody as an agent you talk about his clients and it gives it why they're so good in\nThe uh she has to be well versed in analytics though because you have to be a good point to to to appeal to all teams when you're trying to figure guys now granted I couldn't tell you off\nMy hand how much of that he does or how much of that is just that but as\nWhen you're trying to sell clients in this day you have to be able to find every little nugget even if it's just what a dies launch angle is on a Tuesday ...\nLike do you do at the ... and no he has\nTo be incorporating that type of stuff is you know decisions at all that\nBeep trader Brody and he'd be a particularly good with that marketing um you know potential players to move but it'd be were to become the gym but he's got to the mystery candidate and all of this so now I'm starting to store to its way out you could check out Matty halt coverage and the record and a three time tonight Matt\n... is all it's\nAll right a quick break some thoughts and then we'll get you ready for a game one of the world series tonight it's the sports don't repeat McCarthy and the boys the New York ... double you all are now\nIn the W O R sports with my car [noise]\nOur more coverage of the ... general manager ... coming up in the next few days or tonight game one of the world series between the red Sox and the Dodgers Clinton curse shopper LA\nChris Sale for Boston and the Dodgers with an All right handed lined up to go against the ... the Dodgers are want to do\nOne thing interesting about this World Series at least as of now maybe because it hasn't started yet it doesn't feel like in this town at least there's a ton of juice a British series in and maybe that one big ... and everybody gets into it\nUh but with the Dodgers the red Sox too familiar teams are hated team for many with the Boston Red Sox in this town\nOr the Dodgers with historical roots here but um you know I'm more a chase outlays about the thing that gets people going the most about the Dodgers these days around here are ... they're too big markets\nAnd yet it feels like it's been kind of sneaking up\nOn ya tonight but ah you have a potentially great pitching match up with ... Shaw and sail are always interested in the world series how the d._a. just going to factor in\nI always think the NFL team is the one that is at a disadvantage with the ... because they don't have\nTypically that big bopper sitting there on the bench the Dodgers do their loaded absolutely loaded with bats the d._a. is no problem for them to cover they basically playing All right handed team and then all left handed team and ship them out as the game goes along\nSo they are more than capable of handling that spot\nFor the red Sox gets a little bit more interesting ... might see some time at second base his native position ... when he's down in the minor leagues that's where he played\nA so maybe they would use him there for a little while and a game at least early on if they take the lead a start playing for defense but that will be a problem for LA it starts in Boston tonight's supposed to be cool there was some rain earlier in Boston\nUh but uh I uh these teams seem fairly evenly matched producer ray of hope he hates those but I like the red Sox and this one as they've done it done with the bullpen has produced a raise team\nAnd they have just so deep up into believe they can be to the top of the line of the middle of the line at the bottom line up\nOr that ... does not stop as they used an Astros found out real quick or the other night so uh the one under the fourteenth World Series much more coverage coming your way\nYou're on ...

I got to say hey by by George Soros so yeah he learnt sorrow not come on all you know everyone\nSays all the violence is from the left or you know what they're going to say okay so the story is George Soros who gets blamed for\nEverything by the right well he goes on in the Caribbean oh he's funny is funding the caravan and everything that goes wrong is funded by George Soros any kind of protests there oh it's a sorrows funding\nThey loved anyway and explosive device was found in his Westchester mailbox it looks like a tone of which is part of Bedford I'm so that they found some kind of explosive devices and billionaire George services a New York house in the mailbox you know what\nI'm whenever something happens of a violent nature so you say the left as violent you know you know what the issues is going to be here or a Democrat planted this just to make the Republicans look bad\nWell first of all we have no idea who planet and you're already jumping to conclusions\nKnowing how I'll tell me what what their rights are going to say we could be some lunatic it could be some Unabomber type person we have no idea and already are jumping to conclusions saying it's the Republican I didn't say what anybody I'm just telling you what the what the right you don't have that imply Lynn ... with\nThe cash that is your tax a little bit more ... more into it I did go to Stuyvesant so\nYou could have a little subtlety in conversation doesn't have to be all beat you over their head lie a dead who have a little\nNuance to the conversation who the heck knows who planted the bomb but fortunately did not go off and no one was hurt in George Soros is compounds violent ... again ... remember that the Ecuadorian pizza delivery now and it was detained by ice well and everyone\nRally to his support including all the left these who of course one all the immigrants here for a ... well it turns out he has now been charged with domestic violence he pushed his wife against the wall slapped her grabbed her phone keep her from calling police now you ask people like Cory Booker\nWhat do you have to say about this court you are as big support it when he was here and Cory Booker says I was supportive of Pablo when he was unjustly detained by ice in the summer with these latest allegations are trouble\nThey are by by law wrecked an athlete or on a definitely heading back to Ecuador for that that's\nThe that's too bad you know if they've painted the picture of him being a good guy and the family guy and obviously he's not such a good guy and that is going to cost\nThem a one way ticket out of the country and like all those people come in here in the Caribbean and who are totally ... and all paid for by not out of Adam's apple in a lot\nOf this is a really wanting to today's Len Burman and Michael read all in the morning kept it alive tomorrow from ... on seven ten W are\nForty in the morning of voting every one of us who is day is October the twenty third\nTwenty Eighteen you know before we get into the caravan and the big rally in Houston last night from the president just dribs and drabs are coming out from a turtle once beach in Turkey he's talking about what really happened to the murdered journalist he's saying first of all it was all pre planned this wasn't just a a fight that took place and and to show that he died\nAll pre planned he said a team of Saudi ages began arriving a turkey the day before the killing ... and they said the cameras in the consulate removed\nOh that's interesting that's an interesting little so little tidbits chin is has he been able to tie it to the crown prince of Saudi Arabia and that's what we're waiting to find out my guess is no because it basically the tenor of his speeches those who are we got to find out who exactly was responsible so he's not pointing the finger at the crown prince yet\nBut I saw a report that the Saudi Arabia is saying it's now was it the number two to the crown prince somebody close to the crown prince who ordered the hit but it wasn't the crown prince himself which frankly I have a hard time because that's what the Saudis are saying yes well you know emailed her violent lie and you know\nThe big question is I'm going to get into this later what what's the United states can do if we're going to just stand by and be milling about about this than the than\nThe what's the point so I think we have to take some strong action that's my point of view but let's let's move on to the caravan and let's move on to Trump's rally um here's what he said he I mean it was a huge crowd and they couldn't get into the place and uh they really were excited the president was there in Houston\nWe want people to come into our country we have a three point seven percent unemployment is the lowest it's been more than fifty years but\nNo problem with that deal and I don't know what I thought you were an open borders go I'm not sure why why do you keep\nSaying you know you keep saying stuff the way the president just keeps saying stuff and you hope it will stick to the wall and it may be true no you're just making stuff up the way he said oh there's that mess Thirteen there's eastern Europeans and that that ... come on Michael you know that's not true\nThere are seven thousand people in that ... we have no idea who's in that care one guy named ... and other than you but you listen to the ... piece in the wall Street Journal about that care of and don't think for a second line that the caravan is spontaneous that seven thousand people just decided hey\nLet's get up and leave our homes and march to America it's not how it works Honduras has a left wing government that is against the United states it's agitating against the United states is doing what Castro did remember the Mariel boatlift\nWhen Castro sent all the criminals from Cuba you let him go on a makeshift rafts in boats in the United states and you couldn't really back then and one of them was a scar face Al Pacino remember that's how he got over here a member of the movie Scarface mhm so Honduras is sending some of these people encouraging them\nTo try to\nStorm our borders to wreak havoc here and you know what it's not going to work because we have secure borders thanks to President Trump and those people are going to march for two thousand miles and get here and I got to face a wall we've got time to build that wall before they get here\nAnd you know this because it's all factual yes because you read it in the wall Street Journal yes a newspaper so it must be true\nYes All right ... you don't believe it all Street Journal now\nBut I I you know I'm All right fine\nWe don't have borders we don't have a country we have to protect our vote or they go\nWell you well you're not a problem with protecting our borders I don't have a\nProblem with protecting the boy I don't think Honduras rounded up all these people and they're sending them here to to wreak havoc and storm our borders need if you believe that story that find do you can even cleans your right wing believes\nNew seriously think that this was just a spontaneous movement of people they all just got together one day and said hey let's walk two thousand miles the United states\nTruthfully I don't know when you don't either\nI think the Democrats have something to do with it and now they're saying I think we made a big mistake because people are seeing how bad it is how pathetic it is how bad our laws are they made a big mistake\nThere are those on the right who are charging this was all a democratic scheme to try to make the president look bad in some way I don't believe that either here's what the Democrats love to do\nSubsidy devastating when we lose six businesses in our downtown

big three this morning in a jam packed news day we are getting in dribs\nAnd drabs the truth of what happened to that journalist\nAt the Saudi Arabia an embassy in is than bowl president and I got an ... is a giving more details but so far left and I can't see that he is tied the order to kill to show the directly to the crown prince of Saudi Arabia\nI don't know if we can do that I don't know how he would do that but he's certainly said they disconnected the cameras that these people showed up the day before the law a plant it job it was well planned out it wasn't just an accidental fighting the consulate not all that stuff we didn't know but that the connection with the cameras ... that's a little a little factoid\nForums is the Trump is taking a ... percent on that he has cast doubt on the Saturday explanation or even though he is close to the crown prince a very interesting story that I read in the wall Street Journal that says perhaps the king of Saudi Arabia who turned over to the kingdom to the crown prince\nOr he may have to have a hand in gently as they say pushing his crown prince aside\nAnd installing some other so under cars there I think nephew that's probably where I Wish in and then that kind of gets cleaned up and that's the end of that also in the big three the caravan is thundering its way to America seven thousand on med people\nMaking their way through Mexico\nTo our border and led into dens just want to let them\nAll live in an all don't put words in my mouth ...\nThere's ... there's going to be a backlash against against immigration it's going to make people even more bent\nOut of the Trump build that well I think people have chosen up their teams and this is just this will feed whatever narrative are either side wants to use it\nYou know the ... could be talking Joe Bartlett and I were discussing this when you weren't paying attention to our brilliant\nI local and now you guys were talking about your little righty no damage could be talking about health care now something that does matter to people that they've been overwhelmed\nWith this silly caravan coming our way and Trump has switched the conversation to the problems with our borders\nYou know what's going to do it's going to drive Republicans to the polls 'cause normally the party in power doesn't turn out for a midterm election but now they will they're energized so he got cabin on the caravan of ... going to gin up the base so you're you're you're thinking with your heart not your brain\nAs they are it's heartless Republicans you know that they know the big three it is the great debate day Andrew\nCuomo finally faces his arrival mark Mullen arrow debates on CBS they're taping it I think uh this morning that will air tonight\nIt's seven o'clock only one hour moderated by Marcia Kramer and uh I think that's right he says they want to tape and cause a case that Cuomo screws up they got a little time to do some\nRented huh God this is why why why else would you not do it live because it is well they're not going to edit anything out who you know it is what it is you could have been line should've been lied yeah most debates all I've been ... to\nShe's facing her a poet who already Bernard nine months in jail for ... ... ... see a G L E shell the H E L E S so that that debate is gonna last thirty minutes\nOf talking about a minute to pay the entire debate is the lightning\nRound I mean really I mean ... will be the will be the vote totals about one eighty seven the Thirteen I mean no one's ever heard of this person are morally\nAll right let's check in as we do every Tuesday at this time with ABC News political analyst Alex ... good morning to you Alex\nGood morning Michael and let her quiet dating washing\nThe I'd actually nothing to see her All right Alex here's my theory I think all the attention this caravan of seven thousand migrants is getting\nYou know they get it from CNN when they like to show the pictures of the poor little suffering children and they're hoping it's going to appeal to the American people in their big hearts and they know the Democrats are so much more sensitive to these migrants but I think the backlash is going to be sensible Americans say well wait a minute we can't had seven thousand people\nFlooding our borders that's why we need to support Trump and Republicans what do you think\nMichael I think you're dead right I think this is the biggest political mistake Democrats have made sense Elizabeth Warren decided to take a DNA test\nMe push her out [laughter] so I think that's exactly right I think telling the American people that an army of seven thousand people marching on the border to come here illegally oh no that's not a threat to the law and order thatch the\nChaos that Democrats invite that Trump's message you saw chaos in Washington during the cabinet hearings Republicans are getting you know the White House press secretary getting pounded out of restaurants um law and order so yes this is\nDonald Trump Bush message is what the Democrats are reinforcing here\nI think he's got a good a new slogan Republicans want jobs Democrats want mobs\nThat's a very good slogan and you know Donald Trump is the\nBest the best political instincts of any predator in the political junkie and he is a is on message here that's why this race has tightened up Democrats had intensity their message was\nDonald Trump's gonna take women back back to the stone age take away their rights very powerful we were on fire but now Republicans are\nWhat kind of given NBS in this whole situation\nJust to be transparent to be fully transparent that with the world is watching this is a very very serious accusation and a very serious situation and to to make sure you're you're a transparent and to um to to take this very seriously\n... well no I don't think MS you know what it is\nIt's going to just be at that point on Dorey as well is is just BS and here's one other a snippet from the pushing her interview\nAnd we're getting facts from multiple places and then once those facts come in the sector state will will will work with our national security team to help us determine what we want to believe in what we think is credible\nAnd what we're going to do about it that's the key thing\nWell let's get some facts from Molly hunter ABC News correspondent in Istanbul good morning to Mali\nGentlemen good morning I Wish I had more fact for you\nWell the show aired on has come out he gave a speech today what what is he put on the table\n[noise] he did and luck if he'd given that speech two and a half weeks\nAgo I think we would all be jumping up and down because she walks through all of the Turkish evidence he put his name to all of the Turkish evidence at that hit the leak out through anonymous Turkish sources for the last\nThree weeks so it's been exactly at three weeks since ... show he went missing and Turkish officials as we've just got to have basically been leaking story the Turkish stories in the beginning and they have been consistent\nAnd all of their leagues that this was a study hitch on a murder happened inside the conflict is is premeditated this violent this ... this was gruesome and the airline went very methodically very clearly through all of the evidence\nWhat are you didn't you to do is talk about the video or the audio the Turkish officials have reported that the Turkish intelligence hatch and we've been waiting for the audiotapes or if they exist because if they would answer so many questions that we still have\nWell did he address the existence of the audiotapes at all\nDidn't even mention them by he didn't mention two big things he didn't mention the existence of audio or video and then he didn't even mention at king's come on son name a NBS of course the crown prince he talked take king's found on directly he paid at great\nDeference she spoke respect to the king and and he addressed a couple of direct question for the king he said\nWhere's the body why did it takes so long for the Saudis are to come up with an explanation why did it take so long for this study is to actually admitted they killed him a and then he\nOrdered this um and he said he was he took king Salman at his word that king Solomon hadn't ordered a but he's certainly implied that king Salman might know who ordered\nAnd Malia one bit that did come out that I hadn't heard in his speech today or two on the Turkish president was that he he's claiming the cameras roll dismantled in the consulate or the day before the attack\nYeah so that was actually one of the new ... at ABC News didn't know at least and they basically a small part of his daddy hit team that went into the conflict he said the first thing they did was dismantled the hard drive and the surveillance cameras a we'd heard that hinted about kind of makes sense but that only ... the question to\nAsk how did the Turks and get their audio and video that they stay or at least anonymous Turkish officials that said uh they have\n... hey ah my explained to me the complex relationship that aired on has with the Saudi family they you know on the surface they they try to look like they get along but there's a lot of rivalry underneath the surface isn't there\nThere's a lot of rivalry there on opposing sides basically I've kind of two regional\nAlliance says but what's interesting even though kind of they're definitely on two different sides airline more aligned with ... with Iran and chatty on the other side of course trying to balance Iran\nA with assistance possibly the United states these days at but there's also kind of an Islamic rivalry is both men both\nThe crown prince and president ... see themselves as the most important guys in the region they see that they are leading the region in the middle east or at least the Islamic world into a new future but they're very different visions of what that is an airline", "year": "2018", "show_name": "WOR Tonight with Joe and Lis", "city": "New York", "day": "23"}
