letter almost struck an officer while making an illegal turn and then refused to various instructions after he was stopped by another officer\nAt the end of the ... so to get our rested on the way to practice what they have a traffic violation but you are in getting arrested or after the fact and uh apparently he\nUh the same car was involved in a similar incident the same location on Monday\nA day or does it he has been reporting a summons was issued by mail after the car owned by law letter had not stopped and left the scene so I you know these are some some issues at the very least he didn't make it to practice he doesn't get his rap now\nAnd you wonder what the heck is going on here a potential felony involved in the charges against him so I it's just a disaster you added to the list for the giants this year\nAnd they may have had just a bizarre in nature about them over the last two years it it's a it's a circus with the giants from\nBack in juniors interviews sit next to little Wayne to last year how ... do handled the bench ing of Eli Manning and goes to Gino Smith ... of all people to take over that spot rather than\nTake a look at the young quarterback on the roster or this year they have the opportunity to to go back to it in a better way a right way and now all these questions are raised about\n... and boy talk about blowing and opportunity\nYou have a chance to get playing time his rookie and the NFL\nNot because you did anything great in the pre season or even in practice simply because the guy in front of you uh looks inept and has played inept over the course of this year it and there are reasons for that\nNot saying it's all on Eli here but he's not moving the football not scoring points as part of this ... or ... so\n... isn't the right place at the right time until you hit four Ninety five west than we are in New Jersey and ah now finds himself or arrested and um you know his future not completely in doubt here but\nWhat do you got yeah just get some rest today and you can't do it and the giants today you look at the movies made around the NFL\nThat division was busy cowboys went out last week trade it for a mark Cooper today the eagles went out added golden taped to their off bench or you had the Washington Redskins pick up\nHa ha Clinton decks a terrific safety from the Green Bay Packers the Packers also sent down time Montgomery ridiculous decision this week to bring it out of the end zone on a kick off even though he's told not to\nFumbled and Aaron Rodgers never got the ball at the end of the game with a chance to win it for a Green Bay against the rams the rams who are they are so aggressive as an organization the coach to the top made a number of big moves this off season\nAre bringing in\nSome markets Peters from the Kansas City chiefs and in ... suing they added to that team is they know their window is now\nAnd they add Dante Fowler junior to help out the ... from the Jacksonville Jaguars a credit to the rams I enjoy that team Sean McVeigh the fake punt the other day goes forward on Fort down\nHas faith that his team talked about hey we're not worried about failure around here and we don't fear failure around here I loved that being aggressive take it to the other team especially when you're clearly superior\nTo the other teams in the league as the rams have been over the course of the season and the front office backs up they make the moves they have the ability to do it and they have a quarter back on the rookie contracted Jared ...\nTake advantage and that's an organization the jets should be looking at and John emulate what the\nRams have done with Jared GOP who had an up and down rookie season didn't exactly look like a franchise quarterback but what they do\nThey went out grabbed an up and coming up to ... to head coach all of a sudden ... playing like a pro bowler\nAnd when you had the quarterback on the rookie contract you can spend a lot of money and build a defense and go out and get some wide receivers the main move for brand and cooks this off season and they've given golf a ton of weapons to work with\nAnd that's got to be with the jets look to do with sand Arnold going forward they got a lot of money to spend this off season they have the quarterback back there and they got to decide is Todd Bowles the right guy to develop this quarterback take 'em to the next level you look at these offices around the league in Kansas City\nIn LA with the rams uh with the bears are able to do either innovative often they're doing some different things the eagles or even you know when Carson went went down the adjustments they were able to make to win with Nick Boles\nThose are the kinds of minds that you want molding ... you win with ... and the NFL right now defensively only so much you can do you actually tried to play defense is going to yell flags all over the field\nYou got to be able to score points in this league to win now and the jets [noise] they've got\nThe trigger man they've got the quarterback yeah give them some weapons and do that today are no moves from the jets no moves from the giants you wouldn't like to see the jets get in on the wide receiver\nA but you know it's a dumb areas town it's it's not going to be kept most likely after this year he went to the Houston Texans are golden Tate a goes to the Philadelphia Eagles the jets they don't want to be given away a ton of draft picks years there without second round for the next couple of years\nBut hey you hold on to those picks you better put him to use in the off season and they haven't\nDone a very good job drafting or with my ... at least beyond the first round or so ... you're trained them you know makes moves his off season but look what the rams have done be aggressive as an organization\nHe aggressive Gulf War up or down sometimes take some chances you're often can't move the ball because you're short and it will come up with something on special teams make a play and they don't\n... and they have that kind of a aggressiveness McCann it sometimes does they want to take some chances he went up to number three and hope the right quarterback would be there and landed Sam don't\nUm but I Want to see more of that more with the rams do out of the New York jets\nA eight hundred three two one zero seven than the number to get involved to take some calls coming up uh eight o'clock hour or you will hear from Brody van wagging in that press conference for if you missed it earlier today a wall so a play some oddities with producer re\nWho's a had a day I woke up in Buffalo today and it's here ready to roll a producing the or the show tonight sports don't people card the on the voice of New York seven ten W. O. R.\nW. are sports with le Carre W O R [noise]\nBreaking news the college football playoff is out and you will not follow who is number one [noise]\nYeah so it's that Alabama [laughter] Kurds that that number one\nBig Clemson LSU Notre Dame making up the top for Michigan on the outside looking in along with George Oklahoma Washington state eight states down to ten spot a following a there last couple of weeks ago there was now\nA but to me as an extremely casual college football fan or this is something that ... it one step first playoff poll comes out now now you know where everybody stands how it all fits together what the key games are going to be to me it's kinda\nAnd maybe the Caesar disappear weeks too long for him as it is different for guys and the minor leagues as a five month season you go to the begs you got that extra month by drew Smith melted down in the final month of the year and I don't think any of those guys Jacob brame was up and down all season long\nOn those guys really show themselves that hey they're ready to be impacts pitchers Tyler bachelor um you know it it's going to take a while at the very least it and who knows you know you only expect a handful of them are a couple of them to\nEmerge anyway kind of playing the numbers game hey let's get a number of big arms in here and and help a couple of them stick well so far none of them stuck and it's been a year and a half\nNow since they acquired all those relievers so even though it's not ideal city signing free agents relievers to big deals because we know these guys are all over the place the Colorado Rockies made the playoffs they went out the off season prior last off season and it makes a big moves in the bullpen may\nGrabbed weighed Miller or they signed\nA the reliever from the Cleveland Indians Bryan Shaw and they spend some money on that pen and those guys weren't particularly good for them this year is Adam ought to veto who'd already had it was getting the big outs for them and\nYou know they won on the strength of their starting pitching actually was far better there in Colorado this year one of the few times you could say that about\nUh the Rockies playing at an elevation but it's going after relief pitchers they're great one season they get off of work they're not as good the next year they're out there down uh there's not a whole lot of samples sized and they're not pitch it as many innings as say a starter is but you have to\nHave a bullpen you could depend on over the course of a hundred and sixty two games and certainly when you get into the off the post season now there are different ways to go about it was about the Astros the red Sox the last couple of years utilize the depth in their rotation and some different ways in order to\nGet their way through the postseason but at the end of day you want to some guys you could trust there you can't\nIn twenty eight teams and say hey our starters gonna go eight innings every now and we're going to be fine\nYou had to have four or five arms at the very least that you can depend on the metric fortunate you know they should be able to expect seven innings out of the majority of their starters on a given night and we saw jak wheeler become an innings eater this past season\nWe saw Jacob the ground consistently me game after game pitch a deep into outings I Know a synagogue is certainly capable of that\nUh that we didn't see him at his best this past year I said that a nice starting point for the Mets they built up a lot of these guys arms because they were able to stay healthy last year Mickey Calloway does believe in pushing these guys he wants to let the starters go deep\nThat's all plus but there are a lot of work to be done in the bullpen and uh those are some things the Mets are are going to have to get done\nAnd then the outfield to me yeah I I don't see an obvious trade or a free agent candidate that I Would be going after if I were the Mets it it is a little tricky for them obviously you want and says but as being such a question mark\nGoing into next year but I have to assume I I think you have to uh you know going to it assuming you're not going to get anything out assessment is next year coming off\nSurgeries on both of his heels I probably you would think he might not be able to play every day as an outfielder you might be able to ... but that's not an option for the Mets and the national league so uh you know I liked the idea though of a young centerfield or someone who's relatively controllable\nI talked to a lot about Jackie Bradley junior of the last couple of months he was so terrific in the postseason who knows if he could still be had\nA Byron boxed in and Minnesota to name a couple go get a guy who had aids for ya\nBut could go get the ball ... and ... has been close to be in that kind of player but he has been able to stay healthy you can't depend on him and he's got to be a fourth fifth outfielder for you\nOr next year and I like to see the Mets you know not look for another big bruise there is going to play at the corner\nBut find a center fielder that can do a little bit of everything that you can get on base for a that can make some things happen on base that can replace some pretty good defense out there in center Pashtuns guys and put it all together yet but he's got a ton of potential and the Mets do have\nSome pieces that they can move 'em you know they have this crowded first base position and you know Pete Alonzo is killing it in the Arizona fall league he's having a tremendous winter building on\nA a big time season\nAnd he could fill you know a couple of different roles within that she could end up being\nThat big cleanup bat or the replacement for says but as in the lineup if his power does translate to the big leagues\nOr he could also be a guy that\nYou know does the defense work out because he had enough at the big league level\nOr to be worthwhile overall in and maybe they look at him as a trade candidate you know that's something that is a possibility and you might be moving a future star but he also might be far better off in the American league where he could ... play a little first base and mix it up a little bit more\nUh and to me I'd rather have the athletic player who can go get it and center is going to help you build a offensively and defensively\nOver the first baseman that can slug you know there's a decent amount of first baseman that could go out and be had this off season ah Paul Goldsmith might be available via trade a Steve Pearce with the world series and the pay with what he did this year there's some guys that position and generally you can slide anybody to first base let's move\nJay Bruce first as they did at the end of last year they still were Flora's on the roster for now you know an assessment as his future might be first base depending on how he comes back from the he'll issues so you know that position is already crowded within the ... Smith in that mix in one way or another\nAnd if you go out and find a center fielder you know somebody young exciting that's more of that make Neal Rosario mold then you know what we've seen for the Mets over the last few years that's something I Would love to see\nAnd I understand it's risky move with a guy like Peter ... who you know it seems to be a good kid is tremendous air you know it might have been nice to get a look at him at the end of last year but the mass decided not to go that route and it has to continue to success from the minors at the Arizona fall league here\nBut you know so it takes chances and these are the kind of moves that the Mets have not been willing to make over the last few years and I I think will be part of the test or with ... bandwagon and just how aggressive or a general manager is she going to be\nIt needs to be aggressive as an agent the marketing your player to every team possible right you're trying to speak\nEach individual teams language to convince them that your player is someone that they need well\nYou can do that would trade a opportunities as well and I just never felt that you know Sandy older sending company we're aggressive enough are creative enough with some of these deals and\nSure innovations versions championship cybersecurity\nJoins secure renovations for cocktails and conversation with just moved on Baltimore's champion is limited reserve you today on structural renovations Facebook page\nW O R sports though with McCarthy on seven James W O R [noise]\nBack here in the sports so an eight hundred three two one zero Savage and the number it's quick call and\nWe'll hit a oddities with producer re Vinnie in Oakdale is there have any\n... let me read something by you\nMean and that's the bottom feeders right now I've been a fan all my life why not go all in\nAnd see if they can get a ... year to play right field but Chu ... any moment center conform to left you got good pitching gotta stop or in the ... and you know you get this Bangor at first base um keep but\nUh what's his name uh\nUh keep the other first baby I mean what do you think is that too far fetched\nI well I personally Machado to Harper I think but John is a better fit for the ... and he demanded shortstop you could move a amid Rosario for a year or two in al ultimately Machado is your third baseman down the line I I think that he fits in better than Harper but\nI yeah I I didn't like what I saw from a ... if the bottom line is when you have that time but I I don't like a dirty player and seeing that every day uh but let's say you have an opportunity to ... I'm not going to say no I I Will say that much so\nI I I if I make it a big move and one of those too much out or will be my guy not Harper\nAlright I looked at him in a couple of big spots a couple of days ago and you know he's a he's a numbers dial up his numbers um I just didn't like what I saw in the playoffs\nYeah I I agree I didn't like what I saw from Harvard down the stretch where they play the game in Washington this year and\nA ... ... at one point apathetic because he's not running anything out when he had to fly ball in the air but they also angry and ... and swinging the bat in the air or at least going down the line never let go of the battles ... alone at bats I I just I don't understand what's going on a with Bryce Harper at the end of this year\nOr so I understand are losing and and maybe it's fairly new for him as is they've been a perennial contender but I didn't like what I saw from either of those guys\nAre over the uh the course of the latter stages of this year\nOr both of those guys are dream right now I Will tell you you know they talked about sustainable success today and that's not going all in sustainable successes\nYou know China not half bad money and dead money or you know a year after year and the Mets even though they haven't gone with too many big contracts or they've certainly had some of that over the years with David right with you on assessed but as in the injuries that those guys have suffered in yeah some of it you get back and insurance but\nAre not all that so uh you know it's going to take some convincing no doubt for ... bandwagon into tell ownership to go out and and hunt for a man and Machado Bryce Harper type\nA bowl say they're confident um competition in the ... the the Phillies are signing one of those two guys village is going to go all in this off season and that is a ... it's right at that spot\nThey have a lot of money to spend more than the Mets have to spend a you know coming into this off season so you know you want to keep away a well sometimes it's going to get real interesting I'll take a\nQuick break come back with oddities with producer ray and then if you miss the press conference earlier Bernie bandwagon and why that for you before we wrap up at nine o'clock sports people currently on the voice of New York seven ten W O R\nBacking the W O R sports with McCarthy\nEvery night and the eight o'clock hour had some of the the other stories and and the sports news and we got producer a in here ... fresh off the trip to buffalo to seize patriots stop all over the bills yesterday a license plate we're waiting a little while I was like nine six and the second I have nine did not expect that\nLittle little bit of trouble couldn't score I miss field goal by ...\nThe crowd was really into it because the halftime ceremony for Thurmond Thomas was was sensational how they did it they turn the lights off everybody held their cell phones up and they just have spotlights on the stage\nUh you know a more of leaving Kelly where they're marvelous marvel looks still looks very very good for his age Jim Kelly boy he uh he's he's fighting the good fight he looks a\nLot of people kind of kind of painting like you know how many times we going to see him coming around more ... what everybody out there is such a legend the NFL but what a what a great night to be there and again\nWhen it came back and won and then I got to the post game party after we had a good time with the with the bills players may be partying with the bills player the ... or ... or the tackle for the bills\nA he's a ... graduate and my buddy ... was\nHappy enough to get some passes and we uh we spent time after the game of pictures great time at a fun time nice maybe the party and after the loss you know what it's like I say the party 'cause there's no alcohol in that but this food and they're all the families come in so you know your kids taking picks like shady McCoy was walking around taking pictures of little kids\nYeah it's it's nice to see the human side of these guys after game ... walking around and I I don't know what I took all my patrons gear off on that and then right after three other guys patrons go walking around like really I mean I'm the guy that takes it off like yeah whatever [laughter] I got a tonight\nWith the end of the bills game or you know did you notice that there was a a another\nAnother item tossed on the field again I did notice the referee they'd put his hands on it ... it just looked up but there was a a a little toy thrown onto the field again the second year in a row that somebody is a\nIt's like a tradition in a ... game yeah twice yes it's been multiple years now that this has been a a thing up there\nSo I thought that but uh it was pretty interesting but that leads to a great story here right in the New York post today about a a\nA this was in the posted a professional dominate tricks which I didn't know it was really a professional thing or\nA claims to have a ... a high roster of a power judges and all those people are well but she was a beaten abound with duct tape and then they stole all her four thousand dollars of toys so I Wonder if any of those made it up to the Buffalo Bills game last night and that's maybe where they got the ...\nAnd it's a place you could go\nFour thousand dollars worth of [laughter]\nThat's a that's quite right ... ... they're a\nLittle more bills theme stuff theory remember last a couple of weeks ago who was it a retired half time\nOf the game what was it was it a volunteer David retired half the time of that game well ah east Strasburg university their head coach weighs four seconds left in a game called a timeout which was the fourth time out so it was a penalty he said I'm retiring and he walked off the field and drove away and that's how my coach too and\nHe noticed the officially said sir I'm going to call for time out I Know that it's illegal you're going to penalize it but it's okay I Am retiring he uh did it with four seconds they blew the whistle the kids came in and I told them when I was doing and east Strasburg coach headed out the door and the coach was a I don't know but to fifty three seasons with the team Seventy five years\nAhead of head coach and again a young guy you know you do that the younger they are never coaching a grand\nEver and it's pretty much there are a musical it real quick here I'll you know the sun\nSo you're glad I add one Seventy three years old or do you know who Paris dealing is she's a twenty four year old model in the best known a with a Instagram photos up there and she puts his his around for a very pretty girl uh\nI like my coffee how I like my men rich and smooth then gives us some nice little pictures\nHere of uh Paris deal and who is the latest American Pie for Mr\nDon McLean your thoughts ... ... at Seventy three she's twenty four [laughter] it's a\nVery quickly before we go it is political season and we got a great one here a big vote came in here you know David Price or the or for the for the for the red Sox he got one vote for district attorney in Massachusetts not\n... but he wasn't getting out of three months ago gosh I'm not a producer ray with the oddities will take a quick break ... bandwagon in earlier today sports down with people car they on the voice in New York seven ten W are\nStill putting off a building that dream\nIll with whatever it is we are going to rage their ... well you couldn't rage away as long as it's not against me I don't really care I'm going to be so mad at Republicans that they don't go out and vote well I have very\nVery sad that we can cite she's already hooked on the drapes she got this thing covered\nUm I'm not so sure I'd want one of the unknown factor is the ... the greatest hope for Republicans in my opinion is that\nIt absolutely there is an unknown Trump factor\nAll bets are off 'cause I don't think Trump supporters of the type of people are going to answer anybody's call for any poll ever I don't I've been on calls me I never get called for a poll\nAnd polls you know I look at them I Know a conventional wisdom is I read real clear politics every day you know Nate Silver as as an eighty five percent Democrats take the house\nUh but I also know that they got it wrong in two thousand for two thousand and fourteen and two thousand and sixteen and not the only did they get it wrong they did it in a colossal spectacular way\nSo I'm just saying to the American people don't be swayed by polls don't be dispirited if you think you can't win assume that you're behind and go out there on the field that's why we play the game\nAnd you know sometimes your favorite team wins and sometimes your favorite team loses I didn't particularly enjoy election nights and two thousand and eight yeah\nBecause you can't dwell you cannot complain if you don't vote so go out and vote I Can't complain because I'm basically not talking about you everybody knows you vote\nHas nothing to do with the voting I got older we can do is informed people\nHas everything to do with the voting no it has everything to do with every but my my vote is meaningless in New York for the most part\nNow we know we're in a blue state so we do the best we can do boating I don't know about every year we do our civic duty and but I Am saying look look at where it's important look at what states presidents do whatever they he's not doing a state that Lebanon rally blitz\nCalifornia Florida Iowa Ohio we all need you go\nDo when you know at the end for example we sucked up Obama for eight years it wasn't good for the country you know what we would suck up a Nancy Pelosi as speaker one more time but I'd rather not I'd rather keep the

you know he has to be up on how every organization in baseball talks the game\nAnd what they are looking for and what their needs are and not only\nTalk of a general managers of run up as people around the sport but ownership ... as well and getting an idea of what\nThe people at the top of the chain are looking for for their respective franchises\nAnd we've been focused a lot on how you know Brody bandwagon and the information they all have on his players his clients and obviously yes that's certainly a factor and it's something that\nCan be advantageous uh as long as the players roll with it and and that kind of thing and we we get the advantages that could be there but I I think it goes beyond that as you know sit back and thinking about what Jeff said that you know one of the people that he asks about you know who the top young decorative and the game you dig broadly bandwagon\nThat kind of information and and the agents or some of the information brokers or throughout the game as well and you gotta\nSome fascinating conversations are being in that position just talked in the game talking baseball and doing it with thirty organizations and you\nBetter know how they view the game what they value and\nYou have some inside it up from the players who are within these teams up early bandwagon talked a lot about culture yesterday and what he wants to bring and yeah I tend to\nDismiss that the time okay everybody wants to bring culture right it's one of those\nBuzzwords we heard last year it make a cow and you hear all the time\nBut it's got to be a little different coming from someone with his background because he he knows when players are rolling their eyes at something like you know David Martinez bringing in the camels last year at spring training with the national that the kind of thing\nThat actually motivates anybody or are you are rolling are guys rolling their eyes that that uh you know broadly bandwagon in ... one of his clients he probably would know and have an idea that you can't be maybe don't be goofy for the sake of being goofy and maybe\nA you know players perverse up straight ahead unless all players are different but you have an idea of what\nTeams are going about it the right way or the Boston Red Sox you know one thing that they've been able to build there\nIs that like grinders mentality they had it in twenty Thirteen and Ulysses guys talk and they all felt like they had it again this year though they had some stars on that world championship team JD Martinez in ... put up\nAnd be ... caliber season said they were both phenomenal\nBut\nThen when you listen to the guys are well how tight we are and um you know a lot about that that grinding aspect of it and you\nMay see players like Steve Pearce brought into that theme he goes off in the postseason Jackie Bradley junior all role player really for the red Sox but he's capable of having some huge moments in the postseason I tend to think hey when you're winning everybody loves each other right\nWhen the Mets were Lebanon one this year are you talk to any player on the Mets damn hey we're tight you know this is we are great chemistry this is why we went in and this is\nAll part of it and that's what you hear well that didn't suddenly go way game number Thirteen\nIt just it with you when you're winning and everybody likes each other everybody's happy everybody's in a good mood and then it goes away as soon as you start losing you can't be talking about chemistry at the team is losing eight out of every ten games you know\nBut a burly bandwagon and I think would have a little more perspective of what players are looking for from their teams then\nAgain your average executive\nWho you know probably doesn't have a whole lot of intimate conversations with ah with players over the years and it's more data driven and less\nA well listen you know I Try not to be one of these you know jump off the ledge kind of things scenario Mets fan but I hit my real fundamental problem number one you know\nIf the Mets set out a track record I we're comparing apples to oranges here you take like so someone like the patriots and ... of a habit in the history a track record of finding diamonds in the rough and turning them into gold I graduate so do I do have a best quarterback it all is Thirty Years' play but then that helps\nSure they'll get the benefit of the doubt they don't deserve it over based on the last few years\nExactly so you have high loom who's everything ... aren't\nPerfect that made a perfect fit everything from the age the mindset the intelligence and occasionally like like like Brody kind of talk is chief kind of sweet talk the will ponds because of his relationship with them into the job sort of like the way\nPhil Jackson did within the next now Phil Jackson had a track are going to be a successful coach I get it but\nI mean it goes well he's not going to do is work from Montana and and basically just to take his check or you know that's not going to be the case Brody is the foreign everyone will ...\nAs a but but me I mean look at it just for a little logic comments that standpoint shuttling who is banned in the trenches as we understand players development skill another problem you're talking about Vegas I Want to hear that I Want to hear if he wants to move this team back into the eastern time zone because they have that team in an environment where you really\nDid that they're going to be a in Syracuse this upcoming year and a twenty five years out\nYep I okay I I was younger I wasn't sure about that\nYeah that that was pre salt they had that problem um you know figured out last off season\nThey announced it by early life okay okay okay so I missed that later but I mean again I resigned\nLittle was ever saying that baseball is today that successful teams the Astros you know\nNo I agree I agree and and and the I got I got hit the right time to be nuts yeah ... and thanks for the\nCall Steve I I Would have preferred blowing a straight up I Would have preferred bloom I liked his background but I\nIt was close with Brody bandwagon I think it's interesting I don't mind the Mets again that they're taking a chance\nIf you hire high and boom you're assuming that he's the brains behind a lot of what Tampa Bay has done\nA you're also a hoping that he translates to New York he's got to be able to speak for the franchise right with these crises come up all the time the GM's got to be the one who talked about it I'm telling you ... bandwagon ... can be comfortable in those situations\nAnd yeah that's we talk and part of it we talk on the ... we talk in the media that's part of the jobs we talking the bands a little bit hey I got it it's under control that's something that you need sometimes\nEspecially with the Mets and the way that things have gone down in in recent years and even not so a recent years but this franchise\nUm and and as I talked about a little bit in the open to a\nYou know bandwagon it's going to bring some really different perspectives I think in having he's an opportunity to pick the brain of people all across major league baseball\nI think that is a potential advantage and it's got to take you got to be able to take all that information and use it in a way that it's going to be beneficial but that's a lot that he potentially\nA has in his favor there and you know again\nI I Would have loved bloom and he made a lot of sense checked out a lot of the boxes that you're looking for but that doesn't mean that the Mets necessarily gone wrong\nAnd\nYou know a lot of this is gonna be see how it plays out and we'll talk with my ... the New York post I was impressed with ah what bloom artsy me one bandwagon and brought to the table yesterday\nAnd was he a you know when he does he think that first task is really going to be promoting bandwagon in here is the or\nThe Mets GM once that introductory part is over as it is now a we'll take more of your calls coming up a little later in the show as well eight hundred three two one zero seven ten it's sports on will be McCarthy ... voice in New York ... W O R [noise]\nUh there was no expectation to compete for a couple of years and sometimes it's hard to get off the good starts as it got bad starch and there was all part of the process to there's going to be forty that only because uh the Mets and she has had made it very clearly that uh they intend to the next year so I guess we'll see right away\nHe has the courage to put them in that position\nAnd then he said a winning soon winning later and that's what the Mets are expecting to do with him at the controls here as we chat with Michael Carl or the New York post your big basketball guys while you're covering the New York Knicks\nTonight um what do you make of what's happening there at the garden these days not pretty but it's kind of fun to watch\nWhat I'm fascinated by it because for years for decades every\n... every every Saturday followed team in New York has been told that even even if they feel differently that where you can't build a New York because the parents and you know we have a couple of teams that are go is that now I think the giants are funny you can really they may have to do that\nKind of go through the last couple of years you know really profoundly tried to rebuild what they are and that's where the next or doing look I mean I I don't think it comes to the guards anytime this year\nWith the expectation you have really no memorable results even if they wanted to get what you want to see is how they play together but you want to see each other as politicians to do what you want to see how this bill labels build a ... a punch small victories and how\nLong ago she said well you know you're now you're losing streaks that are going to be connected by ... their glee but if you're willing to buy in to the idea of illegal\nThen that's what you're going to get and it's going to be fulfilling on certain level if if if you say that because they have to do is rebuild which they wash history political Twenty years knew it was time and it was a lifetime because you're you're talking about a time eastern tell us where\nThey're nowhere close to the Celtics were the Sixers are the raptors can even three and so what's the point of trying to teach you know to to to not fully golden and maybe get set in the dish said would you know that'll be a couple of games and the playoffs that's it and then you might as well\nBeing for the long haul plays along game as they say is poker is just share that those\n... exhausted every avenue down to try not to rebuild over the last few decades and a mind as well give the actual rebuild a shot here and and quickly I I don't know how much you've really a dive into this yet by local college you starting up as soon as next week it is there anybody in particular that you're excited to see this year\n[noise] [noise] well they found out she has as its most talented roster says since ... coach so you know I think that the other party is finally over I think that there's real expectations\nAre on the campus there I think that that that Chris Stapleton deliver you know certainly a change that's that that's going to be the conversation I was watching Sunday I Would suggest that it's time for them to actually make that leap and playing the biggies that generally catch by sixty to\nA a a species of fish for college with a five hundred record you're probably going to get in to the to the told me they'll say jobs and had which we call the most challenging them they record but I mean he plays a Big East will allow you to get there I like to see that because I mean ... ... to see progress I just think you\nKnow the Christian that as bad a job sometimes people that have blamed for it it's hard to watch just because the tell when there\nIs you know they have the best player in the league what else is according to the prosecutors and it has you know she has five really good players that they can play at any time and and that's really important place so it was all over the\nLast ... players but now I'm On the ... that was did it all over it until I see it differently but [noise] um they will have today after the second or third after better than Jay and you're there you go to the butler that's better than more cat can they do that I think that certainly the rich\nBy the very least be better than the next nets in our hockey teams around here and we can all get behind something in what might be a a a relatively dark winter in New York sports but my my car oh the New York post always tells it like it is in a way a lot of money on my thank you\nAll talk ... thanks very near\nAnd as far as ... goes it's always more fun around here and went and St john's is good and uh obviously a lot of other talented teams in the area as well be checking in with their head coaches over the course the next week or sell gets ready for college who sees and\nUh and so we'll be doing that here in the sports zone\nI'm Mr breaking news while we're talking to Mike and that is that the uh University of Maryland has now fired their head football coach DJ Dirk in a it's a huge story and we'll we'll get into it give it a clip notes version of it a a little bit later on in the show a\nBut certainly wanted to pass that along have you been following that story after a player died a from\nOver ... exertion a training for the football team this past\nWinter or in you know real quick or the ... they recommended it at Marilyn that they allowed to work and to continue the board of regents recommended that earlier this week\nAnd some of the players walked out of a meeting he had with the team to do is ah uproar at the university\nOr some protests in today a university making the decision to fire a DJ Dirk and as their head football coach oh he takes Metcalfe coming up we'll get into our candy and NFL team power rankings looking forward to that tonight\nA and a much more eight hundred three two one zero seven ten it's a sport sound with McCarthy on the voice of New York ... double you all are\nThe murder of a [noise]\nLot cause a reaction to the general manager ... for the Mets yesterday Bernie bandwagon I'm becoming the thirteenth GM and Mets history\nRainwater berries pumped up about what's up right\nI'd love to hire a bottom line is an outsider recycled GM's fire my aunt is they believe and this guy and I think they're going to give them they're going to raise the budget because I think they believe in his guide to lead them you know\nMommy's going to win or a year after year like he talked about yesterday he's going to need some extra resources to work with especially the the next few years coming up\nI get you're going to get it I ah I just said that his father hasn't been there six sided in years ... so that tells you stop right there you know\n... ... ... that kind of the blind faith that you hope that that is going to be part of the situation here and thanks for the call re um because within the Mets are going to be a\nChampionship contender next season they makes a big moves are based off season and they're not shedding a ton of salary they stop season\nOr they're gonna have to be able to up that payroll in order to add on to this team what needs to be added they needed entire both and they need\nA catcher as we talked about my ... I think they need a center fielder that's where uh they should be you know looking to get things done as far as the outfield is concerned so and you want to fill all those spots and the ball and it's not just one closer and they need like three guys there so\nUh that's that's a lot of work in at the very least a lot of creativity if you can make some trades and and moved to pieces around and and hopefully we see that from bandwagon and that is something in recent years I don't think the Mets ban is creative and\nUh this is a a whole new mindset coming in and out two or three two one zero seven than the number our candy slide Sanibel power rankings coming up right now and is upstate\nIs the best commercials and the second best candy on our list tonight and only makes said the Kansas City chiefs are they have been obviously phenomenal if you're a former match pitcher pat ... son\nCalling the shots their quarterback and just weapon after weapon after weapon just is a really good Snickers this flavor after flavor right you got the chocolate the camera Melba nuts you got all of it in a Snickers wonderful Halloween treat and again one that\nWhen it's sitting there in the bowl way they\nProduce some I don't like anything with nuts I'm like you're going to kill me yeah you're you're you're allowed to wear my bottom to\nNo good for this ... at all a next up when you need a moment to ... you know\nThe saints they don't have many moments that impressive Sunday night when I got the Minnesota Vikings\nThey can use the moment last year when you know they can't defend a long pass plays those ties is expiring but uh otherwise St getting it done and we know the ... you get the two bars get it done well for the state's mark Ingram Alva Kamara guys get it done\nAnd I I like to say it's All right now or the old old reliable next\nBy it's boring\nIt's never exciting when you get to her she is but it's there every year it's always solid you could always go to it as far as the patriots just old reliable consisted they're always there that much drug a little bit of top and people in Boston\nGrown because two losses unacceptable the first about the disease even though they do it every single year and a rip off ten wins in a row and the patriots well on their way at this moment\nBy the way a today as it went to the doctor and I grew up in the ... the White House to house trick or treating but now I live in a story in Queens\nAnd it's very different the kids they trick or treat to the stores and they basically to a store to store as a kid to run into the uh you know the the I doctor office all day a trick or treating their glow in the dark Hershey's\nThat is a that is a new thing I was not aware of until today I don't get the point of it just\nDelicious chocolate what do you need to glow in the dark for I don't know but if you if you're in the dark and onwards after you eat or do you go in the dark has been that would be cool\nIt's got radioactive stuff in it I don't know yeah\nIt makes my stomach started glowing you have to read it that's great I I don't see the\nPoint and it's like it's like The Simpsons Sago her she's as the patriots next up [laughter]\nKick ass great Aaron Rodgers has great\nWhat's around around it isn't so great you know you get the crunch right and the chocolate is good but it's not a whole lot else going on it's like a Snickers you get all these different flavors and all these things happening uh the the kick cats kind of a a one\nNote treat and that's the way the Packers were looking these days I find that to be sitting at the moment\nI find that kind of a hollow candy especially the outer chocolate which is great like Aaron Rodgers middle thinking\nWhich is the rest of the matter just don't eat it like John Carlos ... where he just takes a bite out of the four bars that heritage it'd be a crime you have to split it apart All right next door [noise]\nSorry I was no way\nNo justice diverts the losing to stay in this past weekend\nThe Chicago Bears and the reason I have them as the Milky Way\nIs because of the Milky Way is just a Snickers without the nuts and the bears are the shapes without a quarterback that's what the bears are ... okay you can run for some first down pretty can't hit anybody is what made Sundays laws for the jets so frustrating\nAnd then if you take it at the next level up three musketeers is basically a Milky Way without the camera mail\nAnd I couldn't wait we didn't dig that deep to find a team for that but basically it goes Snickers Milky Way you lose the nuts then down at three musketeers you lose the ...\nMilky Way midnight in that because that's one of my favorite\nWell then you're now you're going off the grid ear and screwing the whole thing up I'm Sorry Pete a next up very controversial\nChoice and that is the candy corn\nI loved candy corn I guess I'm the only won the world the Internet has decided they'd all I can go nobody liked candy corn anymore what\nIs wrong with people it tastes like wack wack it is like a delicious sweet treat that is totally unique from anybody anything else I used to eat these all year long I Love candy corn you go in\nThe pharmacies they've got the candy corn sitting there for months it is a trench there you go in there you get it real dirt cheap tomorrow and you just store it you have ten pieces of the day\nYour life will turn out okay I'm telling you you're done just love it ... your debt is will definitely love it or the chargers team put her I don't like the charges like other people do they seem to be the team that people argue about the Moses dean good is it not dumb put down as the candy corn or next up\nNext to Sara Sara cuts off\nIt it takes a lot of likes to be the New York jets in San ... Arnold takes a lotta licks of it is the\nJets or maybe not as much as Eli but\nAh the jets that they're that fits the pop to me\nThey had the quarterback excited about that the lollipop part of it is good but then in the end you end up biting into it you got Horton lollipop stuck in your teeth all of a sudden the Tootsie Roll part of it gets in there it doesn't taste as good as a real Tootsie Roll when it's at the end of the pop\nThe whole thing just becomes a mess in the end and that's that's about where the jets are right now\nAnd I I like a regular Tootsie Roll but you're right the Tutsi pop at the end is not good and then that's what the jets are\nNow start hitting the grand finale here are ah are are less\nCandy with an advertisement behind it\n[laughter]\n[noise] I Know I did it advertised\nSmarties I'd never heard that before I Googled\nAnd they're terrible these these were always the last candies left in the ... was a bunch of roles of smarties a and they are they are the raiders to me just their their leftovers\nAh they traded everybody else away everybody that mattered on that team away except for their quarterback car Gordon's mess I I you know we know where the writers are they are not good there the smarties there'll be just be sitting there for years and nobody's going to touch him until next Halloween rolls around then you give them out to somebody else\nAnd John ... thinks he's a smart he does not\nKnow not to not to this degree got nine more years to prove that he could do though\nUm [noise] I remember going around as a kid and every once in a while you\nGet to a house I don't know they ran out of candy or what was going on you get like a bag of pennies near you get like five pennies it affects people give change that's like the bills\nAnd has no idea what you're doing you don't understand the holiday you're trying to make things up as you go along here that\nThat is the Buffalo Bills of houses the house that gives away a bag\nOf pennies even Nichols a quarter are I'll take a quarter and fifty cent piece is really good but the ... now you you don't get with the holiday is all about\nI think today's equivalents or that we were talking before his raisins something healthy paintings raisins all the same\nRaises no good and it's not the day for raisins a house that ran out of candy yeah that's the house you don't want to be either just straight up you don't have anything you're turning off the lights pretending you're not home kids know your home cars in the driveway that's the forty niners they gave fall so\n... gonna be the man he gets hurt where they now middle where lights off trying to pretend they're not home we know where you you're in the basement watching TV uh and then finally the worst candy you get really\nThis is the one that everybody fears this is why your mom has to go through all your stuff and start throwing out those candies looks suspicious the apple with a razor blade and nobody wants that one you know a team that is [laughter]\nThat's the giants baby you bite into the giants right now it is not a pleasant experience I don't I give anybody any ideas but the thing that's dogged about it\nI guess ... the one that put the razor blade in the apple or I I don't know\n... got some friends with a police force there making sure he's in a a good situation but every week it gets worse for the giants so that that's about where they are uh at this point in the seasons ago our candy slash\nNFL power rankings that went okay I liked it\nReaches peanut butter cup a number one what is your number one if it's not a peanut butter\nCup oh I Love her she's oh you mean ... all day I'm really the whole bar every time it is when I looked like\nIt's an all day treat I get it but it's still for a little ... and it's delicious a eight hundred three two one zero seven ten the number we talked Smith will take some more ...\n... ... or so to me [laughter] off season they started coming up and it's almost like the giants and all it is that what the ... are\nFor it to rebuild and he said he yesterday a road he said yesterday they're not going to rebuild a cop out so it made its licking other hear what you're Cuban he lies basically J. lo got and you know that they're going to let me\nGet attached to it and you're totally then it got to go out there man shot him that's real reason why can't I mean you're in a lot of money okay or you're still you're still like eleven in that range\nIs the real new do enough for you they they pull up that kind of trade for a franchise type catcher\nBut here's the thing though here's the thing though ...\nIt's just lie to me it's up to do that because if you if you get really looked out and you're getting rid of any\nPlots that area or that that got that they're going to have anything to keep that that's why I get to play this year when you don't want to do that to be honest with you if I have a shot at our check with them all\nBut I don't I gotta I gotta go to a child I don't think that just because of what they have right now which is the fed I don't care what he did it in seven games Dodger games in the\n... and you saw a lot of that a lot of dirty plays for no reason when he was under the microscope which was I don't like it but I'll get over it if he's going to hit thirty plus homes for the Mets play that\nBaseball is you could be glad to get your thirty or was it a hundred RPI I don't really care about NBA we all\nWell and they found people care people care how you go about it we talked about sex but it's nonstop for years uh in part because of that\nWell to me and and I don't want to take up your time it really comes out to the you know if you want to make a splash on your show this guy that you mean the Mets fans if they lose but shout out to another team\nI don't see them let's make a push to hit it sure they don't use that noise picture that they want to see that being active and these guys because there's no reason why they should\nThey are ... and ... and ... bandwagon and said he as you and ask about the top free agents the Mets would be there and we expect to\nBe an on every body you gotta live up to that and yeah so a lot of it comes from ownership um but I I I Would think a former agent and it's going to believe in some star power he's going to know what that brings to a team um\nAnd yeah it's ... Harper at the top ... the guy that would obviously excite the fan base I think we'll move to would\nI we talk about what they gave up and that kind of deal but he would excite the fan base I'm not sure there's another player available this off season now would inspire a people and Mets fans in that way I think this past offseason\nIt didn't inspire Mets fans it wasn't until they started a Lebanon one that people really started to to jump on and believe in what they were seeing a little bit and that's something fans can be even more resistant this year after two straight losing seasons to\nYou know jumping let their guard down and and think this team's going to be ready to roll even with some of the things that they go right the second half last year so uh yeah they they got they have work to do there's no doubt it I don't think it has to be the number one Machado guy but you better make some\nBig goal you know be plus moves at a number of different positions or to get people excited doesn't have to be the eight plus moved necessarily a but a ... you know a ... a a big time center fielder you know like a Jay Paul you you better do some things that I'm\nExcite people in that kind of way of the off season that say the brewers said as bad as long as you take that I had and the yellow Cain those kind of ... a plus superstars within the game but they built into that and a lot of boys in Milwaukee last year I Will chat\nOr coming up with bleach reports Danny nobler it take more of your calls after that it's a sports car the on the voice of New York seven ten W O R\nC's shark tank entrepreneur Robert Herschel back and HDTVs how slippery ... will be live in for a breakthrough will somehow take just four hours out of your life\nIn this free event they learned from these experts to take advantage of key areas of growth in twenty Nineteen out or profit using emerging trends in social media and online sales and how to protect yourself from the real estate market you can also get to work\nWith some of the nation's biggest names in real estate and entrepreneurship view leave December with new connections and wealth financing ideas cold [noise]\nNow here in the W O R sport no\nI've been talking about the Mets yesterday introducing Brody bandwagon into the fan base to the media as a they had the big introduction and now he's the GM the thirteenth and the history of the franchise\nAnd we welcome on right now daddy noble or was there covering that as a national perspective writing for bleacher report into Danny how you doing or I've got\nA big oh it's good talking to you what's your favorite Halloween candy and let me have you with a toughie right about that [laughter]\nThat's a that's a that's a tough question you could possibly be I don't know I'm too old I don't remember\nI remember what it used to get for Halloween what am I Can't say a general you you you go to the pharmacy tomorrow what do you what are you grab that you know I'm\nNot that big on candy I'm not a big candy guy I Am sorry to disappoint\nWaiting beer like what are they asking her yeah yeah definitely definitely I'll take I'll take a beer okay I I\nDefinitely I think a beer over most of the candy I can find that the ...
