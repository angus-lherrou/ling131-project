we're the radio home of Rutgers football or as we All right over there at the ball so we have to go there we could we could do in how how bad is it out\nIf I like I yeah because you know it's it's no hair off your back you just say oh well you know what we could jump\nKris asked shot every Friday so I've been I've been up on it and we used to coach flood on the show here but I don't\nI don't have the background of truly living and dying uh with with all that's happening there\nLet's just say football season has not started off very well on Saturdays or Sundays to be quite honest with ... and look I was very optimistic this year about this team I mean I was insane Rose Bowl but I didn't think of it it was out of the realm of possibility for them to win six ... and go to a ball game I thought that that would have been ... years three of the program of you know Chris Bosh\nI thought that that was the next step and unfortunately when you've already had some of these winnable games go by and in a couple of them you weren't even competitive\nTo say that uh it's disappointing would be an understatement how jarring was it to see a a couple of weeks ago at buffalo is in Grand it's not a big program it's\nA big draw right but it wasn't there weren't a whole lot of people in the crowd a lot of people were leaving at half time\nAnd they have an apathy set in around a program that has been well supported over the years\nIt's tough and you know it's funny a lot of people come up to me all the time because they know I went to school I'm a fan and everything and you know the latest disappointing results they come up to you and kind of just say boy\nDon't you think that they were they regret going to the Big Ten yeah remember this is they're not even losing a Big Ten teams we prior to last week you're getting paid by buffalo you're going to be cans in for crying out loud\nAnd no I still think overall that was the right to I mean it's a no brainer when you think about number one the financial ramifications what it means for your school I mean the Big Ten is as prestigious conferences you have across the country so from that standpoint it's a no brainer any hope that it opens up better doors for you in terms of recruiting down the line and so on and so forth\nBut if you are a program which is trying to get its feet underneath them and you are trying to install a new culture and all this stuff is nightmarish to be able to do it in that conference because think about those teams are playing each and every year there's no escaping it\nNow I was in Chicago a couple of years ago I ended up in Michigan bar and they were playing Rutgers and Everytime Michigan was laid off and on and they just play it on a loop the whole night it was a\nAnd they had them later this year and you know the funny part about it so like I said you know you looked at the schedule and you try to identify six wins before it started because at the very end of the schedule the last four games I forgot what the order is but\nThat's the gauntlet Wisconsin Michigan Michigan State Penn State so if you thought that the Kansas and the buffalo games were bad wait till November gets your pate\nBrace yourself can be fun coaches show winter is coming [laughter]\nWhy and what they've gotten over the jets the giants it would appear earlier than we were hoping as\nWell if you were to be optimistic about either of these teams find a way back into the mix give us some hope for this football season Dan who does it rest with\nI still think overall that there is more optimism and maybe at least a better chance to do some damage in twenty eight teams with the giants\nThan it is with the jets because the jets look they're far from a finished product right now this is a team that still trying to find its way take that next step you're doing it to develop a rookie quarterback ... just on the jets to quickly at the end of this year\nApart from the wins and losses and everybody would like to win don't get me wrong you want to want as many games as possible but at the end of the year you were ... you want to be able to say you know what we got our starting quarterback we've got our future he's the goods and then you take whatever the winds lost his record is and you say we're going to take that into what's the next year will be better\nGiants is a window team you're supposed to win obviously drifted sake one Barclay spent all that money in the off season and then it ceased\nTo be real who's running away with it nobody nobody is running away but nobody will run away with it so that's\nWhy yes you're one in three yes you're off to a top start and this was kind of be expected because you looked at that giant scheduled for the season started there were some difficult games not going to get any easier next week when you're going to Carolina\nOff by come up to play Philadelphia not easy go down to Atlanta even though they got all kinds of problems that still not a a a fun place to play so it was going to be challenging first half of the season for them you want to be able to at least get to the midway point I think if you're the giants\nWith ... with at least three four wins to be able to salvage something in the second half that's gonna be tough\nYou know they can be three and four three and five the first half that might be\nEnough as you mentioned how top heavy the schedule is one thing I Do worry about with the giants those we saw this team self destruct\nIn some ways last year and I understand a law that was put on Ben ... do you get off the the kind of start where you have to win ... games to go on a run this this team stay together and keep it together and the the way that they need I think\nThat's going to be incumbent of course upon patch Irma's had\nChristian look we're still learning about him I Know that he had a cup of coffee of course there in in Cleveland coach and the team and he Kimberly gauge a lot from that it was still a long time ago\nYou know it's going to be those trials and tribulations adversity that is when you learn about not only your coach but the players you have not lock them do I think that if they do go through some lean weeks it's going to self destruct like it did last year no I don't think so that was a disaster because I think that\nTo a man I still think the guys in this locker room have respect for ... I don't think they had respect for ... for a band Mac and do it takes years to lose it\nAnd the way the ... laws that typically don't come in\nWithin four games you're losing your team or anything like that yeah that honeymoon period where the guys would cut you a break for a little while\nAnd that was a guy went to the playoffs in his first year yeah I mean that's that's why sometimes these things can be fickle you know you get you catch lightning in a bottle the right time they won their double digits games and it it seemed like everything begins to go downhill with them with the boat trip\nThe boat trip before the playoff game and I had the time I did not blame that party as the reason why they lost the Packers but it's still a bad optic and now in hindsight it looks even worse so from that moment on the bench Mac do train just can went completely off the rails\nTo show you as much as young players especially think hey this is going to be my career I'm going to be in it every year I we were talking about David right before when in the division and two thousand six do you think every year is going to be like it it's not the way it goes you can't take anything\nFor granted especially in the NFL were parity reigned Supreme when is your lawyers are short careers are short right now so ah again eight under three two one zero Savage\nAnd the number eight hundred three two one zero seven than a will be deep diving into the Mets and the eight o'clock hour an hour and we got you covered Anthony to come out MLD dot com Tim Haley of Newsday will be with us and we'll a jump into the jets here at thirty one twelve laws the jaguars yesterday is Todd Bowles in over his head at this point\nUh with gang green a we're hanging with ... right now and is up to\nNew York says do fossil fuels rated number one seven\nTen W O R voice of New York and\nAnd we've got Seventy two degrees or seven o'clock that evening I'm just making the FBI\nSomething is wrong there and you know when you see a guy like Jimmy Johnson getting paid Seventy two million dollars to be a shutdown corner even though I Know that that term has kind of outdated now in the national football league 'cause corners can't even play defense and use their hands anymore God Forbid\nBut when he's getting toasted by Dante ...\nUnless you've got the Seventy two million dollars in his pocket and that's what's Wayne him down you expect a better effort\nBy um does Abby didn't have a dumb game breaking penalty for a second stereo dumbest thing I've seen a what do you do with Jarvis land during the blame game and and that was really where it all started to go downhill their buster screen\nLong guide to look at this guy's a nickel bag and I I don't always supposed to be good in this lot can handle stimulated by play yesterday drip and the ... the strip and the ... every once in a well\nHe could do something and then you see them getting burned the penalty every time it's easy opponents throw it him I Know it's a nickel back in the ... the top spot but it gets it\nIt never seem to have similar dependable in that area\nWell teams do their homework right and teams are going to pick on the ... the inferior link there in the defense but right now I mean I I don't even think it's so much buster screen because you see teams picking on ... and you see teams obviously picking on terrain Johnson taking deep shots why not and you know they're getting killed with these underneath routes like you saw yesterday because\nThat's a Simon football more than anything else and you're talking about the mental ... and they and they harp on that you know ... ... ... Williams and by the way it's been fantastic he he's really he's been a fantastic signing\nIn our post game shows Greg bowling myself for the last two weeks he was our player with a game I mean that's unprecedented you know two weeks in a row is the player of the game but um\nThey got to get this thing figure it out they they really and truly do because if you are going to salvage anything from the season got three straight home games coming up you would think now would be the opportunity or else you could be looking at one in seven one in Maine and that's not what any Jeff\nAnd wants to see now I bought in got the season ticket when the jets drafted you embarked on board out so let me ask you a question when all was\nIt ... it was it Darnell yeah that made you just jump in with both feet and send 'em in\nAbsolutely hate my money now is that yeah ... my next day I got to be and I got I got to see that it's been forever since it seems had a a quarterback I Want to do ... for years and when I heard from him\nIs exactly what he was last year at USC he can extend plays he can throw some guys open\nBut he also every once in a while just as a blind spot doesn't see a defender didn't do any picks yesterday it'd be almost had one down near the goal line at one point yesterday why it didn't like yesterday he missed them open throws that I expect him to be able to hit down the field including big port down with Quincy uh ... what do you think of how Donald is\nProgressing here maybe a little too much mustard on the new will throw but Quincy\nAnd he's been great this year to hit him in the hands ... ... the NFL big moment in the game you want to come up with that catch 'em he over shot Robbie Anderson in a chance to take down the field and you know you'd be through that one probably five yards past Robbie ... Powell coming out of the backfield on one I think it was in the first half of the game over shot I'm a little bit\nAnd the thing about Sam is and and you brought up USC last year and this was one of the knocks on him coming out of school and into the draft into you know kind of one of the reasons why he should not be considered the consensus number one quarter back out of that crop\nIn the draft because of the turnovers in the interceptions last year what happened in southern Cal last season\nThey were compensating for guys that were lost on that I'll fence of line they were dealing with some injuries and what not\nAnd if you look at us off into blind right now I don't think that he has a cozy pocket in any way shape or form I don't think that it's probably going to be the offensive line that you see five years from now that he's playing behind hopefully in a jets uniform so I think that he's getting some of those bad habits again while also facing a lot stiffer competition it's the national football league\nThe game is a lot faster\nOne of the thing from yesterday though and this is you know we always ask these questions is is the coaching staff or this is the scheme conducive to helping him make place\nAnd the second half yesterday but you mentioned the fourth downplayed a Quincy you knew that was a fourth in one place for that was the third one on both of those instances like it kind of struck us was we're watching the game yesterday\nEmpty backfield among both those place now look\nI don't think you have to be a genius to figure it out but if I'm On the defensive side of the football and I see in the back and maybe even been five wide that I'm not even sure but if you have an empty backfield there with a rookie quarterback there's a better than good chance that they're not going to be running the football and that's certainly one that's fourth in one\nI mean in most cases that is a running down so if you're going to have no pain the backfield I'm On defense I'm known hey they're throwing the football let me ... years back and go after and get this guy and Jacksonville is as good at doing that than any team in the national football\nThey had an opportunity to burden them to the college credit out had an opportunity and but uh Donald unable to hit and as great as the ... the first\nGame against Detroit to come back from the ... six he is still seem for the most part unflappable maybe a ... a little jitters in that game against Cleveland in the second\nHalf but these are all part of the growing pains right and he's not turning the ball over left and right we have a say in his first game without a Saturn over which is a good sign but even in the Cleveland game was only later when he had to start force in the rye downright healed which I understand I I think he's still seeing some good things but\nReminded hits Twenty one years old he's\nGot a lot of learning and doing as Baker Mayfield hits the ground running and Cleveland score and forty two points in Oakland yesterday I think that's something that's important to remember when it comes to these guys\nYou know I ... and look you that first game was great you know the lines on that Monday Night and I remember just talking to the fans and the post game show and what not and how excited everybody was and boy this looks like the real deal and we're going to go sixteen and no and\nYou know you got to those games are few and far between when you have games like that where everything is clicking on all three phases off ... special teams that was a a juggernaut performance that night\nYou know a little bit of luck involved in a way but\nYou know you have to keep a proper perspective they're not going to win every game he's not going to play that good each and every week how you would just how you get better from the rough times those little things that separate the guys who well Timothy become grape to those that ultimately just disappear I mean you saw I mean people think about it Mark Sanchez right I mean who had more success than him the first couple of seasons\nYou all you saw was poised poised Mark Sanchez old rookie year unfairly was\nFirst to put first two years they went to the AFC Championship game and he played well in those playoff game and then there's big money games he wound up the Fox borrow out played Tom Brady\nYou know he he went to pay a beat Peyton Manning the week before that thing about that manning Brady and then he was the one that almost singlehandedly brought them back in the Pittsburgh game and the AFC Championship won the rest of the team didn't show up in the first half because they thought they want they thought they won the conference the week before by beating New England then you realize oh we have another game to play\nSo I mean you've thought that he was ultimately going to be the guy to lead them to the promised land and we know it didn't happen so that's why you have to digest everything you're seen from Donald the good the bad and then at the end of the year you'll be able to put at least a little bit more stock into what you have in him but I you know I'm with you I still think that all indications are he's going to be pretty good\nAnd I think it's important for the league too because if the jets do struggle here and the jets do decide hey maybe Todd Bowles isn't the right guy to lead us right if Sam Donald really shows the league that he has what it takes\nI think about how attractive that had coaching job can be and and this is where you're not judging Todd Bowles is the good enough to be an NFL head coach\nIf you have a great young quarterback in place now you have one of the top jobs in the sport and that's what you're looking at him as you're not looking to bring in the first time head coach and hope you head now you become the destination\nIt's a it's appealing I mean that's the most important component especially if you're an offensive coach clearly and that's why you know when we talked about where this team is on our fence right now you know you're trying to build something and it's not going to get there overnight well if you look at the most important component you have that at least you think you have that in the quarterback and\nIf they do make a change down the road yes and I look at the New York jets and say well you got that Arnold kid he's pretty good ya I'd like to work with him but let me also say this though\nAnd I don't know what the rest of the year or the off season is going to hold we got a place to twelve more games but I just want to dispel this whole rumor theory myth whatever you want to call it that you need to have an office of coach to be successful with a quarter back you know to make an office work he needs to dolphins of coach to be able to tutor him to mentor him\nBill both chicken and our fence of coaching and he's had a great deal of success in New England so would you want about what they're going through now but Mike Tomlin defensive coach ... about a nice little run together so I I ... and just because Tom Bowles as a defensive background doesn't mean that they can ultimately work well together\nBut you know you're going to have to start showing some results here and then the organization it's going to have a choice to make their at the end of the year\nTurn it and to me it's not just an authentic coach they would want to come in potentially ... and join up and be someone with a defensive background as well or if they they liked that position and that's your that's what it's all about you want to have\nThat head coach quarterback marriage I think most ... that the quarterback is in place for the long term the head coach even after all these years still big question mark and I think we'll see how they respond\nOn and I think most jet fans also when they look at the team where they are now with one in three I think that\nThey're not pointing the finger at the quarterback and say that's the reason why we're losing that's the reason why we've struggled the last few weeks you know I mean he's he has not been great but he's not been awful either so it's all part of the process I think of grooming young player and that's what you're saying\nI think they like some new ... I mean I always say this just as a fan right that if it's not going to be my team that's going to be playing for a championship and whatever sport it is I I like to see new blood you know I like to see the new team and they're a team that kind of came out of nowhere\nA ... it's refreshing it's fun and shoot I was rooting for the jaguars last year and they have the championship game but I think\nI think all jet fans were but I'm sure if the jaguars make the playoffs again come January ... jet fans are going to think long and hard about boy do I really want to support this team the ones that kind of wrote that in our face when we played them earlier in the you know ...\nYou'll support of against the patriots as by about it that's a fair but how about the patriots why do we have to do this\nEvery freaking near where\nI produced Iran's big patriots fan listen to him on Saturday he saying that the first of all the red Sox and embarrassing loss Saturday the penultimate day of the year to the Yankees is Dina one hundred plus games and then the patriots why or why they're wanting to\nWe have already said that we don't cry and cry me a river home I mean you're not going to be behind it\nAnd that's what God love right you you do but I mean enough is enough is enough by the way I and maybe right could shed some light on this too and I don't know if he's ever share this with you die hard fan right has tickets still goes to the games up there in Gillette Stadium do you know\nThe method of transportation that and that is involved in him going to these\nGames assumed he drove no no no no no this is this your lawyer with planes trains and automobiles how moving yes that's basically re every Sunday when the patriots I have a home game now why don't you share it with the rest of the listeners here about what you go through to support your team\nMy normal thing would be to drive out to the east and park my car take the ferry from Korean point to a New London my parents will pick me up there take me up to a to Providence now all of my parents live just outside of promise of talk it\nWill ah then get change in my gear they will drive me up drop me off about a quarter of a mile from ... it's a it's insane to get anywhere near that stadium I Walk in I come back I walked back to Dunkin Donuts after they picked me up again do to reverse back over the ferry back\nGet to my car and the only point and I'm back home at night I picture you like popping out of a crate as part of all that you know what if you like me do that I'll do that no video\nBut think about that for a second I mean look at and and I'm not sitting here questioning anybody's found them or anything but can you ever imagine\nOkay having that much passion for anything in life to do what he does just to go to a football game\nCar ferry car train bus\nI I mean everything just to watch a football game the last three hours and about his parents Panama and helping out the whole family get together they get to see me they don't get to see their son say do they go to the game with you or did you see my mom will be a Thursday night and go my mom yeah they play Thursday night\nRather see the parents want to see you I'm sure because you know they don't you guys don't live that close right so ... and I come down so much they can but yeah anytime I can go up there but I guess because otherwise like sometimes the parents would have to get involved and they would have to say it's like a\nRay I mean do\nYou really think this is necessary I mean you're an adult you're coming all this weight right do you really think that it's necessary\nAt least it pays off I think it's worth their time yeah yeah you're not going to Thanksgiving games where you you lose by forty touchdowns into their shooting off fireworks cause you kick a freaking field goal a ... I was a great game what are you talking about our game how Steve Gregory doing these days\nOut new nothing out right I mean he had a big night that night I remember\nHe was a guy who did the on the field interview with or whoever it was on there and I say I didn't even know where he is paid Gregory was like on the bus his picture was on the Sunday Night Football bus that night because he was the one who had the the ... from a touchdown\nI always touchdown fumble kick off but fumble within like twenty seven seconds right Steve Gregory uh two of those touchdowns right I Believe so he picked up the he picked up the phone if I'm right yes\nHe had a big night career night\nAbout done with this conversation [laughter]\nI mean you guys want to do the fake spike next and then we'll just to go with the\nDolphins ... I watch it when that I Can't stand that that's what I was telling me about this before I think the team I don't like is that dolphins I don't know a problem with the jets and like the dolphins added dumping a lot more growing up but\nThat has shifted people yeah right people of a certain age don't realize that when you talk about a jet rivalry ... it was it was the dolphins for decades but I still\nLike a bunch of dolphin fans around here or to Dan Marino retire and they all know there are always so many dollars ... than you'd run into at\nThat game when I when I drove into the parking lot a couple of weeks ago when they played the dolphins in my life\nI came across this tailgate set up it was one of the biggest things I've never seen more ... in in my life was like hundreds of people there let me raise it better I think all over thirty five years old dirty or something like if you're a young kid would you ever\nGravitate towards that kinda Steelers are always a draw one way or that you don't have that I don't understand why you'd ever become a dolphins fan except for Dan Marino and it's amazing to me that all these years later you have a budget you know thirty five year old\nWith ... with a band hanging out tailgating metlife state is so true\nBut it's funny you know this would raise said though he's like I don't I don't know the jets don't bother me because that's like his way of saying\nDiets are never a threat I don't worry about that's why I Love wrecked so much because he made the jets the villain and I had never rooted for a team as we talk about the top that had crossed over to becoming\nThe villain in the jaguars maybe the today or yesterday was a little part of that turn for them but my team has never been the bad guy\nAnd I want to root for the bad guy that's the guy\nThat's what's funny I Want to be the one that everybody's dying to get\nWhat can a team in Jacksonville tiny little Jacksonville be considered the villain they're barely on the map the patriots were\nBarely on the map and twenty five thirty years they all get the Boston tie and that's solving something even though the patriots existed mile a bill\nParcell there came in there they they used to have their home games blacked out or bill parcell shown in the town that's out there that's the attention that they garnered up there in New England\nEight hundred three two one zero seven ten you know I think I ... to ... to ... come in and he's a big patriots fan yeah then Tim Healy I Believe he's a\n... guide to uh I I we might have made it terribly out of the other day by day than but we'll we'll keep it to them [laughter]\nThis weekend oh boy\nIt's the uh sports people car they ... on the voice of New York seven ten wor\nI'm Len Burman and I'm like I'll read all the FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh rolls along and rap star Carty\nBeepers herself is a police over a strip club vault Berman and Michael read all of the morning tomorrow ... than I Am on the voice of New York seven ten W\nHe was asked in the industry don't know how many times has been there through the decades of decriminalization medical and recreational today high times is down there and helping to break\nNow you can ... high times for influence Ninety nine dollars can't high times investigate dot com\nI sense holding corps opera will be made only by means of offering circular which has been found with unqualified by the U.S securities and Exchange Commission the security's are highly speculative investing and shares kind of ... times holding corporate significant risks the investment is suitable for persons who can afford to lose their entire invest further more investors must understand that such as best we could be a liquid for indefinite period of time no other cars are currently exist with the\nSecurities and if a public park a developed following the offering it may not continue to send a copy of the offering circular which contains information about high times holding ... offering and other related topics including the risks of investment pleases high times investor dot com bust high times investor dot com\nI media and its affiliates are investors in hard times holding court that are not associated with is offering her media and its affiliates responsible for the information\nInformation including ... tons of after dot com or the information filed with the securities and Exchange Commission\nTo your morning start with Fox five joined soup ...
