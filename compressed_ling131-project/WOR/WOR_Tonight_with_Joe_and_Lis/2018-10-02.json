original vision vital experience\n\nSeven can tell you all are forced to go with the McCarthy [noise]\nThey're rough weekend birthday already here than\nSome on the line that we talked about as pulls on the line at a baseball one\nAs it turned out it Daniel Murphy to get ahead and his last bad today I needed him to finish but I turned out well for you with that extra head\nKnocked it struck out against Josh hater\nThe laws that they might football picked out a good weekend I did this weekend to do but I didn't pick the Thursday game I got distracted on Thursday night didn't pick it would have had the ... would have covered it and now yeah I think I got nine yesterday\n... they're ridiculous it's insane lifestyle shock to pick the ravens and expect them to actually win in the way that they did as some issues or they could do cover anybody\nI mean they forget about on the field have been off the field and and the one thing that has been\nClear what the Steelers over the years they don't do a good job of filtering out the off the field stuff in the ... keeping that away from the on the field because they're always\nLast year when that whole thing with the national anthem surface remember they had the al ... who was a former Army Ranger and he was the one guy who said I'm going to go out there and stand for the anthem while the rest of the team stayed in the locker room they ended up losing that game to the to the to the Chicago Bears and the bears weren't that good and\nYou know they admitted afterwards yeah we spend more time worrying about you know how we were going to demonstrate the anthem than we were going to worry about the bears and go into playing football now you have leaving on bail and I mean it's just\nThis could be that one year everything blows up for them\nThey've always been fined though and that's what you say this\nCould be the one year even with all of the drama that it's world around that\nFranchise for years and it's always something they find a way into the playoffs and they've always be able to score a ton of points but last night was really the first getting that from a football since you saw they missed levy on\nBalance they miss them and even go back to week one you know they tied the Cleveland Browns they get on Cleveland in Cleveland right I mean so you're ... their defense has a lot of holes in it a lot of holes Libyan Bell's not there even though there was a report that now he's in a show up I think in which seven now supposedly a little bit earlier than the week ten I don't know\nI I just ... it's going to have to happen\nFor every team right where you're going to have one of those years we're just everything goes awry since he's off to a nice little start Baltimore looks like they're rejuvenated Flaco and whatnot so this isn't going to be in Cleveland is no pushover as they used to be so this is going to be challenging and thinking that\nThe Kansas City am looking forward to seeing the chiefs tonight against the bronco that top divisional match you up on the road in Denver early in the year and you hope Denver gets worn out tonight\nBecause short wake them they got to travel we used to play the jets on Sunday\nAnd then you go ah the jets trying to keep hope alive when I'll finally\nBe there will be able to make you go and see just before the game show you gotta yeah going by All right All right Marty we'll see what kind of condition um and you know my jets game that's my escape [laughter] two one zero set a deadline deep\nDive and the Mets Tim Healy of Newsday as well ... ... dot com we'll recap some of the season and and look at it in a big way and and somewhat ... will bond hinted at yesterday that's coming up right now news update\nYou take a little bit more optimism from the final couple of months Anthony mentioned all these guys perform so well down the stretch I think that gives you a little bit of hope going into the off season ...\nWell they are different ways to get to Seventy seven eighty five before I'd say that I should say I believe the Dodgers had all the way I also believe the national out of the hallway felt a lot of your calls ... right but there are different ways to get to Seventy seven eighty five and if I I think there's a lot more pessimism for example in Philadelphia right now where they looked like a playoff team for most of the summer and then\nAbsolutely crash landed in September\nVersus where the Mets were out where you get to a similar place in the standings by the end of the year\nBut with a nice final six weeks and final eight weeks I think it was actually it winds up leaving at least a better tasting your mouth even though ... paper over the fact that there are problems here that needs to be facts\nTim Haley Newsday what what's real about some of the things that went right over the last six\nWeeks or so well I think the starting pitching is probably not sub three ear ache good but the starting pitching is pretty good the way I look at it is you're you are approximately what your record says you are so for the Mets they're losing team\nNo getting around that heading into the off season yes they're obviously she's the bullpen centerfield and catch our question mark maybe second base is a question mark but\n[noise]\nYou can look at all positive shark and Florida was great the second half my nails very good starting pitching was great but every year there are things that come up that you would never expect if I told you in April that some guy named ... McNeill is going to be\nActually one of the best players in the majors for the final third of the season you ... you'd have to Google jak McNeil and then you think I'm Crazy so when you talk about how good the Mets are heading into the winter things like that I don't weigh the second half too heavily I look at the whole\nTo take it with a grain of salt and you're not necessarily buying in with a lot of these guys and and that's a fair point and\nI I think guys a good place to start here when you're like evaluating the seasons are home and what they're going to do moving forward\nI think you've got to go right at the top with Mickey Calloway I mean he's he kind of learned along the way you know there were some gap certainly in the season we know that\nAnd he wasn't really acclimated to National League baseball and the things that are entailed there when you are the manager but do you think and a lot of is going to be changing on who the general manager is and what that person decides to do in in the manager's office but do you think\nThat he deserves at least a nother year here albeit with a new boss while you're asking that I'm a\nPerson who does not believe the manager matters all that much once you have the winning formula in place yes I Want the right guy at the helm but to me it's much more about personnel and it's much more up to about the decisions that are being made it a front office level but the answer your question specifically about Mickey Callaway\nDoes you deserve a little bit of a longer leash I Would say probably yeah actually I think he made a ton of mistakes this year and you would hope that he learns from them but you hire him at the beginning of the season you can't fire him now just because he had a Seventy seven when these I think you have to see it through at least through the beginning of next season and see where he's\nAt politics getting the white guys right and and what I mean by that is he was hired by a different regime\nWhen you're asking me based on merit based on merit and everything I think he he deserves at least the chance to keep going now if that's going to prevent you from getting the GM that you want from getting the GM that has the vision\nThat you think is the right vision going forward the no I don't think any manager really is worth that so it was going to stop you from getting one of the top GM's in the game which I think they're going to struggle to the kind of lure these guys anyway but if that's going to stop you then sure find a new manager let the new GM bring his guy but in terms of\nHis actual performance on the field I think it was okay enough that that you know he didn't have to be fired over it\nI thought that it took him a long time to learn the national league rules and just how different the gaming is even late which means and he said it felt like a weekend off when they were up in Boston and had the d._a. ...\nPlayer coach in the American league and it certainly seemed to me early on those first few months\nThat there were issues with them what you would think to be basic moves Tim\nWell I think the takeaway there is that having the pitcher hit is a bad idea but maybe that's a whole nother debate [laughter] I Will get that in there any any time I can and the\nMatrix hedger this year that that that something happened to him it's picture this year that was pretty nowhere around it yeah I only getting\nAbout um what else Tony ... think of when you think of mistakes that Callaway might have had early and how do you think he came out of some of those things at the end\nI think his expectations in reality just with New York and what the job entails in this market we're we're totally divergent at first and I think it took him a long time and I'm not sure he's there yet to be honest in terms of\nHow to deal with the media of this size how to deal with all of the people who want a piece of his time and all of the people who are going to frankly criticized him even at times when when the team is playing well and I don't think he he's been able to drive that fact and his mind that you know\nAaron Boone got a ton of criticism as your as manager of the Yankees for a team won over a hundred games ah you know\nBoston Red Sox I mean go up there and listen to their talk radio how often do you hear them get criticized another one of the best teams in the history of baseball record wise so it's going to happen in a market of this size and I I don't think he's been able to wrap his mind around that\nAnd I think he's going to have to if he wants to succeed going forward because that's not going to stop even if they get out to a Twenty one record next year\nI don't remember him pumping back too much at\nCriticism maybe there's one press conference where he snapped a reporter was asking about his or believes bullpen decisions in June ... word how it worked well of course but what\nWhat did you notice where you think that it it was it it is something that affected him or or that you noticed the he didn't respond well to the criticism\nI'd say that was the most prominent example but I think\nAnd look part of this is a perspective because you come from Terry Collins who's open and honest with everything and you get to a more buttoned up guy and Mickey Callaway and you're going to get a different perspective on things but\nUh you know just the day to day being there the comments that you hear from him and things of that nature of the way he conducts himself\nAnd his press conferences the way he can be surprised by questions and things of that nature [noise]\nYeah I I think just on the whole he wasn't prepared for what it wouldn't tell that doesn't mean he's not qualified to do it because I think he's a good public speaker I think he has those leadership skills I think he can convey his message I just think he wasn't totally ready for what it would be in this animal compared to say Cleveland\nAnd we'll

you know\nIn one breath Jeff will upon said it will be up to the next GM and we want to give him full autonomy and the next breath Jeff will find said I Want all those guys back so you know it it can't be both and I think that's something the Mets are going to have to hash out if they want to do this thing the right way in terms of hiring the next year\nI didn't get the said yesterday though that the payroll is going to jump up and a big way\nAnytime soon did you notice any luxury tax is not going to be a threat that who is there any changes in that aspect\nOf the discussion even if they're willing to give all the power to this new baseball person that's going to come in and I will the resources\nBe more plentiful\nI look you're going to have you're going to have to give raises to Jake if the ground into Michael going forward or no cinder guard a lot of the guys who are under contract whether it's a Jay Bruce or some others are going to\nBe paid more next season than they were this season so the payroll is going to jump just based on that but\nYeah I I don't get the sense they're going to go out there and all of a sudden spent two hundred million dollars which if you really want to go and fix the areas that you need to fix the bullpen which I think they need probably bringing to big arms I agree and how you doing I think you need to go after one of those top two guys those things that I just mentioned alone are you going to lift your payroll of significant amount so\nAre they going to do that I Can't say definitively know but history shows us probably not the whole way\nYou want a nice things that's going to cost you money right I mean you want to you you want to be able to bring in some of these Marquis guys in look no none of us expect them to go out there and be major players for Bryce Harper many Machado we don't need to to do need\nTo you're absolutely right about that in you know I'm\nWith Anthony here and if you were asking me what I think is the area that is the most concerning it needs to be addressed for this team going into the off season it's the bullpen he got his start there I mean plain and simple ... you start to see that one healthy\nI think some of these bats are going to be able to carry their way catching position not withstanding but if you have a good starting rotation and that's going to be the core of your baseball team again in two thousand Nineteen you better supporter with a nice quality both\nAnd I think you heard a lot of that understanding yesterday for both Jeff Wilton and Mickey Callaway when they talked about some of the needs for the off season they named catcher they know they have work to do in the bullpen what\nDifference that I had though I'd like to see this team signed a real good to weigh center field or a guy that's an old real center fielder and not finding Nemo or Michael could for do kind of faking it over there are giving\nUp on one with ... ...\nIt can be a bench bad whatever but you can't trust him to to plays\nLigaments made at a tissue paper or something I think it's been made a parent but um what do you do you agree that 'cause they talked about a quarter bat same Haley well he talked about a few different things to India of corner batter right handed that wherever that person is but Mickey Callaway talked a lot especially in the second half about valuing defense which\nThe Mets did not do mostly for understand the oldest and\nA defense a centerfield specifically that's one of the reasons they signed Austin Jackson who didn't hit very much but played it solid centerfield and that's why Mickey Callaway liked him\nA the problem is when you start looking at the available centerfield there's there aren't many quality to a center fielder is out there to be had but yeah trade for on my right\nAnd that's where I think Pete Alonzo gets real interest in you know how much value might he have elsewhere in Kenya land a young centerfield they're from another team\nYeah I I I mean I think certainly it's something you're going to look at it I don't consider it a top priority because I Do think the bullpen and the catching are much bigger hole that you need to fill and if you go into next year with the same outfield is that you have even having no idea what you're going to get with you on and says but I think you can make an argument that you're okay there\nObviously you can be better but I think you can make the argument that you're okay\nYou know one thing that I Do think they should think long and hard about this winter and Mickey ... has alluded to this is starting pitching death and it it sounds kind of crazy because they had the best starting pitching rotation in the air and the national league or in the major leagues and the second half\nBut once you get past those top five guys you're looking at Korea's walls and then who and\nYou've got all of these innings and all of these starts out of Zach wheeler and Jacob the ground and knows cinder guard\nAnd Steven matches guys who have historically had very very high injury rates can you count on that again I mean maybe it's not going to be as bad as it was he's when he's sixteen but can you count on getting all of that production out those guys again can you count on a second consecutive Cy Young season from Jake the ground or will there be a little fall off\nAnd and and

seven seven twenty to fifty five\nEight five five IRS called on the Web it's rush tax resolution dot com\nThen hopefully he can get us off to a good start tomorrow\nWell he'll address but he also has a five point six Seventy or rain over his final fourteen starts the season\nAnd it's not very good if you're going to have Gary Sanchez catching him those to combine fray disasters doubting in Oakland against these aged in early September\nWhere you had multiple wild pitches past balls combined for Sanchez and ... and several arena lasted just two and two thirds innings in game\nKnocked out six runs five or so why exactly is ... you know the guy over say Moscow hero to knock those ... big starts over the years for the Yankees or J. happen to finish the season strong\nWe met Saturday Night as a staff and cash you know came came up to Boston and um we we we talk through it a lot of guys um\nHad had input on on the decision and and uh had reasons why one way or the other\nYou know I just kind of took all that information and and and slip on it and I felt like at some point Sunday is when I decided for sure that um I wanted to go with savvy in this game and that's where we're at what they ...\nWouldn't be my pick out one of the other two I like someone who is pitching well at the time ... you know it's a better starts down the stretch but you look at the entirety of the second half\nAnd that's a nightmare any or a over six and now you're trusting him and his big game especially guy really struggled in the same exact spot last year and the AOL wild card game and didn't make it out of the first sitting but this is\nThe greater point in at all as we can discuss the breakdown who's the best starter for the Yankees in this game how much does it really matter and it's an odd thing to ask right this is a playoff game your seasons on the line\nIs starting pitcher doesn't matter doesn't matter nearly as much as it did\nLook at what the ... are going to do tomorrow the A's or starting Liam Hendricks they're throwing a relief pitcher in open or they're going to be both panning tomorrow best case scenario for the AIDS they get two innings out of their starter\nAnd then they're going to go to the pen and oh my God all along or labor or they're just gonna go ... or two at a time with all the relievers that they have\n\nSo while everybody's going nuts does it the right decision Severino over half over to knock\nIt doesn't mean nearly as much as it used to\nIt used to be the most important player in a given game was you're starting pitcher\nThat still holds true for most regular season games as I discussed you can't bullpen every single day\nBut when you get into the postseason you can you can do this every game and then the ... are going to be fascinating if they make it past this wild card game how do they\nRun their pitching staff could they bullpen their way all the way to the world series they could they get real deep talented\nBullpen there and a lot of familiar names for Mets fans that are part of it including former manager as familiar\n\nBut ... that's how it has changed in a big way and it's starting pitchers you don't need a guy to go eight innings anymore if he can give you one or two turns through the line up you take that in a heartbeat and\nThe Yankees the AIDS they can't wait to turn the game over to the relievers to make this a bullpen gay\nThe age will do it more than likely sooner than the Yankees will but even if\nSeverino is good stuff unless he's absolutely dominant he's not going to be going more than five innings\nSo are the Yankees starting in the right guy is this the right move I think it's a lot of wasted breath and wasted energy because chances are it's the second third fourth fifth pictures that are out there for the Yankees they're ultimately going to decide this game\nThat is a way that it is just far different in the postseason you might see some of that in tonight's game with the Rockies and the cubs and on paper you say oh Jon Lester and Kyle ... these are\nTwo legit top of the rotation kinds of pitchers Lester is a lot on his postseason resume\nBut the second you get in trouble as a starting pitcher now you're gone it's not July anymore there's no value in pitching those extra innings\nGetting a team through six saving the pen doesn't exist in the postseason as soon as you're in trouble you're yanked and you'll see that tonight you'll see that certainly tomorrow and it's a different kind of game\nAnd I've said this for years when you get to the postseason best bullpen when\nYou look at the bullpen Sarah hot going into the post season the Indians have a tremendous bullpen\nWhat Josh ... does for the Milwaukee Brewers is big for them and now of home field advantage in the national league the A's have a tremendous pan the Yankees have a very good pen on paper but they didn't\nPut it all together over the course of the season and there were some questions surrounding the world is Chapman going into this postseason the Yankees hey maybe within a week they could have everybody\nOn board pitching well and he has to be incredibly difficult to knock out with that Penn but there is a piece of that to come together and you look at recent history\nYear it didn't look at the ash does this happen is phenomenal bullpen but in the postseason you did because all of a sudden they took some of their extra starting pitchers put them into the pan asked them to give them multiple innings and those guys were lights out\nYou think back to what the Kansas City royals were able to put together and fourteen and Fifteen or the difference in that twenty fourteen World Series was Madison Bumgarner coming out of the bullpen in game\nSeven\nWe know how the Mets royals series ended up with every game being decided late\nAnd it sixteen as well\nWith the Indians and the cubs those teams went out made big both acquisitions the deadline Andrew Miller to the tribe and enrolled us Chapman To the cubs and those guys helped carry their teams deep into the postseason that's what wins\nIt's why the Boston Red Sox despite winning a hundred and eight games this year are not long for the animal the play offs\n\nIt's why I think the Yankees are in big trouble tomorrow even if you look at a match up in St Louis Severino and\nIt's why the Braves nobody's given that much of a chance anyway but as well I don't like them at all\nGoing into the postseason you gotta have some guy's not just one multiple guys it gets you out because starting pitching it's not caring you the way that we're accustomed to seeing\nA and certainly not over these last few seasons eight hundred three two one zero seven down the number again ... eight hundred three two one zero seven than when we bouncing around tonight that we can take some ... calls is that we like to do around here now will dive into the jets the giants what has been going wrong with those two teams now one and

incredibly frustrating\nSeason and it has a look to a whole lot different besides a new based on the sideline and said the giants are tough schedule coming up here as well and this one and three star and we walk Maine right now pat Leonard covers the giants but the New York daily news and how you doing tonight that\nHe will do it ... you know they look up and just started his she's an open mic oh there's some winning football and so far more the ... so uh open for something to turn around soon\nIt's been frustrating and we know last year this team did seem to fracture as it went along or do you think that they are in danger of those kinds of issues popping up again as you look at the schedule the next few weeks and and you could see this team really having a rock star\n[noise] yeah I mean I don't know if it'll get as bad as last year especially with you know the the players talk about how the coaches back and things like that but I I Will say this you know anyone who was watching Sunday's game at the scene that oil Becca junior just tired of watching balls sail over his head\nAnd watching Eli Manning mission when they do have their\nTheir opportunities to connect give it up he fetches are playing them but the shots have been there and not getting the ball\nGetting it when you open and so I think oh del did a pretty good job actually all things considered of you know ... saying the right things after the game and trying his best I'm not to lose his cool\nBut I think he was really hard for him to do that especially if that won't catch you saw that I think that's what's going to be the frustration is you know same old same old as far as\nThe defense doing just enough or the fence not doing anything to help the defense and eventually you're they're all standing there in the locker room the office of players are frustrated and the defense of players are wondering when that helps gonna come\nAs far as back him go as you've been around him covered him daily over the last few years do you sense the\nThe emotional maturity that they that he has shown to this point and we certainly tested and he talked about that with you or after the game on Sunday\nIs that real or is this an effort for O'Donnell backed him to contain what we've seen boiled within him in the past\n[noise] so do I I think it's very real that uh he's in a better place because otherwise\nYou know ... he's an emotional person no ... no matter what he does to re center himself when he's in a competitive situation his emotions and the juices are going to flow and\nYou know part of what makes him graders that competitive spirit but the problem is you know here's a here's here's what I Would say about that the key is coming from a better place so that when things have gone wrong\nHe's been able to kind of bottle it up and channel it because he knows that what he's doing here everything needs to be for the best for the betterment of the team you know it's not all about him it's about the team and he definitely realizes that I think there's a lot to him saying how much work he did in the offseason to get to that point\nBut I think what he's articulating after that game especially is\nListen everyone has the breaking point\nAnd I don't care if I'm getting the ball or not I care that we're not winning especially when there are opportunities for me to get the ball and that's not happening either\nAnd we've been talking about the office of line for years with this Giants' team ... wasn't a miserable performance by those guys on Sunday had seen that he like manning had time to to be able to launch the ball down the field and and they weren't able to do that effectively\nWell said I mean you know here's the part of the reason\nI keep reminding people of the full picture of what's going wrong with the ... relation to Eli Manning struggles is that\nYou know clearly in giants land it's okay to throw a professional off sense of linemen who has a name and a career under the bus\nAnd even the Redskins which was supposed to be the week where everything comes down to the giants Washington has shown themselves pretty solid with Alex Smith us far so you know that's not necessarily a gimme a for the giants in you know when you are one in three already a you better\nAt least split that next chunk of the season and three and five halfway through even that is you got a lot of up\nHill climbing to do depending on how the rest of the conference shakes out eight hundred three two one zero seven and the number again eight hundred three two one zero seven ten\nOr some changes baseball

cubs do or die\nWhen or go home yesterday not quite that kind of drama as it was just waiting and continue or losing a void that game you don't want to play in today baseball card games they're terrible\n[laughter] if you're a fan of one of these teams as much as you say as a Mets fan you'd love to see them in the playoffs the experience of the wild card game is not fun when it's actually happening when you buy a hundred and sixty two game six months investment in a team\nOn the line in one do or die game and the baseball game emerges\nSo slowly and gradually it's a painful slow painful death often and uh those teams to deal with that tonight but it's great fun if you don't have a dog in the fight and you get to see the cubs fans are holding on to themselves biting fingernails all those things right that\nHorrific nervousness is the camera's always seem to find the fans\nIn those dramatic moments or just a wishing hoping praying right that something that's going to go right for their team and then of course tomorrow or the AOL wildcard match up right here in New York with the Yankees hosting the aged in\nA well blur album needs a new day on TALK about that a little bit further coming up a but it used to be black Monday across major league baseball yesterday we'd start seeing a number managers being let go and you didn't exactly have that this year though you do have some openings the reds are going to be hunting for a manager Mike ...\nAre left as the angels manager and he's taken a step back to the angels jobs open now uh the rangers can banished or at the end of the season and then John given what go by the Toronto blue jays but still there are some other jobs that could open up here at one time I Am kind of curious that there's there has been some resolution\nBy now is buck Showalter in Baltimore where it has been it seems that a fate accompli that he would be let go yet and as it happened right away and here we are\nIt's Tuesday it's two days after the season ended a but still you know move made their buddy Orioles too I think everybody assumed were going to be busy here and you also see in this was a a bit of a surprise pall mall under\nFire today by the Minnesota Twins I only says manager they've offered him another job in the organization but this guy was the ale manager of the year just last season and\nThrough all that good will I suppose out the window he's got two years left on his contract and\nUh the twins making that kind of move anyway after a disappointing year and I really wonder about Byron boxed in as a a a potential trade target for the Mets is the twins and kind of jerked him around over the course this year if they want to change things up as they're changing the manager\nOr that might be an interesting name to keep in mind this off season but uh well a dive into the L wild card game a little further coming up right now and is up to\nThe zoo fossil fuels rated number\nYou know I'm trying to put that in a couple of different ways and each time he says no no not at all but\nThat would have been done against the red Sox in your hand you've got to hope that first of all that you can stay away from in the wild card game because he is allowed part roster and second of all that he does get those to start that you know he can he can put the Yankees in that position against a very very good team\nWe're talking again here with Laura al bunnies Newsday it's the Yankees will be taken on the AIDS tomorrow and the A. L. wild card game and the other interesting decision by Aaron Boone has to start Gary ... behind the plate\nAnd while they caught a separate throughout September they did have a memorable start to first outing in September for Severino in Oakland where there were a number of wild pictures past balls six runs allowed or two and two thirds innings by Severino are no concerns from Boone throwing Sanchez in there again\nThere isn't but I mean how could you not\nA diet that outing between Severino says it's nothing short disastrous and you know they they chop it up to a bad\n... maybe not getting signals right the calls are different uh and that's not something they can absolutely a board and the situation uh Gary had that look the best behind the plate especially recently had a number of ... ball or he doesn't ...\nTroll or like the Yankees would want but the Yankees ... cash and said we're doubling down on and we're struggling down on him they think that you know they can unleash the crackdown essentially that eventually Gary than to the dentist back into it and B that off into power house that he can be and I'm really a game changer and we've got a very bad\n... has a sound like these days does he think he's close\nHe seems to think so you know it's a little bit a little bit difficult on our end because he does talked with a through a translator so sometimes things do get lost a little bit in translation um last time I spoke to him he just said that you know as long as they win the game that's all I care about\nUm I I think everything's going to be okay and I'm working very hard which again I'm sure it would sound a lot different if there was something where I was talking in his language or he was talking in line and you'll be a little bit more forceful a cell with those kinds of situations that can be a little bit different a little bit difficult trying to understand where he had an exactly\nSure we understand that as far as the AIDS go ... Hendricks for a little while and then where do you think they go from there they they have so much talent in the bullpen but are they going to go to some would for legs or are we going to see you know ... million Blake training and guys like that given the multiple innings\nI I Wish I could answer that question the truth is I don't know and the\nBob ... says he hasn't decided yet\nWhich really gives you a a good indication of any as to exactly how the Arabs are are looking into it uh you wouldn't quite say that he's playing with house money um but he does seem to be taking situation there comes a there are very adaptable as a staff they'd have to be the season because of all the injuries they had\nSo it's really anybody's guess as to how they're going to go about this I think we're going to find out about you know eight thirty tomorrow night so we'll see that and\nHow many pictures over under a what eleven pictures tomorrow between these two teams ...\nOh I Would say so you know a little breezy four and a half hour game [laughter] [laughter] I Would say I\nSay where we're going to see a lot and not only from the eighth because everything the Buddhist that indicates that you know\nThat Marino on great but if he's not or if he's a little bit wobbly he's going to have a pretty short hook I mean there's a reason you've got half on there that the reason he got Lance went on there and there's a reason you got to knock on there and it's not for their health it's because he's he will use that Neal deploy them that he thinks that Severino isn't on his game\nAnd this is the trend where we're used to break it down to starting pitching in a given day and then what kind of edge does that give a team and it feels like it it's true it means less than it ever has before and it was starting pitcher in any team is giving you a more than five and ... it's almost a surprise at this point\nSo lately and I I've been through to a few of these that today at Hendrix the job and he's like you know I Hope to go out there a pitch six innings and\nGet quality start in the past that would not be a joke that is something a starter says that's something that started was but he was saying it there's no way that is going to happen because it is it's completely it's a different landscape it's a different language or we're seeing an open air for the first time in postseason history and and a lot has really changed and in\nEssence you know the wild so they get bailouts are getting the Yankees play last year with every no starting ... no one in the third inning ended up being bullpen game so we could be in a situation where both teams are actually deploying bullpen dams and I think it's going to be interesting and\nIt's all it's a lot like a chess match and it really comes down to how the managers manage the bullpen how to manage their pitching and\nWho has the edge in that particular situation\nDo you think we lose you know as you're writing a preview for tomorrow's game and things like that did we lose some of\nThe excitement for a given match up when we know it's going to be basically are pitching unit in stamp against another stab rather than a mano a mano dual of sorts\n[noise] yeah I mean\nI I I definitely see that\nPart of it and I mean I remember the days of all they had like ... that team's eighth and and your ... going up against each other and that excitement that would come with that but I'm starting as as the season is progressing we thought with Tampa Bay and stay with the AIDS and we're seeing bullpen games just become more and more popular I'm really starting to appreciate\nA just all the mental gymnastics that goes into it\nUm all the work all the ... at ... ability that these ... these pictures have to go through 'em and I think it is interesting uh when you talk about teens are\nAs offensively potent as the Yankees and the ... to see these guys in major league carries these these guys who are at the absolute pinnacle of their meal trying to solve\nA these relievers I think it's interesting I think it's dynamic and I I I think it's a good ... good show no you can't really preview it like we used to back in the day but I still I don't think it takes away all that much from the match up\n... power bats are lot of them in this game as you mentioned they won't see the same picture twice more than likely maybe a couple of guys on the AIDS Severino\nStarts well but I'm more likely than not it's going to be a totally mixed up for these guys throughout the day certainly uh for the Yankees batters a about a ... year citing today\nThere was ... years really unfortunately I wasn't able to talk to the my when my co workers was uh and uh it was just happy to be there he he tends to be a very happy go lucky guy in the clubhouse he was always pulling Frank than I was very joyful and\nThat has not changed with the AIDS um by now than sad that you know when he first came\nTo the athletic there was this little bit of mayor because he wasn't going to be in the closures roll anymore but that wasn't an issue at all ... million said that he would pitch wherever he could he would pitch warnings to innings he was basically I Would assume after the typical year then that's had a typical ... year for him that he was just happy to be on a team that with contending\n... who do you like Tamara Laura\nOh man you want to know what I\nI I'll I'll give the Yankees a slight edge especially since I think if February and it was really odd his game um he can change at all I Know you never count out Aaron Judge you never ever count out John Carlos and then they they pass a law that that I Would not be shocked if the AIDS can pull this through they've had a novel second half\nTheir gritty team and lighting do they they tend to find ways to win even when they shouldn't it um so I I'm really really excited for this game\nHedging bets [laughter] out but either at\nA lower our bodies of Newsday banks Laura thank you\nI could coverage there ah from Laura there the Yankees today she covered the Mets plenty this year uh the jets as well so\nUh she keeps her busy there Newsday would appreciate her give it some time to some insights there is no interest Abraham Hendrik showing a little different sides of his personality and you know the small market teams you know there are a little looser often are they coming into\nA these games a team like the A's yeah they don't have a ton of reporters around them until they get to the playoffs and then all of a sudden it's a it's a whole new ballgame and\nUh I guess the problem with it and Hendricks doing that today and you know it's funny here in a you know Hendricks joke about ... throw six in ... and everybody can laugh because they know that won't be the case but\nIt wasn't that long ago even a picture saying hey I'm going to give six you'd say openly sex and that should be your attitude going into a start and uh it has again just dramatically changed such a short period of time and how are these pitching staff sir are operated and we will\nFind out of a little bit more than ... really the first time the bullpen and gets used in the post season\nIn is this going to be a new edge for these teams it was for the raised over the course of the season or will it be for the Oakland Athletics tomorrow night against the Yankees okay I I really liked the AIDS tomorrow I like their chance they'll love their open\nThe A's or Seventy into\nIn games when they're leading after seven innings show or if they get in front they are extremely dangerous with that pen you'll see Fernando Rodney launching some arrows at some point in the Bronx tomorrow night as well they don't do it three two one zero seven and the number again ... eight hundred three two one\nZero seven ten or more sports don't coming up on the voice of New York's ...

biggest not impactful for them as well\nTo see\nHow much love you can give and get in this town I compare it with Joe Mauer in Minnesota the home town kid\nWho liked David Wright had a phenomenal start became a huge star early on in his career\nSigned a big contract didn't live up to it but\nWas always the guy and the franchise in Minnesota compare his send off with David right was it a sellout at target feel\nIt wasn't the of bands that it was in New York everything is magnified here and even though the Mets yeah they live in the shadow of the Yankees and Mets fans\nThey're every bit as vocal and allowed as what we have across town so I think it was impactful and they hear Jacobs ... actually come out and say as much\nAnd that's got a lot more on about than just one night than just honoring one player\nBecause everybody else has to look on and say hey that could be me\nMaybe I Do want to stay here even with all that nonsense that goes on with his team maybe it is worth it to stick it out to have to kind of moment that David Wright was able to enjoy on Saturday\nAnd that's important that's impactful and it's something that the Mets have to do much better job with with their former players bringing these guys back and acknowledging the history of the team and\nJay Horowitz is in the new alumni relations role so he should be impactful in that area and making sure that happens but if I'm a ... player I I'm aware of those things I Want to be able to come back I Want to have a home\nAfter my career ends on at that moment that appreciation when my time comes and uh they saw what it\nCan be like hey don't you three two one zero seven ten again eight hundred three two one zero seven then\nAlso uh the Mets and a final it's been a Hank Aaron award which goes to the best offensive player in each a respective league and they won't win that but it's interesting every team gets a nominee\nWho the Mets nominee was we'll talk a little bit if they got that right
