{"month": "11", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "Not every division has that right now you're right the division was as tough to win this past year and that's one of the things that I think is very disappointing for the ... point is it in a year where the division was down they didn't compete\nNow how big loss for the division already here in the home run sculptures gone there in Miami so we'll have to recover from that\nYou know and then actually the ... the other yesterday was agent saying he's not going to sign up probably in science I mean the Marlins could could lose a historic number and the\nBraves metsa nationals could all be in unreal motel or I could see the Phillies making a huge run at Harper I think that's where he ends up I mean there could be some some positive division\nAnd that's what I'm Talking about\nIt's not necessarily what you saw in the division at the end of this year it's how all these teams could get better\nAnd and that all of them except for the Marlins have that for the teams are going into the winter with the idea we're going to try to find a way to witness to visit next year and as I said not every division has that and yeah you're right there were a lot of disappointments in this division this year but there's also\nThat going forward I see potential for for the teams in the short term\nYeah I don't know no doubt about it they're they're all talking like ah they're going to be competing that's for sure as we chat with Danny nobler a bleacher report right now let's try some quick caters witty Danny and hope it goes a little better than the candy question earlier a number one but where does Manny Machado land\nYou know I'm guessing Philadelphia or we'll see but I think they're the team that seems to have the most interest is probably going to be the least scared by what happened in the postseason when he said he he said that I'm not Johnny hustle I wouldn't be absolutely shocked if the Yankees signed up\nBut I think a Philadelphia probably more likely\nDoes he get the biggest contractor Bryce Harper\nMy guess is Harper but I think it's going to be close and it may end up being whichever one wait out the other uh and and and the ... you have two different ages they're both going to want it so even the ... they may be the one that science ... last\nMay end up working the number so that it gets higher so they can be proud of the number of the player can be to uh I don't think\nIt may not be that much different I think going into the postseason that may very well a bit much ado because being an infielder middle you play mostly you're probably best surveys but he showed again you know after I went to the Dodgers I think he showed he can play charts done a lot of ah but I think I think the way\nThings wet the postseason forum will turn out enough people off\nThat there could be people who end up and I I probably trust for us to get a little bit more money the ... was a much autos agent so I I think it's going to college\nSo we both take the Phillies make a big movie that I just they harbor all end up there you say Machado where does harbor go\nI wouldn't be shocked if Harper adds up back in Washington I I don't do that that's going to happen but it is the only question in my mind on that is whether the nationals are really willing\nTo play at the top table on that and they haven't always been before but he likes it there now he has got for us as an agent it's probably going to come down to offers the most money so it might not be them but the ownership there is always liked him they know how much the fans are like we saw it during\nThe all star game and the home run derby how much this past are in the if they're even what other fast he had a not so great first half of the year and yet it didn't change the way people they're felt about if\nI I'm not sure about this\nBut I'm guessing that that's that's a it's kind of all of us a long shot gas now people don't believe it but that would be that's my guess\nRight now and we've got one minute or try to squeeze into more here we're the biggest name traded\nA well rounded is going to be big but I think there'll probably be some other uh they'll put up my guess is there'll be someone bigger I'm not sure what's going to be\nThe most active team this off season\nWell the Phillies are going to be at on everything because they got so much money that uh so I I think they're going to be very very at\nRight Danny nobler bleacher reports and a Danny ... much coming out always always love to have a newborn\nAlways good talking to the\nRight Danny know blurb bleacher report checkout to step in uh the red Sox show that they enjoy their parade today and there are twenty nine other teams around major league baseball hoping that it's something different next year and the red Sox would be tough to topple for all those American League teams and\nA boy I mean that would be a terrible or outcome for them to do it ... put out there you know ... Bryce Harper sticks it the nationals and Mandy Machado is added to this division\nI even if Jay ... gets moved out of it it it it could get a lot tougher a very quickly here for the Mets so yeah they\nYou know when you start talking about the guys in the top of the free agent market and and you want to see the Mets make those moves in some is keep it in a way from the Philadelphia Phillies and that could be\nA reason to make a move on somebody as well because the Phillies they look great for the first what Ninety percent of the season they faded down the stretch your young team Aaron no it wasn't as great the last few starts with a year for him as he had been before\nUm but that team they have talent they really do I don't know the gay ... the answer there but they've got a ton of talent and it's just a matter of time until they get back to being the kind of danger that we saw in the not too distant past\nI Would take some calls coming up eight hundred three two one zero seven TEN Sports don't repeat McCarthy on the voice of New York seven ten W O R\nDrowsy show must go on comes from these fears musical comedy him get ticketed the musical dot com [noise]\nIf cancer treatment didn't work call Dr Lederman we hit the cancer brain body prostate called two one two choices two and two choices most insurance is Medicare Medicaid accepted Dr Lederman two one two choices thirtieth and Broadway\nVagaries of where\nIn the W O R sports when you look on the [noise]\nMy interesting no today from Andrew marsh and of the New York Post's than\nAm ESPN China ramp up its baseball tonight coverage I kind of this upcoming year and apparently they reached out to David right at about becoming a an analyst for them and I'm David Wright did turn them down but\n... has the ability or to potentially you know be on TV in the future maybe it is and why down the line\nUh but uh you know I think as David Wright talked about a lot over is final few weeks he wants to be able to spend some time and and home is too young girls to raise and\nYou get a feel for for that part of life from sure spent more time at home than maybe otherwise would have liked but even a with his rehab a lot of it sent them out to California out to Florida so even though he wasn't playing\nOr he still wasn't necessarily you know at home with the family uh and then you know what happens a lot of players that Dick is you know they they get their life slows down some embrace it and you know fit right into the next chapter in in some guys get antsy and they want to do something\nAnd you know for David right I I don't think anybody would be surprised to see him doing some television and you know apparently did express some interest in you know being involved in in a front office so\nUh you know for a per day right now still some options there but not exactly surprising they turned down a TV opportunity or right away it's not going to be you know show up once a month and a share some thoughts are eight o'clock hour Howard balls are the sports exchange will talks menopause with him coming up right now and is up to\n[noise] no they definitely do and they're you know there are only two games out of first place and so yeah I think that this was just a situation where Fowler just wasn't producing for them they have you know good starters on the defensive line and he was a situational guy and so a lot of teams they have younger guys there that are\nJust just around them so they figured this was also an opportunity to give some give a younger guy some more playing time\nAnd you give up a player that probably wasn't going to be with your next year anyway so it'll be interesting to see if the if the jaguars can write their ship in the second half of the season because right now they're they're just not playing good football even though they did put up a pretty good fight against the eagles and\nIn London last week if they they they need to win obviously a lot of their division game and that's what they're going to have to do to close that gap with the Texans who of course brought on\nA dumb areas Thomas at receiver\nAfter losing a will full or in the Thursday night game last week and that's a big loss for them Thomas is not full or in terms of speed or any of the other things but he does give them another good pass catcher that can at least somewhat help ah with with the injury that occurred with solar\n... what is that they can have a decent squad again right as its Peyton Manning retired it always feels like the winter comes out nine and seven and it you know like a guinea playoff spot\nYeah you know last last year that the jaguars course ended up sending six\nAnd so you know I thought everyone thought that they were going to be at least that good\nThis year the remember they started off very hot ... a bit of a bad run since then I thought you know I wondered about Tennessee because of the new head coach and mark is Mary oh to still get banged up and injured and but the culture I mean the culture are into\nA you know aren't a threat to win that division right now but they're playing a lot better football and a lot of it\nFor them at least ... as trace\nTheir office of line up playing better and they started running the ball and we can talk about a passing legal we want and it definitely is but I ... I still believe I Am old school pretty I'm old school I still think it's important\nTo have that good running game and the colds look like they're starting to develop that with a healthy Andrew Luck or they they could be in the hunt for Activision you know once again they're not going to win eleven games but who knows like you said nine and seven might end up winning that\nHe doesn't need much help Andrew Luck or just a little bit over the years would certainly get him where he needs to be as we chat with Howard ... of the sports exchange right now you mentioned markets barrier there and and the lightning of injuries that he's had to deal with I think back to that drab class where everyone's arguing Mary auto or Jamie It's Wednesday and\nAnd now when since bench by Tampa for Ryan Fitzpatrick\nWho do you hold out more help can maybe not live up to what everyone thought they could be but at least have an ... along NFL career here out of those too\nYeah I'm not sure that either will be quite honest so I I like Mary ... Mary odor for what he can do but the problem is trying to figure out how to utilize skills because it's so dangerous when you have a guy that runs you\nKnow the ... because they tend to get injured and that's what's happened with him and he hasn't shown consistency\nOf throwing the ball in the pocket listed it has that ability in the pocket but the mistakes that he makes and the bad decisions that lead to interceptions is very troubling you know it's one thing would have happened is your first couple of years in a league but when you're in you're poor\nAnd it's still occurring that that's a big problem you know I saw I saw an interesting note today that the buccaneers\nSince their inception have drafted twenty four quarterbacks and none of them have ever gotten a second contract\nHe says that's that's the and right now there's questions whether he'll get on I mean he'll be on his ... year option\nNext year which is worth around twenty million dollars and I just don't know how as a team you can go into next season and pay that money for him and so it'll be interesting to see what happens with Brian Fitzpatrick there and what and and obviously what happens with some of the rest of the season\nNow despite that quarterbacks that they do have a Super Bowl or they can hold ads on that but that the that that is pretty uh pretty bad ... jet spurts Baghdad or a bad run a core release the jets had like a a Chad Pennington made it to a second contract yeah\nI'll bet that most people can't even remember the the quarterback who was\nWho who who was a you know who's the guy during that Superbowl year when John Bruton came in and took over ... ... does each team that was Brad jobs yeah and and in his next year's I mean John grid and never developed\nA quarterback there with Tampa Bay and that was one of the big reasons why they were just essentially a five hundred team after that Superbowl year\nIs that any ... for him with a guy we thought was a decent quarterback in uh in car there in Oakland huh\n[laughter] yeah right now it's not he he did he did have a pretty decent game\nLast week so I I still believe there's hope for him you know they've had a bunch of issues there now they traded Cooper you know the running game has been you know a question mark and and the office of line hasn't played as\nA as well as it has oh I'm Sorry as well as it did two seasons ago so I I still think car can be a good quarterback but like any team like any quarterback you have to have the players around you and that that's why I kind of ...\nI Know I'm sure you've been talking to you guys have been talking about it they're all we can all the stations and all the papers about oh the giants have to give Kyle all lead a chance to see to see what you know to see what he has well what were you really learn they're not going to protect him any better than they protect the lie manning\nAnd the results will probably be worse I mean like if the guy killed so if he's struggling what does it prove it doesn't prove anything and so you have to have the players around you and go you know you we mentioned the rams\nI mean here's an amazing one of the most amazing staff so that I see in a season and a half now going back to the store to twenty Seventeen the rams offensive line\nHas not the ... the group that they went into the season starting has not ... has not missed any start\nIn a meaningful game the only start that any of their offensive lineman missed was four of them that were arrested in the final regular season game last season when the rams knew their playoff seating and couldn't\nDo anything to change it other than that every guy has started every game you don't see that but when you have that and you have that stability in that line these guys are playing together then\nYou can do excellent things with your off and it's and and obviously the rams are doing that\nNow one of the reasons the ramp caught guard or John Brown and the giants actually picked him up you will probably walk in and be their best at the climate right off the bat here with the way things have gone and we watched you know I've been watching a lot of not so great football here between the giants and to some degree the jets don't want the you mentioned the ran I Love watching this team I what\nI was surprised they weren't able to move the ball a whole lot early on against Green Bay bought love the grass aggressive things that they make upon make something happened that willing to go for it on board down which may may is done there and it ... it's a total culture change just by being aggressive\nYeah no I mean it is the thing is\nAnd you hear it all the time it seems that aren't aggressive oh why don't they try this won't try that when you have the players they have here\nThen you feel confident in being grass that because you know you have players that can I can go out there\nAnd make plays when you don't have those play makers then you're you'll be thirty second attendance certain that all the time and then everybody will say to your your your your office has horrible so that all naval you to do those things especially when you can protect your quarterback\nBut I'll tell you the one thing about the rams and it's gonna be interesting\nA great match up this weekend when they play the saints you know the number one you have ... Gurley number one Russia and the league going against the saints were number one against the run and and the rams in a in a couple of if you are games when they've come against you know good defense and the Packers habits\nGame you have a billion pitching changes left and right and and that's\nThis has become the norm Dave Roberts is using three four pictures to get through single half inning and every time commercial break as the guy comes in and warms up and you have all this time that gets away from you what it is no action and I do think that\nIs an issue after a while because you're most exciting moments are happening well after midnight\nAnd it's the same thing this year with the game three that ended at three thirty in the morning the\nProblem isn't that goes to three thirty you know and that's what made it nuts and kind of an oddity a but\nLast year game five which was a super exciting game um you know the back and forth a ton of runs that game had all the action you'd want\nAnd people were tuning out they were losing viewers once it hit midnight on the east coast\nAnd that's not east coast viewers check it out that's overall the whole country you're losing people watching when the most dramatic moments are happening you cannot cross that line once you're crossing the line\nWhere people who want to watch are watching are turning your game off when it's at its most thrilling most dramatic because they physically can't stay up any longer they're either fall asleep on the couch or\nThey've got to get to bed to get up the next morning\nAnd that's a problem and if you're not going to solve the length of the games you gotta move ma\nAnd it\nComes down to this I I Know it's very east coast view\nWell just fine but on the west coast you missed the first couple of innings of the game so be it\nYou don't want people missing the exciting moments in the back end of the games those are the most of the world series memories that live on and on max months he's Homer that should be a moment that you see I Know they lost the series but there should be a moment that that lives on some degree\nAnd yet most people didn't get just to see it because it happened so dang late a game five the way that that game ended last year a that ends up being too late for the vast majority of people to see what people will be ... sport they have to be able to watch the biggest moment since I got an NFL season\nAnd then you can't stay up late enough to watch the Superbowl well\nYou're not going to have that same attachment to the sport to the game when when that's the case that the one on one to me and when the ratings consistently show once you go past midnight in the east coast you're losing viewers overall as a big problem is I Would do everything I could if I was baseball makes sure\nGames aren't going past that point a ... a quick call here Ritchie in Putnam county what's up Ritchie\nAgree with you that you're trying to remember listening restriction trick or treat your sorority all my pockets with the war going on sleep in trouble at school but anyway my question Jewish or ... what is she covered by insurance usually heal produce you operations is she going to make sure we're going to ensure\nThey have insurance but I have not seen the terms\nOf it ... it was kind of odd that we knew exactly what the terms of David writes insurance we're in and how much money the Mets were getting back I have not\nSeen that aspect of it with that but it's but they had said he they are covered by insurance in some way\nOkay I'm On the shoot 'em up [laughter]\nYou know he's not going anywhere they don't they\nKnow we just heard it like the Mets can expect anything out of them next year and they've got one year until he's a free agent uh know team's gonna you know take a chance on that right now\nA literature art to really enjoy your show your your ordinary agree with you I'm sure\nIt was All right back to that Ritchie uh yeah I mean ... isn't going anywhere or the ... process has to be\nThat you're not getting anything out of him this upcoming year it and that's\nWhy this is a big off season they do have to go out and find some impact either a couple of impact badge or one really impact a bad to put in the middle of this line up a but in the\nCase says you've surgery on both of your heels uh he had the most recent one the second of those surgeries or last week I can take a while for him to make his way back there hoping he could be active in some way in spring training I wouldn't\nCount and like games but they haven't really given a timetable for his return\nLive you've surgery on both of your feet you be able to stand out in left field day after day after day and you know spring when you need to sprint down in the box when you need to uh he says feet were on fire\nLast year we finally made this public after he came back from one game to play against the Yankees are on a friday night and as a bat\nIf memory serves me correctly Homer that night it doesn't matter he doesn't need his feet to be a good ... player but\nHe's got to be able to do enough to play left field and that's the concern with the Mets are there are an A. L. team alright easier da ...\nEven first base is it a great option for him because it's so crowded there you've got Pete Alonzo Jay Bruce potentially Wilmer floor as Tom Smith all in that mix right now\nHow is that the position where you're going to get you on a ... at bats and ... be the priority but\n... going to have to play Jay Bruce in right field every day he had foot problems this year I I just think that whole thing is dicey so you got to go in thinking you're not going to get anything out assessment as and if you get something great\nAh but um yeah it's a it's a tricky tricky situation in in ... I don't know how much of a factor this would be but you know that's but his his agent is now\nWhat are his former agent is now the general manager of the ... the bandwagon and he knows a little bit of what makes a un assessment of tech\nEight hundred three two one zero seven tend to number a well at some oddities and the sports news with producer mark and we come back sports and with the McCarthy hung the voice of New York's ... W O R\nYeah we sort of stopped paying attention and racked up a lot of\nThat yeah it was stressful he blamed in April my credit card debt and I blame him for building not\nPutting off a building that dream home\nNow is the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider will find you the loan them the right for\nCall today and let me get storey\nCase it's awesome anyway we stop blaming each other dinner homework and read that a smart way to consolidate debt is to get a fixed rate loan but getting a loan was brutal ad time drain so I was in my man cave researching personal loans and I found best egg they have an a plus rating would it be", "show_name": "WOR Tonight with Joe and Lis", "year": "2018", "city": "New York", "day": "01"}
