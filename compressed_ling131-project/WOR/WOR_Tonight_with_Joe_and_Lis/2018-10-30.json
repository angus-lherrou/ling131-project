{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "The situation a few times a three and five and just looking at the rest of the season and you know they have the dolphins and then their home in Buffalo and then they have by being no you know they know that\nThat the rest of the season hinges on what happens over the next few weeks because if they can get some wins in the division well you know then suddenly they're looking pretty good you know and and they're back to five hundred and they could look at some positives and and know that okay well\nYou know this is this is something we can build off of and and move forward so um you know and that the markets mace it today you know hey we we have it all in front of us you know we have a bunch of division games left\nUm yes they have to against the patriots and at this point I you know I don't know you if you would get that much of a chance but you have those two division games against the true against buffalo one against Miami that's a lot you can make some noise and and build on that for the future so\nYes this is a critical junction and they know that they they're looking at this as you know we've got to come out and be a heck of a lot better than we have in the last two weeks\nAnd they expect to be any healthier the Sunday\n[noise] that's a good question I mean God both doesn't give us much in in the uh\nYou know in terms of injuries and especially not on a Monday but\nUm you know hopefully they get back Ronnie Anderson in ... in practice at all last week so I'm like you know it's it looks like it's kind of a week to week thing um see they need they need somebody you know so let's see what happens tomorrow or maybe they bring somebody in\nA ... you know with the trade a deadline coming up uh that they could use somebody just somebody who gives them a spark\nA to make some place because that's that's what they eat at this moment\nExpecting them all [noise] [noise] I don't have any picture move right that they gave up the second round for a Darnell\nThing that's the thing yeah so I wouldn't expect anything\nYou know just like a huge splash it you know people talking about the Marius Thomas being uh an attractive option for a lot of teams I just don't know the jets have enough\nUm to get a guy like that a little slower but a ... you know at this point I think anything will help me and asked her what we saw yesterday with the ... and it's just somebody who can catch\nSomebody who can get basic requirements onto the jets are like ... that don't jump on a false start ah Dennis ... of the Associated Press a bag so much for coming on tonight Dennis ... she had it\nYou got any time Pete\nHow you to go up there a dentist was acting you know yesterday a number of things about that game that drive you nuts\nTo recall and you know this is a dangerous runner they allow him to get out open on a screen paths every Williamson blew the coverage machine from the jets are against various running backs over the course of this year that's a big play ah the kills gang green a mixture ... it's\nNot a good drummer you know it's how often on third down he's looking to run he's like Blake portals it's exactly\nWhat you're ... role is on that bears team it's a ... like roll out don't turn the ball over and pick up some first down with your legs\nAnd you you have to know that about ... and at times the jets were spying on him and they're just letting them and he picked up some big dark rooms in that second half yesterday\nUh so you know that those are the things that drive you nuts because they're predictable and and I get a it's a it's a hard thing\nTo contain\nA quarterback that had some escape ability some ability to move and a big arm on top of it but\nYou know you're busy might have a big army he has no idea where it's going to make a beach down the field and the jets did not do that often enough yesterday you know they scored a touchdown light when they finally got the ... going to get within seven and then\nUh the defense at that point just looked exhausted and got run over by the Chicago Bears are but to me\nYou know it's an effort is not good enough for the jets are coming together as a team isn't good enough it's great\nThat same Donald is developing that was the a number one this year but you also want to see this team start to develop a winning culture and an identity\nAnd they're not moving in that direction when\nTodd Bowles is saying what he's saying after yesterday's game\nAnd to me uh that that's the most problematic thing out of yesterday is that up more so under man in you know the fact we're able to keep it close okay and that's not good enough for the bears aren't one of the elite teams in football\nIt's winnable game they're very good team there seven an apt point favorites but\nYou got to find a way to to stay competitive there and you can't lose by fourteen and just shrug it off and say well the ... was good this was good and bench really got to turn around and the expectation has to be the when you want to teach your young quarterback that to\nEight hundred three two one zero seven than uh we'll get into the giants uh twenty Thirteen laws of the Redskins or the other day Patricia trainer of the athletic go we'll talk giants with us at eight oh five is the sports people card they on the voice of New York seven ten W O R I\nCan get what you were a lot\nMore to go with the MacArthur your [noise]\nAnother aspect of the jets lawsuit bears is a twenty four to ten\nI get that there are undermanned we talked about my ... poor drafting over the years at least in the later rounds where they don't have depth on this roster they have some injuries and they don't have star power at a number of positions is they're trying to put this whole thing together\nBut one thing that you see the jets they don't take chances are they're willing to\nLose like cowards to me and you watch the best teams in the league\nTheir coaches take some ... they gamble and it's easy to gamble\nWhen you have one of the best op ed says in the NFL but I'm watching Sean McMurray on the rams yesterday and they're really had a hard time moving the ball against the Packers deep and one of the few times this year the rams have been ...\nSo what do they do they think a pond and they broke for the first down take a chance\nOf Fort down it's not automatic hunt field goal Web Fort them when they go for it\nAgain they're better set up to pick up a fourth and short than say the jets but how about some trickery on special teams how about something imaginative ... a gadget play to try to make something happen and you didn't know that from the jets it is a land\nBrand of football that\nWhen you are under man why one takes the chances what wouldn't you take some shots but wouldn't you run a gadget play fake upon fake feel go do something to try to catch you pointed off balance to try to steal a victory\nAnd the jets don't do that and they feel more comfortable at times losing by a tiny amount that potentially being blown out alright fitzpatrick through all those interceptions against the chiefs Bakri is with the jets who cares\nI don't mind that seven intercepted several talked a buddy keep forcing the ball you're down to three scores you got the ball down ... makes a map\nAnd and that's not I think that you have to have lost as far as the plight calling and the creativity and big rush them in the head coach is concerned you need that\nSome time believing your guys take a chance and the jets seemed all too comfortable or to lose by only two scores to the ... bears or last night we'll get into the giants and the another dismal performance from their up and coming up a Patricia train of the athletic be with us right now in his update\nTime wanting to see what Kyle Love letter the backup quarterback the rookie that they drafted who you know may or may not be the long term answer you know I can see the logic and wanting to see him but you know I I just think that as long as the giants are still mathematically ally\nFor a playoff spot and I know you know that's hard to believe that one in ... that\nThey still are but they are um\nI think he lives will be the quarterback\nAnd you know maybe we don't see a wild letter until I was maybe the last word games the season we might see him active you know after the by weak and maybe he gets the mop up snaps but I I don't think he's going to get true significant snaps until later on in the year when all is absolutely lost\nAbout in practice that this law to start to get some extra reps as we go along here even before you even if it was a you know at the the thirteenth game that he gets in real action\nWell it's interesting we don't get to see the the uh practices in season but today head coach pat ... said that well let it does get reps in practice now here's the caddy it's well let it getting reps in practice you know you have to think it's the as the scout teen quarterback because the team's getting ...\n... the number two quarterbacks you would think he would probably be active on game day and not ... who has been active on game day so it could just be a matter of semantics you know ... trying to just quite the grumble about whether or not well that is getting wraps but um I Do think as they go on as each week goes on\nHis his work was going to increase in\n... it's just a matter of time before he gets a gained a uniform\nAnd the giants course made some moves this past week or dealt away you know apple Damon Harrison and on the defensive\nLine how do you build a team reacted to those moves and then you know go out in and try to win a football game that's under\nWell you know speaking on the deep end you know who obviously were affected by those two losses uh they play pretty well they played well enough to win they only gave up a\nLot for most of the game that day and how the thirteenth six a deficit and then you know there was that last ... last ditch touchdown by Adrian Peterson so the\nThe things I thought you know say for a play here and there which you know we've seen all year long anyway uh they said well enough to when I'm you know so\nIt was the next minute up and and it was an opportunity for the giants to take a look at their future you know they brought up grant Haley\nTo play quarterback and he was rotating in the slot that the Sean Chandler ... free agents made the roster on the defense of wind BJ held out and Thompson Kerry when all that increased opportunities with daemon Harris\nAnd God so I I think as a whole everybody responded well there was just you know you usually break down here to break down there which led to the Washington points\nIs the room in a better place that the team or you know locker room is it in a better place than it was at this time last year\nI think so there's not any fighting going on that I Know up there you know nobody has broken any rules to where they\nYou know gotten fine you know for being late or whatever I just think you know the ... there's more leadership in that law school and then there was this time last year the giants actually doubled the number of leaders they had um you know with veteran guys\nWere you which you know had been with the team a long time ... and a landing Collins and then three new covers household between Michael Thomas and they sold her so that leadership you know it it might not be the ... type you know like what we we were called with an trouble Antonio peers when they were here\nBut those guys had done a really good job in and just\nPolicing the locker room making sure that everybody does what they're supposed to do and that there is no you know pointing fingers at each other know dissension you know against the coaches or anything like that\nAnd what do you see a say over the last few weeks and do do back and junior did the interview with ESPN and I did have one you know it was ridiculous highlight reel one hand catches a in traffic yesterday that the U.S don't make\nYou go wow a book where have you noticed any change to his personality and and now he's been in that room since you know over the last few weeks here\nI think he's been humbled you know the the losing obviously you know it's not fun it's not fun to be on the losing team has not only a few of the media to cover losing team day in and day out so I spent almost ... uh like a a level of humility from back on who you know\nRealize that his comments in that interview maybe they were taken the wrong way or you know they came off I'm In a context that he did not need it to 'em but\nHe knows he's part of the team and no one is is blameless in this mess you know you went as a team you lose as a team and it was nice to hear oh down the other day say I also have to do more\nBecause you know when when guys start saying you know all this one's fault for all I think we have a problem that quarterback or whatever and they don't love themselves into the problem when they're very much a part of it you know because they were on the the the\nThe team that struggling that's the problem and I and I did go kudos for stepping up and saying you know I also have to do more to help us when\nNow is a criticism of the interview that he did with ESPN a few weeks ago I never really pointed it out of self ah and you know talked about ... and some of the other problems happening there with the giants are a little difference that you can hear\nOver these last few weeks or reach out again with Patricia trade of the athletic tomorrow or the NFL trade deadline giants have already been an active team do you expect anything more up from the squad potentially by tomorrow\nOh well they say never say never um I think\nIf you look down the list you know supposedly everybody's available for the right price except for like ... I'm Barkley or you know ... and even though I Do I just don't see them trading or do I know there was a report that\nTeams have a quiet about him but I just think from a chap standpoint I I Can't see the giants doing it and you know like I pointed out in an article I wrote you have to go through the rubble and you have to pick out the pieces of what you want to build a foundation but with that said I think\nThe most likely go to a move would probably be ... I mean that's the guy um\nHe he's just he's had his share of struggles this year and he's got to hike cap number and I just\nI Would be very very shocked even if he if he survives betray deadline I Would be shocked if he's in the long term plans\nRight Patricia trying to upset a job covering the giants but the athletic and the banks much got on the show tonight Patricia\nThanks for having me there was not a good stuff they took out of work a again a on the athletic up on what's happened with these giants and recovered job for a long time or knows what she's talking about and ah for ah for the giants here and it's just an ugly season\nThat has another week [laughter] there's\nThere's nothing that happened yesterday that is wow look at this book of this problem it's all a buildup of the same issues time and again\nAs they fall to one in seven ... moved the ball you lie with turnovers some inopportune times they can't block for him at all\nAny deep ends with a decent path rush can just tee off on the line you know exactly where he's going to be it's not a problem cutting through that opposites of wine and even with all the weapons that the giants have from ... to ... to\nA avid anger room to a sterling shepherd they have weapons and they can not\nOften enough to get the ball into the hands of their play makers to actually bring out what\nCould have been a good ... and it's proof positive you can't build from the outside in ... it's got to be inside out especially if you're going to have a quarterback that needs protection needs time\nOr to make some things happened and I thought yesterday even some of the reads from Eli Manning were often your veteran quarterback it's one thing when physically you can't do what you could do ten years ago\nNBA is the deal with the MGM GM as well yeah so they both\nLegs with the same gambling house or do the NBA didn't tournament they call the gaming NHL\nBetting partnership was the exact\nWorld the NHL said Betty ... they were a little more honest about it and you know they've been braced Las Vegas they got the eyes there now so uh they're they're jumping in it's going to be a big thing football baseball you wait it's going to be everywhere and the not too distant future DNA could be here in New York as well exactly or perhaps by this winter\nI think every team is based or every leaves basically envisioning from your seat you can bet on who's going to make the next field goal\nA lot of money to be made like that and it it provides interest in games that people wouldn't otherwise\nWatch yes exactly now we're both big Twitter users or how do you feel about the like button I'm okay with it well it's an affirmation sometimes all young soon a Twitter is getting rid of the like button and people are very very angry about it on Twitter ironically they won't\nLike that the status that they're ah they're losing it but I was a kind of stole it from Facebook right and yeah there are certain time or you want to you like it was something it was a star ferrets a favorite show it's kinda the same thing I don't know why they would get rid of that at all people were using the favorite and the same way and actually I don't like but\nThey want to change the discourse and I I don't understand how changing the like button I think they're issue was that um [noise] the more of an agitator you are the more of a following you tend to build and you get those retweet some like some lives and things of that nature\nBut that's that's just the nature of the culture out the twitters just reflection of that you say outlandish things\nSome people disagree with is that people agree with you they do so vehemently and you know this is how things go\nYou know when it's winter I don't think here's their use is very well people like people trading like things like we ask for you to get rid of all the bad people on Twitter that say mean things you get rid of the like button like they don't really listen to their users very well but there is somebody else who really doesn't like Twitter do you remember\nMy gundy yes for that guy that guy he went on another rent now and I'm just to let you listen to the full thing it's forty five seconds\nCriticism where from where\nQuarter radio or a rat's ass about Twitter [noise]\nA platform for people that are sitting home trawling John employment check sitting in front of a keyboard [noise]\nReally disregard and what you're saying\nTrust me I get it in my own house but I I mean I just kind of felt like the\nSocial media and Twitter is what's destroying this country anyway so that's how I feel about it from politics to sports whatever yes people a platform to [noise] and then other people are like needle in it and they're sitting at home and they are laid off a payment so anyway that's how I feel\nSo apparently were unemployed and don't make any money and we're lazy because of Twitter\nNo my ... like what are we not very often\nBut I you know what I think of as those are people expressing opinions that are fans of his team yeah and they might be critical in the moment during the game\nBut these on his hair lay\nThe trolls and those people out there is people that are communicated with the beat reporters or whatever or on their own uh you know a site they're expressing their opinions on the game and it gets out in real time now so this is what your fans who are thinking\nHere we are presenting it to you but to to not to social media sounds fine but to me you're not in your fans when\nYou're saying what he's doing and that's that's fans of the program these talking about the people are going out a way to troll Oklahoma State\nExactly almost all of his fans are probably on Twitter and he claimed the devices ruining the country I don't really understand that part\nThat that that's a different conversation da but if you're going to say that he's not worried about unemployed folks on Twitter listen those people are talking about Oklahoma State or people who care about your team\nThe program yeah you you're you're knocking your own band\nBut he did give us a great soundbite and then you have that forever exactly everybody's problem is it better than I Am a man I'm far more now is because I like to better it's such a like he made a really good ...\n... some talent to it did you sell the ... I don't think it's\nA shame pretty angry and we [laughter]\nHe's got that got forty anymore I think he's like fifty\nOr a Mark Twain or producer mark without any thank you mark mhm\nYes bringing that to the table appreciate it a hate I did three two one zero seven than a steep Philips ... general manager weighed in on the bandwagon and earlier on the program on that point when we come back sports with the McCarthy on the voice in New York seven ten wor\nThey don't putting off building that dream home\nNow perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider find you've alone then you write for\nCall it today and let's start\nPossible health introducing new Medicaid plans in Virginia and helping you get the most from your Medicaid benefits were more on line and go family care dot com that's go family cared dot com will call a three three four six seven eight to five nine for Medicaid plans from after my health\n[noise]\n\nYou have car insurance for the big stuff but I think you know pointed goes unmentioned is the fact that he's insurance premiums are going up twenty thirty percent of review and ... and I never raised her prices is is killing the economy it's killing jobs it's taking\nMoney trying to be noisy but are you making at fifty bucks a patient I'm I I I make a monthly you making any money\n[laughter] that's what we're going to be married and has been acquired yeah yeah\nThis has not been acquired by the big boxes you know we're able to keep the practices afloat or able to drive interest in primary care were able to treat people in the rural communities these practices are in inner city there are critical access hospital are critical access communities in suburban and urban setting a and it's worked out\nVery quickly in Saint poor people in America people we defined as poor or lower income they can pay fifty bucks a month and they can get a hold are you twenty four seven and if they need to Z pack they're going to walk out with a Z pack and pay above the Z pack\nWhich I don't know yet they should be able to get think about it the poor and ... the more you need a mock it might treated a study on Oregon's Medicaid system in only twenty cents on the dollar cut to the recipient\nDon't believe either have a a functioning current car insurance gas money to get to the doctor if you're poor you can texture doctor you can email you can call them you don't have to leave the house necessarily because the doctors are\nAnd how many patients you have a we have about six or seven hundred per doctor\nOkay so what what kind of way and I think it's like most practices and probably most of your patients like me I\nReally don't want to see you unless I really need you unless I'm saying hello or you know saying let's go fishing together hum this most people drink but there's probably at least ten patients of every practice what they call you every day I'm assuming\nWe we have our ... and are you\nA we had her height we have our high utilize there's a we have a few pains and they asked it never stops you know we factored that in um the other part of the\nProgram we have doctors coming from a three hundred and fifty doctors from forty one states descending on our land do this weekend to attend the conference to learn how to set up their practices after this so now with or a thousand practices nationwide already practicing the director model or we're looking at increased that just by thirty percent with one conference alone\nOr the interest is massive will keep growing and as long as we could policies were placed the state and federal level that continue to allow these practice to\nTo grow and blossom or you'll see this movement weaving all across the country are getting better access better care for their cost\nUs and I got to tell you any Democrat that is telling you anything about healthcare that's out now is they're talking point we're offering healthcare a ... and Republicans will take you take care of preexisting conditions that line\n...

S. CCAs here to protect you\nYou know there's so many questions going in to how this is all\nGoing to come together and work and it's not totally unexpected varieties first second day on the job but there weren't a ton of clear answers right there was a lot of talk hate this team can contend as soon as next year\nWe didn't get that blueprint of ... Brody bandwagon and is planning on now you don't necessarily expect that we're not going to get the full story of what he told the will ponds and ownership about how he's going to\nGet this team after two straight seasons where they have lost Ninety plus games how they're going to get them\nBack on track but you'd like to have you know a little bit more of a clear picture of a blip Brodie bandwagon and it's going to be all about as a general manager and in my opinion you didn't get much as far as specifics uh you got that as an agent yeah he's\nGot to understand analytics the language of analytics to sell his clients are we talk quite a bit last night about oh scouting\nBackground you got to draft the right players develop players have a system in your organization that's huge that was one of the big focus has been the Mets\nGoing into this search and Brodie bandwagon and isn't exactly you know a former farm director scouting director and what he and the Mets were saying today is that as an agent really bandwagon and CIA ... he's a\nFrom a previously ways an agent may have to be able to recognize who's going to be the future young talent in the game and that when these guys are drafted they're already attached to an agent so I\nI'm curious how much of that is the agents doing legwork or they just going to the big advance you know the underarm are all American game and things like that and\nAnd you know whoever they can talk to establish a relationship with that too they're going after ah but you know the agents do have some degree of scouting that they have to be able to accomplish in order to build those relationship represent the players and you don't wanna be representing a bunch of ten ... you want to be representing the guys\nBetter be getting the big paychecks are at the top of the drought so now that it's something similar to what teams would go through a bed an agency has to be able to cover but again you know how exactly will that translate\nTo a baseball team and you know that it is is unclear or you know clearly the situation with so many of his clients\nHaving been part of a New York Mets organization and now he is you know this vested or from you know the CIA and they're not as clients any longer and said there his players as the general manager and one of the key guys there of course\nIs Jacob ... and Bruce back of NBC asking one of the a clear question for today\nYou said in July the ... to either treat the ... or\nGive them a contract now that you are the Mets how will you handled the crumbs contract situation Sher\nDidn't expect that question today [noise]\nSo so chicken decorum clearly has a status himself as the best pitcher in baseball or hopefully in in a couple of weeks he'll be awarded with the with that trophy or you know as I said earlier I think that uh you want to try to identify the best players and you want to keep them for as long as possible\nAnd if our vision direction does not intend to include day long sustainable winning team then you have to consider moving players but make no mistake I Believe Jacob dramas if an incredible talent and I hope to keep them for a long time\nSo yeah he's not going to run out and back up the branch drug he understands what the situation is here uh ... what is interesting is that\nBandwagon and we'll have to recuse himself from certain negotiations and will not be able to take part in how exactly that is going to work out will be interesting he's not going to be across the table from Jacob ... Jake the grounds new agent at CIA or otherwise however that pans out\nOr he is going to have to have somebody else the organization handle uh some of those negotiations you have you thought there was going to be some great advantage to him being the general manager\nI think it is still there as you're going to still have those inside insights ... shortly there'll be some talking behind the scenes but\nUh it's not going to be like bandwagon into across the table there and that's a lot of players within the organization a lot of key players or the ...\nCenter guard you on his chest but as a ... Todd Frasier I mean you go down the list a ... and some of their top prospects as well you know three the top pitching prospects in the organization we're all broke the bandwagon and clients as well so you'll have to recuse himself from some of those negotiations when they do come up but I Would think\nHe'd be able to say hey this is what we're thinking financially on the Jacob ... deal and we want to make sure we have this guy back\nHe did talk about today\nWanting to build the culture and wanting to reward the players who do perform well I think any fan is behind that you see a guy come up in the organization go about things the right way those are the guys that you want to sign on long term and keep in your uh within your franchise and Jake the ground certainly\nA falls under that umbrella or more generally here's broadly bandwagon in on what bands can expect\nWe had a lot of work to do in the coming days and weeks to build a championship roster and to put a good process in place for good decision making [noise]\nBut I Want to assure all met fans that every person this organization will be fearless\nAnd relentless pursuit of greatness\nEveryone we working together in this effort\nThat will include players scouts coaches and the front office [noise]\nWe'll start with our major league roster where we already have some of the most talented players in the game [noise] we won fused new talent to the roster to supplement what is already in place and the foundation that we have\nWe won't be creative as you said will be collaborative and we will be proactive [noise]\nWe will invest in our scouting department will invest in our player development\nOur health and wellness and our analytics\nNone of these investments will be mutually exclusive from the other\nWill be priorities [noise]\nThroughout my career I've come to understand that character and make a\nCritical keys to success\nUh trying to get away with entering suppliers he not only hit Hayes who's Aguilar foot as we talked about in the ... crossing first base and clearly intentionally\nHe also stepped on the heel of Steve Pearce ice constantly hitting the catchers in the head and I understand you have a long swing but when it happens over and over and over I I\nJust gives me a bad taste in my mouth ... someone ... town would want that talent pool watching him every day and in some of the things he did over the course of the post season if that's the kind of player a person that he is is a competitor that All right they're not\nOutwardly violent obviously violent but they're like the little things that you can get away with\nAnd say well I didn't see that in the U.S but I didn't know is a you know the catchers had was in that spot I Belong back swing\nThe kind of things you can make excuses for but when you see a consistently it's like do we try to get away with here and I did that wouldn't be a player I Want to watch every day as a ... and ...\nOr a home run that I Know that changes everybody's tune a but a lot of the things that I Would want to see a you know just me personally or that\nI don't mind the black also sometimes no drive some people nuts it's a long season I don't understand how you don't do it in the ... World Series but I I can overlook some of those things but the\nStepping on the thirty plays a spiking an at second base and a lot of nonsense there but those are the kinds of decisions that GM has to make ... you say it's all about character is your first move going to be to convince the bonds to pony up three hundred million dollars in Simon and Machado and making your franchise guy\nA dining Lyndon you're optimistic after today\nWell water does and that means so much let's take a look at the body of work over the next couple of months and we have that's that will make our judgment and what you have to consider the Mets I mean last year they were Seventy seven eighty five I didn't lose Ninety by the way they said well the last two and a half months but\nThe thing is if we can get\nStay reasonably healthy we can't seem to do that that was my question earlier assemble guarded pitched a foot six much\nHe would have won five more games and assessments I paid a hundred and forty five games he wish us we'll talk with er let's say food victories and showed the seventies show that they would have been eighty six\nAnd a sham but we could have played this game after twenty Seventeen as well and then you had a lot of the same problems in Eighteen twenty\nSeven game say what you mean one twenty seventh day\nThey were better but they had the same issues you could have said well center guard made the extra twenty starts that he should have been Seventeen and says but it doesn't get hurt well it'd be better than Eighteen you you can't play the same game every year is what I'm saying\nYoung star in the mail that we know what to say that it was now now here's a story about a ... I think the question that you're putting us answer and it could turn out to be a tremendous shift is that's all you hear about it was Peter allows though if you hear about all that much in a while\nSo I think the question now he'll be out of the ocean now when we were\nIn the end of the two thousand fourteen she's a woman was Seventy nine and eighty three are being considered a possible life called contender at best in Fifteen I think we're closer now than we were going to be going back to the world series\nOr well it better be a you know that this is the window where they're supposed to be good that they were in a true rebuilding process from two thousand eleven through twenty four teams so they're supposed to be in a better position now than they were that\nUm yeah I I ... and thanks for the call done I I agree with some of what you're saying I Love ... I think he's middle of the line up he could carry line up for some some time I was encouraged by what we saw down the stretch last year\nOr not so much the win loss record overall but just the performance of certain players the fact that could Bordeaux looked like Michael could photo again in the second half Jeff McNeil\nI wouldn't say that future star but he certainly is an everyday second baseman and maybe he does perk up to that kind of level or you saw you know the pitching\nIt's one of the things that he pointed to that he likes about Mickey Callaway is that they need that kind of positivity ... around this team\n[noise] yeah I mean look I'm not a big fan of relentless positivity I\nAlso don't like the old I don't like old school negativity that I went through as a kid so there's got to be a be a balance somewhere but the mental\nAspect is big and the second thing that I don't share the optimism that they can stay healthy when it counts they never you know every team injuries but you know you're counting to achieve roasted thirty twenty of them are when they're out of the race what difference does it make [noise]\nYeah and and and that sort of ... Rob I'm\nYou know this team last year this past season for twelve games those guys keep count it mattered and they look great\nAnd then it went back from there and Joe June was a just an awful awful month a and after that yeah they perform better they were healthier a ... and you say it doesn't matter because it came after the games were truly relevant and I\nGet that um\nAnd it's going to be a test for them and there's no doubt that they have questions they're going to need to answer a they were healthier the second half last year I don't think game stopped mattering therefore you're healthier I Would say it's usually the opposite way more guys are more willing to take themselves out on the line up\nAnd I remember the Mets they did put in a lot of work to try to change their injury problem and and they felt that they were making some gains on that or or the second half of the year\nBut again as I talked about the topic today is all talk\nIs all talk today there's no true plan that was put forth as you you wouldn't necessarily expect to be\nMother also wasn't a whole lot of insight as to what kind of general manager Brody bandwagon and is going to be\nDoes he want to go big game hunting well he didn't give you a clear answer there what kind of team does he want to have and you know he wants a a a little bit of everything but isn't gonna put himself in any kind of a box it's so easy now to put the GM you're an analytical guy or you're a scout guy well he's trying to be both and play it in the middle\nSeat you don't have a clear idea after today\nOf what it's all about and we're going to have the judge based on the moves that are made and one of the most important things again dubberly bandwagon and is going to have to do\nIs convince ownership that they are close that\nIt's worthwhile to invest this extra ten Fifteen million dollars whatever it might be into the team that they can make it back and that it's going to be a wise choice that makes the Mets winter that they should be investing in analytics an injury prevention and scouting and he talked about investing in that today\nBut will\nActually increase the budget in those areas these are the spots where you know Brodie bandwagon and I think as to when initially building infrastructure\nOf the organization and uh you know obviously of eventually make the right call on you know some some big items in order to make this team at a true competitor next year I think they can\nNow compete with it and then at least that's relatively wide open right now are we were talking about World Series could dinner and they got a ways to go to\nTo get to that point a eight hundred three two one zero seven ten more calls coming up well Dave Lenin of Newsday his thoughts on today where the Mets are and how it's all going to work with the uh ...\nDid you come in dealing with some of his former clients on these New York Mets are that's all coming up again eight hundred three two one zero seven dead sports don't repeat McCarthy and the voice of New York ... W O R\nYeah and then when you work for an organization like ca and Brody kind of touched on this somewhat today is that you know your job is to find players you know your job is to find talented players to represent so as far as what he did and what a baseball team tries to do\nThat part isn't all that different you know you're trying to put together a roster of talent um now how are you able to do that on on a\nIndividual scale and competing with teams rather than other agencies you know again is is a different challenge there um so I I I think the strengths that he brings to this from a business hack your men\nAre certainly going to be helpful you know people talk a lot about his relationship with other agents and other GM's is that going to be a problem going forward on the GM side I don't think so ... uh with other agents uh that could be interesting to see\nNow we're talking with Dave Lenin of Newsday right now I have you spoken to many agents around and no we've gotten a feel for you know it's got Boris ... being a conflict of interest would anticipate that there is some anger out there from the agents side towards Brody\nA yeah it's rare that I've spoken to an agent that said something nice about another\nGiants and it turns out that part of the game\nRight fell and broke you touched on that today too is like you know a lot of people in that line of work with she used to be a tend to say things that are self serving a that's just part of the nature of the the beast with that uh listen when it comes with his dealings with those guys\nA lot of it's going to come down with the money on the table that's the bottom line when it comes to signing players so whatever animosity that may have existed or not I think they'll get through that the parts that I thought was kind of difficult is when they mentioned about him having to recuse himself from negotiations involving guys like the ... the guard\nAnother ca clients which\nTo me it gets a little hairy there you know that that's a big part of what a GM does um so again it's going to be that remains to be seen how they get through that\nNow and we're talking with Dave blend in Newsday right now I Would think like a lot of things you can always use back channel to give an idea right like a manager gets ejected from a ballgame buddies still pulling the strings are back in the ... to me\nThat there I'm sure there are some ways to get around it but you're not physically going to be in the room on the other side of the table and and these are huge because you should that could be coming up as soon as this off season\nI yeah I mean some of these bigger deals and I think ... is a good example you know when they were working out that new deal for ... which was a hundred and ten million bucks\nYou know Sandy was certainly involved in that but as we can see between the relationship with Jeffrey Brody\nThat was kind of done at an ownership level you know when you start talking about a hundred million or two hundred million or three hundred million not that the Mets are going into three hundred million range but yeah you get what I'm saying there um so yeah I think guys like was the only person I Know for sure from their front office group right now that will be staying as ...\nThat's a lock or the other to decide to do and where they fit into the ... ... plans or J. P. and er John ...\nUh that's going to be something that's probably going to be sorted out in the next couple of weeks\nBrodie bandwagon did say wanted to invest in scouting player development of health and wellness analytics what kind of sense were you able to get or or do you have as to\nWhether Brody bandwagon and can convince ownership to put some extra money into those areas and build a it's really the backbone of the infrastructure of the organization\nI mean that's an important part and and I think when you do make a new GM higher or what it can do is kinda rejuvenate\nA an organization it and make the owners thank you know OK I'm look you know time to press the reset button let's let's look at things let's you know let the new ... new GM has some leeway give them some money to improve the departments in some areas or you saw a little bit you know when Sandy all of us who took over\nThat was more just an entire ... they had to rebuild the organization from that standpoint in this case\nYou know there's going to be an evaluation of looking where they're at\nAnd you know they said they are going to invest in those areas and I think they recognize that that they do need to do that\nI mean part of this interview process is really kind of picking people's brains to who have looked at the organization discovered some of the weaknesses are areas that need to improve and you know hopefully that will puns made note of that and and going forward can you know work with ... to ... to patch up and strengthen those weak spots\nAnd we're talking again David Lenin of Newsday or will be some of the few first test for Brodie bandwagon and coming out\nWell starting on Monday with the G hadn't made him a Arctic Carlos California that's going to be number one I mean it's just going to be thrown right in the deep end of the pool a and having to be in that environment not that he's not used to it there's a\nPlenty of agents that attend those proceedings but when you switch switch sides and now the GM\nYou know this is the first time it's gonna be see how he's received you know when he's in studying what these other GM's are they going to be leery of him or are they going to be able to kind of exist are they going to be you know annoyed that an agent has become a GM and on the flip side with the agents there\nHow are they going to feel about a guy that was on their side before now mixing with teams and being a teen guy now so there's always been a line drawn between those two sides and now he's going to have the kind of dance on both sides of it and we're going to see it right away on Monday\nWhen it seemed like the good news for Mickey Calloway at the very least\nA yeah looks like Calloway did get a a an endorsement that he will be ah staying which is what we pretty much expected to you never know with the new GM\nOr but I think in this case they want certainly want to give Mickey at least at least another year to see if whatever he picked up learned from the second half of last year when things got a little bit better maybe he can that maybe he can carry that over to uh connect season\nAnd I thought what brought you to saying that he's going to make the players a priority or it did kind of call back to last here I'm with you know Mickey said loved the players but yeah a player's first organization that's something they would certainly agree on\nGuam and that's what agents do right I mean that their their whole job is to pump up a player you know tell them how great they are so much money there were a that ego building is a huge part of what an agent does with their clients you know on a baseball level for a team level you know I I've always been\nUh this is not the case of ... bandwagon and it's really a blank slate for us to go by to imagine what kind of GM is going to be and\nNewer and a whole lot of specifics and you didn't expect an exact blueprint a wall along I tried to sign this guy and and trade this player wiping them as you're not going to get that we understand that but you also didn't get a sense of even what kind\nOf general manager he will be you know and I I tried to ask him you know who he thinks is the gold standard as far as general managers and the game to kind of get an idea of what he values is what he he answered with\nWell I guess now they're all my competitors I [laughter] I I have a lot of respect for for all twenty nine other GM's I've worked with a lot of them in their current post I've worked with a lot of them as they've\nThey've grown in the business I have a lot of respect for a lot of different people but but what I Do a lot of the teams that have have succeeded in recent years have had good culture and good systems and I hope to up to match that\nNo culture systems but you don't necessarily get\nWhat he thinks are positive traits or in a general manager and maybe what he might try to emulate again you know I I I was hoping to have more insight as far as\nWhat kind of a general manager is going to be and I understand you can't just place every body and the boxer scouting guy or an analytical guy\nUm but this is going to have to to play out to really get answers beyond hey they're trying to win right away\nA bill in Tom's river what's up belt\nThanks for taking like oh I I was working today I wasn't able to hear that press conference but I don't want to show more than an hour and out of trying to get an understanding of\nWhat maybe the art at say ... how this is going to be different than what we've been dealing with the last ... years and it ... all all the virtues outright isn't going to be that great and all that well\nHow would the odd believing that higher organization now that I'm older than me better than what it's been a [laughter]\nYeah well I think you didn't get specifics on that either except for the fact that they made it outside the box higher that is I think naturally going to have different views on\nThe game on on how to build a team\nAnd ... again today was short on a lot of specifics about that is going to play out uh but they you know clearly been impressed by Brodie bandwagon for a long period of time and it was you know selling Brody came to them and said hey I Want to be a GM\nOr Jeff will upon asked Brody of you is interested in that kind of position and then he obviously a was able to excite them so you know that\nThey're gonna they're gonna you know it up on a ... a little bit and start a free agent hiring like it shouldn't really been happening\nNo I mean that's that's the key and that's the bottom line out of all this and thanks Bill Bradley bandwagon exactly able to build a winter as soon as next year if they're not going to give him some money to maneuver with\nThat has to happen or he can eat in you know say that he's been guaranteed the payroll is going to get up ... about the payroll didn't give anything specific ... as far as that goes today a but there's no\nDoubt I talked to a lot about\nBuilding the analytic ... scouting and all of these areas that you have to build the organization but yes the the payroll has to be a part of\nThat I suppose what ... you can hope for\nBrody bandwagon ... job over the years has been to get money out of ownership and get it to his players not just beds ownership but the ownership zone or a major league baseball\nNow he's got to get money out of ownership for himself to spend a on given players so it is a somewhat similar 'cause everything's ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "WOR Tonight with Joe and Lis", "city":
