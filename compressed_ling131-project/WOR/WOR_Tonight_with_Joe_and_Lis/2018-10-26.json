Bek um junior and and you know he needed him and he ... he let him go to a certain degree and I think that that\nKind of went a long way toward Coughlin kind of being shown the door because he couldn't really get a handle on or do back um a lot of coaches couldn't handle\nAnd uh you know have you enjoyed it is now talking about bill parcell guts ingenious just look up you can pre order it now ... are widespread November twenty ... and you could see that to get all the ...

Bo ... not as much but\nCertainly those other three those are the pitching prospects on the rise throughout the organization that are making their way towards the ... so he has a hand not only in a lot of the big name star players on the major league team but also quite a few of the\nYoung up and comers and prospects within the Mets as well and I'd be curious if you are one of those Mets players\nUh of your favorite New York Mets right some of the star players on the team or including you on assessment it's by the way in some sense but it's news today\nAh he underwent that second\nHeel surgery that he needs his hip problems with both of his heels had surgery a back after that subway series this summer on one leg and the right leg and now today I had surgery on the left heel or so the reason they do that and say you're not bed ridden if you have\nSurgery on both of your feet at the same time as they spread it out a little bit this was the plan all along with some time in October he would have the second surgery\nOr the ... in the past when asked John right go about it\nThey didn't give a real hey this is the window that we expect them to come back and be able to play in twenty Nineteen and they felt that\nAs soon as he had the second surgery they have a much better idea of what the timeframe might be a so I I Would think in the coming weeks maybe we have a better idea of what kind of impact if any are you on assessment is can have going into next season\nAnd one day I'll keep in mind we way that I Would look at it if I were the Mets is that you have to assume you're not going to get anything out of ... is there is a major question do surgery on both feet\nWould you be able to handle the outfield the ground you got to cover its a lot of running it's a lot of standing on your feet there's no designated hitter in the national league\nYou wouldn't take first base would be much of an option as it's already a logjam over there for the Mets Pete Alonzo down in the minors Jay Bruce Wilbur floor as Don Smith name a few\nUh at that position so a lot a lot to be determined as far as that goes but probably nobody would have better idea of the physical status of one you want it says but it's been his agent right Brody bandwagon and who\nMight very well be on his way to becoming the general manager of the ... the like the potential call here to go to bandwagon an eight hundred three two one zero seventh and the number\nAgain eight hundred three two one zero seven ten Brad in alpine starts us off with that but\nHey the um two questions and there's always a catch these guys sure I got to be something like is it hey if you you know through the general manager then the two missions do forego the commissions for the gloves and a garden and lo\nAnd therefore we could offer them less money off in equal\nNo seriously there's gotta be something art because it's just so unorthodox\nIs going to work that ... in baseball it is we've seen it and other sports but never a situation where\nThe the organization already had a relationship with bandwagon and I mean they have gone after plenty of bandwagon and clients it to the degree that you kind of raise your eyebrows at it after a while especially if they're drafting so many of his players or early on in the draft and\nIt's like Scott Boris with the nationals right and it always seems that he could get that extra money from them at the end of the year except now bandwagon it's gone to the next degree where it gets the case the franchise on top of it\nOr hopefully it's just they become very trust him over the years and the relationship or started but are you a basketball fan Pete yeah All right 'cause the nets fan I'm just wondering the nets Knicks they match up at all 'cause\nYou know Spencer didn't witty and ah and Russell both of good players but sort of a larger they can't play together\nAnd and that's a big man you see the nets indexed match up\nI don't think they'll ever making sure I ...\nI don't see them making a ... on the bench today and he put out a tweet that's just a period so I guess you\nTake that as soon not being thrilled about it um but I don't see those two organizations make a deal and there's bad blood there or not that long ago I Know a lot of those people aren't there but you know the ownership situations are still the same I I don't think you'll see the Nixon\nNets getting together and it's like the Mets and Yankees you know and it's even trickier there in the same division\nRight right\n... ... they're actually you know real rivals\nAnd thanks for the call Brad um but uh you know getting back to the Mets here um\n[noise] you know I I I get what Brad say of feels like there's always a catch ... and there's a lack of trust between ... and the ... ownership and we've talked about it for five years here on W O O R and\nUh I don't think that has ever been mended um you know this is an opportunity and this is the key you know is it going to be someone who's going to have the right to make the final call 'em\nWith Doug Melvin coming in I don't think that he necessarily would've huh I'm not sure he would have been the guy that says hey I Need to have absolute call on what's happening here otherwise I'm Out there is a sixty six rolls his last chance to be a general manager perhaps did he had the same bargaining position\nAnd save and wagon and that is a successful aging it's a lot of money doing that\nUh you would think that he's been given some kind of assurance is here at least if he's going to officially sign on that he's going to say um what is happening and and maybe he has a comfort with the Mets in this situation but are now getting all that has to play out and\nIf there is a press conference next week announcing Brody bandwagon as the next general manager\nThere will be some fascinating answers that will be a part of that and it will really be a get to know you know whatever interview Brody bandwagon and for his ideas on the building I interviewed him years ago and the Mets science that's been as to the four year contract but\nI wasn't talking about you know what he thought about the ... and build it up the team but we're talking about the negotiation with ... marketing opportunities in New York and things like that it's a it's a it's a much different position in that way a eight

P. rich already so\nYou know a band wagon ... who has no baseball operations experience as a neat to lean on guys trying to help them navigate the through things a little bit but you know as far as the\n... where he's doing that stuff like analytics expanding the analytics the Carter meant and uh when he wants to do with this farm system stuff like that\nI I I don't think we really have a ... point of ah where he is on that stuff\nI mean we're talking with Mike ... of the New York post we don't really have an indication of what his clients that are members of the Mets might think about all of this but uh we have you tracked down Scott Boris one of his rival agents or earlier this week but you know as much as your rival aged you're also\nThat's ... you know there's always some turmoil or it might be too big a jump for somebody a ... for that to be their first job in much\nNow when she got poma digging up stories you know it gets tough yeah that\nThat the fact we know so you work for the little ...\nYeah and then there's a lot to it in a row the bandwagon and all have to be working a balance or perhaps as well and and and so again you think it perhaps even as soon as tonight we find out this is a done deal with the Mets bandwagon\nYeah I'm a you know I think there's a chance that happened and I are more likely at some point over the weekend\nOld and a no Mondays and all stay in the world series is still going on in London the travel day so I get sick ... do you know make it official announced it on one so uh I think that's what they call me like ... because we've got Jim meeting will be a week away\nRight Mike who am I the New York post great job and this has always my bank you take a peek alright a micro but\nGiven us the latest there and the Mets general manager situation so Neil Armstrong son in law could becoming a BB gun in the next general manager of the New York Matt ... of course also havoc tonight the world series game three\nUh we'll get you out to full coverage again through starting up at seven o'clock I'll give you some of my thoughts are coming up on the other side of this break it's sports don't repeat McCarthy on the voice of New York ...

Cora has done has paid off\nAnd we'll see how this plays out over the course of the game tonight but you got to think of the red Sox are able to take any kind of a lead late you'll see Martinez come out of the game and Andrew ... tend to get in there to help them out defensively in that outfield a another\nControversy here as far as many Machado goats and he has been in the middle of everything from slides at second base in the ... to a hint colliding and essentially a running into the leg intentionally\nOf Hays used Aguilar the brewers first baseman which prompted Christian yell at you the brewers to call but John ... a dirty player and more than that as he was muttering under his breath while leaving reporters a buck Machado now is being called out by the red Sox for potentially\nSignaling while he's on the base paths to the painters what pitch is coming while it's not against the rules it is frowned upon within baseball and often\nResults in maybe a purpose pitch being thrown at you ... if you're caught doing that kind of thing\nUm you don't see as much as bad as today's game obviously and especially in the world series in a close game that's not going to be the time that you take that kind of shot a but for Machado it definitely bears watching tonight and the red Sox there'll be changing their signals trying to righty a different ways to keep the Dodgers off that sent\nA and sometimes the abuses even for the pitcher in the capture that are involved you see some wild pitches and things like that so uh that bears watching as well but many Machado he has been in the middle of seemingly everything over the course of this postseason and that has not changed in the world series and the Dodgers desperate tonight more when at least one\nUh and uh they'll do it a potentially tonight's game three and we have full coverage coming out but they'll do it but it's sports don't tonight thanks to my home of the post for joining remark tail mark winter I'll be McCarthy enjoy a night and enjoy the baseball coming your way\nFew areas of the city were hit harder than the Rockaways in Queens the five and a half mile boardwalk completely washed away but this past spring word came down to the neighborhood was enjoying record job growth and business sales since the storm's devastation and two thousand twelve\nPart of a comeback powered by the city's small business services department which was handed out three hundred and forty five thousand dollars in grants to aid in recovery just three years ago the department also launched trap\nA program in the game planning should another similar storm strike James flipping for seven ten W O R Sophia ... is\nBeing named TVs highest paid actress for the seventh year in a row Forbes says the forty six year old Colombian American beauty pulled in more than forty two million dollars from a rural on Modern Family and from various TV ads you had a very nice year port authorities for major airports now have free unlimited why\nOfficial said travelers at Newark LaGuardia Kennedy and Stewart airports and enjoy a high speed service good enough to stream of movie while waiting on a flight delay passengers can receive unlimited for our sessions of free high speed access weather forecast could be better because we have a nor'easter on the way also on the way as the forecasts\nAre for ... ... ... ... ...\nYou know how to react to their asthma attacks here's how to prevent them visit WWW dot no attacks dot org or call your doctor because even one attack is one too many Fisher brought to you by the ...\nThe I in the ad council young people everywhere are making a difference\nOn how can we help you know and the real\nMy friends I may have I\nRealize that what I'm doing it for re high\n...

I I was reluctant to say this but I you know I'm the media coverage was hysterical absolutely I mean nobody's life was really in danger here now and um you know I could see look at if the bombs exploded fine\nI've got a letter Miller but I mean these were ... I was relatively harmless\nThings that were sent in the mail yet we're reacting is if we are under attack well I don't know what you're watching because I was just so much the same way you see what\nYou see Chris ... Don Lemon out there is a salt on the media and it's all because of the president of the United states every moment they get they turn this into a way to bash inland I don't know you're just blind when you watch these things that you agree with\nI haven't seen anyone compared to September eleventh or Oklahoma City bombing so I haven't so maybe they have I have and so but in terms of the hysteria that has been attached to this well I I Will say and I remember feeling danger\nI ... well yeah my son works at CNN and he was freaked out and didn't want to go to work the other day yeah I've got so I've by us most as I did feel unsettled was like when they had anthrax of NBC that day and that's where I was real stuff I Know well but we didn't do that now that would well now they're saying that Joe we didn't know that two days ago\nWe didn't know and so now they're saying well most of them than other couching it well many of these couldn't explode okay maybe they couldn't but we didn't know that when these first for coming out and number two the idea that the president ... zero responsibility for any of his rhetoric or anything he is done on his side that's just unfair\nWhy should he accept responsibility for his rhetoric Glen when the media is read Latin list and it's a tack on him and he fights back he's got nothing to do with it ever came up with the idea to send these pipe bombs whether they're fake bombs are real bonds you cannot blame the president for that you simply can't lend\nI think your flights leaving for Florida [laughter] I think you know my God I was just ...\nI think there was a very well [laughter] I Will repeat myself you know I Do as well he's the one who said it's just fine and dandy for congressman Weiner dog and the and and so that brought a bomb you know\nBut you can't excuse the president of language and actually beat up the protesters I'll pay for it listed by ...\nMaxine Waters gets out there that you get paid ... how do you always she's got him to do\nHe's the president of United States and he if he wants to fight fake news doing with facts which she seems incapable of doing\nHe is doing to them and they didn't want to destroy him though\nIn hairs well there's a you know NYPD put out a sketch and the two of them it's a my own trained I look\nYou know the family and sisters do when they look like they do when I saw the picture discussion today if that is nice for me ... you know so similar\nDo look like from the sketches are they really do\nThat they looked like terrible and it really looked like lesbians not that we know what lesbians looked like the ... to ... well they may have been lovers that's what it says here yeah but what do you mean they don't look like well I mean you know what do you think they're all like six foot four carrying an ax land ... do you mean they don't look like well I'm just saying you know this you know who knows I don't I don't\nWell I think the key here is that um uh they said there was no sign of trauma right so that was the first tip off the way to say that they may have thrown themselves a\nHorrifying to me too but they taping themselves together honestly I I I don't even want to think about that especially there were so young and and you know apparently they were I had heard their early twenties and now you're saying it might be in their late teens and us and to think that something was wrong in their life that this was like ... would do is terrible\nI Hope it wasn't because they were lesbians and they felt that they couldn't be different about their relationship and they felt terrible pressure from you never ...

I'm trying to remember who else in math and that was it I never met them at night\nWrote a sky theater column about Mary Tyler Moore when she was in a Neil Simon and ah she was a little older and she was having trouble learning her lines and Neal's wife delivered a handwritten note from Neal to marry and the note said either learn my lines or get out\nAnd my play wow Mary slapped down on the table

was wonderful in the Mary Tyler Moore show us oh and I met some uh Valerie Harper when I'm trying to think of the people I mean those were actually met at one time or another\nI had a a just a quick story for it I had a friend an actor and he was a guest on the Mary Tyler Moore show and he arrived or for their first reading the script and all the chairs were out there and Betty White was there\nAnd he said he was the guest actor and he said where should I said and then he waits oh sit anywhere word democracy around here so we sat in the middle charged oh no no that's a mayor so [laughter]\nThat's ... year democracy so what do you make it a president Mattis may sign at the defense secretary\nMay signed the order today Trump wants between a hundred thousand troops on the southern border this was an addition to the Twenty one hundred National Guard soldiers that he's already spread out along the southern border this was the combat the caravan heading this what got no problem\nWith that you got what\nSeven to ten going maybe the fourteen thousand people come in there who knows who was in their gang members terrorists we have no idea coming our way we've got to secure the border this is precisely what the troops should be used for all the image that they're coming up right after ... cards right in the ... being pushed over here we\nGot to get the anyway down early in the national guardsmen\nThere don't they just uh offer support to the customs and border people they don't actually get out there and do the work they actually do backup or and all that so I don't know what the troops are going to do but the okay um\nWell what do you what do you should be done I guess let them come in you know\nI've said like proposed a lens something has to be done at seven thousand people or they're not coming in okay let's some of them are going to get in okay and they're coming to your house because as you said you know when I was under the border and wave and go back\nOK okay we've been around and spend a hundred times about Sarah Huckabee Sanders was left to defend the president yesterday because he is being attacked\nBy the ... well you guys called the mainstream media they say he should in some way be held partially responsible for all the rhetoric that's going around the these days with these so called bombings anyway eras Sarah Huckabee Sanders yesterday\nThis could get a little messy yeah they are uplifting nine million bucks or ... is that crazy that one's Ronan Farrow yeah now the president that Ronan Farrow is the guy who broke all the stories of Harvey Weinstein and others\nNow you know there's a little bit of controversy with him and NBC because he alleges he brought this he was working for NBC why MSNBC they wouldn't run the story that's right and so he brought it to the New Yorker but now Megan Kelly wants him there which leads you to believe she's got some dirt\nOn some other NBC people that that she's going to make sure she gets her money wet or she's going to build a ... that's my that's my take on\nThe line too and just remember ah the brass at CBS including Les Moonves and some others who got hash tag meat to either the existence so maybe there's some tricky stuff going on and NBC and Megan Kelly has some details\nShe hasn't been that long to get that kind of dirt and I'm sure she doesn't have very many friends there they're going to give her the gossip I Know well I must say I will tell you though it shows you how precarious we all are 'cause you don't want to show this seemed like an innocent conversation and this this was that this is the whole thing here\nYou get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on Halloween or a black person and puts on weight when I was a kid that was okay as long as you were drafted character\nYou know not Len Len ... yes it is precarious and ... we do it every morning live radio and you know sometimes you get a little carried away you got to pull back on come on black face you know I like I say they went on a problem when I was a kid that is\nA red flag if ever there if ever there was one\nIt was a ... let's let's give her the benefit of the ...\nSaid that was just a really dumb things you say okay let's\nThat leads me to believe that they were looking for some yeah it was the last show of raw how do you agree with you by itself and nothing else is this a fireball defense well although ratings sucked well and also guess were or bail he doesn't have anybody to\nTake her back I mean yeah you know we got her back yeah I'll be like already on B. C. one church you can't get big ... descended apple wasn't happy with her\nAnd I guess we're bailing after that comment she couldn't get guests him remember Jane Fonda one after her early in the shows you like a question are they supposed to have the new um house of cards and they all bale hay bale them yeah and then remember the new will and grace team came on how to build an awkward\nThey were well here's the problem she was\nShe was good at Fox plane the tough question or the prosecutor because she is a lawyer ma coming from the right\nBut then when she decided she wanted to be all warm and fluffy in the morning nobody bought it the viewers just did not buy her that all the rent no absolutely funny and and they're not going to embrace somebody who's phoney and they got rid of someone I really liked I'd a camera hall Dyarman who is great without they had that I Would do very\nWell I was on the show with them all the time and by the time right now has her own talk show coming up with Disney which is Great Hey I'm Monica in Westfield New Jersey you one of the way you know I always story Monica\nGood morning I'm Megan Kelly and ever since the first eight however I live in LA I mean I feel that\nShe would say it in the context of the character of paying somebody habits they led by Diana Ross and I got to put a white face Diana Ross is carry it I think we're coming down to that\nBut I ... Monica Monica well she's gone now but I mean you have to understand that blackface is deeply offensive to African Americans you can't they used to call it black dumped you know they would put the charcoal on their face and do a minstrel show that is racist and offensive and it touches a raw nerve in this country and she just went right for it blended into it\nYeah but again I think that was her only a fence you know we've heard ratings were great they say hey there's a little sensitivity training I Apologize you know let's let's bring us she tried to apologize to well your apology but then she brought on a ... a good blocks that came out like our broker but then she said I Melvin\nSaid that bone headed thing where she said it in her apology and and I learned that that um minstrel shows in blackface are offensive to African Americans I learned she just learnt that now might just talking to al ... you're talking about this\nLearned that given the history of blackface being used an awful way by racists in this country", "year": "2018", "show_name": "WOR Tonight with Joe and Lis", "city": "New York", "day": "26"}
