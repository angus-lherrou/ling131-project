{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "Know if you listen to add 'em over the last hour I think you get a sense of of how many different things\nAre part of under the GM's purview all the analytics and in different areas that are front office can study and improve in an organization\nAnd the reason the Yankees playing this game tonight they got one of the best in the business and Brian cash men and he's got a ton of resources to work within that front office not just the payroll but smart\nGuys people that could come in and help out rainwater berries next day right\nHigh paid few dollars at great to cast your hair you know it's like having a front office guy given it strike you know and he was honesty you know he gave us pretty much what he's talked could happen you know mhm hopefully hopefully go Jim I have a feeling of no champs got got ... have the money to spend you know\nWell I don't know ... you know it probably won't go after or my child but I think I got upgraded well quality you know\nI'd like to see them be in the mix for Machado if they do fall short and you just ask for an honest effort editors team I think and\nThey're gonna be a lot of teams that really want that guy and you're going to be up against the Dodgers money in a lot of other teams but uh you know they should be in the ... and if they're up there at the top of the marketing Machado is choosing between different teams met maybe there is something that he'll like about the Mets but if they fall short there\nThere are a lot of holes that they're going to have to fill and yeah and I I'm curious to see what kind of general manager candidates come forward and want this job how much confidence is there within baseball\nThat you can have success with the Mets under the ... I think that's a question of where to get it somewhat of a a read on over the next few weeks\n[noise] so I'm a I'm interested in that sort of call re um I I think um you know that's going to be part of the art of their GM's guys that have\nDecent jobs and baseball right now they're willing to become the president of baseball operations with the Mets the to step up it's up in the ... up onto the Mets would be willing to do I think it's one of the reasons that they waited so long\nTo start this search process you have a lot of general managers and the sport who grew up Mets fans and this job has a certain emotional connection to a lot of different\nFront office people is now to draw to come back home at the very least for guys that grew up in New York John Daniels and David Stern and a turn off in Cleveland I don't know if you grow up a Mets fan or a Yankees fan but he grew up in the area so\nYou can you ... one of those guys somebody's had success elsewhere in that chair and now you get the bump up ... you know the title and pay\nAnd certainly a challenge in front of you\nWhat are those guys do they see a job where they really can be successful and they're willing to give up somewhere where they are and have had success that's something you should be able to do with a franchise like the Mets and I think that's one of those things where the proof of being the putting do they get interviews with those guys they have any interest and if not\nWhat direction do they decide to go is it going to be an old school regressive type of front office or are they going to progress even further than they had with Sandy ... ah that's\nEither\nFranchise changing decision the Mets remaking in the next few weeks it is as important a position as you have in an organization beyond the players and it's why the GM's and the guys getting paid now more than the managers\nMad is the a number one position a smart\nGM can take a team without a big payroll make them successful look Billy Beane in the eighties now they've had some down times over the years but they always seem to rally backup\nNewer playoff team four years ago that miserable experience in the twenty four teen wild card game against the royals and took a little while but they built it back up Ninety seven when team this\nYear that's the kind of difference that a smart general manager can make for you what the Tampa Bay rays have done over the years with different people in that front office from Andrew Freedman who is now in LA\nWhat they have going now and utilizing the ... and you have an opportunity to be innovative sometimes in a smaller market and then you know the bigger market teams get to poach those smart people bring them in that something you'd like to see the Mets pull up here\nAre right now your chance to win an al ... network prize packed the caller number three and eight hundred three two one zero seven ten and you're the winner watched two division series games on it will be network plus live coverage before and after\nEvery postseason game on and that will be tonight color three at eight hundred three two one zero seven to not only that your chance to win a thousand dollars coming up\nIn just a five minutes after the hours about Fifteen minutes from now it's the sports on what people currently on the voice of New York seven ten W. O. R. W.\nR. soy down with the book are the [noise]\nThe phones they don't just three two one zero seven can continue our discussion here [noise]\nMy buddy Brad and out fine is there without Brad\nHey Pete how's it going good how are you doing All right\nI I don't understand I Am surprised that there was a more negative reaction to a so that you will on press conference\nAnd they did it the rind day they did it a football Sunday and the Yankees are having a wild card game tonight I think that's why beyond you know I was talking about it you haven't heard a whole lot\nI mean you've seen some uh some blogs cover it but\nYou know the guy they they've gotten such a free pass to come exaggerate I mean it it really is an abusive relationship and you know I Want to say you know I work in a financial world and we'll produce Sherry's sponsor latour investors don't they have I don't know what the what the\n... what it is but they have to have an obligation to their fans\nSure I I look at the Mets and baseball teams in sports teams and they're getting you know a lot of\nPublic help on their stadiums and things like that it should be something like the public trust doesn't mean you got to lose money on it but ah there is a certain expectation that fans have that citizens of a of the city even I gather the team and\nA clearly and the Mets we talk about the payroll there are things they have to do better and they have to be run better from the top down\nYeah mean have you seen um ... if there is that there was an interesting or Twitter\nOr what do you call is way post like five things in a row Twitter storm or two weeks or whatever you call it from Kerry Franklin is so ... yeah like Frank Coto who is in the Mets for the office for I guess if you're this year ... and ...\nUm I forget exactly what he said I rented out five o'clock on Monday morning but\nI mean it's really telling just his perception and his perspective given that he was that he was and they all just say I'm you know that they that the problem is the skin on\nOn a on scouting and on analytics or the you know they had the ... baseball and it's something that you know we've had a hunch about over the years but\nI mean just because how could you know the it seems like there's some something big um is that right\nWell we talked about a little bit at a Fisher earlier this hour Brad that\nUp and you know what the analytics can do to help them in sorry I had bad timing on that but uh what are the analytics can help out with as far as\nInjuries to studying defense to all these different kinds of advantages that teams like the Dodgers and the Yankees have been able to take advantage of and those teams especially the Dodgers perennially have been able to win the NFL west\nAnd the Yankees yeah they took a step back for a couple of years there but they've come back incredibly strong and incredibly smart and I think the Yankees role to mentally Louis tonight but\nWe want a hundred games they did a lot right this year this weren't the best team in their division so\nAs we talk about on fish or they they don't have any starting pitching but\nStarting pitcher is never meant less going into the post season which is odd to say 'cause I think pitching matters especially this time of year it starts to get colder the ball's not traveling out you can't just depend on a home run when you get into these postseason games\nBut the starters just throwing less and less endings fewer and fewer readings every year\nA ... game last night actually ended up being a little bit of a throwback is called free lending Jon Lester both able to throw at least six innings last night that's about the most that you are getting out of your starter\nThese days I'm must somebody is essentially perfect\nNever gets in trouble is taken out teams one two three every single any they don't trust any of these starters to go deep\nAnd they don't want them to work the they want to get into the ... is a totally different thought process then what do we always say about the Yankees and the late nineties all they grind out their starting pitching get to the middle of the pan and do all their damage\nNow need both pens are typically so deep and everybody's throwing Ninety five plus you so many arms and they're all going a hundred percent when they come in the scoring stops when you get to the pet\nMe and say a whole lot of scoring at all last night but these teams are designed to get into the to get to their bullpen and then shut the door\nAnd that's going to be you know and the key things uh tonight obviously with the Yankees and the athletics and I loved that he's Penn is why I like them in this game I'm\nIn San Marino even now the busy really going to go more than five innings the you know a whole lot more than that I don't think they want more than that out of him a Robin Clifton gives us to shout what's your mind Rob\nShow there was an interesting interview with the Fisher I think mhm\nSo want us to cautious because it was really interesting listening to the strategy if people are Jewish everyday issues I've added I've told you about it many times it feels like the Mets do evaluate or develop tally quite as well as the teams that consistently or in the play offs mhm\nAnd I keep saying a strategy would be to coach\nSomebody from the minor league system from the Dodgers from the cardinals you know the Braves all those teams that seemed to always get it right and I loved it next time you enter your pick his brain about look at you Dahlia waiting and especially developing players 'cause heres what I see what the ... even though I'm optimistic about their\n... they looked like this like almost every every other year where the ... George in garbage time they play well\nMy issue with your team I don't believe you could attribute all that looting injuries I Believe a lot of these guys can't handle the pressure of expectation until they completely fall out of it and then they get comfortable relaxed and the stats start to cook and that's a big problem\nBecause I'm not optimistic that even though they have good players I'm not optimistic that they're going to get out to a good start\nDo you think do you know mentally these guys aren't prepared for what big late life is like initially\nI guess I mean it's just like you look at the you look at the table and there's always another reason why they fold when they're supposed to be good in the first three months of the season and I don't think it's just a tribute to injuries\nNo ... well a lot of these fires or come up and they haven't been as prepared to be major leaguers if you'd like to see amid Rosario he's still developing at the major league level of last year and a half you'd like to be passed the development stage when you've been up for that long but that's not the case with him obviously and we've seen it\nWith Don Smith in San ... quite a few players that haven't been ready from the jump\nI get that [laughter]\nYeah but what I'm saying is there something I just feel like there's something missing in the minor leagues because the other team structurally constantly bring up major league ready players here after a decade after decade and we'll do that and the best way to start stealing some of the institutional knowledge you start poaching people furloughs organization and do what they\nDo well I I agree with what you're saying Robin ... one thing that I think it's going to be important news then whoever the GM is that yes they have some experience with player development in a successful system but that you\nTrust that person to set up for the entire organization\nThen I'd be a Mets way Mike the cardinals but at least a philosophy that these are the things that we want our players to be able to do the fundamentals of the game this is now they're going to be coached up about it and along the way they work their way up and have a plan in place\nAnd make sure that when somebody comes up they could drop down upon that they can hit to the opposite feel that they could do with the situation dictates it's one of the things I Love about jak McNeil\nHere's a player that gets situations\nAnd when it's a man on second nobody out jet McNeil understand I'm going to hit a ground ball to the right side maybe it gets through and I drive in the run at the very least it's a ground out to second base I get the runner to third with less than two well we even saw McNeil bond in the\nDavid Wright game ... game on Saturday Night race started off with a double ordinarily I'd hate to bumped in that spot but\nFor David right yeah they were extenuating circumstances in that game and the meals that will drop down the button wouldn't the prettiest bunny get a little more air than you would like but it was successful and other things you want to see guys be able to do\nMcNeil too sometimes he'll swing for the fences and he picks a spots on really a big fan of them have you got more players that are situation only adapt and trained as to what to do\nThat is a big plus and then it's certainly an area where the Mets can be a lot better or they did take a a a blow in the minor leagues today though as Frank Viola longtime pitching coach and the Mets organization tweeted they've wishing the Mets organization well\nWant to thank all the pictures have had a chance to work with the best going forward remember trust your stuff as long as you're wearing a uniform you have a chance to achieve your dream good luck\nGuys\nSo Frank viola or you know which is bad for the Mets organizations so he will be out he's worked closely with guys like Steven ... and\nYou name it the pitchers have come up in recent years and they generally have son his praises ah But Frank ... yeah I Know he texted my boom and the posted and he's interested in being a free agency and what's out there about another\nReally mainstay in this ... organizations is out you know a lot of changes happening up and down the Mets organization right now ah and you figure that's going to continue when they do finally make this higher whether it's a new president of baseball operations or general manager or whatever it might be\nThat's ... baseball put ... put that\nForward and and you get the sense that the game has changed it and that way as well it was on last night\nAnd if you don't like the direction maybe you're thrown up in your mouth a little bit is just an odd play but no one era NATO grabbed a ground ball at third base hobby or by as was on a second for the cubs\nAnd was running towards third and they said it almost collided a but it or not I knew he couldn't get double play so he stopped in the baseline looked at by as biased basically gave them a hug [laughter] it looked like interference like he prevented Aaron ought to be able to make another play there really wasn't another plate make\nIs that it just took too long to develop but they basically embraced each other between the baseline whereas Albert Bell would have given a forearm shiver a going between the bases in and that kind of spot and is there something wrong with that great about it it's just the thing that happened is an oddity\nIn the sport\nAnd and he had the weird things that didn't happen when there's pressure on guys what is the biggest moments and they have the adrenalin coursing through\nIt's just kind of an oddity left I think that it may know the game soft now or one of those weird things that they could have happened twenty Thirty years ago and you know similar way\nA eight hundred three two one zero seven ten eight hundred three two one zero seven damage got another and I'll be network prize back to give away and

we're not on the same page\nAt all it was wild patch while pitch pass ball past ball and you pretty much put all of it on Gary Sanchez that night and they have worked together in the game since but

know who has a a crow illness yes now I'm going to have you ever wipe your boat with football uh\nPersonally no okay never really occurred to me never occurred to do it well he certainly occurred to anybody until he did it Thursday night against the brown yes\nHe did do that and uh did you hear his mother's ... somebody asked his mother about it and she said well I did not like it as a mother I was literally shocked he's such a mild mannered person he usually doesn't do much celebrating\nIt but it's not really a celebration to me it has to be about the browns remember he was formerly with the browns and they cut it in Cleveland he wiped his football is behind and then he threw it into the crowd yeah I think that's a message\nTo Iran he denies it but yes it was yeah um what else are you doing that for it's actually worked out for um have you ever heard of dude wipes\nA vaguely\nOkay so it's basically moist how let's you're behind after you use the restroom\nWhich sounds like a great idea but I cannot jumped onto the trend I feel like I Want you to do it you can't go\nBack it's one of those products are like why does it have you called dude wipes like do females not need to wipe their butts so I don't I don't understand regardless I say ... is now sponsored by ...\nCents on social media lots of pictures and made some extra money out of it did he get fined by the NFL and I don't think he did yeah so so he was spared that so I guess it came out in the positive any costs the jets penalty or which when the end of the world for them on the kick off but uh\nYeah they you no matter what you do you can monetize\nIt these days and he he found a new way to get in there I'm surprised or do didn't get like a a fire hydrant endorsement deal or something like that many pets do\nYou need needs creativity guy but he's got to figure it out it's good it's a good job by them we're ...\nWe're talking about exactly now people know what dude wipes you know I Would have just gotten any white but you know\nIf you really need a specialty wipe for that than go to Dubai ups I guess something else that happened to this is hockey near and dear to my heart you know Tom Wilson as

well huh\nOr Mets fan you're from New York you're not\nYou're not in on this and it probably didn't help that I was wearing a Chad Pennington Jersey at the time but anyway there's no there's no good option for you as a Mets fan the red Sox are simply\nA less evil thing or or at least less in your face then all the Yankee fans that you see at work or school or at the deli and the red Sox\nUnless you're around Boston people like we are with producer right here a big red Sox fan or you can get away with it a little bit but there there is no winning there's no real rooting for a Mets fan in these situations the only solution I could\nGive is that\nYou've seen them both when a bunch before this is nothing new and one of them goes to the world series wins the whole thing\nHow many times have you seen the Yankees when now how many times have you seen the red Sox win now yeah it's old hat\nRight okay they add another one to the list and when the Mets have to try to catch up with championships they'll just have to win twenties slowly up to twenty six in a row at that\nPoint to to catch up and make that happen so uh yeah\nNot not good not good for the Mets fan not a great day uh but I'm telling you ... you know just looking at it objectively for the Yankees last that was a big night and I know\nYou could look at Yankee fans and less yesterday they're concerned about this game against the Oakland Athletics and now everybody's confident going into the series against a one hundred and eight when Boston Red Sox team\nAnd you know what the right they see it right I Love the Yankees and this division series against the red Sox oh love the Yankees but\nThey should be the favorites in this series the red Sox as I talked about over the last couple of nights they have major questions in their bullpen and if there's one area of your team that you can not have a question marks in going into the postseason agent relief core you have to be able to dominate\nWhen you take the lead and hold onto it\nWe're asking these both ends to throw at least four innings every single playoff game\n\nOf course sale is compromised David prices and pitched well against the Yankees in the past\nThey were going to trust the knuckleball or to come out of the pan\nThey're going to trust some of the back and starting pitchers to come out of the panning get big outs worked for used in last year but that's a big adjustment for guys to make on the biggest stage possible not just the play offs but now you're in this Yankees Red Sox\nRivalry on top of it all where it's not going to be your typical postseason series you talk about pressure why Boston are one hundred and eight when season they've been knocked out early in the playoffs the last couple of years\nAnd now they got back it up right away against the Yankees that's a must win in Boston so yeah\nUh there's gonna be some pressure on them and I just think the Yankees are gonna be in a strong position here to have Aaron Judge John Carlos Stanton get off the good starts in the playoffs in that wild card game Abu ... says\nTo that list a lot of those guys were I to some degree at least question marks the guys that you needed to have come through\nAnd they did that first game it buys them at least a little bit of\nTime like the first two games the division series and then stand goes oh for aid to everybody will panic about it again but it buys him a little bit of time there buys the Yankees a little bit of time here and more importantly man some things to really feel good about you know\nThey Eddie ... by the athletics last night and maybe Chapman was shaky or\nStat and didn't do anything some of these things well they're moving on but you wouldn't feel great about them in that series gets ... but the way that it played out last night I either port and very well for the yanks in his division series against the Boston Red Sox\nAre not only that I don't know from the AIDS point of view last night Fernando Rodney\nAfter the game ... reporters that once I saw judge hit that ball I said to myself this is over referring to judges home run in the first inning how how soft or you as a team\nAnd I'd say inexperienced but Romney spin around the game forever is forty something years olds forty one\nHow are you saying it over after first standing home run me come on I Know the place was jumping but you got to have enough confidence you could come back the is they've been a terrific\nCome from behind team all year the tickets over in the first inning and you have lamb Hendrik starting the gaming might've been the worst picture they put out on them out to all of last night to think that that first inning was going to beaches ridiculous\nAnd I'm always Oakland I Would hope he was the only one thinking that I wouldn't be in a hurry to bring that got a guy back ... credit for being honest fine but\nAm I\nCan't think it's over they gave up a home run and the first in\n\nThe Yankees or the seven to win last night they move on and we'll start the LDS tomorrow tomorrow's one of the best baseball days of the year where it's the only day in the postseason that you're guaranteed for games on the same day\nSo tomorrow will be cool I always loved that and if you get lucky you get another one of those days early next week but this is the only one that's guaranteed\nAnd you'll have baseball from two oh five first ... Astros all the way through the Braves and Dodgers who started up after nine thirty second line that about three o'clock in the morning or so you go full day of baseball tomorrow that's always a lot of fun loved that day\nYou know we'll keep you updated everything happening here the brewers with a to nothing lead on the Rockies there in the top of the fourth and Christian yell at you to run Homer in the third inning boys even something else so he's going to wrap up the N.

B. p.s starts the playoffs and\nIn a in big time fashion where they used to run Homer for the brewers and by the way everyone knocking the age for deciding to go with the bullpen and strategy last night\nThen and on the train it's not even in the stands it's on a train home after those games have you ever been on a train from the garden after ranger amateur him no you don't want to be there yeah it is not a fun place to be probably not if\nThe ... when then it's probably a fun place to be well no\nIf there's not a fun place ... and vice versa ...\nWhat are you know as far as that goes like it's unique right you don't like the Yankees but you ought to the Yankees stuff all the time they want to play off its thrust into your face on on your way home from work when you just wanna relax get away from things and pop the ear buds in and be done with the world and then you got a bunch a Yankee fans\nRevel in heaven they're fun and you know you're not\nA part of that at all in fact that all you're not a part of it uh you just like the whole thing is experience that is unique to uh to sports town to a team town like we are in so many sports here\nYou know like if the Braves and I'm a Mets fan of the Braves when something I don't have the Braves fans and knowing me about it in on my own trend but if the Yankees do yes it's completely different\nEight hundred three two one zero seven to end the number again eight hundred three two one zero seven than a will get it to the Mets general manager search will have a some moron really went went right for the Yankees last night I I don't think there's anything from last night's game\nThat you'd be concerned about if your the Yankees last night went about as well as they could have dreamed it not only to win the game but the way it happened and what they\nHave the opportunity to ride now going into the division series eight hundred three two one zero seven TEN Sports on paper card they on the voice in New York ... double you all are [laughter]\nNow here in the W O R sports\nThe\nYankees getting ready for the ... the ads the Yankees are on the Yankees gearing up for the LDS the Mets gearing up to\nFind a general manager and that search become unreal now as they start to schedule some interviews and we'll give you the latest on what happened today\nBut last night we had as sin wise Adam Fisher who was formerly of the Mets front office here in Studio it's terrific listen both about\nWhat the Mets should be doing this off season to the GM hunts to all of that and you could check it out seven ten W. O. R. dot com slash sports but within that interview I asked that I'm just out desirable\nThis mess job might be\nYeah I think I think all of that is fair you know there's a lot of stuff out there in the media and um if I'm a gym candidate who doesn't really know a whole lot about it I Need to get to the bottom of it and understand kind of how much\nHow much I mean if you remember when Omar got got hired though I mean this this has been a sort of a a theme you know\nFor you know Twenty years or so um how much control does does the gym have with the Mets and um and you don't remember that quote from our control with Fred total control and you know he did for the most part for for a number of years\nUm but ah but yeah I think I think you have to investigate because you want to be your own person um and you need to find out kind of what the situation is I think every\nTeam has different dynamics and there's a lot I mean ownership is involved with not to sort of fall back on that again sort of every all thirty teams cliche but you know the owners on the team they can do what they want and you have sort of different levels of um involvement\nWith all thirty teams some very heavily involved in some not so much\nAnd the Mets it's an involved ownership both with Red Bull pond and Jeff will upon this is not a situation\nWhere a budget is set from corporate owner of a team and there's no one really bother and yet All right so here's your payroll and\nYou know go do your work it's a different dynamic with the maps and you have a lot of different people in that mix in the front office with Terry Collins is an influential voice to ... John ... J. P. rich already all part of that front office right\nNow you're essentially inheriting a manager and Mickey Calloway as well now there are no guarantees that Calloway will be part of the new GM's plan but Jeff well up on it did let it be known that he would like Calloway to stick around even as he was saying that you didn't want to say\nThat much because it might impact what candidates will tell him in their interviews\nAnd they give one that works and that typically is that younger Ivy League educated guy but this is the Kate and I'm not saying a lemonade baseball people someone like Terry Collins with all the experience than he has that is important that matters the best at these\nKids to calm but uh the current crop of GM's that you often see hired the best of those guys they listen to everybody and they take in every piece of information that they can\nAnd it's not overload and they're able to do that to make the right decision to make the best decision I guess the the best way of putting it it's something that the ... does in Chicago fire all the ... or the scouts and just rely on spreadsheets like something out of money ball\nYou listen to every take every piece of information that you can\nAnd that is what you want\nFrom the person who's making the key decisions about your team\nSo that's why it's not about age necessarily it's just philosophy and within that you can have some analytics people you can have some old school scouts people and some different philosophies of looking at the game and have those debates and do it in a healthy way and you hope you keep it respectful\nAnd you don't want to have factions but you do want to have different ways of looking at things not a bunch of yes men around\nAnd that's that's what you want to develop as a as a culture within a franchise and and that's what the method the opportunity to pull off here and again we'll see if\nA lot of those younger guys that think that way that have options if the Mets are the team that they want to give it a shot with only thirty these jobs and it's a big one in New York one that has some talent on the field will they get those kinds of interviews\nHere I'm curious ...

there's more well let's get to have on friday you think there's any way to put a lump get up against the uh the red Sox\nYeah I uh you know as as far as ... goes I'm now on\nGame one ah well dude that guy game five as well as the guy who had some success or for the Yankees against the red socks this year\nAnd you know we'll see what a if that's able to continue here are against the Boston Red Sox and then you know as far as Aaron Boone handling things in the\nUm [noise] last night\nOne of the big decisions he made was to take Louis ... out after the first two batters reached in the fifth inning\nAnd it was funny just screwing up my Twitter or you see half the people\nThought I shouldn't have even come out for the ... and half the people thought that hey he has taken him out too early this guy seven strike outs for plus cynics but that's what it is as soon as you get into trouble you're done you are out\nAnd you're not going to be able to stick around in the gay pitchers aren't going deep us they're perfect you won't see it the six innings that Jon Lester threw in Friedland at a a real deep start for the Rockies that's maybe is pitching oriented a game as you'll see this postseason\nThen the Indians astro series might be able to provide a little bit of that but most of these teams there they can't wait to take their starting pitcher out of the game and get into the pen that is the analytics what it tells him to do and we see iron boon utilize that part of it last night\nEight hundred three two one zero seven Gen again eight hundred three two one zero seven ten Randy Miller covers the ... bands media will be with us and the seven o'clock\nHour also Scott Miller of bleacher reports lots of baseball talked coming up right now and news update\nOn some of this is talk station you'll see rated number\nOne seven ten W O R voice of New York and\nHe can lock in for as long as he needs to do with uh these games meaning what they do\n[laughter] I think it's more than that when I when I watch I mean there's so many times that is fundamental or off but he just turns to love the wrong way doesn't get in front of it and he's a he's taught over and over and over and\nIt doesn't seem to it it just doesn't do it and [laughter] look here's one the best arms and legs you\nWhen he hit me and obviously it in the ... six last two years he was a ... catcher in baseball\nBut I think they're going to have to live with this I just it's been like this it was sixteen years old when I first signed them sixteen Seventeen and uh he still when he talked scouts it's just it's just crush them by how bad is eventually they think he's going to be at the age or a first baseman someday and last night he did do a good job\nAnd you watch them day in and day out to shake your head and say I I honestly I've never seen a catcher there's bad and and did a great job last night\nYou know he has a great arm it can be a huge weapon but I really worry that at some point especially Boston speed or the way they run the base is he going to get nervous you gonna get off game uh I think he's going to be a huge huge he and his next series\n... going forward Randy male or ... media coverage the Yankees with us right now today the workout day is it a lot of talking today was the most notable thing to come out of a Boston today\nWell there was a lot going on the Yankees clubhouse wasn't even open because of the Yankees train was slow moving Aaron Boone guy here I'm ... and there are two guys on the field answers was here J. happens here the game one starter and ah so nothing we're right\nAh I live in Philly so I found I got home a change close to the airport in Philly what there is two o'clock and I thought I had to rush to get here and the turns out to the the Yankees or didn't they canceled their workout so um so they offer them\nDead of a day what what do you think the biggest match up in the series what's going to decide this between the Yankees in ...\nI think the huge key is going to be the Yankees have to win one of these first two games if they can get home\nOne one way they played at all in the last two seasons as ... as they are there with a fan at the Yankees are going to win a serious to me it's going to be in for games and ah this is also a huge Fenway\nFenway Park is also a huge vantage half in game one has a chance to set the tone is going to get better and sell have been very good against a Red Sox this year end in Fenway force career also I'm just going to get a chance to win the red Sox won ... games a tremendous line up\nAt the Yankees are I think more than ... teams have a shot to bring them down a just cause they played them so much because of what they've done last year he will last week in Syria didn't mean much coming up here and one two three and a last weekend the seat and it kind of gave them extra fuel thinking hey ... we're going to be just the really really often\nYeah it is too talented teams meeting up in the ... the ads and a real talent American League overall you look at the asteroids and the Indians as well so it'd be fun to see how it all shakes out Randy male or ... media thank you Randy\nOK guys ...\nAh Randy uh getting a song caught up what's happening there with the Yankees and overall today a quiet day but you know a J happen it's gonna be ready to go in game one as\nThe Yankees Red Sox obviously these two teams quite familiar with each other and they'll have a another one of these years meeting up in the postseason it's been a while now you have to go back to two thousand for the last time they did meet up in the postseason but it\nIt feels like it happens I guess more often than it has a and a they'll get to the reignite things up between these two now as far as seasons series go to the Yankees actually won the season series but it's very tight uh ten nine Yankees uh\nOh she be the red Sox beat the Yankees is your ten nine as has very tight between these two teams the Yankees though I did\nA they were out scored by fourteen runs or by the red socks this year so uh we know they went up to Fenway got swept in that board game series late in the season I was a brutal sexually decided the division\nA but his brand imagine now is meaningless series but they did take two or three later in the year and I just think they got to feel good about the way last night went down not just that they won but how they won\nAnd some important momentum and\nUh some positive signs going forward Severino pitching will Chapman pitching well but tens is dominating last night looking like a real postseason weapon and make all the difference for you and potentially the guy that used as early as the death like we saw last night or you know Layton games as well\nI'll

postseason I've been saying for months I think this is a team that is built for what today's postseason is all about which is a great bullpen their starters stink remember\nWe were talking about the brewers in July that they should be making a big run at one of the ... starters whether it be Jacobs ... or ... wheeler adult we'll or would be a terrific pick up\nFor the Milwaukee Brewers they didn't do it they they really didn't address their starting pitching they'd they'd go out eventually get geo Gonzalez from the Washington Nationals but game one of a playoff series\nAnd the brewers sent Bryant in war drove out there today and they had no intentions of him pitching particularly deep into the game and he gave them three scoreless innings only allowed one base runners struck out three that is the absolute max that they could have expected from him\nAnd they know they're just going to be a bullpen games they went to court and burns for two main Couric enable for an ... two thirds he's the guy that you worry about in his brewers fan and Josh hater\nAs come on gotten one out does far got out of a a a base a runner on situation that enables set him up with by the brewers have the Rockies exactly where they want them it's tuna thing they've got six out to get\nAnd they've got Josh hater on the hill who has been all but on the hit a ball all season long and he is going to be what Andrew Miller was two years ago the Cleveland Indians he is untouchable\nHe could throw multiple innings he could retire let these and writings\nHater to me is\nAs valuable as any ace when\nYou get into the postseason because the difference doing hater and what even a Jacob ... could do for you is that hate or can affect every game he can't pitch three innings and every game but he can at some point get into the game\nEvery single time you've so many days off built into the schedule in October to on one off to on one off the max you play in a row is three assuming no rain out so you can use the same\nOr labor is over and over and the birds that very smart thing most of the season it wasn't until late in the year that they even used hater back to back days they were giving him even two\nAnd I I don't think it's as simple as the budget Jeff make Neal's in line drive ... are going to do it but you did see McNeil\nActually I've success\nHitting at home as well if you guys had more success at home or Ben at a\nBan on the road they have to be more on what\nNeeds to happen it's why I Want a center fielder another corner outfielder and you're faking it ... for Darwin center\nYou need to strengthen defensively and I know\nIt's easy to say well the analytic about the home runs now in the walks yeah but look at the best teams in baseball they have a young position
