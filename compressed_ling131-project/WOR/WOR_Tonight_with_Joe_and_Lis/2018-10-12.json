Dodgers in game one Clinton cursed Shaw\nA well at the start for LA and coming of age scoreless innings to it or to it's allowed against the Atlanta Braves and he's had those kinds of performances over the years in the postseason but for whatever reason\nAnd when we know the reason the ones that are memorable for him such a great regular season picture are\nUh the postseason failures and even after that game so four point oh eight career you already in the postseason for ...\nAnd we talked about this little bit with Danny Noble or as much pressure is there is on the Dodgers to finally get over the hump to finally win a World Series and add some hardware there to Dodger Stadium for the first time since Nineteen eighty eight\nIt's all going ... well nobody wants to be the guy that you didn't perform as best in the post season and this isn't small sample size territory anymore a curve shows a hundred and thirty postseason innings and\nHere's an e alright that's about twice what it is for him in the regular season two three nine regular season for weight post season so\nHe's had the opportunity here\nI had some terrific performance is last year a but really stunk and that I think it was the game five of the world series where he allowed the Astros get back in the game when he's staked to a big lead and ended up being the wildest game uh in recent memory in the world series but uh with uh with that\nDefeat even though they came back game seven pitch well the pen\nA it didn't so much matter so it's just a lot on the line you'll legacy wise as well for ... for the Dodgers and crush of course with that opt out as well as you never know just how much longer his Dodgers ten year would laugh but you'd certainly expect probably would not opt out at this point with some of the back problems that he has had\nOver the course of this year and encourage will be able to get ... for the Milwaukee Brewers and that's basically the best Milwaukee ... they get about a twenty innings out of their starting pitching total in the series you know the thing goes seven\nOr that might be surprised they they are not depending on their starting pitching to do a whole lot they are built on the bullpen Josh hater could end up throwing more ... than any starter for the brewers in the series and I would expect that to happen and that's the way it should be for the brewers Josh ... the best weapon the best picture that they have\nA you want to rely on him as much as you can uh and they'll you know look to the walking stories and Jeremy Jaffer says to\nFill out those other innings pitched an outstanding series against the Colorado Rockies now they'll have to do it against the Dodgers and then ...

Colombo became it as a rookie\nInstead on bold and would walk in and and you know you just immediately look at me so that you're you're just a different levels you like you're you're a man you're ready to just go out there and do this most will go through the things will go through you know they're in the deep end to the pool and they don't get it and they're confused and\nThey hit a wall and it just you know they go through those\nWilkie adjustments and he said and cotton balls and never once you're that young kids go to Australia either say he's just he's ready to go\nI guess it's certainly take that because you know even as a team as we chat with Bob was using it it's been up and down over the years but they haven't been able to string together some big victories coming off of\nThe big win against the Broncos on Sunday and now I see a one way in cold steam coming in what kind of a test is this for the jets to prove they can handle some prosperity\nWell you know I don't think this was some kind of wide ranging parameter\nUm for what Donald's going to be or for what they're going to be as organization them and I you know to me wide angle lens this is still a developmental gear for them a developmental year for the quarterback and not a year I was ever expecting they were going to be a playoff team but if you're just looking you know\nAnd kind of a silo of

understand he got a cup of coffee with the Cleveland Browns is head coach it didn't work out but there's a lot of coaches who weren't successful in their first stop and then suddenly rewrote the book on their careers moving forward like another coach who first coaching job was in Cleveland\nIt's still up there and Fox borough I think you know who I'm Talking about a new some pretty well for himself or I was willing to give ... second chance I was in a line manning supporter you may even call me an Eli Manning apologist if you want All right but I didn't think that he was the central reason why that team bottomed out last year and just couldn't figure anything out\nThe offensive line yes we know that they needed an upgrade and Dave gentlemen was proactive in doing so he went out and gave Nate shoulder the biggest contract ever for a tackle in the history of the national football league and that was they sold their worth it no of course not but you know what it's right place right time it's opportunity\nAnd he was a left tackle that was available and they had to do something\nSo they upgraded the position he is the second round pick on will Hernandez he looks like a good player right booted Eric flowers over to the right side on a short leash and we know that in hindsight he is now gone looking back K they signed Patrick ... from the Jacksonville Jaguars we'll get to him and a little bit that one hasn't quite worked\nOut\nAnd then with the sake one Barclay draft pick if you believed that Eli Manning was indeed still a guy who had some life left in that arm and still could play winning football for a couple of seasons like I did like I did\nThen I thought okay go ahead and Dr Barkley you're saying to the world that you weren't even when now team and then you're going to try to surround the line with this much talent as possible to be able to maximize what's left of his football mortality I was on board with all those things\nOne hundred percent everything they did this all season except resign or do back um junior\nNot backing guy never happened never will be and I know it's easy to pile on now but you know what I was never on that train from the get go the train left the station and I was not on there at the first stop I was gone\nBut the problem with the Barclay pick and we know that he's a sensational player\nWe know that he looks the part of a guy who's going to be one of the top backs in this league for many years to come but the problem with the Barclay pick and not selecting a quarterback is if you win nouns to yourself and you want an ounce to the world that we're already when now football team\nAnd right now\nYou look at this team and you look at the season and you look at the start that they've gotten off to and they're sitting there one in five and the latest display last night at home against the division rival\nIn your building and that was the type of effort you put forward you look at this giant teams are six weeks you tell me\nIs the worst team in the NFL right now maybe one you want to say Arizona maybe\nThink about what you're watching and I tweeted this out last night too and I don't mean this patrol giants fans I'm being dead serious but it's a question that we are going to examine here tonight as well over the course of the program\nIs this giant team today in the middle of October two thousand and Eighteen or are they any better off than they wore a year ago when you had a head coach who appeared way over his head in bend Mac do\nYeah I had a general manager and Jerry ... who was baton zero when it came to his recent transactions you want an offensive line that was as bad as any of the national football league I don't know if it's that bad this year but it's certainly not playing it any winning caliber\nAnd more importantly and we'll get to them in a second because I think you have to what's important you have an ownership group\nAnd ownership group which has tolerated this stuff and it was a loud this behavior and his allow this program\nTo disintegrate to the level that it is at right now and that is a problem and I don't think the ownership gets enough blame for what's been happening with this franchise\nWhat were you look at this team right now if you want to be on the surface you could be losing right now while also breaking in a new quarterback and they're not doing it because he lie manning is still a guy that they're running out there\nAnd I don't know deep down if they really and truly believe that he could still play winning football I don't know the answer to that\nI mean I have my guess is but I also think that what happened last year and the way that that whole situation was handled with Benjamin Eli Manning and giving Gino Smith starting job albeit temporarily and allowing Eli street to come to an end and how that was mixed with just a horrible reception\nRon ... out there you might as well be going down the same path that the jets went down to the last couple of years in trying to make something out of Bryce Petty or see if they had anything in Christian hacking\nBerg or something like that the chances a coyote long letter is going to be the successor to the evil eye manning thrown for the New York giants I think the answer is slim and none so you don't have an answer the quarterback position yes you have said Kwan Barclay\nOkay and he is fantastic he really is sake one Barkley is the franchise player now I don't care about all do back um I don't care about his contract\nSake one Barkley is your best player sake one Barkley who's the guy you want to build around that you want to mold your other players like\nThat is the guy that you should embody\nHe gets it on the field he gets it off the field the giants in a home run with that one you know what the problem is he plays the wrong position\nThat's the problem with thick one Barclay he is a running back so realistically speaking if you have an offense to begin with if you have no no no no offense like the giants do you're going to be riding him into the ground\nSo how much of a shelf life is he going to have\nYour five years six is he already going to be a broken down player if you're going to have to give this guy in the neighborhood uh thirty touches a game I mean is that were reduced to\n\nYou don't show up the offensive line that's going to be the problem if you don't have a quarterback that tend to be able to throw the ball five yards down the field that's going to be a problem and that's going to be the likely outcome but to me\nBut one reason where I look at this team and actually I think\nThat they are worse off than they were a year ago is big now that they are in bed with oh do back from junior and they are for the foreseeable future\nLast year you may have seen it out right last year he wasn't even around the team 'cause he was hurt but last year you at least had the prospect member of the ... the conversation was hot here conversation was busy shall we trade\nThis guy what's the point of keeping them around you don't think about what you could get for you really want to command big dollars to this player and make him the face of your franchise did you really want to do that I was against it\nI Would have traded him give me a number one give me a number one another you know three or four I Would have done it what were you winning with him what have the one with him and you don't have\nTo deal with the drama you don't have to deal with the headache you don't have to deal with the nonsense\nBut they already went down that road again and you know what that's not they've got 'em in school that's ... cool\nThat was ownership\nBecause you know what I'll do back him does for all the wrong reasons he keeps the giants relevant he keeps them in the news it gives you headlines\nAll of his antics they create attention\nSo you while you weren't winning any football games and while you are continuing to plummet down the standings over the last couple of years and nobody cared about you're on the field on Sundays they were at least gonna be talking about John Sundays for the crap that he pulled last week with the interview with ESPN\nThat's all anybody wanted to talk about out that the giants played not that the giants lost not that the giants were beaten up a gun by sixty three yard field goal or anything like that it was back them\nBack to them that come and they like that\nThey are in a horrible horrible state has a franchise right now is atrocious\nEight hundred three two one zero seven ten is our telephone number before we get some of these particular ... collectively as a defense I don't think they should get off easy either did they make a stop to get get get off the field at some point like I said this Philadelphia Eagles team\nWas not exactly the greatest show on turf so far here the season they were having a hard time putting points on board and they made it look easy last night they made it look like it was the super bowl against New England\nYou know this giant defense is one that doesn't force turnover is number one they don't get off the field on third down and those two things up that's going to be a problem for you and yes you could talk about the effort which some of these players last night on that side of the football just see the mist tackles\nDid you see some of those attempts yeah I'm sure they were really trying hard you could fool me you could have fooled me\nSo how 'bout effort whenever effort is brought up it always comes back to the head coach does it not and pat Schroeder last night after the game when he was meeting with the media\nWas asked your guys quit your guys try here was patch armor\nI said I'm not worried about their efforts I'm worried listen then he asked me about effort and then I said I wasn't concerned about their effort right there we go again one concerned about their effort as concerned about how we executed and how we didn't get in the end zone and how we let them in the end zone\nYou know why he's not concerned about the effort you know why he's adamant about it you know why because like I said that comes back to the coach you can talk about a guy missing an assignment missing to tackle drop in the past not making a block whatever that's players that's execution that's on the field that could even be missed assignment when you're talking about effort\nThat means that are male and then because they don't believe in the program\n\nThey believe that this was a runner leadership essentially\nThat's what they think when they don't try\nSo any coach and unfortunately if you were losing head coach you're going to say the same thing over and over and over again it's just coach speak at this point no we tried are now we gave it our best you know I saw a great effort out there\nI grew up going to games at the at old giants stadium\nFor the jets when rich coat type was the coach in Ninety five Ninety six and they want a grand total of four games which by the way is where the giants seem to be headed here for the rich go at the same answer every every game we battle bard we played tough you know there wasn't any quick we fought\nIt's the same garbage or from Ben Mac do last year and now it's starting to be the same thing you're hearing from pat charmer this time around it never ends but it doesn't get\nBetter either doesn't get better\nThere is no solution there is no light at the end of the tunnel and you tell me again that performance last night a short week at home coming off of a crushing loss a crushing loss against the division rival and that's how you come out\nThat's how you come out of the gates last night with everything to play for as bad as you've been as bad as you've been right\nRight there\nYou would have won that game last night as crazy as it sounds you would have been tied for the most wins in the division because nobody's running away with this and in the east nobody is\nAnd that's the effort that you put forward disgraceful\nI tell you if I was a giant fan I don't care that I paid for my tickets I wouldn't even go to the rest of the I I wouldn't even go what am I paying for what am I devote my time for it and especially the way the weather was last night to sit in that crap and that garbage\n\nIt isn't all bad though like I said sick one Barclays revelation\nGot that one right member they've got them and said that you know what his mother could scale that type of player he got that one right he's your best player that's the guy that you build around you just hope that they don't run him into the ground\nBut they have a lot more problems on that football team starting starting with that wide receiver\nAnd we'll talk more about him coming up next we'll also do more giants coming up with the top of the hour with pat Leonard he covers them for the New York daily news when we come back I'll tell you what my thoughts are on the show they'll Beck and junior collection of drama which has reached its tipping point are ready for this football team\nEight hundred three two one zero seven ten stand grants to infer peed on the sports zone the voice of New York seven ten W O R\nRoss Ah yes indeed we are here\nOn a friday night it's the sports own Dan in for Pete's that eight hundred three two one zero seven ten on the voice of New York seven ten W\nO R\nLet's get to some phones and understandably so the giant fan is fired up tonight how can they not be right well started off with Matt in red bank Matt you're on the sports on on Seventeen W. R. how're you\nDoing great all good Matt what's going on all\nLike all this is a a lot um it's it's hard to say if I could be a little objectives in life and then I Believe all I don't you start off your stay off the bat if it's if you\nCan get like a ... what elements of the giants play so what do I strongly believe that he like many is is actually a quarterback he left his age now it is on any NFL team he is all it all\nIf you get a T but it seems to me that\nIf you have to get back to the playoffs or at least as a as a winning say without any doubt I'm as I said the second issue\nIs is just ... I say the NFL is because he's more of the shows and um yes then as you said it's a it's a real us hate us so I say it is is on his back all of that and being in the news is diverting attention is probably well put\nClimbing I think that's the only way you can put a mat and I thank you for the phone call here look\nKnow Superbowl teams with the giants you would have thought that old down a scapegoat rush there against the patriots and Superbowl forty two and throw down the field and you thought oh down caught that passed with his head instead of David diary\nRight you've thought that was really so don't want you to think that that was him you know you would have thought that he lie hit all down for the game winning touchdown pass\nWas blacks to go and then what about the next Superbowl few years later\nToday on the sidelines the Mariel manning him no no no they'll either\nNothing absolutely nothing so essentially oh del on his best behavior oh they'll be in a team first guy right oh down being someone who's going to do right by the organization that lasted all five weeks lasted five weeks\nThat's some good bang for your buck if you're the giants right and how about last night too with the sideline antics head Bunning a giants fan and he says he does that to get them self motivated oh that's great great\nHere here was his explanation by the way after the game last night as to his running what that piece of equipment on the sidelines\nTells you ought to give us a role in uh [noise] you know that that's\nWhere I feel like some of those players right after you must have ... some office so I was just trying to get my so far the home and I did the mood to\nHelp me you know there was a lot of things going on with that hit me ...\nIs like I said if you live is maybe bring out the energy out on the way around it was supposed to give us a\nWhat is he talking about it it it brought out the best than him\nOr you got six passes for forty four yards\nWhat was so good about his performance last night like like what would if that was the best in what was the worst\nWhat was the worst I mean are you kidding me\nI mean that's what you gotta do to get yourself going to sit there and started head button way and you know the cameras are going to be on you\nSo he's see that's the thing about that he's not stupid scored intelligent actually\nHe knows the cameras are going to be on and which they were he knows that the people are going to be talking about him during the game last night which they were he knows what they're going to be talking about um all day long like today like we're doing right now which they are\nAnd he loves it see I really and truly believe in look I've never had one conversation with them not one but I really truly believe that old del Beckham has happier when\nHis name is in the news and when he's being talked about\nSo than even winning football games\nI Believe that because otherwise guys\nWhy else would you do the ESPN interview why else would you do that and it turns out he did it without the giants knowing so he knew he was pulling one pass them because the giants would probably say no way what little Wayne no thanks do little waiting\nTo go to ... see the giants were like you know the little one wants to be involved tell them to go to east Rutherford come down to the facility they can watch practice you could do lunch then we can sit there and have a nice little round table blah blah blah blah blah\nThis was done offsite without the team knowing because they know what the subject matter and the topics were going to be plain and simple and he became\nTalking point of the NFL I was a ... like stadium last Sunday 'cause we have the jets at home against Denver so I'm sitting there doing the pre game post game whatever and the guys back in the station or telling me and my ear during commercials all this stuff about the film and I said what do you talk I had no idea what are you talking about oh del interview\nDo you mean one of the Dell interview and I couldn't believe all this stuff that I was hearing but that's what people were talking about around the league\nKnock if the giants won they ban went against the that's the problem they don't win right now for anything he did on the field that was all that great but he did an interview\nAnd ruffled some feathers he's being honest is how they want to portray you don't want\nNobody cares would you have to say nobody cares what you think because guess what you haven't done anything to earn that you've won nothing\nAbsolutely nothing and did you hear his explanation\nHow about that when the cameras caught him for walking off the field with two seconds left in the first half did you hear his explanation as to why he decided to call it quits two seconds too soon did you hear that play that for you\nComing up next we'll get more giants coming up at the top two with pat Leonard from the New York daily news ... sitting in for Pete on the sports zones the boys in New York seven ten W. R.\nW. O. R. sports shows\nGuard fees is rough [noise]\nRoss in for paid here it's the sports zone on a friday night boys the New York seven ten W O R eight hundred three two one zero seven ten will talk will giants with pat Leonard covers him for the New York daily news so two seconds left in the first half last night\nAnd they show all do back and walking off the field into the locker room getting an early start like somebody you probably did maybe once the clock at five and you were ready to embark on your weekend\nNothing wrong with that right and you're thinking okay or at least I Am watching the giants must be taken any right nothing special then they flash back to the field and lo and behold no they're actually running apply they call it pass play and all that was not out on the field did he quit on the team is that oh del being old del again\nWell here was ... after the game last night asked about those fateful two seconds\nLater and I'd be you know he does he hydrated again [laughter]\nAh he went back in the locker room\nYeah oh yeah well I think you know guys some guys bodies kind of re hydrate quicker than others\nSo we just got to keep looking for ways to make sure he stays hydrate\nYou guys believe that\nAnybody anybody believe that there's a guy who every other day they want to remind you just how good are conditioned athlete who use\nPhenomenal shape but I'll do back um isn't\nWorkout warrior how he takes his job so seriously\nHis commitment to fitness and all this stuff\nAnd he needed an IV to ... he couldn't wait two seconds but are you going to have to be carried off a on a stretcher if we didn't wait two seconds while they were running a play this the guy who wants to be on his first team he'll have you believe in every single chance he gets but he had to walk off the field two seconds didn't need any help by the way just multiple phones they looked OK to me\nLook okay to me here's something else it's pretty sobering to your allies over the last twenty three games\nThe giants are for Nineteen bay of one more when during that time period than the Cleveland Browns they know what's even scarier biased you right now you could choose the future for either the giants are the browns you're putting stock in\nLike I'm taking the ladder we'll talk back Leonard next New York daily news here's the news\nYeah and so what that means is Kyle all that it doesn't mean playing him in Atlanta but\nLast season for example and Mac do should have been starting to get this Web ready saying weeks five or six or whenever it was eventually going to come and you didn't do that and that was part of the problem right so I think with the giants need to do now\nIs kicked in motion the idea of giving law lead to more rich and drag just getting an accurate for games and getting him into games whether it's after the by week or whatever because clearly this gel fans is too I Know people are still kind of\nHolding their breath to see will they really check you out when the when the organization starts changing their tune from when now to oh this was always going to be rebuilding on certain things that should tell you where they're going that should tell you they're prepared to put the rookie quarterback it at some point this year\nTalking with pat letter to the New York daily news and grass and for ... here on the sports on on the voice of New York seven ten\nW O R I and I said this earlier in the show pat I mean you could sit there and point fingers all you want about you know ... maybe in over his head they've got 'em and did a bad job assembling the roster ... getting all the office of mine\nYou want to start to the root of all of this and it's no different than the way it was last year my opinion this falls on ownership they're the ones that ultimately sign off on each and every one of these decisions and to me you know what it's time to start ratcheting up the pressure here\nOn those guys because merits ... primarily you know what they allow this organization to just disintegrate into what it is right now\nNo question and you know I'm I'm I'm working on a plan to fix the giant or wherever they go from here for Sunday's daily news and\nOne of the items I'm going to put in there is that they really need to take a motion out of these decisions because clearly there's too much emotion involved in the past and it's led them down the wrong path\nLike for example with Eli Manning situation last year the reaction to the fans and to the former giants or we're going to revolt against the decision and how when John\nBrennan ownership knew what was going to happen Maris signed off it was going to happen\nChanges his mind um and really just should've been there in the first place when it was going down but what what needs to happen here is merit needs to understand no matter how much it hurts no matter how much ripping the band\nAid off are saying goodbye to your two time Super Bowl winning quarterback however painful it is it will be less painful than continuing to make the same mistakes and we have Groundhog Day every year here walking by and the defense or you know and that was to me I'm sure we're getting into the law was saying\nAbout last night and when you say you know ownership is to blame\nYou're coming back a year later and you got guys on the field they look like they're not giving a hundred percent so not only do you have personnel issues and quarterback issues or whatever coaches shouted you you got guys who you should have gotten how out of the locker room an off this team Bush still in the building\nMy ... to me more if we want to name names and I'll go there I have no problem with that and you know it's funny too\nAnd when you look at the side of the football there with the defense that's where you question the effort\nThat's where you look at the way they played last night against an eagles team which hardly hardly resemble the team that won the super bowl I mean you know this that they scored more points in the first half when they've scored in any game all year so far this year this was a team that was not firing on all cylinders and you know what the cure all is pat\nIt's a giant defense because they can make any off insult good\nYeah you know ... and it was interesting the the one Dr where Olivier Vernon and cream Martin in the past rush you know really just ended eagles drive by themselves\nYou know they stopped there was especially there was one way that he was Jeffrey was wide open it would've been like a thirty or again thank lord burning or Martin got their knocked the ball down a bit more often than not went to all day to throw and even when Cory comment\nOr anybody was running the ball the lanes are wide open missed tackled even on special teams guys just lifting off tackles a way too easily and frankly you know I thought ... where they had it right on the head I mean they were harsh on the broadcast but they were dead on and you mentioned Jenkins ...\nSo many ways and you know to my knowledge there's nothing wrong with him I mean I you know I thought maybe I'll maybe is what's hurting and this and that but I you know he's not on you as a bit on the injury book report\nOr you know like last year he was dealing with a foot injury most of the season according to him that was part of the reason and some of those games but we saw some quit last year and when you see a guy you're paying that much money a quick you know quitting or not giving maximum effort um do you like you said it's ... it's time to make some tough decisions and\nThat's one thing I Need to say about patch server is he's not going to throw guys under the bus publicly\nBut he's a tough guy this is this team that was on the field against the eagles\nDid not resemble anywhere close to the team he thought the giants were and the genie needs them to bed so there's more harsh a personnel decisions coming down the pike\nHere I couldn't afford seen this I thought that they would be a lot better than this ... I'm really shocked I mean I don't know if this was a playoff team but I certainly didn't expect to see once again to be one of the worst than the national football league when you talk about battles on the defensive side of things do pat I think to me\nOne of the most staunchest fights that I saw last night was the brouhaha between pat Leonard a nanny apple on Twitter last night after the game what was that all about it\nYeah so uh I approached Eli Apple in the locker room as he was walking away from his locker as land in college was talking there nearby and I asked him if he had a quick second or a question or two and you know we're about halfway down through the locker room and\nI Would have been done asking him about a couple of things just by the time we got to the door and he said he didn't want to talk to me and I said are really well why not are you kidding me and he said no no I don't I don't want to talk and it turned out I guess he had talked to a couple of other people or maybe on his way out\nBut it seemed like he lie apples mother um thought that I was somebody who chased him down in the hallway\nI guess when he was approaching his family and was giving him a hard time or asking him for time and he declined so I think there were some wires crossed there where I said you know he declined to talk to me in the locker room and I didn't appreciate it especially coming off last year where those were accountability issues\nWith him Mm um and I think any apple\nIs mother seemed to interpret or believe that I had been somebody who I guess approached him when he was with family and I'm obviously that would be more sensitive time to understand that someone wouldn't want to talk so seems like a misunderstanding or but obviously wants things go out on Twitter they uh they never come back\nAnd they have a life of its own as you said you know again you might apple he won the runoff last year to the point where\nYou know I wouldn't even a brought him back this year and I know he hasn't been horrible or wasn't it's not as being as bad a train wreck 'cause it was a season to go for a variety of reasons but uh just the fact that he's on this team is even quite surprising we're talking with pat Leonard of the daily news talking about the giants here on the sports on on the voice of New York seven ten W O R\nThe auto Beckham situation we can sit here and talk about this for an hour um if we had the time but um it's still nothing has changed pat and I do think that this team I I sell repeat what I said earlier\nAnd they were going to rue the day that they decided to sign up for another tour of duty with him because nothing has changed\nHe did everything and set everything that they want to be here before he got the money now that he's got the money it's the same old garbage same old old Dale it's about him and not the football team and coincidentally enough the results on the football field aren't any different\n[noise] yeah I mean you know it's it's insane to think how quickly this has come from him signing and getting twenty million signing bonus sixty five guaranteed now to this point where I'm telling you in the locker last night you could feel how on notice he is from the head\nTo the owner like John merits kind of watching from across the room and she was talking to the media or you know there was Jake lasers report report that they find him and not only a reprimanded him and native apologize to his teammates and you know\nThis is the thing and this is what I was going through about pat server he's not going to tolerate lack of everybody's not going to tolerate drama he's the boss\nAnd as long as Becca is going to do things his own way or you know regardless of what the giants what they are going to come down on him uh but you know with a contract like that and that signing bonus yeah I've I've had a lot of fans asked me today are they going to trade and we've had enough of them it's not that easy now and he is a great player\nA but because they misjudged their team so badly and brought him back and now they don't even have a succession plan of who was quarterback will be post the why she's talking about all we move on from Eli but you don't do that as quarterbacks going to be and you gotta star receiver you're paying ... billion dollars so you can't get on the ball anyway so it's just a perfect storm\nAnd of course again we were talking about things that take a life of on their own like on Twitter\nThat interview he did especially his comments about not knowing if he's a happy in New York and talking about LA you can't take those comments back no no they're always going to be out there and John marriage each fish when they're that must have gone through the freaking Ruth I Wish I'd been there when they heard\nIt can't be not surprising even though ... that's the problem I mean this is what you signed up for it's not like you're just beginning a relationship with this player they knew that this was his character nobody likes to make it about himself\nAnd they know that only cares about is getting his name out there on the conversation even more so than whether or not they win or lose I mean even that outburst last night on the sidelines when he's head bobbing the fan\nHe did that after steak one Barclay goes out and make some nice places on the field it's like okay the other guy's doing good on a field but look at me I'm going to act like a child on the sidelines\nZone so we put the giants the bad we come back we will talk about the other football team in town team that maybe a little bit more optimism that would be of course the New York jets they got one coming up on Sunday against the colds it's grass and prepared here on seven ten W well war [laughter]\nW. O. R. scored zone filling in for people to guard he used in bras [noise]\nPressing for paid here on a sports films voice in New York seven ten W O R eight hundred three two one zero seven ten we think Pam Leonard do happen on when I was talking a little New York giants football\nWe will get the jets signed a things with Anthony ... coming up in about an hour he one of my co host to the\nJets pre game show on the jets radio network there in Ninety eight Seventy ESPN and we will talk Rutgers football would head coach Chris ... coming up\nAt eight twenty five so still a lot more to do here on this busy friday and speaking of the jets we have to them now an eight hundred three two one zero seven ten and they have themselves\nA bit game to say the least coming up on Sunday against the Indianapolis Colts the second of three consecutive home dates they took care of business last week snapping there three game losing streak in\nConvincing fashion beating the Denver Broncos and it was really similar\nTo that season opening went against the Detroit Lions right we're all three phases kind of game together often the fence special teams and\nThe result was a pretty emphatic W over Denver bronco team which in my opinion is really nothing special I think they're pretty mediocre at best they can't walk down the road we know that they've also women out of twelve away from home so it I mean I don't know if they went out there and beat one of the best teams in the AFC but regardless\nYou know what you have to win a game and they stopped the bleeding at least temporarily that window will mean absolutely nothing absolutely nothing if they don't go out there and take care of business on Sunday against the coach theme that\nYes there shorthanded once again they're going to be without TY holding their number one receivers are going to be without jak going on one of the plane making tied ends but you still have Andrew Luck you still have some talented players on that team and Indianapolis\nIs a wounded animal right now that's what would concern me about this game okay they've lost three games in a row and they've been pretty close K they went down to Philadelphia\nAnd put a huge scare into the eagles remember an eagles team which embarrassed the giants last night they went down there in lost the very very tight game you know they lost the Texans by a field goal they had a game that they were neck and neck with the Cincinnati Bengals in week one too where some things kind of got out of hand and the second half of that game um\nYou know they went to Washington and want a football game they're not awful\nYou know and Thursday night last week against the pats up and Fox borough does Thursday night games are a disaster let's face it especially for the road team unless you're playing the giants of course so I don't really take a lot of stock in them getting obliterated like they did by Brady in company a week ago this is a tricky spot for the jets for the simple reason that\nI don't think they're good enough to just be able to step down on the field and say that they're going to beat somebody\nThey're not that type of football team okay and they'll be the first ones to tell you that\nYou know and I think if you're a jets fan one of the positives that came from a locker room this week and I was out of foreign park that when my duties for you know the pre game show they were just talking with some of the guys and you know to a man that is something that I heard quite a bit we're not good enough\nTo just step out there and say we're going to win a game so they know that that is the message\nAnd the fact that they've been down this road before to where they tasted prosperity right off the baton week one and they were the toasted the town everybody was talking about\nOh well this team looks like they could do some damage and they could be special and Sam Darnell listen Sam Darnell that and then what happened they came out flat the next week against the dolphins at home\nThey dug themselves a deep hole in the first half in one or they couldn't climb out of and they end up losing the game and they go on a three games skid until they finally snapped that last Sunday so I think that it's incumbent upon the fact that you better\nGet rid of those bad habits right off the bat and come out here and play like you are playing one of the best teams in football that's how you have to approach each and every game and as I said that wouldn't last week against the Denver Broncos is not going to mean anything\nIf they don't take care of business against Indianapolis and if they're able to do that thinking about how the complex and changes here a little bit right you get to three and three you're five hundred team with ten games to play your back at the break even point you say All right\nThis is the record we had last year maybe we can still do some things", "year": "2018", "show_name": "WOR Tonight with Joe and Lis", "city": "New York", "day": "12"}
