Cora went to him of course they had a couple of game cushion there so it will be interesting\nHow long it goes with these guys I mean the ideal situation is highly ends up all the hater game over somehow six seven innings give it to ... to ... I don't think we can do that at this point I'm a boat starters have been seen a lot by ... by this other by their\nOpposition so be interesting to see how how he uses but he's definitely going to use his top guys can able Jeffress and hater or the guys for sure yeah Josh\nHater sevens gross endings twelve strike outs in this postseason for Craig ... out of that penalty Gonzalez alone with Jesse Rogers joining us live from Miller Park you're on baseball tonight on ESPN Radio all then I looked\nAt the Dodgers lined up from day Robert standpoint making that change with the lead off spot going with David Freese I thought that was pretty strange to me that he's only had been in the lead on spot three times in his career why Roberts making that move [noise]\nI think it's very simple here um they have no idea how long waiting Miley is going to be in this game he faced one batter in game five and so\nIf you're if you're not going to see much weight Molly you you want to get as many good looks against him as possible and David freezes probably Dodgers best option\nIn terms of the political situation in getting good looks against left handed pitcher is I think it's really that simple\nAnd I think one thing that's interesting about the way the series is played out and I and I think it probably has to do with the way that the the brewers kind of a ... a user bullpen I'm Jesse they Robert hasn't really use the match ups as much because if he were met cap would be in there today and recon Hernandez be than today ... would be he's got Coney Island during their\nShe's got max Muncie there he's not really worried about the matchup thing because the brewers have just you know you have no idea how long you're going to see what yeah\nBut when it comes to free they actually think he is thinking of the matchup thing because what he wants to do with freezes get too fat side of him with a lefty on the mound and then when the tourists go to the Penn which is probably going to be fairly early\nThen he'll he'll pitch for free sea breezes hitting six\nHe may only get one at bat against the lefty now you've kind of wasted\nA a decent hitter so you're you're bad I'm up high getting those two at bats assuming may Miley is going to be in there for three innings and then get them out so in that case he's using the match up but I'm On the other side man I mean council talked about the Dodgers ten has been great against the Bruins I mean they've\nHad they've produced do damage I I think this game comes down to what happens early\nIn the game of divorce take a lead I think it's such a perfect with open if they have to play from behind watch out this is going to be you know maybe a Dodgers\nRed Sox World Series and I think that's been a really good time by the Dodgers that Kelly chance and has been right\nThree and a third shot innings that's what they need\nAgain David Freese in the lead all spots tonight for manager Dave Roberts Jesse I wrote the story it's on ESPN dot com right now Machado is October's newest villain gives a little bit more detail because it's seemingly from the optics starting to be to be the case in October [noise]\nYeah I mean this is this road itself I mean first game back at Miller Park since the the two slides and run past first on ... Machado was a this crowd is going to really give it to Machado or it turned out that it's almost\nIt's going to be interesting 'cause council mentioned the crowd pre game and how it can maybe spur them on especially offensively\nThey will have that villain to get them going\nYou know what I mean so much I don't get the crowd going the crowd then in turn gets diverse going so it could work really in their favor or there is no doubt I talked to some fans yesterday they were eating their free hamburgers because they won twelve in a row 'em and\nThey are going to direct their anger towards manning Machado early in this game I think it's an easy one to to to to predict right he's going to hear it because it is the first time since those three incidents\nIn Los Angeles just have a question for you what do you think the crowd reaction is going to be when many metallic presented with you I don't see us MVP trophy ... if the Dodgers when today it's actually pretty strange I was looking at it today\nMany metabolism nine thirty five O P s in this postseason obviously small sample size but it's easily the best on his team I Can't think of anybody else if the Dodgers were to win the series\nThat would be more deserving of the MVP trophy then him what an amazing story like well\nYou have to pull back from that and just think about baseball the optics here's a guy that played a little dirty has admitted he doesn't hustle and he might be handed that trophy it's kind of a\nWeird thing you'd think he'd be having a horrendous and I'll see us but numbers why they're very good but the the other stuff not so good so it's an interesting point I was in good good\nJesse Rogers ... thank you both enjoy the game tonight\n[noise] you got it affects\nHer thanks to both as you don't want to miss the Dodgers and the brewers and the national league championship series potentially for game number seven Sunday eighties turn on that first one with our pre game starting here on ESPN Radio at seven eastern time job recently\nIn the studio and that's not baseball and I presented by ... seats after five pitches on Wednesday what must wait Miley do tonight as this is\nThe national league championship series on ESPN Radio on the ESPN out [noise]\nI'm a new show and fuel rewards cards and then he was telling your MasterCard with me you say ten cents per gallon up to twenty gallons every time you fill out that the same with me and you also earn ten percent rebates on your first twelve hundred dollars a non fuel purchases for your show stations yeah and I can do you any were massacred at oh I like you already\nEggshell it's all about saving WWW dot ... us less get rewards and apply today have participated in shelters has only been conditioned to play\nFast ball five out here oh it's football is back in vivid seats is you go through for game tickets just go to vivid\nSeats dot com or every purchases fact by their one hundred percent fire guarantee from the big house or the swap vivid seats has you covered so get off the couch and get into the action your team needs you fill the seats the official\nTicket partner of ESPN enter promote coat ESPN a checkout to receive ten percent of your order today [noise]\nMine number ... does not look like a number two I don't know what to call it isn't there a number three [noise]\nPeople for for police [noise]\nMiddle leap repeat permanent problem\nThat my fear of flying [noise]\nSound like you if it does you could be one of the many people with a digestive condition called ... pancreatic insufficient heat or a pie I even if you don't know what he ... he is you might know the symptoms frequent diarrhea gas\nBloated stomach pain if you have even just one of these symptoms you could still heavy PI because not everybody experiences he'd pee on the same way which is why it's so important to open up to your doctor about oh your symptoms and the good news is\n... manageable so don't keep a lid on it good why Denis ...
