{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "Taken ate and ate and said that was a good season yet Donald in some work let them get the experience see what he's got and then when it's all said and done you're ready to hit\nThe ground in two thousand and Nineteen maybe with a few weeks the roster you go out there and spend some money remember the jets are gonna have more money under free agency than any club or the NFL or thereabouts they're gonna like Seventy million dollars and kept space\n... they're going to be able to ... go get whatever they want in free agency and this isn't a finished product yet just because they have a young quarterback doesn't mean that they're ready to be a legitimate playoff team you still have to run out this roster but it doesn't mean you can't be competitive\nAnd it doesn't mean you can't go out there and and and and upset some teams and being your share of\nGames\nSo I think the steam as talented enough on their best day to ruffled some feathers we've\nSeen it right we've seen it when things are clicking they can play some football and they can be in some games\nNow what's your song offensively they'll last week against Denver look you're not going to put up over five hundred yards of ... we can and week out\nThat's not going to happen you're not going to run for over three hundred yards weak in and week out like they did but if you can harness that and if you could even just get a fraction of that type of production\nYou'll sign up for it each and every week and it's about\nGrowing all with this quarterback as your focal point on the often some side of the ball I think that it was great to see him in ... and connect on a couple of chunk plays last week right Robin or soon as the guy who we know is a legitimate vertical threat the guy who can stretch the field\nYou want to see more of that he's the guy that outside of one catch against\nYou know the Detroit Lions on that first Monday night has really been MIA\nHad a couple of costly farm bull's eye in consecutive games but dolphin game and the Cleveland Browns game which turned the tide of those football games you don't want that\nBut if he's going to be able to contribute like you saw last week\nThat only helps the quarterback and it helps the off and you know if they can get ... prior involved a little bit\nYou know he made a heck of a catch and a heck of a job getting his feet down in the corner of the end zone there to be able to get six on Sunday that's what you want to see you know Noone what's been the guy that Donald is kinda zeroed in on he's been that security blanket he's been that safety blanket\nFine but with the experience and more snaps and more ... you start to develop a little bit more familiarity with seeing the field going through your progression going through your ... and then not just walking in on one guy singing the entire field\nYou know one of the\nTerms that Darnell used to talk about last week's game was quiet ... feet he had quiet feet in the pocket which means he settled down a little bit more and that's the object if that's the goal\n\nAm I prepared to sit here and say the same Darnell does savior he's got it I think it's way too early to announce that but I can also sitting here and tell you that there's a lot to work with there and there's a lot of positive attributes and he does do some things and he does show flashes to where you say my goodness you know what the jets have themselves a keeper\nAnd we also at the same thing about Mark Sanchez to after a couple of years remember he took a couple of teams to back to back conference championship games\nAnd you're really thought that the savior had arrived but then what ends up happening was they put more on Mark Sanchez plate and he wasn't adept to handle it right and he fell apart and when they asked him to be more of a\nLeader on the offensive side to throw more to not be a ground impound team like they were those first couple of seasons and had him go out there and throw the ball fifty times game that's one of the mistakes started to mount\nAnd that's what you don't want to have happen with Sam Donaldson only completed pen passes last week\nBut it was ... or if it was quality over quantity big how many explosive plays a big place we're able to be engineered and that's what it's all about\nLeading your team down the field putting the ball in the end zone and walk in there at off the field of winter that's the objective of every single quarterback and Arnold did that\nAnd he got a game this week that if this team is serious about turning the corner and if this team is serious about growth in the coal sit home our team that you should take care of that is a game that you should win\nStand bras and for being here it is a sports zones the boys in New York seven ten W well are are used in the U.S [noise]\nAnd play with pretty much here on a friday night if they have rising and for the sports zone on the voice of New York's Seventeen W O R eight hundred three two one\nZero seven ten is the telephone number got a jam packed final hour all lined up for you Anthony back to one of my co hosts on the jets pre and post game show on the jets radio network he will join us\nTalk a little bit more about the green and white and we'll do our weekly chat\nWith the head coach of the Rutgers scar the nights

afternoon in the game that can be heard right here on seven ten W O R beginning\nAt eleven thirty AM so we will talk to coach ... coming up at that point and you know another thing on the jets you look at the opportunity\nThat presented itself here in the way they say if the shakes out\nYou know New England as themselves very difficult game coming up Sunday night against Kansas City they're undefeated they're flying high so that is going to be a tall order for the patriots you know the dolphins have a good bears team coming down there in Miami's banged up a little bit tannahill as if he doesn't sound like Cameron Wake is going to play\nAnd Buffalo's going on the road to take on the Houston Texans so it's not that crazy\nTo suggest that if the jets could take care of their business against Indianapolis that maybe they're sitting there tied for first place\nBy Sunday night and who would have thought that one of the sky was falling to many and they weren't limits that three game losing streak that's how quickly things can change\nIn the national football league but he can't worry about what's happening out of town you can't worry about the scoreboard you're the jets and this is the message if they've been preaching all week I'm sure you worry about what's in front of you and that is the Indianapolis Colts a very beat a bowl opponent put a dangerous one\nBecause of that quarterback that's coming up on Sunday like we said we will talk to Anthony backed\nWe will talk to Rutgers football coach Chris Ash all in that final hour it stand in for Pete on the sports zone and the boys in New York seven ten W all are right now we will pause gets all caught up with a news update\nWent crazy and so people were wearing the Oakland A's gear right so is he has money ball\nBy the way\nOh he lost all his money yet lawless all this money that commercial was great that came out like ten years later and like ... and he's like he's like dancing all of a sudden these the foreclosure house [laughter] I don't think he cursed because I felt like he tweeted out something\nPrior to the wild card game about the Oakland A's and I said I might have been that day as a matter of fact and I remember even replying said no there's no way they could lose now and then sure enough that's what happened\nThey couldn't touch that fast ball you know going to win such this no\nCouldn't not at all\nThat's funny so started jak it's coming back so be on the lookout for that and we'll we'll ask Anthony about how his home shopping stuff\nGoing on and of course he's all over the map with the college football and whatnot so he's a busy guy and it's nice to fit in some time for us here a little bit later on in the program as far as the Yankees are concerned as we do a nice little transition of baseball\nYankee season came to an earlier this week they've had a couple of days to collect their thoughts let the dust settles after losing to the Boston Red Sox in four games and there's going to be some\nDid it come to a program on a consistent basis the urgency or plan C what we're trying to do see how much we've been proved that a lot of areas you know we we got to win and and develop on the inside before the result short consistently on the outside of that is what we're doing if people see that when they're here\nWell coach who really appreciate a couple of minutes here tonight best of luck of course tomorrow in the rest of the season and hopefully I'll get to a game before the season is over thanks again for joining me I appreciate it\nThank you guys take care of but they're
