yesterday's game for the New York jets and it just to me it struck me as even though they lose by twenty in the end I was a game or\nThey could have found a way a one sequence that drove me nuts and last week I complimented the jets for what they did\nPrior to the end of the first half would they let their hair down they let Sam Darnell drive them down to field a note was only a field goal it was a well executed two minute drill and that's the number one area\nWhere you see a quarterback make a difference right\nAt the end of the half the end of the game when you need to drive a team down the field do you have the ability to do that\nAnd yesterday should have been one of those situations where you'll let Sam Darnell do it again now I understand there's a big difference between the Colts defense in the Minnesota Vikings\nBut for the jets to mismanaged the clock in the way that they did a minute twenty eight to go in the half the Vikings just Mr third down opportunity the clock is running\nAnd Todd Bowles looked at tech all the way down and eventually the Vikings call a timeout after uh the plight caught went to zero they kicked a had a field goal attempt they miss the wins there were unbelievable but\nThe jet should have had a minute twenty to do something at the end of the half to move the ball down the field and instead what do you get\nThey keep it time outs they lose the full forty seconds talking about cannot be worth more than forty seconds by the way there there's no reason to hold onto it that's going to lose the whole forty seconds at a time when you do need it\nYou use the time out and that's a total ... by Todd Bowles\nAnd then they can't snap the balls a problem all day yesterday Spencer Long understand their centers playing with a dislocated finger and it's affecting him but basically you have the old Darnell jumps on it and it's up to give it up\nAnd you know they don't want to risk a third down and the Vikings potentially getting the ball back but some time but\nIt's just scary cat football and if you're going to trust Sam Darnell to be er franchise quarterback let em shine in that kind of spot lent him drive your team down the field or at least give it a shot\nAnd learn at the very least as he goes about it and you know to go in and say oh we're down three that's good enough\nYeah make something happen\nAnd it's not enough but it clearly wasn't enough as a they basically got their clocks cleaned in that second half the turnovers became a big problem and a one bad turn over from Sam Donald otherwise some tips in a lot of drops by ah the jets receivers running backs titans everybody\nWho was involved in that yesterday but what struck me is you know that's a game where I don't think the Vikings looked like a great football team Adam feeling is a great football player he's amazing\nTo watch ah he just finds himself open every other plays amazing or moves the chains you can make big plays ... ah you know quite the receiver and quite a year he's having for the Vikings but um besides you know where he brought to think that Minnesota defense played great yesterday the jets defense\nHeld their own in this game until the very end that fourth down play with the Vikings put it away with a touchdown late\nAnd you could see where the jets are short how they are short of a team like Minnesota but if they're not able at home to take down a team like the Vikings or at least you know keep it within a scorer late in the game\nYou know this isn't a postseason team and that's not a shock it's not a surprise is a team or the jets were talking about\nIf Sam ... shows progress you're happy with the season if he shows you can be a franchise quarterback that's the a number one and and what I focused on all year\nBut now here we are about six or seven weeks and I feel very confident checking off that box that while we haven't seen Darnell have superstar glimpses a whole lot ah he has\nBeen an NFL caliber quarterback doing it at Twenty one years old on a team that doesn't have a whole lot of authentic talent around him so they've\nBeen successful in that way I think they have something and Sam Donald even if it's not necessarily going to be the top five quarterback in the league\nOr he is an NFL franchise quarterback and I think that part of it has been answered even on a date where he didn't look all that great like yesterday or playing in the elements in had three interceptions but\nAh to me was evident yesterday is the lack adapt the lack of weapons that the jets have and boy\nThey have a hundred million dollars they could go out and spend and free agency this off season and they got to spend many they'll defensively to number one thing this team needs to pass Russia\nAnd they got us and five guys every single time of her cousins to get any kind of a rush and what happens when you leave or corners on islands\nAnd you get beat and that's what happened in this game yesterday especially in the second half so I'm you know the jets to me it's personnel and coaching\nYesterday it does drive you nuts how the end of that first step was handled and I know there are some complaints about some replay reviews that Todd Bowles should have called for I I didn't I didn't take her cousins I didn't think it was a safety or I didn't they ... they deserve the catch\nI don't have a problem with those but you have to be able to coach those late half situations far better than jets have done over the years that's why last week he gets the culture is such a shining light at the jet to actually put up points and drove down the field at the end of a half\nAnd that's an area where they lacked yesterday and they shouldn't be there should be able to find a way to at least be aggressive in those spots and you know what the kids grows up so be it\nBut go down swinging rather than\nThe one and went down at the end of that first staff wasting a or not using time outs wasting time and ultimately I'm not scoring the points they need to this is an audience of lake you can't just say hey or defend to hold up which scored seven points in the first half that's enough you know thirty points to win these games in the league right now\nThis is not a defense first football league you need to be able to score so when you have that opportunities at the end that it happened to the game you better be able to get your team down the field and trust her team to do it in kneeling it out and it's not going to cut\nA eight hundred three two one zero seven den again eight hundred three two one zero seven and a number or the jets are thirty seven Seventy and lost to the Vikings as\nThey are the competitive part of their season or certainly takes a turn they dropped the three and four overall and now it's trade season coming up in the NFL what are some moves that could be made a big move that was made today in the NFL will tell you about that\nAnd it only makes sense if you paid five thousand dollars for personal seat license just you have the right to pay a hundred plus dollars per ticket per game including the to pre season games and you don't get a whole lot out of having that personal the allies since well\nAre you going to give it up after ten years even if you don't you don't have the the the means to to make it work do you think of it as well I'm already in this bar so you know if I could sell these games I get my money back and\nI just think the whole thing they took away not only the die hard fans and the people were willing to go there and make some noise but they've set it up so there's a whole field vantage there at all it's it's like fifty fifty at these games it's unbelievable\nTo me that question I have there with that P. S. L. and I remember going through all this and just do the more boring than pay us all talking but\nYou know you purchase that now what happens if you decide you don't want to go any more you still own that TSLs somebody have to buy that P. S. L. from you I I don't know everything about it but nobody's buying the ... no in fact they felt season tickets now and you don't have to buy the ESL anymore which upsets some people that you bought it ten years ago but they\nThey ripped through the whole season ticket weightless that doesn't exist anymore\nAnd it's a whole different world with the games and I understand they can\nPick and choose you go to one game or two or as a band that it's part of what you know the secondary ticket market does for you to not just for out of town bans but\nThese teams and I'm sure it's not just the jets but they have basically taken away what should be a whole field advantage and it's not there at all and it's I mean yes it's\nSixty percent jets fans forty percent Vikings fans in what's it going to be later on the season you get to November December the jets lose a couple of games here and now the patriots come to town you know exactly what it's going to look like they're and it's just a yeah it's it's a shame because there should be some excitement about the team that right now and I think there is and yet\nThe way these things have been set up and [laughter] you know you\nPlay in front a bunch of Vikings fans that every one of the jets players get be thrilled about that eight hundred three two one zero seven than the number or the giants with a huge game tonight Atlanta gets the falcons pat Leonard the New York daily news outlets break that one down the giants still hold on to some kind of life here\nWith how bad the NFC East has been a ... an absolute absolute must win for the giants this could be any meaning in this season will get it to pat when we come back sports on with the McCarthy on the voice of New York ... double you will work\nWith the new chasing business unlimited credit card you get unlimited one point five percent cash back on every protests simply you don't even have to think about it to think about opening your shop early\nDon't think about that one point five percent cash back\nAbout automating some of your operations think about delivering across town across\nEverybody is that the one part that works but out of hot\nHere in business unlimited card learned more I chased dot com slashing credit card to issue I think usa any prescriptions medications that by\nSaturday October twenty seven is national prescription drug take back day help keep prescription opioids out of the wrong hands and reduce the risk of diversion missing and it'll be in\nWhen you're appealing medicine expires or you no longer need at please just those of left out for medicines and a drop off location as quickly as possible for more information or to locate that take back their location closest to you go to a D.

Rio against David Price and walk reviewer will go in game three for the Dodgers the red Sox to be determined there I guess the one that jumps out to me it is David Price\nIn that as he\nWith that start that he had the al ... does he have full confidence now of the red Sox he can go out there because he was kind of in between the rotation in the bullpen for a while there\n[noise] yeah he was um you know I I think that start really boosted his top of that set out full confidence hard to say I I think you know Pete if we get out here tomorrow night gave one\nAnd price has a good first ending I think are good starts going to be really or for him because if he has a good first inning and then a good second adding\nAll that confidence from the game the other night is just going to continue the bill but if he gets into trouble like say the first thing that I think all of a sudden uh you know that that what he did last gave all that are\nThat they would they they'll be quick to parliament and that's what we see in the postseason\n[laughter] yeah you know well I'd like to talk for his own self confidence but yeah also I could see you're right I mean I I don't know I mean I think David prices probably within the red Sox organization in at least in the postseason yeah I see you know he's probably on double secret probation and\nI I agree yeah they're not going to like go you know to deep if he starts it get it a lot of traffic on the basis\nHad been nine with six plus the IRA or in started the postseason until that outstanding out in game five or to clinch the series against the Houston Astros occupy Lee Scott what do you think's the difference in the series who do you like\n[laughter] you know I I like the red Sox I I just think that if everything goes right for them they certainly can with the reason I say the red Sox\nI really like this line up as I did coming into opening day because they hit home runs the contact hitters it's very versatile they've got some athletes athleticism they've got guys who could run a but especially the fact that one through died contact hitters and guys they can do some damage\nOr the Dodgers are concerned you they rely on a home run so much and they're they're so good with scoring positions right that's what the difference and I think ah\nYou know you could argue the Dodgers pitching could be a little bit better um overall but again they've prices while part there so you know we'll see but I think by and large the red Sox a hundred and eight wins this year I mean that this team as a machine I Know that\nThe hip thing going into October among some of the baseball players was all you know the Yankees are going to beat the red Sox Red Sox are like well respects took it to the Yankees it in\nA while Houston's pitching there's no way bosses can be able to get past that and they clobbered him at five games I mean this is a really really good team I think it's a really complete team and I think they're going to uh it's giving too much for the Dodgers to handle\nAll right Scott Miller likes the red Sox in this series we'll see how it plays out in the Scott always a pleasure thanks much coming on\nA pie or me to thank you always enjoy talking baseball's you\nRide a Scott Miller bleacher report or give it it's a ... game one tomorrow night you'll be able to hear it right here on seven ten W.

actually experiencing and enjoying life this does not happen to be tolerated can\nBe limited even whether it's ... ... smoking sexual dysfunction loss of vision for the future of the science fair either in your business your personal life I have succeeded were others failed\nOr so you know this is all\nPlaying out and bandwagon they could go from being on one side of the table having Jacob ... interests at heart to potentially switching over and having the Mets interests at heart and he would certainly have a lot of information\nThat you would think teams wouldn't necessarily be privy to friday to have a much more personal relationship with Jacob ...\nUh you know might have more knowledge of a physical issues or whatever ah you know personality insights that the team wouldn't have and you would tell a your lawyer things that you wouldn't necessarily tell the police officer right or\nOr you're negotiating you have your agent he has your society's got your back you have a personal relationship with that person you know that's different than your boss who you might be negotiating against to some degree\nUh as far as a contract goes so it it it is very interesting and I understand where Scott Boris is coming from but for us it's smart guy he's opportunistic and it brought a bandwagon stays in the agent game uh this is something that no doubt Boris would use with potential clients saying hey does he really\nHave your interests at heart does he want to be up front office guy what's going on\nSo you know the the it's all part of the the game I suppose but interesting that ah Brodie bandwagon and felt the need to put out a statement I think is an interesting candidate I'm curious\nYou know with the knowledge they has not just of decorum but he has plenty of ... of clients who are members of the New York Mets is that something that uh\nWould benefit the Mets and that way uh what are his views on on team building I mean he would be a unique he's an outside the box candidate really is what it comes down to\nUh and uh we'll see the Mets want to go in that direction or Doug Melvin ... that gives you a more traditional general manager candidate\nAnd and sit there and that might put them at the post also tweeted today I said he's talked with several people connected to the organization who believe that Fred will upon will go the conservative route and pick Melvin because the Mets last quote unquote outside the box pack Mickey Calloway as backfired somewhat\nA and that's a certainly interesting insight you know has a Fred soured on Calloway as a manager to some degree ... kind of floating in the Braves at the moment even though ... said they'd like to have him back\nThey will leave it up to the next general manager\nBut to me he brought a bandwagon player age it becoming a GM that certainly outside the box\nA butt hind bloom considering all the experience that he has had in the Tampa Bay rays organization they are one of the smartest teams in all of baseball they obviously manage with a low payroll they've been willing to experiment over the years he's been there long enough that you know and Joe Matt and\nStarted bringing the shift into normal baseball strategy what it wasn't at the time and it's been a big success strategically a\nYou know that's the kind of thing that you know I don't know if I'm bloom is directly involved in but this is what the rays are willing to do this past year they had a lot of success with the bullpen and and one of the better starting or pitching staff and all baseball once they made that switch and about may\n... they've been willing to experiment and some of the the brighter minds of the game of mother Andrew Freedman now or the general manager with the Los Angeles Dodgers of course going to be in the world series this week\nOr so blown to me and he's not a nontraditional candidate and he's been around the game yeah he's a younger guy and he's going to be more analytical oriented but that is what the typical GM looks like and the background of the typical general manager and the game right now\nAre said to me Melvin and bloom or the really those are the two that\nI'm Melvin being the traditional choice eh but Blum being the new age choice and really the modern choice of what the smartest teams in baseball are doing now a it typically you know looks like the someone with a background of a hind bloom and then bandwagon and\nWho knows I mean that's just kind of a wild card to me ah because\nWe don't know a whole lot about what he thinks about building a team what he would focus on a he would have a much different perspective\nAnd he probably also have a lot of information for some key decisions that the Mets have coming up and you wonder how much is this a van right and I'm sure as genuine interest to being the Mets general manager but\nI Wonder how much you show your cards where you do have a couple of clients quite a few clients within the Mets and you know you're going to be negotiating with the mad severe continuing to\nRepresent these players are you able to you know suss out some information as to you know that the team likes take of the grumbled what their plans might be for him and vice versa a little bit of the Mets\nOr get a sense for you know what bandwagon and might do if he were ... general manager when a situation like ... where there's all kinds of Jacob ... you're not allowed to talk about that kind of thing I don't know it's just fascinating to me uh to have someone with that background\nWith key players on the team and especially\nThe probable else Cy Young award winner who you're going to have to sit down and talk a contract with at some point this off season because if you don't make that happen this off season chances are\nThe ground is going to say my two years I become a free agent and I'll take all the money that I can then uh when I'm thirty two years old but he is in the past been open\nTo having that discussion about an extension it's not something that um you know the bats have had long talks with him about apparently\nUh in the recent past so old that playing out as far as the Mets go and trying to determine who the next GM of this franchise will be and it's it's a huge higher than there are very few people in an organization that are more important than the general manager these days you are making\nThe decisions from the draft the player development or even some of the endgame decision making at the very least having a plan along with the manager is not just you give the manager of the team and let them go\nAh so you are involved in just about everything in an organization and you know some of these guys had become rock stars like Theo in Boston and of course in Chicago now to\nUm you know these are the guys that\nAre just pivotal free organization and of course you know with the Mets or how you handle ownership and and the other pieces that are there in the front office if you're going to keep them around what you do it Mickey Calloway and they're huge decisions to make right off the bat before\nEven think about getting into that first big trade or the first big signing come free agency but there's opportunity with the Mets too and it's a team that has talent that has a tremendous rotation\nThat has\nA now a better farm system then in the last couple of years so are there are some things building for the Mets even after back to back Seventy something when seasons and now\nUh you know they need that next person who's going to put it all together and then figure out how did he get the Mets to be a championship contenders gear in and year round\nUh eight hundred three two one zero seven ten again eight hundred
