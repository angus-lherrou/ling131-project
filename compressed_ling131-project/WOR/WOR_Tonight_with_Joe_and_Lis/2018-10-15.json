head coach Todd Bowles acknowledged it is not the same old jets kind of outcome\nGame wasn't perfect by no means but you know the growth of the same problem with the last this one year ago a couple of weeks ago so when ugly for us as a pretty good thing and so the majority was just got to work and\nMay go out they had the big start to pitch sex like the stadium on fire but then you look up not long later and the jets are down to the Indianapolis Colts and the second quarter\nAnd it got to try to rally back and they do and\nMaybe the biggest change\nI've seen in the jets of late and it was evident at the end of the first half yesterday as well as in a team that was contrite to take a lead into the locker room and not try to take some chances to add some points I might have in their faith and their rookie quarterback\nTo lead them down the field at the end of the first step\nDidn't result in a touchdown if you watch that Indian out or if you watch that Kansas City New England game last Sunday Night Football you could see that there's a gap between what the jets could do\nAnd the cheap and the patriots with more homes in Brady but baby steps for this jets team and to walk down the field at the end of the first half and put up some points in that spot\nAdd a little insurance going into halftime a to score lead that was huge on which Sam Darnell depletes that passed the clock is ticking down and he spikes it with three seconds on the clock\nStadium cheese [laughter]\nThis week because that just hasn't happened around here in years and that was a bit of\n... or the jets as silly as that sounds a field goal at the end of the half but the fact that\nTheir quarterback is trusted enough to be allowed to go out there and make some throws and its talented enough to hit some receivers and the Colts it's not exactly a fearsome defense there\nBut the jets took advantage of some things are defensively for the jets they gave up a ton of your niche and this is something you see all across the league it just seems ... is at such a serious advantage over the defenses are in the league and again the evidence in that game last night\nBut the jets the bench was able to force and turnover something that they have done a great job of in recent seasons but four turnovers against Andrew Luck and the colds that was huge\nThey directly result in in points they helped out their off fans would feel position\nOr the ... and some estates a couple of turnovers and the second quarter where the Colts were able to build that back into a lead\nAnd while yeah the defense gave up some field goals are huge goal line stop the cult at first and goal ... yard line had to settle for a field goal then another turnover Quincy a new law fumbling the ball on a tunnel screen and again\nThe jets defense held them to a field goal and kept the team in the game instead of going down multiple scores and the jets do the ability to put up some points and how about the fact that they actually went back to back games\nSo often in the past with the jets they win a game they look great like they did against Denver last week\nAnd then they lay the eggs and it's not the same\nEffort level and it's not a it's an inability to handle prosperity well may be a sign of some maturing\nFrom this jets team because they were able to handle some prosperity they were able to follow up a nice went against Denver and take it to Indianapolis at home\nAnd now the biggest test of this three game home stand is unique is that is coming up this Sunday when her cousins who used the jets for contract leverage basically didn't want\nTo join gang green wanted himself in Minnesota the hallway a comes to town this Sunday against Sam Donald mood you rather have Pham Donald or her cousin's going forward I Know my answer is it's Sam Donald all the way\nConsidering how young this guy is to be coming in starting from day one married through the Sixers first NFL attempt was a ... against the Detroit Lions breezy able to settle in and win that game didn't have to be spectacular\nAnd guys open handling the patch\nRush well and he's the guy that can create extra time can escaping can throw on the run and that's pivotal in today's NFL and to compare it to Eli Manning who can't do those things and I know you can look at the ... the blind for the giants and this\nAnd that but that's a huge difference do you have to be able to do that the best quarterback in the league they create time\nEven Tom Brady while he runs for a touchdown yesterday ... yards out that's not exactly would you expect to see from Brady we haven't hey can create time\nWhen he needs and\nPatrick ... homes a whole other level he's getting bullets yesterday by the New England patriots and he's escaping spinning away from one guy pushing way another rolling out throwing on the run those are things you have to be able to do to be an elite quarterback it is not simply a pocket passers game\nThe pass rush gets in there relatively quickly these days a lot of real good pass Russia's in the league\nBoth the jets the giants could use one of those but they are around and that's one of the things I like about ... I liked about him in college he can move around enough\nAnd if you could create that extra time and throw on the run and be able to ... a bit\nIt's a big advantage for you and and it is something that you see glimpses of not all the way like the game we saw last night which is unbelievable and how great was that\nPatriots cheap ... Sunday night NFL football game and he's getting an absolute shoot out back and forth whatever at the ball last who's going when it turned out to be the New England patriots as it so often seems to go\nAnd Brady walks down the field the big prone to Rob Gronkowski they kick the field goal and the patriots have themselves a hard fought when you saw a lot of respect on both sides based on what was said from the patriots about the cheese when the chiefs about the patriots and those are the teams that\nAs of now\nSix weeks into the season you'd anticipate seeing\nIn that championship game and there's a huge gap between the jets and those teams\nBut the jets there in that middle class area where at least the games are meaningful and as a jets fan next week you go back to ... stadium see them take on the Vikings and that will be a meaningful football game where you can drink a little\nBit maybe after a couple of pops in the parking lot at the tailgate about the jets getting to that level of\nGetting to the point of being a true contender and to me it's important for them to show over the course of this year that they're moving towards that\nDirection I think you feel good about the quarterback the head coach\nYour question do you not positive that he's the guy Todd Bowles\nBut the fact that they did bounce back from last week when a fairly ugly football game against the Indianapolis Colts yesterday and that they were finally able to have some success and back it up that next week\nDoing some good things because the jets are going to become a desirable job\nAnd now you have a franchise quarterback in place the jets would be one of the top jobs if they decided to change coaches in the offseason couple of years now whenever it might be\nAnd what that it changes the I think how you set your own head coach because you can go out there and get some guys that have had some success before then have developed quarterbacks and Todd Bowles a he has a resume is terrific defensive coordinator\nBut he has had a ton of success with the jets really hasn't been a position or with the teams that he has been given to this point\nBut I think that's what makes it tricky to assess Todd Bowles is that now you're not looking at him versus whatever guy another\nFirst year coach that you can hire now you'd be in a different situation as far as what kind of code you bring in so the fact that the jets comeback play the way that they have these last couple of weeks rack up some victories and you can see now that they are on the rise\nThat's a very good sign for Todd Bowles the jets franchises a whole and and some things to be genuinely excited about will chat with ... men or the New York daily news or about Sam Darnell development a key injury for the jets based on Sunday and and now the jets can move on from there\nAnd you know what has had the steam emotionally keyed up the last couple of weeks so I'm ... Mann of the New York daily news when we come back to sports so we'll be McCarthy on the voice of New York ... W O R U town\nR thoughts down with regard [laughter] jets\n... victories in a row now three and three overall this season\nOppressive boy yesterday against the Indianapolis Colts football game but the came out on top of we are joined right now by ...\nOr the New York daily news hour it's ... feet area I'm good I'm you know one thing that I loved in yesterday's game was the aggressiveness at the end of the first half and I know it only resulted in a field goal but the kind of thing that\nWe haven't seen a ton of from the jets in recent years that that is so important to trust your quarterback to make the right decisions make some place down the field\nAnd a field goal before they have to take a to score lead\nA how significant do you think that was the moment in this game for the jets\nAre very important I think you hit on the keyword trust trust not only in the quarterback trust in the office and I think that Todd Bowles at a place right now where\nHe believes that Jeremy ... is going to make the proper decisions in terms of play calling and that same Donald even though he's only six\nGames into that a film career is going to make the proper decisions on the field so I I agree with you you know if what fifty seconds somewhere around there at the end of the half it could have been easy to to maybe run the ball out are just going to have time with the lead but the fact that they maintain that attacking mindset I think it was an important\nPiece of that game obviously there are so many different things that happened that ultimately determined to\nThe final score but uh I like the attitude and I like the attitude from the head coach down to the oh the down to the quarterback and I think that's the type of play that you really have to have moving forward especially if you want to give trust to your young quarterback and tell them that you know you believe in him and you believe that he can succeed in situations like\nThat that's how you develop a guy can't be red light yellow light you ain't got given the green light a little bit the jets doing that with a with Sam Donald would you say there are any limitations at all the jets have in place considering\nThis is the youngest quarterback distorts the merger and he is only six games into his career or is he fully in the deep end of the pool now\n[laughter] I thought frankly even in the pool and when the season started it may may maybe that's a bit of an overstatement but I think once they get past that three games stretch and eleven days once they got onto a regular routine here the last several weeks playing we'll once a week or you know playing one Seventy six days\nI think once they got it out of that really weird a vortex\nOf of you know three ... eleven days I think at that point you know they feel comfortable and handing over the reins for lack of better phrase Sam Donald they know he's going to make mistakes made mistakes yesterday that was a terrific game but he didn't make one mistake or on the interception a that was a play that he\nThat wasn't really as fault if you look closely at that play the snap with low so that kind of put things off of written to begin with and then he had a pass Russia guy really flying in his face a actually a\nIt is although I Believe all on a patch pressures helmets so that kind of three things off as well but uh yeah I I just think that a man this is going to be what the season it it's you know it's a three and three stars there were three and three last year I don't know if they're going to run the table I Would imagine that he wouldn't run the table uh\nI just think that it's going to be a seesaw ... the ups and downs but there clearly thing really well right now\nAnd ... it's exciting to see because only six ... in San Antonio has done so many great things that fans probably\nAnd even realize this first month and a half in his career movie one of those things [laughter]\nWell if you look at a play yes yesterday it's easy to look at a touchdown and say that's what everyone gravitates towards and and I thought the touchdown pass the trail prior to seven you order was great in terms of just a\nTrusting the receiver a wedding it fly before prior actually turned around and feeding it in to a tight space there were three guys around prior on that route\nAnd the ... just had a lot of confidence not only themselves but in his receiver to kind of fit that in there but there was another play that isn't going to get that much attention a\nWithout markets may struggle at that fish in the middle and it had some hiccups and if you looked closely at those games there were times where he was out of ... and those are you know\nA part in the game where you would think that markets may not be at a position or could make a play so I think that the markets may last frankly you know a little bit more impactful than equipped you know\nA couple of key once they're ah either way with may as well as ... noon why's he reported today and then uh some good news as far as the defensive coordinator Casey Rogers is concerned\n[noise] yeah he's going to be back in the building a fulltime ... today they're going to eat and back and we'll find out what his role on game day will be I I tend to believe that if he is going to be involved in play calling it'll probably be a little bit more\nTodd Bowles that Casey Rogers we'll find out it early in the week and the jets are I think he'll feel comfortable with both being a heavily involved in the play calling and again you don't want to put too much on the Rogers played I just think it's important\nFor morale standpoint anybody even knows Casey Rogers had been around the Rogers knows any I think it is a tricky guy he's a great influence on these players\nAnd to have is scared like he did a week and a half ago and you know it's clear that hurdle and to be back with the team it is important but in terms of logistics and how he's going to actually work with Todd Bowles on game day a week this specifically that remains to be\nYou know Mila they'll figure that out but certainly a positive news when it seemed as if it could be something very serious way they were talking about it and um you know good that he he was back in the building yesterday to write\n[noise] he lost the casual observer up in the coach's box I I think that was more\nAbout Casey Rogers gotta itching to get in and they were waiting for test results back today there was nothing that he could have done yesterday though he held up to it and I think that's why those said hey you know you just hang out with with the guys that don't stretch yourself and don't worry about any kind of a you know\nGain gain planning or play calling I'm sure he offered it invites him during the course of the game but it's getting him back you know like I think it means a lot of players you talk to any player privately will tell you what a case Rogers the means to them and ... if you've been around\nIf you're reporting that are out Casey rush for a few years you know that he's a stand up guy\nI'm Annie Schmidt of the New York daily news ... thank you thank you too and then uh you know again uh you know some fun breakdown of some of the tape and um some of the plays that same daughter was able to make you can check it out or ...\nOn Twitter a and a ... a was a was all of a sudden the injury situation they break it down it's going on with the ... ... as well as markets may which I could be\nA considerable laws for defense that we give it up a lot of yards or even if\nThey did rack up some turnovers yesterday I had some key times we'll wrap up somewhat ... to talk about coming up eight hundred three two one zero seven tend the number\nAnd will transition start doing more baseball coming up at seven oh five is the Mets are continue their search for general manager\nOr Tim Healy of Newsday will give us the latest on that and what has been a bit of a brain drain in Queens over the last few years and ... and it's a big story about that this weekend in Newsday which will ask them about as well to sports zone where people cards on the voice of New York's ... W O R\nYour ... W O R sports\nNot going to ... men and the New York daily news we learn them Donald favorite mommy Josh Shenk redemption even though he was\nBorn three years after the movie came out that's a good movie to have is your favorite and there's that's an automatic solid move nobody will argue with you if you say your favorite\nMovie is Shawshank Redemption\nNod knowingly ... Morgan Freeman Tim Robbins good movie good dude movie\nLike that is good and what would be like what would be a movie that maybe a player would say you're ... is his favorite movie where you'd go oh that might be trouble\nTerrible comedy or something like I don't know which way then we'll go [laughter]\nJak ... what was the idea that would be concerning that would be a little more concerning uh eight hundred three two one zero seven it didn't I never actually saw Jack and Jill did you watch a producer mark\nYeah it is one of the worst movies ever know yeah and then\nThe rumors are true as far as that goes so that might be a good one you start questioning it to a little bit but Josh ... as a solid solid\nSelection of her favorite movie um but for the the jets overall again you know it it's not that they're just going to roll off budget victories and they got it all figured out now you know this is going to be a process\nAnd this was a season where you came in and said hey as long as Sam Donald shows you could be a brand giants quarterback that's a good year and six weeks in that part of the season I think it's a success\nNo guarantee than dogs can be the best quarterback in the league but he certainly has everything it takes to be a franchise quarterback and for the jets just something that they haven't had\nForever for ... years since Joe name it was that guy um so the fact that through six weeks you see that\nPart of the success that's\nJust a huge plus a the jets here and why there should be genuine excitement about the jets for the first time and it feels like a very long time well the Mets be able to share in some of that excitement they've got plenty of pieces they need a GM to see the whole puzzle and\nHow you get them where they need to go to in helium news they'll give us the latest on the general manager hunt for the New York Mets and much more coming up right now and is up there\nThese days and the Mets continued to hunt for that general manager a what I'm you know what what ... do you have as of where they are right now in this process\nWhile they're still doing first round interviews of course the ... will on and John ... sort of a orchestrating or\nGoing through that process um ... there are a couple of ... or early this week how many there have been told all I'm not sure but the uh underlying sense is that the ... I don't really know what they want you know they've hired or they've interviewed\nA range of candidates everybody from Gary ... who is the the cardinals\nThe director player development to\nUm you know ah\nI'm hind bloom the system GM in Tampa Bay who's in his mid thirties and as one of those I think as the San Francisco giants boss but a next Gen GM ... an elliptical inclined very smart fast rising\nAlong those lines but uh overall the Mets have been turned down by quite a few people ... and said well being\nUm it's not seen as a particularly desirable job right now which really is a shame considering if the biggest market around and really a a pretty decent court to work with right now in terms of on the field personnel\nDoes it go beyond ownership and that would seem to be the number one thing that that these are executives who are worried about who exactly is going to be their bus what's going on above you how involved would\nThey be a is there anything beyond that that would make the ... of the ... something that some of these uh potential candidates aren't even going into interview for\nI'd I I\n... I'm Sorry can you say that again ... ... is there anything beyond say ownership and and those concerns\nThat make the Mets are less than ideal\nAh you know jobs that that some of these potential candidates are denying given the opportunity to interview\nNot to my knowledge because if you look at all the other variable ... it it should be you know on paper in theory a pretty good job or an attractive jobs for people um but when you for example have to\nYou know Jeff will find that at the end of the season that it'll be up to the new GM to decide the fate of John ... co owner of an eye or give you a charity Mickey Callaway so that's three top executives and the manager\nAnd shirts Jeff will punch said that the new GM's going to have the final day there but you will find also said that his strong preference than ownership Strunk preference is for all of those guys to stay ... do a lot of times when you see new ...\nThe new GM hired you know there's a lot of overhauling that goes on we're seeing that in Miami right now we're Derek Jeter just Marlin are going through ... and number two of that process some of the old regime being phased out\nIf what this mess job right now the perception is that you're going to have to have to keep the manager and probably you know a couple of your top executives\nAnd that's you know not exactly what a prospective GM wants to hear\nYeah it is a complicated situation as of now and it certainly seems to be affecting the Mets in their search here uh to see who will be the next GM of this a team of which we tax a chat right now with Tim Hayley um Newsday\nOr as poor as baseball tonight you're out in LA uh four and I'll see as game three of the series tied up at one coming in you know you were there in Milwaukee this week I Know one of the guys have been talking about a lot as a potential target for the Mets this off season is the U.S money ground now\nCan you add to what exactly did we see in game one where you said a miserable and a couple of past balls even pinch it's a game to hand it to a double play but he's back in the starting lineup today but is that something that Mets fan should be making note of here\nI I I think you do make note of it 'cause it was a really\nUgly out and was too fast balls and sue errors all in the first three innings of that game one uh but overall you know it's it's not like ... has a reputation as being\nYou know a real bad bender or anything along those lines is actually pretty good catcher um and I mean you kind of have to be you're gonna be the starting catch the Dodgers during the run of ... that they've had the past few years but um\nAnd they can't wait to take out their starting pitcher to get into the bullpen and all these teams had so many big arms that are throwing Ninety five plus and\nUh it has worked out for the St Louis the point where here they are and the final four in the L. C. S. and all of these teams even up at one or as they approach a World Series but it is a trend that has\nMoved along in a\nI mean steeply and to the exact opposite of what the Mets strategy might be these days with their starting pitching they've racked up but I just wonder overall is starting pitching means less in the game than it ever has before and and I think the answer is yes unless you have the absolute great\nKind of starting pitcher or that not only goes eight innings but he's going to be a strong in the seventh and eighth inning as anybody else in the game and you don't have that\nThe value just isn't to say so I I think that the top and guys like a Jacob ... it's still very much there that you start slip in any degree in the six seven eight then if you're getting yanked and there's going to be a reliever that's\nIn a a better position to get those out for so many of these playoff bound teams so\nAnd that's just like in a a really interesting spot where they can be\nThe buck or to the analytics trend in the bullpen and trend and er hey it still works you can have these guys throw a hundred and twenty pitches and go seven innings and see if you have enough talent you can shove it with your starters it and make it work\nThat's not what you see a whole lot of uh in the postseason and go back it was three years ago today meant the Mets\nBeat the Dodgers in that game five the division series and that game more than any other and the Mets run in twenty Fifteen sticks with me\n\nIs probably the Mets won the last time they had to win that big a deciding game post season has a huge win for this franchise\nAnd they did it\nIn ... in today's game it to grow might have been pulled in the first inning\nAs a young guy unproven it Terry ... stuck with them and even down in some trouble and the second ... fights out of it gets through six innings and then the Mets were able to do the cutesy thing right bringing the starting pitcher do a sinner guard editor pen for that ...\nHe was nasty probably could have gone another inning\nBut Terry college went to his closer jurors familiar to get sick south's retired chase laying that eighth inning and the Mets were able to get through that game dinner Murphy the big home run to the stone based on the Milwaukee where the Dodgers when the shift as well\nAnd you know quite a few memorable moments when three to over the ... three years ago\nToday and a um\n[noise] I just look at that game is a a giant norm is where it was a well managed by Terry Collins\nAnd one of the bigger wins in recent memory for the New York Matt ... I don't have many that I put on top of the game six of the ... in two thousand six so it's easy to forget about that knowing what happened the next night at Shea Stadium um\nThe win against the Phillies and twenty six day where they came from ... big homerun\nHave to ... in the ninth inning and that helped send the Mets on their way to a wild card but obviously not the same steaks at the site and gave him a playoff series that was one of the extent of gives you in three years ago tonight and it's funny\nYou say three years ago and it feels like ten [laughter]\nSince the Mets had that run to the world series with the way that the last two seasons have played out a but it's not that long ago and it is one\nOf those reasons why is the Mets look for this next general manager\nYou sit there and said there are pieces of place they have a rotation that All right maybe starting pitching isn't the way the teams build their team at first from any longer\nBut there's a lot of talent there and maybe you can bucked the trend a little bit\nYou have some young position players both in the farm system at the major league level that you can have some hope for brand name all coming up a big year Jeff McNeil what he showed at second base Michael can for doubt bouncing back in a big way coming off the shoulder injury over the course of the second half of the season\n\nThe Mets should be a desirable place to be there should be general managers across the gay that think hey this is a step up to go to New York to go to a team that maybe I grew up rooting for or that I interned at when I was younger and I think that's what jet will upon expected based out what he said\nAt that press conference before the Mets won a hundred and sixty second game this year that they were hoping that somebody would say hey bumping title to be in a big market and the Mets would be an attractive position but unfortunately that's not the way that it's playing out\nThe way that it has played out over the last few weeks and considering that they're still in the process of the first round of interviews this week maybe there are some more names that pop", "show_name": "WOR Tonight with Joe and Lis", "year": "2018", "city": "New York", "day": "15"}
