I feel on Twitter side talking about how loud Yankee Stadium is in and I'm heading there after the gay afterwards on the show heading up there to catch the end of that game or they were talking about Fenway on friday night and\nSaturday was not as loud they expected and I completely agree there was a ... was not as loud as I Would expect a Yankee red socks series to be I Would that be\nI don't know if it's the nervous energy I don't know if it's just the fact that you know most Red Sox fans even even our age or younger than us a think still have that feeling of you know and somehow we gonna mess us up and the boat and the fact the bullpen\nIs a mess you literally have to you know trust anything until ... comes in ... locked down but every out before that you're playing for survival essentially it it's a mess\nHow bad as the bullpen and they announced that a David prices available pitch today at the does that [laughter]\nI just saw when David prize was announced cause they ran out and solve the teams when they play that first playoff game in a new park when David prize was announced he rousing obey in front of Yankees fan now that I think I got\nI got a point gets on the far it's like it's like in the old days before painting finally turn around when Peyton Manning would come in to Fox Pearl and get a standing ovation they loved them 'cause that was made them I mean that's the way it was well\nI got a football story I got a a basketball story I got an alternative story and I got one that's a dear to my heart at the end so uh which one do you like to start off with the first one okay we'll start off with a a with our football story a he had season tickets this year right\nOr did you save up did you save up like put the money away no oh All right well uh Utah I paid for them yet so\nUtah looking to go a University of Utah and that's not the Boise State so the other one to Utah Utah ... I Believe is what they are saved up all their money putting them below thousand sixty dollars and uh they got ready for their season tickets to a Utah one problem they lost the envelope\nAnd they just knew nobody is still on it but they found out a they discovered that there are two year old son Leo and use the envelope and its contents to try out the brand new shredder\nOoh so they trash [laughter] yes so you know\nAnd uh well guess what a ... one thousand sixty dollars were shredded through and ah\nWhat kids got tape that together no but the good thing is uh this is good he called the U.S department of treasury or it won't be ready in time for football tickets but he said what it is that block send it to us registered or in in one or two years you'll get your money back oh my God [laughter]\nGovernment baby years I guess I'm kind of surprised they would refunded anyway right but you're good at doing I think so I Do\nThis and it's true if you have fifty one percent of any bill you mail it to the department treasury with a return address\nThey're going to be back in the new one that's all you have to do fifty one percent and that's the way it is a little basketball story here but it also has a little football thing to it or are we going to tell you this year for jets a jets a patriots you're going to make sure you sure you gonna buy me\nIt's absolutely I Am and I just honestly want it they think you sound like I watch a show my family and your fellow nightly I listen to your show on the radio daily and I my family twenty six year old woman I Am just cost and\nThe way that the Democrats handled that Brett Kavanaugh situation at that time you get the right just to get the right thing\nWell I think we are but I agree I Will tell you that this was a big fight it was say it's sad that it came down to the wire and one vote the way it did it's sad that this man's family had been through everything it's sad that allegations are\nAnd accusations are accepted as truth for people and we live in a very dangerous time where you could just make any allegation against anybody and people run with it and they think you're ...

I. B. L. E.\nThe Yankees last night they messed up Aaron Boone mess that will be heard about it all day\nAnd all of last night though apparently he was ah you know listening to music on the way home and and staying away from the sports talk which is probably the best way to handle it buddy he knew it was bad because it's getting a bunch of tax saying hang in there ah it's where he told reporters prior to tonight's game\nAnd that's what it's going to be and that's going to be on the line tonight for Aaron Boone and\nThese Yankees you lose a playoff series the managers are getting it right over the coals one way or the other Aaron Bhutto survive it you'll be fine\nI mean there's a good job overall the season he got them through that al wild card game there is shame and the ... losing to the red Sox but losing to a one hundred and\nEight when team\nIt's not the absolute end of the world and while boom made the wrong moves last night it's up to even say it costs in the game when the Yankees manage just one run and Nathan evolved the was just shutting them down in a big way last night\nOr so today yeah\nBoon will have a little bit on the line cc ... maybe the last\nBig contribution he can make to the New York Yankees it apparently wants to be back next year or the Yankees they have to get better as far as pitching goes though and noticed that there is no longer a in a place in the organization that he used to be\nBut he is still plenty good enough given you a decent outing and again I I don't think he should be asked to do much denies each call\nTell them hey cc of old what ... give it all you got to\nGet us through three innings max\nAnd and that will be a win and then what makes this getting so tough to predict is starting pitcher is not going deep who ultimately is going to factor in here are the Yankees can be able to bridge the gap with all their ...\nYou know a lot of those guys are going to be in will they need to use it mostly hero to knock it out of the pen apparently he's available\nOn the red Sox side\nThey don't have anyone that you really comfortable with David Price is available out of the pen and I'll tell you what if they bring in price that would be the moment\nTonight at Yankee Stadium\nThat would be the moment that would stick with you that would be like when the Yankees Red Sox bite in two thousand four in the ... see as the red Sox had a big lead in game seven\nRemember they brought Pedro Martinez back in out of the pen and that lit up the stadium the who is your daddy chance ringing through the Bronx\nAnd it was like why would you allow the stadium to wake up they were all dead ... the stadium was half asleep like they Yankee fan they caught on the broadcast last night and you're bringing Pedro in light it all up and that's what it could be like tonight if the red Sox do bring in David Price at some point\nDavid Price which cheered when he was introduced yesterday\nIn the Bronx so I think tonight is incredibly difficult to see exactly how this game's going to go and if you like to gamble or play you know bad who's gonna win ... I I don't know how you can make an educated guess here because\nThe pictures that decide this game you have no idea who they are going to be which means you're going to pinch hitters you're going to have a big time managerial chess match between two rookie managers in Alex Cora an Aaron Boone and two guys that haven't been in this situation before\nBut this is what a an an LDS or a division series game for is it it's the chaos game\nTonight will be chaos and it will be desperate chaos for the New York Yankees as they try to keep their postseason hopes alive after a devastating loss last night sixteen the one you know sometimes you take a blowout loss it doesn't stick with the as much but in the postseason it doesn't matter\nThey all stick with you there all punches through the got last night as well I'd say beret thing when you're finishing a postseason game with the position player on the mound\nOh I Know that became a trend over the course of the season I understand the games already over and you're saving a bullpen arm\nBut the fact that it reaches the point where you're throwing Austin role mine on the mound absolutely embarrassing\nAnd the Yankees got crushed last night they gave up the first cycle and postseason history to brought Cole who by the way is not in the starting line up today and we'll discuss that with Sean macadam of the Boston sports journal coming up at six thirty five\nUm any Yankees making some interesting decisions today as far as their line up goes you find out what a team values and its players when they're back is up against the wall\nYou're you're used to having a set time where you're going to be ready you have a whole routine that builds up to that if you're starting pitcher\nA every single time out unless you don't know what time the game starts getting to that part of it with Louis cemetery no but you have a whole routine you know at ... time before first patch on going to do this I'm going to do that I'm going to go to the bullpen I'm going to start my where my pictures and\nYou had that all set when you got out of the bullpen and just starting pitcher in the postseason as we've seen so many guys do whether it be cutting ... game seven the world series last year ... or in last year's postseason and\nObviously go back further in plenty of examples of this has always happens\nBut you don't want to be coming in the middle of an ending with men on base that is a totally foreign situation you're already throwing some things off but now you're going to enter the game\nIn a situation all ready and for boon to do to Lance Lynn with the bases loaded last night I tell yeah you have to go to someone who's accustomed to being and those kinds of situations and\nIt's always going to be tough to get out of it without getting any runs a we know that the deck is stacked against it when you come in but at least have a pitcher who's accustomed to being in that kind of situation ad\nAt the very least is accustomed to the rhythms of entering in the middle of an ending where there's already a situation and it's not a cleaning it's not nobody nobody out and as much as ... could talk about hey I treat every situation like nobody on nobody out\nYou have to\nAdjust with the situation to know uh what kind of position that you are in so to me you know that was a big mistake and that's something that you know could filter into today because again it's a bad they're poor cello I wouldn't expect out of these guys to be long for this game and how quickly\nWill boon Cora go to the ... and and what situations and they going home last night even though it was early Aaron Boone should have gone to Chad green and he was going to wait that long the poll separate them which was one of the mistakes there as well\nAs for ... you know supposedly not knowing this dark time accurately enough and you'll run darling on the TBS broadcasts noticed that separate and got to the bullpen late\nA ... and said as much about it when ... was leaving the mound darling made a comment that\nMade it seem as if that was the reason that Severino struggled and could be a lot of reasons why separate struggled a and then several Reno was asked about darling comments after the game\n\nWith Hugo Chavez who is a ... well ... ... or ... or ... or she was saying there it is\n\nOr was it was you know it is you\nKnow separate and said no confusion and you know how would run darling no I I don't know him and darling as we know is the\nMets television broadcasters and see a whole lot of Lewis ... darling knows when typically a pitcher's going to be in the pan and start going and getting ready for the game in that way\nI doubt that ... process would drastically differ from other pictures around the league and it had never been talked about before so\nAh you know and then the other answers from Austin wrote minor Gary ... to some degree Aaron Boone we're all kind of a base of about a\nSeparate owes routine\nAnd whether or not it was a affected uh with what they said post games it's like something happened there now is that the reason that separate on struggled and look\nHe's been lousy the second half of the season I he had a five and a happy alright since the all star break gay pitch pretty well in the wild card game against the Oakland Athletics in pitch deeply ... very well for what\nHe was asked um but yeah this is the kind of picture they spend the whole second half and they might be pitching hurt remember Pedro Martinez said as much on TBS broadcast in San Marino denied that but\nIt's got to come from somewhere out the pages just making that up and maybe separate out the ... to look at like is making an excuse or something but it would make sense they dealing with something physical to have the kind of second half that he had because separate it was fantastic the first half of this year\nOr so you had you know whole kind of mess there but ... could you imagine if not knowing the start of the game adversely affected your starting pitcher and and that's something that that hurt you or you know the Yankees\nDeny it but I guarantee you one thing these these\nBad they will know eight oh seven first pitch tonight or as he gets ready for this gay for game for and I think it'll be a chaotic game I really do you're going to have a lot of maneuvering a lot of both an action and I'll go for the red Sox too and I'm very curious to see how the red Sox decide to\nGet to the finish line with their pitching staff and all the questions they have in that bridge\nAlso Brock whole pitch for the cycle yesterday's not in the lineup today the thinking behind that Sean macdonald Boston sports journal I Will give us the red Sox perspective when we come back as sports on repeat McCarthy ... voice in New York seven ten W O R [laughter]\nR soy down with the McCarthy [noise]\nI'll get back to the sports donut game for ... Yankees can be the finale of the theories that the red Sox knock on\nThe Yangtze we bring on right now is Sean macadam at the Boston sports journal and a show it's great talking to you again how you doing\n[laughter] ... effects rather may not appreciate is coming on as far as the red Sox go to nights or what does stand\nOut and maybe it shouldn't anymore because we know so many managers they don't believe in the hot hand but last night brought cult hit the first ever cycle in the post season and yet not the starting lineup tonight and I imagine Alex Cora felt it wasn't that difficult that decision\nUh we uh we spoke to him or just prior to uh uh availability and the press conference rum and we ask that you know somebody joked really so so uh cycles not enough to get you on the line up in a row and Cora kind of trickled softly softly [laughter]\nUm but it really is all about the match up with about the on the mound and how he has done\nA against last editors they wanna stocked up on Monday right editors as they can roll out there and then in ... even though he is not a\nOut a terrific last couple amongst all sensibly it certainly is a trend in field there is a lot of postseason games start truck to study or you know the cost them to the study than an escort pointed out if the Yankees go to a lot of their middle or these guys in the stricter shut 'em down a\nWealthier right hander the presents a pinch hitting offered the role to\nYeah I got to think I think tonight's game going to be chaos game four of these division series where you know one team is uh has its season on the line and your deeper into the rotations where's the guys that you don't\nDepend whether depend on and and throw early on in a in a series a these are the games that you're getting like three ... starter and then it can be mix and match in the bullpen and changes to the line up it is that the way you see this game plan out\nIf it is all hands on deck a certainly the the Yankees are playing with a greater sense of urgency because they can't afford to lose and the red Sox don't want to lose and goes out in the Yankees crack out them even if it will be at home and even if it was being Christ\nDale is starting pitcher they have to feel pretty good about both although towel and the uh the match up for that one but you know whenever you've got a team whenever you've got your split on a team's throat you don't want to let them up\nAnd the red Sox are are certainly in that camp here where they would like to finish up tonight and um you know toward that end we asked about sales availability out of the bullpen\nFor tonight and is it possible that you could get an ending or even a hitter or two out of that and\nA coral laughed and he set the sale has been campaigning for exactly that a throughout the day so he made himself a sailboat and told him soldiers manager that he would be happy to help out and release a stink sense but that would be kind of a\nUm you know last ah a last option for the red Sox they don't want to use him particularly given the shoulder issues yeah out over the last couple of months but you know it's a matter of ah\nYou know you've got Gardner another left the coming up and I run on base in the eighth inning read your column and for you know\nA half dozen such as to try to get you out of a jam said he put that at any of the term ... minimal buddy what role out a hundred percent which is kind of gets back to your point where you know you do on either side you do you have to do tonight to get out of here with it when\nIt gets these different things and they scanned in and out and expect to see the bad there won't be in this game on even if he does well but the red Sox are a little more interesting because as we've all talked about money there isn't a natural bridge to crank kimbrell well what would you say the expectations are ... cello tonight\nOh yeah are you a cat just builds up that sort of analog\nWell let's let's bring some hate tonight between these two teams it's more fun when it goes that way and hopefully it's more than just guys hating on angel Hernandez\nUp on the plate denied a bunch of ... Boston sports journal back the time Sean but those are pretty it's a it's\nReally interesting ah which John touched on there as far as you kind of a difference and it's not a generational difference right it's not just well it's guys today ... yesterday\nI mean there's a reason for that why there was that extra animosity that was beyond just out of the fans felt against each other and the city's felt about each other but the actual Yankees the longtime Yankees dislike the longtime Red Sox and vice versa but\nIt has to build over time and if you're constantly changing players and you don't have the same core develop and stick with a team for a long period of time you're not going to have that and certainly the postseason match up like this can I help breed\nThat extra rivalry a part of things to make it a a real rivalry now the historic rivalry right now Yankees Red Sox his age historic rivalry the two teams and they're twenty five men rosters don't necessarily feel all of that it's all around them in the crowd in the atmosphere\nUp but the teams don't necessarily dislike each other people don't dislike but that can build and hopefully that is something that\nWith a player's\nSticking around with their home team maybe a little bit more ... if you're able to\nYou know like Sean talked about keep ... bats in Boston for a long period of time and the Yankees keep Gary Sanchez and Aaron Judge ... I'll with both of these franchises make a commitment over the last few years to develop from within and grow their own guys and not just go out and signed free agents\nMaybe that's how you do build it up over a period of time and that's one of the things keep in mind\nThe Yankees Red Sox historically these have been the financial bullies which they still are\nAnd they add a ton of veteran players that they went out and sign in free agency and\nReally both of these teams have terrific young cores that they've been able to develop and they supplement it\nWith some of those free agents a big move like a John Carlos Stanton nor a JD Martinez to sluggers brought in that ah took these teams to the absolute next level over the course of this year but you have four or five guys that are well under thirty that are going to be parts these organizations for a long\nTime and have these kinds of match ups and you know it doesn't have to just be the post season when your plane Nineteen games head to head all year but it's better when the team's dislike each other and that is something that I think that it has missed a little bit in the seas in this series it hasn't quite felt\nLike oh three or four Yankees Red Sox\nAnd all that and I think yes there's a historical difference from the ... point of view but it's that there is no animosity between the players on these two teams and\nSports are more fun with villains and having a bad guy and sometimes it is an imagined bad guy doesn't have to actually be a terrible person it could just be a maybe some of the mouths off for somebody you know like a chipper Jones who just destroyed the Mets over the years and it was fun to\nThose games had an extra edge to them when he was\nInvolved and he he did mouthed off a couple of times as well in his time but that's fun that's what you want in sports\nAnd I I've talked to a chipper and my ... and as far as you know maybe they spoke a in Cooperstown this year but as of last spring\nThose two it never talk to her you know really chatted about what it's like to go at each other and it's a mutual respect but not necessarily like each other Avon battled all those years and and that's something that's\nThat's fun I think it had something to the to the rivalries and these games and and so that the ANC socks is ... they we missed a little bit in this series but there's still time for that to\nA heat up as they play a fourth consecutive game today and one that should have a all kinds of sub plots and decision making\nIt will be a chaotic\nGame the most chaotic game\nOf the series this game four to nine eight hundred three two one zero seven ten Bob's gym do cat a ... general manager now Syria sex and the S. N. Y. will do ah some on the Mets general manager search talking about the playoffs with Jim\nOr so a lot to do they're coming up it's sports don't be McCarthy on the voice of New York seven ten W O R\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nNow here in the W O R sports\nFind difficult is ever say tonight's game will be to really plan out and\nSee how it's going to develop it does develop the way that I I think it will which would be a battle of twenty five men rosters\nIs going to benefit the Yankees in a big way or the red Sox they are simply not\nBuilt for that know how some bats on the bench they can go to shore but pitching wise they need a traditional outing from Rick ... they got a traditional outing from made many of all the last night in fact now its core basically called who say oh we were looking to get seven scoreless innings enemy of all the and that's exactly what he got\nA tonight with poor cello yeah he he's pitch well against the Yankees and the passes Jersey native he knows what all this is about\n\nBut it's hard to imagine any these starters beyond the elite guys\nReally pitching deep because the second you get in trouble you're out and and that's got to be the way that you do it as soon as you start seeing the opponent hitting the ball hard\nAnd starting to see the picture well and we know the numbers third time around the order and things like\nThat yeah I get the guy out\nAnd go to the pen and try to mix it up the socks aren't built for that kind of game so can report cello give them that traditional seven inning kind of START I would see a tonight [laughter] that's why I I liked the Yankees signed up like the Yankees and the series and I I don't think they're dead in any way shape or form\nOn the betting lines don't think so either the Yankees or minus one forty five pretty heavy favorites uh granted they are at home but I think a lot of that has to do with how they ... sets up as chaotic as it's going to be tonight\nAnd we're learning a little bit about Alex coronary boom that will help rookie managers as big a game as they've ever managed and they are going to have a ton of maneuvering to do ... last night it was a long night wait\nTill tonight they're going to be major decisions made up and down this game by those two or three two one zero seven men gym to get serious ... that's N Y will join us on the other side of this news update\nStay away from us it's a\nYou know you get a break glass in case of emergency typing the auto wise I'm going with\nPretty much everybody else out of the of the bullpen at this point as a because of that probably because of the way I think you would go for the state it even though I liked him out of the book that I don't like him on the open at yet\nYeah we're talking again would you do get serious acts M. S. N. Y. agree with you on that uh you know bounced around real quick but the Astros Alex Brockman or he was willing to say that he's on happy\nThat the Astros were playing these daytime games the yanks socks get everything in prime time and you understand how TV Works but ah what did you take a break and\nGoing out on that limb after sweeping the Indians yesterday\nWell if they if the if the TV ratings were a little higher and that's why I say he has some kind of arguments but they are\nUh you know I think that the British it's clear what the what there is that in Boston that's York in ... I'm On the you know one of the it's a GPS in this situation I got to go with the higher profile game that's the way the pose those that it's always been that way so yeah I think would end up being done\nI think during the course of the year they've done a better job about a great job at a job of\nDividing up and getting you know other I think the city\nUh this year was on a national broadcast which you hardly ever see they weren't very good but it I mean ... very rarely you see them in a special broadcast anyway so making attempts met area I I think if you're used to I mean there's a you know certainly be higher profile just next out anyway no matter who\nThey will be and I think last year the Astros were kind of a like a ball\nWell under dog guy on the way up kind of story I think that's going to change this year do you get the sense that this theme is ready to be hated a little bit\n[laughter] yeah I think so I mean I think you know the other thing with great then let's not forget this guy as it plays with a chip on a show like he he\nHe he just gets angry about everything he's still upset that the diamond backs didn't address and number one all that's why we're number two in the back of his Jersey or you use the number two that are that you're in the draft was twenty a white fifteenth so so he plays with an edge a little bit of a chip in which is okay\nBut I Do think that the Astros their heart is they're harder team delight uh because uh there is a there is a confidence or swagger that they have to take his desk even all the way up into the office there's a lot of uh you know feeling that the GM their front office think they're smarter than everybody else that's going to feel that you get with a\nYou know with Billy Beane around the game at least one night and then the scouting circle so yeah I don't think there's any level loss for that team or at least a lot of the baseball people I talked to\nThat's interesting I think you'll see that oh and we will see that are coming up this October the warriors there were likeable at first and then uh you know they become a village to the NBA and a lot of ways and\nAh the Astros might be poised to make that turn here uh as we have a gym do cat ah how about the Mets or what is the latest that you hear Jim about their hunt for a new general manager\nBut they're they're very close to the fast even though they had what I think four or five days at a at a craft out I'm into into the public realm a\nAnd this and I know the candidates that they're taught to I I have to be honest I'm not overwhelmed with them yet I think there are four other three or four others that are are also in the mix and you know we'll see what happens but um I I think that in and\nUm yeah there's a there's a standard innocent whether you like the job that Sandy ocean did or not or he did have a level of success there and you had a level of intelligence you had a really a a good resume\nOr in that to me you create this he created a standard for the next general manager for me and how do they how they stack up both president energy and which I think they make do with a ... a combination of a president in a gym to gym might be under that scenario I just mentioned that GM might be you know an inexperienced first time GM\nWhere they experienced you know baseball executive above him as a president if that was the case I'd be a feature that because I don't think\nEven though they have a bunch of the executives there I don't have jobs that they should\nUh in terms of developing people within their front office to come to just say general manager can it's I don't ever see executives are unfortunately even John wrecked it doesn't get calls from other teams to be interviewing and you know GM physicians there and that's that's a to me a dock against the organization Jeff\nHow about you know we talked with Steve Philips last night in and he expressed that if he was you know are looking at that job he would be asking about the chain of command and you have a lot of other voices they're\nAh how what would be something that you would want to know more about a bad match job if you were a you know one of those candidates being someone who has an idea of how the organization works\nI mean as I Know a lot of the guys that are still there I hired a couple of them are some though you're with uh the structure I think there are some money will ah circumstances right now and there's some unusual ... that I'd want to know about\nUh you know there's it seems to be a a a difference of opinion in terms of old school a new school baseball guy that they want to bring in\nA I Know a Jeff will fund set on the last season that you know the ... the current existing group he he would like them to be back but he wasn't going to sound the gym with that ah that that people have interviewed for that or if they don't get that impression\nSo you know that's something that really just to clarify of an experience but yet you don't often coming a executive like venture\nShaking his name out of the uh out of the interview process that to me would be concerning what is he what does he think and what is the hearing and knowing a that\nThat you know as an out publicly so uh that to me is is something I think that needs to get answered here over the next couple of weeks\nSince this up and the Mets can do or whether it's speaking publicly or privately however works to encourage those writer candidates like Ben Jerry's tin that this is going to be a a good fit for them at this point or\nIs perception just reality as to what the the Mets are\nWell I I think there's a couple of things I think that that was\nA the organizations attempt at a ... attempt on Sunday at the at the end but I think it takes more than just that\nLike it's more than just coming out so that way I think it takes for me it private conversation or a couple of private conversations of recruiting process to some degree it's not just how they are you interested in should be interested in the New York Mets large market\nBaseball club ... there's more than ... there's a good candidate out there and I think that is a really good one thinks ... started would be fantastic I think there's other stupid forced a with openings GM there I'd be a all out blitz on somebody like that\nYou got to go out and recruit those type of guys to get them or they're not just falling off the tree and wanting to come and it said your necessarily so I think that the direction of fire and that is almost like trying to ... ... um you know when you get a lot of competition that's how I Would try to try to go after that I Want to\nMake the highlight video you know pictures of ... where the billboards ride the whole night\nMy camera in my cameras video fake that bad boy for that [laughter]\nI did the cat always a pleasure ... thank you I was a gym the cat the essay\nWhy series that exam and yeah I had a had all the stops out from my camera and know all those years ago and they work they got camera in in in\nA meal pointed to bend is a centerfield defensively for the beds before he ended up you know get moved over and Carlos Beltran game that down but uh as far as you know the Mets GM job is concerned you know I I again you hear\nThat these top candidates they are nervous and uncomfortable with certain aspects of how are the Mets operating are thought to operate in his in\nDuke alluded to there is some factions within the organization right now in in these kinds of things that you have to get cleaned up and and I think you know when the the Mets make a decision and your scratching your head that doesn't make sense that doesn't jibe with what making ... a few days ago and and these things will pop up over the course of the year\nOr does it what it all stems from is that not everybody is on the same page and that that's what they have to try to clean up and that's what you have an opportunity to do\nWith this higher whether it be a president of baseball operations the general manager they can end up bringing in both\nUm and\nYou know look you don't necessarily have to push everybody else out here but you have to get every body plan on the same team playing on the same page um you know as the film talked about last night the chain of command we're\nOnly one person is the voice of owner or the ear of ownership and they're not listening to a bunch of other people within the organization outside the organization as well uh that's how you have\nFactions in in issues and those kinds of things that they do show themselves at various times in and they have certainly for the Mets in the past so\nUm you know these are some things they got 'em you know try to convince the these top candidates hey it's going to be your team uh it it's going to be you know your decision making you build it in a way that you want\nAnd you know we'll we'll see if they are successful in convincing some of these top guys that's the case or you know again that the candidates that we've heard this far they are underwhelming and\nYou know they could just end up with a ... something\nHe lived manning yesterday man made that perfect crack to try to diffuse a situation and I said yesterday that he doesn't listen to little wiener doesn't watch ...\nAnd and that got everybody to chuckle a little bit hey see look there's no hard feelings after ... del I had been critical of Eli Manning I think he'd been honest about him and and made fair points but you know you don't expect that to come from within the house and so\nI apparently little way and he sounded like he was hurt by Eli Manning's comment\nManning says quote unquote [noise]\nI don't watch much [noise]\nThe sad part I think it it it bruised his ego or a bed and you know they're both from Louisiana as as a ...\nJunior but here's a more from little weighing on his Instagram last night on Eli\nIs anything bad about it [noise]\nMost of us\nWent anyway it used to\nLove to watch\nMuch me which is\nLet me get near it he said yeah you probably should listen because they're in the way your plane after he's\nCriticize the Eli I'm not\nGoing to come at you and then couldn't help himself going to help themselves [laughter] and now you\nLie and get sick gets in the middle of all this apparently they had a sense of humor about it a giants practice today and they were blasted a little Wayne er during the practice so um you\nKnow it it's it's just one of those things that circulates that you don't really need over the course of the season and and we have seen that happen you know quite a bit over the years with\nThe ... back um but uh you know the fact that little Wayne was there I said as much last night that\nIt doesn't\nAllow you to really take oh Dale seriously when that's the case in little lane was upset about even that kind of criticism a but it's absolutely true if you want if you're an NFL star like go back in June or you want to make a point about your teammates and you have a reason to do so\nUh you know you you express it yourself you don't need to do it with little Wayne sitting next to you or anybody any entertainer any athlete\nOr sitting next to you um and and but one thing that I did notice last night and I don't know exactly\nHow the interview came together but I Do know you know little Wayne and no do back in June or they're both from Louisiana and\nDeveloped a friendship over the years and they talked about other things in the interview and I guess will be a longer version that's going to be released to YouTube at some point but\nESPN all the Monday Night football and who is the entertainer for the halftime show last night but low weight and so it's\nGot a new album coming out ah so you know he's promoting and and that can play the game to be in New Orleans but I'm not sure this was a hype in low wage aspect of things that he was going to have a performance a Monday Night football and and putting him out there a publicly to you\nKnow rally up some interest for that and I you know that\nKind of leads to be shaking my head and and wondering you know how these things really end up transpiring 'cause everybody one of the first questions was not so much what I Would do back a junior said but just the oddity of the interview featuring an entertainer any entertainer didn't at me any personal with little white himself it's just\nIt's like Eli Manning doing a ... interview next to Brad Paisley or something like ... why is he there [laughter] why does that have to be the case you can come up with some wild combinations of shore of athletes\nAnd ah you know a musician that would be sitting next but it's ... it's a sports interview in what we saw come out this weekend and yet\nYou see the wonder ... how to come together why is he there um and you know they use that to try to defuse the situation and uh\nUh for JD Martinez six forty for bed so again even the power ... beating out JD Martinez to me if you're saying J. D. you are simply\nCrediting him for where he hits in the line\nUp and his ability to rack up Barbie eyes and not looking at the whole picture and it included knowing the\nDefenses well movies better op eds employer and ... mostly a da ... in what world\nAre you looking at JD Martinez I had to move in that way\nAnd your argument if you bought the few years ago then or teach could never been because he was always a da ...\nWhere's your factory and it doesn't mean you can't win but if I'm making the case that ... the better off its employer the JD Martinez and he's one of the better defensive players in the league at JD Martinez generally doesn't play defense what like you said that on here again\nWhat do you consider most valuable as opposed to most outstanding it's always in arguments had would that would that entire that entire argument\nThat don't have a hard\nOne ... player on a terrible team to me that's not MVP\nThat just because the data Martinez the newcomer ... yeah I bet to win um but yeah we we had a ...\nHalf the half the award money to the gym\nOr one of the Bronx what's up on\nThe roads are going good [noise] okay first I wanted to say a a good and you guys had a nice day you took me about your banks one\nOkay losing too short Carlene [noise] ah first would though um oh we can go a ... trust and Gail and I'm saying\nOh you want this guy to be Joe Montana where the ... games in ... I mean come on you know\nTake some time this was a a good performance for him it was nice to see a connective ... that that is a weapon that Donald had\nNot taken advantage of and he showed that he can make those kinds of places down the field which he missed the gets Jacksonville the week prior CEO is encouraging for Donald\n... or ... or ... or ... or ... I wanted to stay clear or whatever they call themselves ... or at least you guys get ... ... ...\n... okay [laughter]\nUh eight hundred three two one zero seven ten again eight hundred three two one zero seven then\nUh we will have court judge talk of the same network go around week six as we approach week sex the NFL season and uh some storylines developing a around the lake here sports people car they on the voice in New York seven ten wor\nPay on seven ten W O R [laughter]\nThey see the bad there has started warming up he got the memo [noise]\nSaid oh seven first but then I uh go under three two one zero seven ten\nOr ... and ... you got to be pulling just for more baseball at this time of year right even if you love the Yankees ate\nThe red Sox and wherever they have you ever found one of those two things I gather you root for your team but for everybody else\nIs more baseball they have no games tomorrow or Thursday I don't think I Want to see that game five on Thursday night at Fenway Park", "show_name": "WOR Tonight with Joe and Lis", "year": "2018", "city": "New York", "day": "09"}
