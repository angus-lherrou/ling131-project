{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "Fun no baseball for two days not the fun about that and we await for Dodgers brewers friday in the ... and it would be Astros red socks on Saturday\nNight stick to have a gap like that and that is what happens when you know schedule the postseason the way baseball does before and where you had some short series in the division series and you lose some of that momentum yeah you want to have it where every nights gets baseball to watch and not far\nCry from four games wasn't on friday\nAnd it's friday I think it was a they were all for\nA postseason series plant save time and and your loved that sports day to\nA potentially no baseball for a for a couple of days here exactly when you know you want it to to max out\nOr somebody that we haven't touched on here as far as the giants go as beyond all the drama uh that uh always seems to be a part of things with the big blue\nOr the giants cut their former first round pick Eric flowers today and flowers had lost his job at left tackle this off season they went out and they sold their uh put him it left tackle booth flowers to write tackled only last a couple of weeks we'll or took over for him\nAnd now flowers is done and not only is he done just a few years after being a first round pick\nYou know the giants they knew they added to late this afternoon to try to trade Eric flowers and they gave up on that well before they hit that deadline\nSo there was no interest or around the league in a trade at least offer Eric flowers and we'll see if he ends up anywhere but that's gotta be one of the worst\nA first round pegs in recent memory for\nThe giants and you're talking about\nAre just now getting production out of a guy I mean period and you're better off drafted somebody who doesn't even play\nThen what Eric flowers did in his time with the giants is a turnstile of left tackle it wasn't any better at right tackle a plane over forty games never really improved and\nOffensive lineman don't rack up a lot of stats that you could look at to show what his effect was on the team\nBut there's no doubt that the giants up and it has picked up since they put flowers on the bench and went to wheeler right tackle and uh they did that for the Texans game that was a decent offensive showing for the giants and the ... office of joining should say that they had their best option to showing in years\nJust the other day against the Carolina Panthers and the old line has been better not great uh they have a tough job they really have to be perfect every single play in order to protect the lie manning uh we haven't seen sake one Barclay able to consistently a break off big runs\nBut it's certainly been better than what they have had\nAnd that ... was such a focus for the giants this off season and\nUh you go back and that's one of those ... why Jerry racism here anymore and you know the giants made some changes in went after ... this year in the draft but it always stings wouldn't you miss out on early pick like that and if you if you do you want to hit on\nSome late ... it's going to pay off but I Want to at least get a steady starter when you drafted fairly early in the first round especially you take them what's supposed to be a safe pick up as a blind man those aren't supposed to be risky selection those those are supposed to be guys that\nYou take your plug in and they're at least solid starters for you for a more than a few seasons but are not the case for the giants and the earth flowers era are finally comes to an end or last night's Monday Night football and ... last night just after the show\nA a beaten up or got\nWent out for dinner last night and then the TV's odds of are are excited rush out to get back to queens and catch the LDS and then the Monday Night football game\nAnd by the time I got there not long after the show ended\nAnd the Yankees gave is ten one Red Sox and then they might have football game is blood as well as the saints route twenty six to Thirteen they handled the Redskins easily yesterday and Drew Brees setting a record along the way are the most passing yards in NFL history as he surpassed\nPeyton Manning I'm Sorry a tremendous milestone for Drew Brees who is it quite a few of them and look at it it is helpful to pull your career in the super dome or any use had a tremendous up its mind with him\nAnd Sean Payton but Drew Brees he is one of the great quarterbacks and uh certainly one of the best of this generation I think Aaron Rodgers just on talent is tops and you look behind\nAaron Rodgers and and obviously Tom Brady with all the winning that he is done and it doesn't take long\nTo get to Drew Brees it's basically breeze with Ben Roethlisberger and that is\nThat the tops that you were looking at it and the best quarter bags of you know in the last ten to Fifteen Years ago in Peyton Manning of course in there as well um but Drew Brees what what a career he's carved out for himself considering\nI wasn't the\n... the easiest path to uh you know even making it college in play Perdue or to fill up rivers being drafted behind them in\nSan Diego basically spelling the end of his time there a failed brought in Miami and the bad shoulder and then just taking off New Orleans it's Super Bowl title on his resume all these passing yards and he's still tremendous you could still move around he doesn't seem like he age is\nA it's a it's a big town accomplishment for Drew Brees last night and ah one of the sub plots are here a week five will be looking at a week Sixers well court judge talk of fame network with us and the other side of this news update\nYour small businesses is Fox they rated number one seven ten W O o voice of New York and\nAnd that's what we saw on the giants of the past and talk often as they're\nAbout back them and and some of what he said 'cause oh I've always said was true it didn't necessarily need to be publicly as you you you hinted on I I feel like he's trying to take a leadership role with the team and it's just clumsy about is that given up too much of the benefit of the doubt\nUm yeah I think so I mean you know he said he feels like these out scheme meant the shot at the head coach ... um you know he's asked the question about you I managed very simple yeah you know he's the quarter back at it I mean even if you don't believe it said publicly otherwise you just\nProvoked the kinds of questions that are coming out now you have a problem with him and what's the issue or when you're asked about the giants you prefer warmer weather you like LA oh what's that old I just signed a big deal here\nMe to the highest paid receiver so are you and happy what's going on here and um the bottom line is I said is this is a sort of stuff that does come out when teams aren't successful I and I I think back to again ... you know they were complaining all the time about\nIs a discipline you know and the fact that you had to be there five minutes earlier drawn time you were late that wasn't right he was too tough\nThey start winning games and suddenly those complaints just\nWeren't talking again court judge ... networks check out who the judgments talk of fame network dot com every Monday I as far as the jets are big went over the Broncos and and they're very inconsistent we'll see how they bounce back or this upcoming Sunday but\nI'll let me ask you this who's been the most impressive rookie quarterback in the league to you through a five weeks well that's\nA good question I mean he he does not much of a sample size with Baker may feel I'd probably have to say him only because I've seen him three games you know everyone else has to part of one to others um I I liked the way he responded last week that the tough defense to solve and I'm Talking about Baltimore\nIn there or you take the good and the bad and the ugly with him\nBut he may place when he had to uh I loved Arnold I always have and I told you that I thought he was the best quarterback coming out in the draft I like to write to the ball deep last week I liked is poised to let the fact that he can bounce back from mistakes he is making it look so to me all the wiki quarterback make them and I think people are under the illusion that\nSomehow these guys going to turn into Peyton Manning ... Tom Brady overnight that's not the case where a quarterback struggle we know that watching the un manning his first year um but I I thought Donald ... terrific last week um was on target some of those Deep Throat so I go out and may feel\nDonald I think Rosen's look has you know\nOkay at times but against small sample size and then you know Alan I'm not really sure what to make him um because he doesn't have any run around in the offensive line is terrible he's running for his life and he decided the way with their became now is with defense and the running game so um I I go with may feel a ... but a slim margin over Sam Donald\nHow interesting that the browns to you after a name for the way to Baltimore\nYeah I mean they've doubled the number of victory and some of the past two years pretty interesting um because you look at me go well you know finally Cleveland's got something to rally around especially in the Indians have gone but they have something to rally around fans are great they are they're loyal it coming out and and now the dog pound to cut it and they should be I mean big big God's Plan makers but they generally\nIn recent years have been on defenses play makers and they've got some defensive a play makers galore now and but now he's got a quarterback with people excited about that's the first time that's happened\nYou know probably ... ... couch there um you know I Know ... they had some some successes Eric Anderson one season but boy it's it's nice to see them their plane people tough even if they lose you know ... they could be five and ... I mean what if they had a kicker they they could be five in zero but they played everyone top\nThey're competitive I don't think they're a playoff game I don't think they're making more than a five hundred team at best but\nThey are competitive I said before the season that thought five or six when I'm Still sort of there but I like what they're doing they're taking people the overtime and they're very tough out\nChanging the culture to whereas yeah they expected to lose it felt like a lot of games in the past and that's starting to change um how about what's going on to Oakland or what what are the early returns on on John ... monster contractors head coach there\nAre not good [laughter] I don't need to tell you that you've seen that team um you know the questions about how your car we get along with him\nAnd those questions seem to be put to rest when he played um you know a week ago and put up for a hundred and some yards I'm against the brown and against a pretty good defense and I think he should for touchdowns I Can't even tell ...\nWell no there isn't because their cars not the quarter back he was in two thousand and sixteen that's when Jack do real was there and John ... supposed to be this quarterback whisper this guy who can turn everyone around he'll turn him into rich can well John good has been out of the game for a long time and I know he was in the booth so he was certainly around the game but he wasn't\nIn it and a lot has changed and um you know when you're off the sidelines for that period of time I've seen in the past you know you go back to your meal you go back against Joe Gibbs especially um it's not the same Joe Gibbs came back and has for years he did go to the playoffs two\nTwo times but didn't win a playoff game\nAnd it's combined records thirty and thirty four this is a hall of fame coach went three Super Bowl\nWith three different quarterbacks none of whom is in the hall of fame and who I consider one of the greatest coaches well time it's different when you're out that period of time and so um I looked at grew and then you know his last four years in Tampa\nMe hit a losing record there he didn't he didn't want to play off game either so I don't know what the allure where was I think they were trying to reach back for that John wound up two thousand one two thousand it's not there and he does have some players\nAnd he does have a quarterback needs help but he looks worse than every now and that team looks worse than ever and again don't get me started on the ... I Will never ever understand why I get rid of great players\nAngered keeps talking about they need to pass right to to address guy in the league or or a into turning them when we got to go ... feet all\nDay last week you know first and goal at the one\nI think that he has the march on lens in the backfield and we go again and I didn't even lose a learned from the super bowl against the patriots won Seattle plan apparently not but I heard him\nTalk about the oh that's a Super Bowl you that's a long time ago well there was a lesson learned there you've got four crack given the ball he'll get the one yard but uh yeah the early returns had been horrible there and I think people are shaking their head going ... Clint paid a hundred million for what this guy who can make\nTen years ago so he's not going anywhere so you'll have to get big together there's we a chat with court judge I used to do great knowledge of football history it seem Drew Brees last night at the passing garbage record as you start to consider his place within NFL history\nUm you know where does he what kind of conversation if you start to put himself in now\nYeah I Know I had this question asked earlier today I mean is the one of the elite of all time certainly in terms of numbers he is but sometimes I feel and especially in some of the hall of fame meeting as if we're talking about the fantasy football hall of fame yeah these are\nOutrageous numbers he's put up with a different game today and I'm old enough to have seen unite us when he played 'em and some of the other quarterbacks like name at that and and\nBranch on those guys but United's especially and I'd never seen so I haven't seen anyone is great in my mind is John United he didn't put up the numbers that have Brady or man or a breeze has but\nFor my money if I were to take one in my lifetime he'd be the first guy off the boards but um I look at him and take um the first thing we do in that room is measured coaches and quarterbacks rightly or wrongly but we measure them by rings and or\nSuper Bowl appearance is now obviously there are exceptions damn south sprints never got the super bowl but he was a different quarterback from this time because he was putting up numbers but nobody else was with Eric Oreo Warren ... different conversation didn't get to the Superbowl but I'm In Reno got their one but you look at Drew Brees he's gotten there once to anyone at\nIron Rogers gotten there wants to and he's wanted but\nWould you put him in the same conversation with Peyton Manning I'm Talking about two and I I Would would you put in the same conversation with Tom Brady no of course not so now where does he go he's got these outrageous numbers but it's like\nAggregate a ... there's an aggregation going on the east compiled a lot of numbers because of durable he's stuck around for a long time that's to his benefit the great quarterback but his he might top five in the answer's no he is and is he my top ten I'd have to think about it I don't know about it but um I Know he's not like that\nBut ... I guess you have to judge him against the error rate is you talked about United States you can't look at these two and it at all really compare with how different the game is but if you look at St Brady and manning their on their own level is it like breeze Rogers that brought this burger that next step right now\nYes yes he absolutely you you hit the three guys absolutely and I think most people say Rogers\nBreeze ... burger I don't know I'm a big office burger Fannie went twice as many games as he lost his butt at three superbowls I knew we had some are probably better players around him certainly better defense I'm Aaron Rodgers is a sensational quarterback who make big play\nOutside the pocket like Ben Roethlisberger years ago unlike Drew Brees but um you'll run for first jobs makes it nice and just\nHallmark end of the game passes on the ... that we can't forget he's he's such a charismatic guy but he gets hurt a lot and and their ability to me is a is a big deal when it gets ... doesn't so that puts a breeze and Rogers right there um those are three you talked about had people ask me about Philip Rivers I covered Phillip ... is my maybe my favorite\nQuarterback in recent years to be around I Love watching my wishes would be in a Super Bowl thinking needs to get there to be in that hall of fame conversation again people say look at his numbers were going to say that with everyone now look at their numbers they're so far different but I Would ask you in terms of when I was talking about top five\nWould you take breeze over\nJoe Montana and I'd say the answer is no there there are different eras and say you probably say no would you take them over Dan Marino and different interests I think you'd probably say no about John Elway different interests and take you'd probably say no now he's starting to push themselves down the board so so I said you've got to look at the probably the second tier\nAnd that could end up being the difference you know how long does still reverse play and do these guys start to rack up some numbers even if there are Super Bowl rings that follow as well but had that longevity\nTo go along with what\nThey've accomplished over the course of their careers uh it's gonna make it even tougher for you lie because you know he's the worst of the group that we talked about in terms of current performance\nSo\nIt's all going to factor in your email I used to be able to argue Drew Brees Eli Manning there's no argument anymore\nUsed to be able to argue ill I man and gets Ben Roethlisberger I I don't think there's an argument there\nSo again you know I Will get in the two Super Bowls will make sure that but\nWhen you start ranking him against his peers and the other quarterbacks of his generation here's an show\nAll that well\nAnd you know finds itself behind a lot of terrific quarterbacks a lot of great quarterbacks in the lake you can't put them all in ... and you get a sense of know how it might be a\nBit of a process and certainly you know the end of your career and you know trying to have those last runs at a championship adding some Wednesday or total adding some passing yards touchdowns all those things you know he's not doing it\nThe same way that these other guys are as you know they continue to play a very high levels late in their career and you know I is it a eight hundred\nThree two one zero seven ten again eight hundred three two one zero seven to end the number\nOr as far as the Mets go in the middle of this general manager ... we've had a chance of the last couple of days to catch up with some of their former GM's or tonight chipped the cat last night Steve Philips if you miss if you could check it out to in in their entirety on our website seven ten W. R. dot com slash sports\nAre but we asked a I asked the Philips last night\nAbout\nWho will be ultimately calling the shots are within that organization once the new GM comes in\nI think Jeff has probably more the guy that will be breaking down the every day responsibilities of the general manager in what shows expectations are\n\nSo you know Jeff will be more involved in the day to day versus a Fred well upon who\nMight have some say over the philosophy and what direction they go in that way but you know isn't as involved in the day to day any longer but I thought was interesting ... was a the issue of the the chain of command with the Mets\nThe company is going to want it to find\nAs to who's there and what everybody's role is I mean I think that's going to be critical\nFor anybody called the is so that they understand you know the the sort of framework of of who they are working with and what was one of overlap I don't want people to have a forty\nOr without responsibility a I Need to know that a general manager that everybody in the baseball Hartman reports to me those are the general manager that everybody in the baseball apartment reports to me\nUh and that uh you know that my relationship with older shift as the war\nThat channels everything\nAnd that's important and you can picture right the diagram in your head where it's ownership and above all at the top and then\nYou know the president of baseball operations or the GM below him with a straight line between and then all of those other people uh you know feeding in to that general manager and and that's the way that the\nAh power structure works but with the Mets it's not really the way it's set up for whoever the new GM ... that comes in unless they are able to clean house but you have you know Terry Collins uh with the ear of Fred ... involved the J. P. rich already and John ... go and a number of different\nIn that mix you have to get everybody pulling in the right direction and following one leader and that's not always easy to do when you have\nNo other smart people a better part of the operation but are you going to see things the same way and have a a joint philosophy that works now it does it mean that is going to come by on everyone's got to agree\nOn everything but you don't want somebody who's not\nThe baseball person in power talking ownership and and creating factions and divisions and and that's where things get messy or so yeah a chain of command\nA it is it's an important part of what the Mets have to show I I think these candidates that they have in place and it's one of the reasons that you see the ...\nAnd uh some of the other ... names that have come up or stay out of the Mets are ... to this point and I asked Jim the cat um you know about their searches well and and do shared what effects are younger GM candidate would need\nA GM might be you know an inexperienced first time GM would they experienced you know baseball executive above him as president if that was the case I'd be a teacher that I don't\nEven though they have a bunch of the executives there I don't have that they should\nUh in terms of developing people within ... come just a general manager can it's I don't ever see executives are unfortunately even John ... doesn't get calls from other teams to be interviewing and you know GM physicians there that's a to me a dock against your ...\nYou want to have just like have a strong farm system and you know it's fine you can have ... within your system trade away some prospects things like that you want to be developing your ah coaching trees and and things like that and it's just proof that doesn't help your team that these guys end up going elsewhere but it's proof that you are\nDeveloping talent that you're ahead of the curve and that other organizations trying to be like you\nAnd you know with the Dukes point\nYou can see that hasn't really been the case for a while going back a with a you know other teams poaching you met for an office brains\nAre

that the the Mets had started to find itself on my head again and I'm like\nI Can't bear to see this I I don't want to see the Yankees wait I Can't do the shots into the crowd at the Yankee fans going nuts and starting to pound their chest and\nFeel like it it was getting\nTheir their gift that this is going to happen that that God would or day in the Yankees must wait and playoff series and a do it in these ways that's it\nTo feel like in the Bronx as Craig Kimball was unable to throw a strike in\nAaron judges reaching base and eventually Neal Walker gets hit by the pitch run comes and the Yankees are one hand away from tying the game\nAnd it's all those all those flashbacks Mets fan that I feel that as a Red Sox fan I couldn't imagine because it's so much more personal for you so many of those losses or at your expense\nBut it's not two thousand three anymore it's not a pre Red Sox a World Series and kimbrell did get the ... that he needed a key strike out of John Carlos Stanton among them\nAnd the red Sox they hold on they beat the yanks in on what could have been a whole home last I think for a Yankees fan I Know it's tough to lose to the red Sox but\nTo get your hopes up like that in the ninth inning where you feel like oh wow the Yankees are going to win the game and then boom it's ripped away from you\nKnow things it's more of a gut punch than you would have thought especially when you hear the red Sox\nPlay in New York New York in the clubhouse following the game and dripping champagne on each other or they're at Yankee Stadium\nThat that becomes a real gut punch and it's always going to hurt to loose in a Red Sox but then how it developed\nAnd to go from a we're going to lose today rally up your hopes and you'd think they're going to do it and then they don't [laughter] it's over and Gary Sanchez hits a six hundred foot high fly ball a dead ends up\nOnly be into the warning track\nAnd that's how you know essentially your your season ends those the last real chance for the Yankees last night\n... know sank and it'll thing but that's what the Yankee fans wanted that's what they wanted coming in the series so they wanted after they beat the Yankees [noise]\nAnd they got a one hundred and eight when theme that as serious weaknesses and Alex Cora\nA phenomenal job in the series and you do have to consider it is interesting and we always talk on Mets here but thinking about\nHow that merry go round was played this off season as far as the managers and the first year managers that were hired\nAnd guess what the pitching coach that hadn't been involved in the day to day decisions and truly managing a game\nReally had a hard time and the national league with things as simple as double switches for at least the first half of the season\nAnd there was a long learning process I think Mickey Callaway managing a playoff game would be in over his head based on what we saw the course of the regular season it's a different pressure it's a different game they're different decisions and a lot more decisions that have to be made\nAaron Boone who did a good enough job over the course of the regular season handling the Yankees getting them to a hundred victories\nHe could hit for average there to like Ryan Howard back in the day he had three hundred he was an envy paves phenomenal and they became more of a one dimensional Homer guys time when a um went along\nAnd that's where you'd like to see you know some of those Yankee options\nHave more options I don't think they deserve to change their personality I really just that gets approach ah with some of these teams and some of these players and understanding what's the situation asking you to do and it's never gone but sometimes it is you know cut it down a little bit make sure you put the ball and play and make something happen\nIt's going to George and fresh meadows George what's going on tonight\n[noise] hey how are you gonna ethically calling David my five points as to what I wanted to see the Mets doing the off season you totally disagreed on to them which is okay ah I just want to mention them again no one I Would love to see Daniel Murphy at first base it would immediately be our best sitter lined up\nAnd I'm Still a big no on that but OK yeah\nAnd my second thing was and you will get disagreed at the time was that I didn't want\nNikki Kelly back as manager because they thought he still was raw didn't have the experience\nAnd what you said earlier today is exactly what I was saying basically that um\nYou know in the playoffs it let's say hypothetically must make the playoffs the next year I don't want our managers will be learning on the job you know he him in high pressure situation so I can see a Mickey crucial mistakes and we don't need the manager to be to cross the game like like um like the Yankees manage it\nBut this is the key having a whole year under his belt Mickey ... being a far better position to handle those spots say next year I thought we saw growth in him over the course of the year\nWe did we did I just I just feel a lot more comfortable they were gonna you know have a team if we Kyrah Gmail right move higher or improve our team we have some young guys already or [noise] or building upon maybe we'd be signed the ground if we somehow get to the playoffs next year\nYou know I I just as a Mets fan of die hard Mets fan I Would feel a lot better if I had\nA proven seasoned a manager like you were saying like ... one year as a bench coach them and uh as opposed to Mickey oh like ... back in ... Jr already somebody who's got you know a lot more experience who I'm not going to worry about\nYeah and and I get that when you get into the post season but I Do think that Mickey ... experience this past year and let's say they do make the playoffs next year or another one hundred and sixty two games they managing we'll put them in a far better place to be able to handle\nThe postseason I understand the postings it'd be a totally different animal ah but that's that's part of it and you got a you know grow with your manager a bit or is it a little uncomfortable when you you don't know exactly how guys going to respond sure but\nIf you make a cow is that the best part of the future for this team and I think it can be um then that's that's what I look at look at it I'm not going to punish him continually for how we manage to April through June\nI don't think he's the manager anymore he learned from that involved and got better at handling doubles which isn't to move the happy within a game um but ... Mickey can be in trouble anyway because depending on who the next general manager is if they don't see I\nI Would make a cow away not be around so I'll I'll everything still in play as far as the Mets are concerned and we will be chatting with my\n... of the New York post it seven oh five and get the latest on the ... general manager ... been all over that so uh some updates from today which we will get to and when we come back\nValentine a long time big like manager ... the world series in two thousand we'll get some his thoughts on last night's trends we see in the postseason and much more it's a sports car the ... voice in New York ... double you all are\nGoing to be on\nLine in major league baseball and they will do so without the Yankees\nNow it'll be Red Sox dash girls in the ... the Dodgers brewers in the ... are starting up on friday and we'll be joined right now by longtime vaguely manager for managing the New York that's Bobby Valentine with us in a body\nI I'm just curious how much can you appreciate the pressure that these managers feels everyone's button Aaron Boone now under the microscope today\nWell that's what happens I guess when you're at the head of the class you know everybody's throwing their paper planes in your direction but um you know Aaron had a very nice season this year and you know what could have been should've andme would have happened ah it's all for the second guessing\nYou know maybe they're doing it earlier but those are the things that we're always done\nProbably later in the game only because it has to quality of the full fat that you have today you know I Wish I had\nA left hander Anna right hander that I could count up what I was in Texas you know there are a couple years or maybe a couple of months that that I did but not much more than that\nYeah I mean their strategy is just a totally flipped on its head right those late nineties Yankees were always praised for getting into the bullpen and beaten up on the mineral leaf and now everybody coming out of the pan is Ninety eight plus in and can at least be dominant for one inning\nYeah and and that's going to have its shelf life also not necessarily because it doesn't play well in the game because eventually there's gotta be collect if but that uh you know the boar innings the bullpen pitchers dilemma settings starters pitch to start or ... pitch less\nThan they make less than if they're not going to make the money than the\nFull fans got it has to make the money and uh\nI I don't know that anybody is going to wind up paying forty million Fifteen million and sixty million dollars for guys pitch one and two innings the game\nNow where we found something that it's off season where the relievers prices were ah picking up a quite a bit and those were the first guys off the board which certainly wasn't the case or in the past ... Bobby Valentine right now\nAh how about Alex Cora ... you know everything that he did seem to work out what'd you think of them moved out to go to Chris Sale his game ... starter in the eighth inning of a I still close game\nOh once again he had that available to you or your high price starting pitcher said yes I can pitch and relief\nUh how could you not use that that bullet when a\nEveryone had criticized and and the other pitches pitches in the bullpen were much maligned coming down coming down the stretch so yeah I think it is when the guy says he can if you do that again one of those things are going to regret\nBig for not doing I don't think he'd ever would regret it uh bringing a man even if he gave up a couple of ...\nAnd it was a terrific one two three eight in the red Sox live another day they'll get the Astros and the ales cs I'm always like to get some Mets in here in the ... of course a hunting for general manager right now Bobby ... is there any direction that you would like to see the Mets go that you think would be best for the organization\nWell not really um other than somebody who\nUnderstands talent when they see it and I'm under sit stands a group and how pieces fit into the group when they see it\nYou know if they're if they're just going to do what they've done in the past and think that there I'm going to let the numbers are dictate how a player with the team or or or they should get I think they're going to\nWind up in trouble again but if they get somebody understands or the group mentality and understand baseball talent when they see it I think the next general manager or it's going to have a really good time being in New York\nHow top is not going to be as a manager in this case Mickey Calloway when you don't know who your boss or GM is going to end up being\nWell I I don't know if it's tough I guess once person is hired if they get along with him that it all gravy and if you don't and uh you know it's time to look for another job\nRight that Bobby Valentine is always a pleasure having you on Bobby thanks for sharing your insights\nOkay thanks fair take care of yourself\nKnowing the grape baseball mines in a fun to to pick the mind of Bobby Valentines take quick braking breakdown somewhat body and is that coming up eight hundred three two one zero seven dead sports on what people are currently on the voice of New York ...

W. dot ... dot com which is not for for the continent of advertising math or anything [noise] we're backing\nThe W O R sports when\nGoing down Bobby Valentine and [noise]\nWe used to ship or in two thousand twelve and and you know there are things that they were able to do there are similar to today\nBut one of the big differences that you pick up there is just the amount of talented arms that you have coming out in the bullpen as good as you know say Wendell and Dennis Cook were coming out of the pen for the Mets in\nA you know Ninety nine and two thousand uh they they don't compared to what\nA you have these days where you know someone like Bill Tancer is coming out of your panic is able to dominate the red Sox don't really have that guy but you look around the league it's similar like Josh hater\nWhen if you ever talk about a middle reliever as being one of the key pieces of a series a unless it was just to neutralize one bad but Josh hater I he might be able to throw seven eight innings in that series against the Dodgers and they can pick the spots where it matters most to bring him in\nAnd so he is as much or more of an impact that even some of the starting pitchers a when you end up looking back on it you know what Andrew Miller was able to do for the Indians are a few years ago when they made the runs the world series so I\nKnow that's obviously a a big difference and and now these games are handled and again to me uh what would have to frustrate\nThe Yankees is that you had the edge and the second half of all these games and not just an edge a huge advantage\nWith your bullpen against the red Sox bullpen and they failed to utilize it a big scored some runs a game one not enough to when\nThey put themselves behind the eight ball to foreign game for an game three\nAnd as it turned out game for as well unable to take advantage of the underbelly of that Red Sox pen a eight hundred three two one zero seven tend to number you're on TALK a lot about the ... general manager hunt and how they don't seem to be attracting the top candidates in the sport\nBut some interesting names coming up today and Mike ... of the New York post\nI Will tell us the latest on what's happened as the Mets try to find a new baseball leader for this organization right now and is up they\nI think it's a positive sign and he's he's able to pull a couple of them are jobs all the walking in Philadelphia when it was a she turned down a chance to intervene with Arizona at one point so\nListen uh there was only thirty has these jobs or you know I sure hope maybe\nIt's an odd to attract would quote unquote attractive job right now but there was only thirty over there there's there's a\nLot of people out there interested now are you going to get the highest end guys probably not but you know what there's ... there's there's a lot of smart people working in the game will uh well I think Blum a fits into that category\nYou report it last night Tony La Russa are made at an overture to the bats bond or someone's behalf\nThey did tell me we're losing the big ... a Little Rock guy clubs area little walk couldn't say enough good things about a ... and those were boxing St Louis a\nOr a new look what life was just kind of gather it was it was a little looser wants to finish up there as manager but a federal who still want to Arizona where he was one of the show out there for awhile talked to lower rocks at the GM job\nWas very impressed with it and ultimately they hide Dave Stone for that job\nHe wanted to hire a Little Rock for what he considered equal jobs at the G um but uh uh ... cardinals are denied permission uh for them to go that route it says it was we technically it ... it was in the promotion on\nOn the scale is the cardinals thought so they may not ... it's a but Tony La Russa to Tony La Russa ... rock a lot\nIn this uh this is the first round of interviews for the ... with the potential candidates out long do you expect this first round to go on\nI think we're we're we're the closed here I I think by tomorrow or friday there'll be done with the first round uh although I Am so it it could spill in the next week but I still I think we'll we'll\nWe'll get into the second round of interviews next week and that's when a friend will pond is going to get involved in the process of ultimately\nA you know it says call is going to be the next GM and the Mets\nAnd that's I Would think that's a very different interview doing wrong with John right going Jeff well upon and then you know trying to have Fred on board as well it's got you got to be balanced or at least be able to to talk to people with different philosophies about the game right\nYeah and and that's the thing I you know I think you know Jeff will pawn in that I went to ...\nYou know younger guys or is there in the forties early sixties now and you know ... imported will come on now is comes from a different generation or more of a\nMore no more old school as we've said that he is kind of looking I think I think he's still we sort of a one and a candidate with a with experience so much Clarence element in scouting but I you know I think he's also open I could probably get blown away\nBy the right candidate and like make a Callaway\nThat's what happened was ... ... ... you know last year the ... the whole managerial search\nAre they pulling expected it to go to Ronald Reagan came in the first sign up for it opened with about getting that search for the call came in the first round and said hey we got our guy here so uh you know ... anything can happen when\nYou are when you get the people in front of a sudden will probably remember art how are how lit up the room\n[laughter] and then and then they battle a night after night after night with a I mean are now or are we talking with my job and the New York post ... what sense do you have a the names that are public right now is that close to a complete list of everybody in the ... interviewed\nI think it's pretty close uh I saw my turn off the main floating out there today are against him and um I think uh I think there's some interesting Matt I I don't know how interesting he ... they may they may have spoken\nOn the phone I don't think he's been including interview but uh you may be another name that makes it but I think we're we're pretty close to a complete list here you know five six maybe a ... there's a seventh I don't know but so what we'll wind down there I think uh towards the end of the first round\nI Know one of the names it's generated a lot of attention is coming who's been working for major league baseball for a quite a few years now where do you hear about you know her background in in what he would there be any concern that she hasn't been with a team or in\nSeasons\nOh I don't I don't think so lots of a concern now when the\n... ... lives of the list or is it\nA lot of the race for a few years so I don't think that the deal Kim man a cleaning out a big market experience with the White Sox since she was with the Yankees are what the Dodgers\nWho've done a lot of stuff or all those or it was clear to sell it knows that\nI was very close to Canada they certainly certainly ... ... and they are against anybody does is it\nCertainly is there any kind of front runner you get a feel of that's far too early to call\nYou know the other day I said I thought it was a lot to say a ... it's ... there's a lot of people in the Lacey call uphold the law of lights of a lot but I I'm just I'm not that serves the clear front runner at this point I think a\n... ... if they know a ... a ... ... ... if if I had a\nTweet right now I Would take the ... ... ... ... somewhat on equal footing it gave me a little uh does\nThat Mike ... of the New York post appreciate your coverage of this everybody check it out and why post and a collector giants tomorrow ... seasons on the line\nIs is on the line and I'm an adult and so you know just get a little street going in a sewer that\nIt'll all be okay it was low and sit next to this interview\nHe's not you know [laughter] what do you guys have you have someone next year who would it be when you get you get one music star next to you in an interview\n... ... ... an hour ago\nSo the next big one not an ally I like that ... a given given how to execs Mike [laughter] like eight or ... the New York\nPost a given us the latest there on the Mets now hunters so you know that's it and encouraging name I think background really are as far as you know high in bloom being involved and and my ... my turn off name coming up any Martina no of S. N. Y.\nOr just a tweeted that you know turn up as in the ... says ties to the area obviously is\nFather the program director uh down the dial here so I'm\nYou know he's got family in New York and uh obviously some kind of a connection with the ah the area as far as that goes if you're talking about you know taking an actual general manager someone's have less access there in Cleveland and then you know bumping him up to president uh baseball ops and be a name that would make a lot of sense and you\nKnow that would probably drive pretty well for Mickey Callaway as well of course Callaway coming from the Indians organization as well where he was there a long time pitching coach so\nUh yeah that would be a a seamless transition but again you know those questions about the Mets we talked to the fill up the other night about the chain of command and you know are you going to be put in a situation to\nMake the final decisions to have autonomy and you know have a\nYou know the organization Brian essentially the way that you desire and the best way that you see fit in order to win some games are so these are all you know part of the questions that surround the Mets but I think today\nA much more encouraging in terms of getting some you know diversity in these candidates are and some younger people involved more analytical based people involved in at least you don't have them open to\nYou know looking at the organization or vice versa and getting a feel for what their ideas might be if you don't hire them you know maybe they do give you an idea or a plan for the organization that you know makes a a little bit of sense makes you more open\nTo going in in that kind of direction down the lines I think ah you know that's something that you want and they said they would have a variety of candidates than\nUh I don't think there's anybody quite nontraditional in the mix right now uh but you know we didn't hear Casey closest name or or Brodie bandwagon and a couple of player agents that have been mentioned at various times\nUh but um\nYou know certainly are due diligence being done at the moment here by the Mets eight hundred three two one zero seventh and the number\nGot an eight hundred three two one zero seven then I'll get a giant eagle some of the keys in that game coming up a little bit later on the show and ah as well as what the Mets in to some degree the Yankees have to look ahead of as we hit the hot stove portion of the baseball season\nAt the Yankees are are spending again a that might move the market a little bit and allow things to proceed a little quicker and is a again all of the reason why\nThe Mets have to get this general manager position figure it out as soon as possible they can't be waiting until the winter meetings in early to mid December to be putting a general manager and place or president baseball operations or or you know just in general\nOr whoever's going to be making their baseball decision so I think speed is of the essence for the match to make that happen you certainly want to have it done by the G and meetings in early November\nBut the earlier the better the more time you have to do the research that new front office person's gonna have to assess within the Mets organization as well as a lot of work that has to get done uh so you know the fact that they're starting to wrap up the first round of interviews is good and\nUh you know apparently my turn off will be part of the interview process a Cornell B. dot com\nOr some multiple sources telling Anthony the coma their turn off is expected to interview and he would be a home run absolutely or what the Indians have done would they built there that is the kind of organization that you want to mimic and I understand\nThey just got swept by the Houston Astros but they've got a lot of things going right and not only that\nThere is no team in baseball bat or sets up as similar to the Mets and the Indians came on after the Mets but they're another team built around starting pitching and the trend around the game right now is\nTo depend more on your bullpen\nBut starting pitching can still carry at the uh you have to have both and there's no doubt about it but if you have a bunch of aces\nIt's a different situation and the Mets are still capable of having that with ... cinder guard\nWith the ... and ... garden\nTaylor or you know you have enough talent there that you could be near the top and and have guys that can\nGo seven innings in a playoff game and again it didn't work for the Indians this year but I wouldn't look at three games against the Astros and say that doesn't work or it does and you need to have a lot of other things they've done well developing in finding Jose Ramirez\nWithin an VP candidate this year and we all know about for instance Colin door and what he has done a but Ramirez the guy seems to get better every single year\nAnd and that's certainly a big positive and it just the fact that someone ... Bennett GM before it's not easy doing it in New York of all places the questions are tougher more incisive there's more reporting news more noise\nOr around the situation I think it's harder to handle if you're in your first year I think Mickey Callaway experienced some of that over the course of the season and that GM becomes one of his spokespeople for the organization you want to have someone who's been there before is dealt with some fire storms there inevitably going to come up\nEven if the organization has run better than before and you're gonna have to have an answer for some things so ah you know all of these things come into\nPlay and you know to me again turn off is about as good a name or as exciting name is I've heard a you like I Am bloom with some his background and Tampa\nYou want to get ... that have had success and have been a head of the curve and those are two organizations in Cleveland in Tampa that have done that and that's something that a big market teams should be able to do take from the organizations that have been successful grabbed their GM's and make them your own the Dodgers did it with Andrew Freedman\nAnd you know they've been\nWinning that division every single year that Friedman has been there and now I had the ... starting up on friday against the Milwaukee Brewers still trying to get over the top and actually one of the world series but\nUh it seems to be a matter of time for the Dodgers I don't think it'll be this year but they continue to give themselves opportunities and\nI guess it depends on how you look at the post season is it\nAh does it prove for the best team was or is it a little bit of a crap shoot a in terms of who ends up standing at the end of the thing and you just want to have as many opportunities
