{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "You know you guys get the reputation all those right bad Boston sports fan as a patriots fan do you get upset when one\nOf your guys as it were does something like\nThat yeah because I see it everywhere though I mean I can go to any single fan base and find an idiot like that and are more idiots in just go around you look at the case in point that the Dodgers remember the giants fans who beat up the giants fans will be up at Dodger fans are the Dodger fans in in in the poor man is is you know a and Brian do that in bad shape years later\nI known about giants fans who've gone down to Washington DC you know that you hear about Philly they went to D.C got beat up by Redskins fan\nI saw the picture of the girls filthy mouth on on Twitter about Red Sox fans it's it's just everywhere every fan base has these people it's a ... let's call it what it is too much alcohol too much craziness and you know take it a little lighter\nBut I think it's important that it's not just about hey I'm going to protect my own bands and hey you know get bad that are done anything wrong in my opinion you\nKnow what a patriot messes up he messed up and you don't want the I don't want out and do something stupid and then we all look like idiots and and that part of it is important I like the fact that\nYou know Rob Gronkowski a talk about what it said that's just a little bit too crazy apply as us players are out there competing trying to be the best we can out there that's just a little too much I Would say\nThat's a hard thing to do as an athlete call at your own band base or at least one and a person of your own famous but that is important in a situation so that it it's not accepted and\nIt's amazing what are they it just amazes me about is the technology that you can track this guy down I mean one face amongst thousands in that stadium he's not in an assigned seat right it's general mission over there and they're going to find it and you're not going to be allowed\nBack you know you think about they found this quickly but go back to the snowball game remember they found the guy who they had a picture of the newspaper at giant stadium during the snowball games throwing snowballs for trying to find it back then imagine with the technology now how quickly they found this guy in\nThe exactly what happened aid it's embarrassing where they found the guy who through the ah the Kevin pluck your style toy onto the field up in Buffalo and he was banned they find these guys with out of problem now with all the ... with all the technology out there so you know if you want to pay all this money to go to a football game make for yourself or you're an idiot and\n... you know it's going to charges of\nCharges in all ... stadium event not just at concerts or anything and and ... you know how they're gonna find out if they found you there those fate facial recognition software today they'll have no problem finding again if you try to get in\nThere he's reading about what they have a new stadiums as far as a ... it is it's it's far out it really is a eight hundred three two one zero seven than again eight hundred three two one zero seven to end the number or we will\nHave cut it up in the eight o'clock hour Jim Turner of the former jets kicker helped lead them to a Super Bowl title fifty years ago and that team celebrated yesterday halftime and the jets Victor of the Indianapolis Colts sports don't repeat McCarthy on the voice of New York seven ten W O R what kind\nEight hundred three two one zero seven and a and a week six wrapping up tonight Monday Night football or you have the Green Bay Packers going at it tonight and it just happened\nTo see on Twitter the knee brace bad Aaron Rodgers is supporting these days and it is serious rubber week one uh he suffered a knee injury against the Chicago Bears a missed a some place in that game a couple of series and he\nReally hasn't been able to move in the way that we've seen him do in the past it's such a big part of his game is to talk about with my home state stand place to roll out to throw on the run\nAaron Rodgers is the great improper at quarterback of this generation and he's lost some of that ability and it is a bulky brace that he is not now wearing is basically gotten bigger every week\nOr as he goes out there are certainly jumping a affecting the Packers and why they're up and says have been what we expected or do you think tonight shouldn't be as big a factor against the San Francisco forty niners without Jimmy ... below\nAnd the niners just trying to ... they went from a team that was thought to be up and coming just trying to survive a season and keep their slim hopes alive in any way possible but they might be headed to\nA uh adopt by pick once again a there in San Francisco\nOh eight o'clock hour coming up and we will have Jim Turner a former jets kicker of the super bowl champion squad coming up right now in his up to\n'cause there was no real drainage in those days they didn't have a machine reunite the grass and you actually were running down the hill and it worked out to our advantage because we didn't have a practice facility like they have today that was a practice facility will practices Shay every day\nIt gave me an advantage because who wins that game show an advantage because it was brutal it was absolutely brutal at times\nI was reading some of this uh in beyond Broadway Joe which ah for any jets fan is really cool diving into the stories of everybody on that jets team or by Bob letter how when you go about how much work did you put in to figure out how the winds would play at Shea Stadium\nEvery day every day after practice coach who bank was really a good coach where they came to give it a little school coach a you know he's a funny little guy but he he knew every position in what they had to do center guard defensive tackle kicker punter\nBecause in those days you know like an army of coaches now like I think the Broncos have taught to coaches\nAnd the other team to the same we only had\nI'm guessing four or five\n[noise] and they knew the whole game and leaving I stayed out after practice every day [noise] and again it was vantage to practice at game time at Shea Stadium every day and we figured out the windows in that course over time I uh\nSnuck a flag up over there so more so I could really see which way to win was on and we joked about this week\nUh Chris Berman and set it to while he was there that I'm probably the only chicken that's ever been told coach kick it about six yards or it'll curved net it did but we ended up for practice there every day\nWhere was that flag then the stance\nYou know it uh I'd have to go and see but I think it was maybe on a tree or a wire down to you open to the right it was it was really out of sight but it just gave us a chance to see how everything was like hell is steady\nYeah it's the talk of a Jim Turner of the super bowl champion jets honored yesterday at a at MIT lives stadium um when you guys do get together and talk to football maybe this is a simple question buddies narrow when did you guys take the most pride in\nIs it the super bowl that simple\nFact that besides the super bowl [noise] [noise]\nOh yeah it was a beating the raiders and the championship game in the IT game because that gave us a weird to stoke today we talk about this week was the raiders were better than the Baltimore Colts ... and\nWe beat them we don't like the field but I wanted to go into hiding game and we ended up losing the game but it was nose to nose against the raiders on their field and then the championship game we paid him at Shay and then we knew\nHe'll talk quite a bit and I like that I think it's great you're going to talk some trash to your opponent the week before the game still be have at it\nAnd he talked a lot of trash by quarterbacks around the league earlier this year a story for GQ basically went around and judge just about every quarter back in the NFL\nBut after yesterday's game and getting smacked by the cowboys of a sudden Ramsey wasn't much for talking\nTo shock is\n[noise]\nYou wait to get a lot of the things you know how to explain the Simon Sisters really\nSaid that he felt like it was it was an effort issue when you agree with that\n\nBecause usually plays with a lot of sweaters houses when he's having to deal\nSome of the stuff that we\n[noise]\nYou personally I mean the experience like [noise]\n... Mm [laughter]\nBears saying if you're going to and for a guy who talks a lot to not be able to\nPut together anything after a loss I understand you're miserable unhappy about it\nBut if you want to be the kind of guy that's gonna you know talks of trash and builds and things that listen you've got to talk about it afterwards to after you do get your clock cleaned and then you can tell you not happy guy he clearly doesn't have answers\nAh but ah you know you want to be that\nSpotlight player the rare spotlight part it's not a quarter back some of the things that\nYou don't want to be getting embarrassed by uh you know all over the place next day and you know that's ... that's the situation for you jailed Ramsey after that yesterday so uh for the jaguars you know they had the\nBrunt of the championship game last year after being a a laughing stock for a long period of time really big part of that rise what exactly is that team now and you could try to wait on defense ravens one again based on their defense yesterday all ... and the titans and they shut them out\nBut that is the exception generally those great defense is you know takes me so far and you need to be able to back it up with a quarterback passing game back in ...\nAnd ... and that's just the nature of the league you look at a scores of courses you scored thirty points to win games in his league right now the way it is play all the rules favor the up and\nBeing that deep ... Jacksonville even with the great run game wow works great so you don't fourteen nothing and then we do that\nEight hundred three two one zero seven ten eight hundred three two one zero seven ten a well hit some oddities across the sports world when we come back sports don't people cart behind the voice of New York's ...

clean routes getting himself up and he has had so productive games this year and wouldn't seem to fall on the back of junior why this giant shop and just hasn't been nearly good enough\nAnd it's been the case for a long time for big blue\nAnd it's not a Becker the mayor yeah I've got a leader is failing or maybe he's trying to figure things out as he goes along but they didn't do himself any favors this past week didn't do the giants any favors this past week\nBut if you're a beep was oh they'll going public with some of those things you're the owners of the tone for the whole organization\nWhy are you doing that without outback of junior here to get his the giants trying to heal this thing put it behind them\nIt it kicks up again I'm not saying that an owner as to hide or don't answer the questions but you don't have to verbally ...\nOr take a little shot at ... junior as a part of it now you know a lot of the rest of what John ... said I thought was fair I as far as Eli Manning goes and he has clearly been an issue for this giant steam ... felt it's not all on his quarterback\nA bunch of big right now with a lot of guys\nThe quarterbacks always going to get a ton of the credit when things go well tons of blame\nA when things aren't but with Eli Manning right now and clearly\nHis lack of mobility has been a huge problem for this Giants' team and you could blame the office of line until you're blue in the face watch some of these other quarterbacks in the league they don't have\nGreat confidence of wines day of I'll betcha blinds are very similar to what the giants are worse than what the giants are putting out there right now you watch Russell Wilson over the years\nThey don't have anybody came and block in Seattle and he's instantaneously running all over the place like friend targets in\nAnd has to create a play\nWatching this Sunday night game where the deep I just couldn't stop anybody between the patriots and the shapes when the whole lot of pressure on Tom Brady\nBut he can slide around just enough in the pocket in order to make a play that's a better coached opposites of line up in New England and it does show\nBut Patrick my homes and he's a guy who is able to escape breaks and tackles get out of the pocket you can't just stand there like a statue and expect you're going to be fine in quarterbacking a twenty Eighteen you got to be able to extend some place and it doesn't have to be much we're not talking about\nMichael Vick circa Fifteen Years ago with the Atlanta Falcons we're talking about just being able to do enough\nTo extend to play to get that extra half second and make a throw in Eli Manning cannot do those things as soon as he is brains done he's going down and he has no ability to escape and that is a huge problem\nUp for this giant job and might not all be on the line manning of course it's a team sport there's a lot of other people that are involved on the defensive lineman half to get past somebody to get to Eli Manning but that is a bigger problem is there is right now and consider the giants went out this shot season\nThat got the left tackle they drafted a guard they added a big time running back to try to give the line manning uh play action threat they did everything they could to make life easier\nOn the line manning to push up that quarterback position\nAnd it hasn't worked\nAnd that's really the key constant and the giants not just last year this year but over the last few seasons where they stop and has been underwhelming ... and as for the big picture ... barest last year what about this season\nUp your\nBill parcell blind but the owners saying he's embarrassed again change the coach changed the often\nPuts the pieces around and still an embarrassing performance one in five of these New York giants and that's coming straight from the top and that that should be a shot at the team here I think that's the kind of shot that you want to take if you're the owner that everybody but\nUp over the course of bases none of the elite level but that'll hold his own defensively a deposition\nAnd so you know we can put up numbers you know the guys talented as heck but sometimes you find out a little bit more when you start watching how these guys playing watching them every day or and for Machado\nHe's not helping himself out and it's not just the lack of hostile on a couple places that you notice when you watch him every day but his comments afterwards and this was before last night's game game three that can Rosenthal of the athletic\nWe'll give you the full comments are a little bit later but part of them\nObviously I'm not going to change I'm not the type of player that it's going to be Johnny hustle and run down the line and fly to first base and you know whatever it can happen that's just not my personality that's not my cup of tea that's not who I Am\nIf you're going to give a guy three four hundred million dollars wherever it is maybe ... I absolutely deserving of that if you look at the baseball reference page if you look at the production that he brings to the table but ask yourself\nIs there more to being a franchise player and your undoubtedly a franchise player abuse sign that kind of deal you set the tone for everybody else on that T there's leadership component to that even if that\nIs a naturally who you are as a raw raw guy you at the very least to have to be able to lead by example because everybody's looking at you the whole time your teammates the fans managers every you are where everybody's eyes are going to go\nAnd to\nHave consciousness of it as many chatted does and expresses in this interview but also\nKnown himself well enough to know that he's not going to hustle all the time that he's not capable that he can't do that [laughter] that is a little bit of a warning and now both of the\nTop superstar free agents position player was this off season\nHave those question marks hanging over their heads and it's something that the Dodgers didn't go deep into the postseason many Machado but it is different when everybody gets to lay eyes on somebody and you're not just looking at the numbers being done for some mostly poor teams in Baltimore now\nYou are in the spotlight day in day out postseason run for the Dodgers and people start to notice some of those other things a little bit more and that should matter\nIt shouldn't matter the I test has something to say and I I Love analytics to look at the stats that I think that's all important and you can glean a a lot of information and I'm not saying you don't sign that image out on the matter what\nI'm just saying you got to consider these things before you're going to make that guy not only the highest paid player on your team\nBut he becomes the leader the face of your franchise and what he does he's going to be something that's gonna trickle down throughout your team brought your farm system everybody in the organization is going to take their cue from that guy\nAnd his ... somebody that can change\nWell he's telling you now\nSaid obviously I'm not going to change well he's hopeful at some point it clicks for him\nBut to me that is something that has to be a a red flag and it doesn't matter if you're talking about production and the baseball reference page he's worth all those dollars but there's a lot more that goes into being\nThat superstar absolutely next level guy he's not even that guy in LA\nBut wherever he signs and has that big deal he'll become that guy maybe it is in LA he'll have a different stature and that ... percent and that kind of contract them before\nAnd the other player is the U.S money grand doll we talked about a lot I think the Mets I'd like to see him go out and get a catcher to add to Kevin ... somebody who could share the time and ...\nHaving a real rough Kobe's been a disaster for him a those far this postseason past balls wild pitches another one last night I hasn't\nCome up big in any kind of spot me last night ... walks at the end of that game with Jeremy Jeffress on the mound and Jeffers has been shaky over the course of this post season\nAnd the bottom and the Dodgers lineup is unable to take advantage of it and you\nKnow grand don't it it seems when they have had opportunities ah he has been failing he's the guy up next after ... is begging Jeremy ... strike in motion a\nAnd then stairs down Jeffress the pitcher would he takes the walk at first base open but guess what Jeffress he knows what he's going after it goes right after ... Grand Isle gets amount the booze come down and then grand doll after the game\nIt's driving you guys nuts more than it's driving me nuts it's guys know their free agents in what was coming up right or will do more baseball Anthony Karen ass and why in the seven o'clock hour he'll be here in Studio I'll look forward Avon Phil Simms a you know show time CBS Sports\nOf course legendary giants quarterback he'll joined when we come back sports don't repeat McCarthy on the voice of New York seven ten W O R fine stores [noise]\nThe W O R sports when they look Ari [noise]\nKind of set for next gas now you know for CBS Sports show times inside the NFL and of course is a two time Super Bowl champs with the New York giants quarterback it is Phil Simms and felt great to have your board how are you\n[noise] eat a good to talk to you and a good time of day I'm trying to unwind a little bit you know how that is a it's a maybe it was a little more football before called ... and I'm Glad I actually this is not a gay much so because if it was I watch it so it's good so it would they be able to do\nYeah everything's great over here and get the relaxing night show I watch um baseball mix it up you know something a subject tonight but [laughter]\nNot so much out\nYou don't want habits and even though there was a baseball game I saw a few minutes ago 'cause that's you know football season truly is showing cop a seizure and sell lots to follow thirty two teams of everything that you just go wild are just so so maybe I'll also that I was little baseball player\nAlright yeah just give me some ideas yeah there's lots of stuff ah [laughter]\nHow about the fact before we get into the giants you're just one trend that as jumped out to me scoring up five points per game or in the NFL why has it jumped do you think in the way that it has and are these past the games have seemed at times unstoppable\n[noise] well they we we see we see you know huge differences were one team of scorned forty and then we got another game where they're trying to get the chance to win and it just there there are some really good ... or you're going to have a hard time putting up twenty points on them no matter what you do\nBut ... yes overall all fences and coaches just many things the athletes they're finding guys do specialty things for all fences there of course being more creative uh and and they're more daring with their play call and you're not being so\nPredictable I think that's the big the biggest thing to be a good place Cornell you got to be one step ahead of what the other team is thank you so always do almost the opposite of what you think they're thinking which says she thinks that they always did that but they didn't [noise] and um you know who thought the patriots\nMonday Night or going to come out and lined up an ice formation like it was Nineteen Seventy five and high school and just run the ball and have a great day for the football nobody in the lead does\nBut the patriots do it against the cheese ... which I now realize for many reasons because Patrick holds plays one of his worst games of the year baby is worse and it's still put up forty points so that's why the patriots were in a lot of ... topic is just a slow the pace of the game down\nYeah at least a real bad first half or from homes and then he was laying in it in that second happen and one thing I noticed watching that game\nA Monday Night it and maybe Brady is a fair comparison at this point but come on homes he could roll out he could swap defenders he could create that extra time to make a play and as we get into the giants here\nAre and you know a lot of talk about the lie manning and we know he's not mobile buddies they're more that manning could do even with some of the strongest is armpits of line has or that the coaching staff can do to try to get this passing game going the way that it's capable\n[noise] well you know look I talked to a lot about it and I'm getting a lot of giant ants come up to me while you're being so critical of the giants cycle you know my God I'm not everybody's saying it and it's evidence so are you know I'm\nTelling you what I see I watch all their games I watch among coaches tape to I hate to say that but I just do that's what I Do and they're they're doing everything they\nTo our core set of plays and now it's about making plays and then the forty niners couldn't do it so that where if you're good quarterback or not and let's say and see it gets to take out there but yeah you get that same situation to the top Fifteen ...\nThey're going to make some plays either moving great throw or do something that kind of changed the rhythm of the game\nMade me watching Rogers last night on one leg just a flinging around and it's like there was no doubt he was going to walk down the field\nWell you know listen I I really I said just the boomers size that they've already taping Showtime at your job over I really believe he likes short all ballots war\nThing does that what he sets up and really kind of gets everything into it because when he solved ballot he has a believable touch with the football and those two throws down the left side line\nAt the end of the game does work for ... minutes out and he was actually falling back\nOn one foot Mica fade away jumpers yeah and it\nBut it was the philosophy yeah fade away jumper great example the velocity of the football\nThe absolute perfect spiral and the perfect spot where you couldn't miss it and and um\nI didn't sit there and go oh my God I Can't believe this because I'm like you I'm a fan\nAnd I go well Rogers all the penalty and Richard Sherman ... [laughter] you know the forty niners ...\nHe's going to make it happen and it's I think I heard it today\nOr read it he's told Islam and in the hall last or go to rush for a little move around them all make something happen to\nGet there [laughter] and just you know that's all I can say is that's a different game that I remember\n[laughter] no doubt that ... and the guy's got a huge price on his left leg and he still are making plays with oh\nYeah he's still you know see that's a great example\nHim there's Tom Brady is going to be forty water is he I don't know it doesn't matter\nBut do you watch his feet when he plays\nIn it that's what I always talk about\nThen you know after all was a lot of quarterbacks peep during the summer at every level pros college high school grade school but I'm always talking about you've gotta have that pop into your feet that ... just to shuffle from\nYou know behind the center to get behind the guard real quick keep body type and then make the throw that's what the game is to get out of pocket like pets are more homes who I said it's not like\nSuper fast but to be able to be on the run and make throws ... that's what the league has turned into and we're going to see more and more quarterbacks like that\nThat's why I like Baker Mayfield and Sam Donald more than I did Josh ... who's more of the very traditional get it in a pot is give them a little time he'll make to throw\nIn last thing he is moving around a little more with the cardinals\nProbably to save his life that he did at UCLA when he was staying in the pocket and wait wait wait for the thing that happened but he was such a great story he got away with that\nSo they bring a full circle and and quickly here with Eli or maybe not so much even the him now but when he was coming out the kind of quarterback that he's been throughout his career have we reached a point where that\nKind of quarterback the the straight up pockets statue quarterback just is going to have a hard time surviving in today's NFL\nWell you know it's not even that I I don't even see like any of those guys coming out that I look at I watched try to kinda see who's coming out and everybody I've looked at alike and all that\nThey have one thing in common that you really control it you know they got all the other things and they can move and it just it it's ... there's too much\nGoing on and off and send there's too many places to be had by having a quarter back to a little just a little and again you don't have to be fast uh we've we've seen it Baker Mayfield ran off for a five to forty\nArmy and faster than at ... ... you know uh so that does it it just it's about great footwork yeah being having that bounce just to get out of trouble do\nThose things but there's no question oh you you you don't see those pure dropped back pastors anyway in college very much very few teams and the whole country I've won so what are you going to choose\nFrom when they come to the NFL you're going to find a garbage can move mhm who's got you'd love even half decent size but of course you want him to be a great parents are also\n... great stop and uh I Know you're busy man is you're busy season they enjoy the rest of your Tuesday nights in debt thanks so much\nThe you know what you talked me into it and we'll watch a little baseball [laughter]\nI Want to take a break for football but listening to talk to you thanks for having me\nBack so much fella Phil Simms CBS Sports Showtime inside the NFL a terrific giants quarterback and I'm reading I'm breaking down in just a ... I Believe that balance that their quarterback needs and you can picture in your mind right and it is\nOr something that you know again when we talk about he lie manning you don't get that same field there there is no balance or they're at this point it thirty seven whereas you know it's not just age ... you look at some other quarterbacks in the league\nThey had that they had that quickness and and the quickest to throw and and that's a you know something that you absolutely need to have in uh in today's game\nAh overlooked part of Anthony ... and that's why in Studio ... seven o'clock I'll be talking a lot of baseball's Mets news today as\nA they uh make it official with the AAA Syracuse and a much much more there of course getting into these playoff games all that's happened in a eight hundred three two one zero seven tend the number is well it's the sports don't repeat McCarthy on the voice of New York seven ten W O R\nWe're back in the W O R sports when\nThey start with Phil Simms or last segment and are you on any kind of silver lining if that's possible and the giants either one in five\nI gave you a little bit of it with the fact that falcons even just been terrible and ah the schedule lighten up a bit for the giants here but they have some core issues and a lack of identity is Phil said that\nUh they have to work their way through and this is not a whole lot of time to be doing that when you already have five lost his on the season\nI Will be getting into baseball and the seven o'clock hour a quick update what's happened the AOL see as the red Sox where the two one laid on the Astros in the top of the fifth inning or that series of course tied at one game three to nine and then the only game for brewers Dodgers\nUh later on tonight that game starting after nine o'clock eight hundred three two one zero seven ten and data Karen ... y and Z duty on when we come back sports don't repeat McCarthy right now and it's up to\nNew York [laughter] view rated number one seven\nTen W O o voice of New York and high\nThe kind of franchises that you really want to try to emulate and so many of those candidates have seemingly rejected even an interview with the ...\nYeah yeah and that's you know there's a lot of reporting to that effect and that you know I mean I Would think that the the Mets are struggling with that right now and and what to do about it because it should be a plum job\nYou know we're talking about the New York Mets were talking about New York city we're talking about\nUh you know a a franchise that there's tons of potential here\nI mean if you're you want to be a GM of the team and you have a chance to take over that rotation with those gems in there I mean that's not a you know there's some fixing to do with that team obviously huge fixing and medicate and in many areas\nBut I you know there's still a lot there and uh you you know you're right I mean and I wonder you know the perception is certainly out there in public that there is a divide\nAmongst the power brokers there you know about what kind of GM's to have I don't know if that's affecting the search or not but if they maybe if they sort of had a clear idea or if they made the industry think that they had in their idea these kinds of things you know we wouldn't have these kinds of reports and they would be moving along without that kind of thing going on sort of swirling around it\nIs this a moment where ownership kind of has the look in the mirror a little bit when it's not even the public\nPerception necessary but it's the industry perception now I mean this is proof positive it's not just people you know ... it is\nNow the people within the game that have a hesitation people I grew up Mets fans maybe or from the area a lot of Ivy League educated people that New York ... very attractive to and you know worried about these kinds of issues\nYeah I mean look at you know they're going to have to clean all of it up and they're going to have to make the right call here too because whoever takes this job\nOr you know we I just alluded to it but there's ... there's significant work to be done the bullpen has to be repaired or you know they need to figure out the catching situation um they do have some some prizes in the starting pitching\nBut you know there's there's work to be done and getting the right guy and getting the right philosophy you know there's also some navigating\nDo a you know because we we had the the the end of the year Jeff willpower press conference where he said you know it's up to the new guy who comes in the new person who comes in a who stays and who goes\nYou know coming from ownership we want this guy to say that guy to say this one this one this one so you know there is that out there and I wonder if some of these candidates have looked at that and said oh\nWhat does that mean yeah and what does that mean if I take the job at you know but now you know that being said the the ... there are some names on that list\nOr I covered ... when she was the uh assistant general manager of the Yankees\nUh that that's a while ago now and she's had several other job since then including with the Dodgers and in major league baseball obviously she's exceptionally bright\nAnd she would make a great GM and it would be amazing if if she were to get that job she's also apparently been contacted 'em this is from media reports but she's been contacted about the Orioles job uh she's been contacted about the giants job\nSo you know there's some irony in the fire there and uh you know but I I always thought she was exceptionally bright exceptionally well thought out in the industry and uh you know I mean might be the right person at the right time\nI don't know much about Kim uh but I Know she's been working for major league baseball for quite some time now you know exactly what she's been doing it cause it to me\nI you'd rather have someone who's been involved in team building and an act of knowing everything that's going on within the game and maybe she's been more involved with that then um you you might think work at the end all be officers\nWhile she has tons of experience in that kind of ... though with um when she had her tenure at the Yankees she was a prank attachments assistant\nA for a while then she worked for the Dodgers in the same capacity so she has all the team building experience necessary I think you know she's been deeply involved in arbitration cases of it certainly for the Yankees I recall and I mean this is going back I I don't want to show my age your paper but this is going back a long time ago Mariano Rivera\nA there was a great arbitration case against him where she successfully argued she she she yeah she beat most she'd be most agents and already was there to take the beating to any any certainly on the bottom line did as well but uh\nBut yes uh she you know the the the Yankees had a great argument um because I think if I remember correctly the ah his agents most agents constructed a case based on\nHow he was every bit as a central to the Yankees and every bit as popular\nAs Derek Jeter was one of course you know that you can debate that all you want but that the Yankees debated in this way by using some like Internet hits and uh you know ... a Jersey sold that kind of stopped proving that ... was worth more in arbitration then mall and the arbitrator agreed and Kim was a big part of that case so\nAnybody who can beat Mao is okay my out you know it's it's not met Franco David right now ...\nRight exactly so you know she has got a lot in the bank already and you know I mean the working in the game and the and the and they'll be a central office is you know you're dealing with the clubs all the time too and that you know that the different procedures and and you know waivers and a roster moves and all that stuff is she she's perfectly capable of any of that\nStuff to be fair to any ... came from a similar situation ... oh yeah yeah they actually came on the office right it's all part\nOf the education and the growth of a baseball executive\nUh eight hundred three two one zero seven tend to number we can mix it to a baseball calls with Anthony McCarron a boy and ask you about mainly Machado those comments that can Rosenthal the athletic yesterday basically is who I Am a I don't always hostile as well as ... ... and how much he has struggled and he's a guy that was\nNear the top of my list of who I thought they meant to be going after they saw the ... and a lot will hit those when we come back as the sports
