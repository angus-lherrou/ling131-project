{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "On a six until that point but we are joined by happening McCarron of apps and why in Studio ... night\nAnd as far as the series and the way that they have played out at one of the trends are big this postseason has been a complete non reliance on starting pitcher yeah that is something that uh like the atmosphere\nOr the attitude about ... or whatever it might be it is changed drastically and such a short period of time we're short adjusted for lenders to geared colds you're still going to ride those guys\nBut otherwise you started out after like four innings and that's all right and that's the strategy or really the way that these guys are planning it going into the game which is a ... it's jarring Lee different\nYeah and and I and I you you see at least on social media that ah it's a starter is in there\nAnd the third time through the lineup is coming up it's like almost you can you can count down to the tweets you know as the top of the order comes up for the you know approaches for the third time through the tweet to start he's got to get them out of there are more in the third time he's got what what is he doing leaving them in there and ah you know I felt bad yo sure absolutely still\nTook out whatsoever Reno and move forward through right at the around the same time but it was lonely and also those ... right\nI Wonder now that we're in the seven game series what sort of effect and how these managers will deploy their relievers if it changes at all because\nYes there are all these days off during October and it's great because you know there's this forest rest that you get a benefit up but I mean can they really lasted series go seven games and you're working your bullpen that hard I mean that's something that will sort of uncharted territory now when we dropped the innings by starters to the level that we have\nYou know you saw when I I mean to me and and maybe I'm wrong about this but to me that this the sort of reliance on the fire men in the middle innings the threatening middle innings\nSort of exploded when Andrew Miller was doing it in sixteen for the Indians and everybody was like wow that's great you know he can do it you know he's got the stuff and he can last that long and pitch enough to get you through those tough times and he can come in with one out in the fourth ending and the bases loaded and get you out of there and then give you two mornings and\nYou know so now that that like every start is supposed to be four plus innings or five innings at the most before you get them out of their ... how is that going to affect the ... you know the relief pitching and the and the bullpen has a whole and Andrew Miller hasn't exactly been the picture of health\nSince then I'm not blaming that as the thing that caused it it's just another thing to think about\nYou know but to me\nYou don't want to grind a guy maybe over one sixty two but when you get to October ... yeah you got to be a ... I think even the player in the mobile would tell you this is going to cost\nMe a year and a half my career and along those lines oh yeah yeah well I don't think he'll drive project I don't think another regrets it I just wonder if in these series yeah will they be able to be effective\nWho do you like it as we've seen some of these series play out here\nWell I mean let's take the ... first I've been wrong about the red Sox all year I thought I thought the Yankees were significantly better than them and then when even after they had a hundred and eight wins worth of evidence that they were not worse than the Yankees I thought that the Yankees would beat them in a short series and obviously wrong about that\nI Do think the Astros are going to beat them this time I could go over three here on on Red Sox are anti Red Sox productions\nUh I think the ... the Astros are remarkable team with unbelievable talent and if you just look to me something that's that's struck me uh when I saw who they left off\nThe roster I think it was in the division series off of their bullpen and it was like wow that goes on on the roster that guys on the roster either the guys and this ... and ah you know so they have a they have\nConstructed an incredibly deep broadly talented or from one to twenty five on that roster it's it's a great thing to see they had the tank to get some of those guys there let's be fair and let's be clear but now they are some product\nYou know there are loaded yeah got thirty seconds you like them to win the world series title I do like the way we ever wins that series is going to win the world series the elite theories yeah the ales just far better I think so and I think the Dodgers are ... are going\nTo outlast the brewers eventually it may not be easy and I think they're both both going to go the limit but uh I I mean that's all good for us if you like baseball though\nMost ticket by your guns back a Dodgers down to one in that series going into\nGame for tonight but added we carried a tremendous avenue in Studio ... we're so appreciative of you are coming by into everybody check out a baseball ...

they're changing pictures in between ... to the game actually started to get some flow again because the eighth through ... or so\nAnd then there's a pinch runner up in cheddar and it's just an absolute chess match is both of these teams deployed their entire benches slows down the action which is what you don't always love about it as a fan but at the brewers taking it to the absolute next level today\nAnd I think you know that there is a conversation to be had what's\nThe line between what is good for\nThe fan watching the game what they want to see expect to see and what is worthwhile to try to win a game winning series at all costs will\nWant our team to go all in ... and try to have your ... and you want them doing those smart things that give them a little bit of an edge but if you're up a Mets fan right now let's say and you're just watching the game for entertainment\nSake it entertaining to see the jihad\nAnd managers become stars rather than the players themselves and that is so much of what you have\nWith the direction that this is all going and this is just the tip of the iceberg ... now that the brewers have done it\nAnd they are essentially both painting their way through the post season they're doing it with smoke and mirrors and their starting pitching staff there doing it with the bullpen a and a good one but not necessarily a great on a particularly deep one\nUh but they are having success with it and I just uh I Wonder you know how how this is all gonna end up for baseball because I I Do think that a lot of fans get frustrated and noise by this and turned off by it\nAnd they want to see the players they want to see the players be the stars not a five hour Fifteen minute think fast\nOr like we had last night of course I did have some tempers flaring last night as well or to the degree that Christian yell at you last night went in on many Machado after Machado ran into the leg of brewers first baseman ages Aguilar while he was crossing the back everyone\nLawyer that has a history [noise]\nThose types of this one time and actually [laughter]\nOh you're just a very dirty play by play\nWe've always rounded up run through the\nDon't yell at you this goes back for him not just a one time incident when it comes demanding Machado but keep in mind Christian yellow she's probably going to be the envy the national league this year this couch bona fide coming out and calling the star player on the opposing team\nA dirty player and then as he left the media was walking away within earshot of some reporters including the New York post my poma\nFit at ... am effort or so clearly he's got some ... about what happened last night and Aguilar wasn't hurt it appeared Aguilar Machado made up gave each other a little hug or at first base but\nUh there are still some hostility about that afterwards and it's more about the big picture I think as we talk about it here with many Machado as\nOver the last couple of days we've learned a little bit about this guy right uh and it's more than just as baseball reference page it's more than just the whole runs the ... the production that he brings to the table because he is one of the best players most talented players\nIn all major league baseball but if you are going to make them your franchise star and that's what it's going to take when you're given a three hundred million dollars you want to know exactly what you're getting and\nGetting into civil fire storms maybe it's not the end of the world but one thing we have seen from Machado beyond him telling can Rosenthal bat\nHe uh doesn't have a date him to hustle you doesn't know why does it looks bad but he basically he is what he is in\nAnd kind of crazy ... really is like I mean there's there's no gentleman a no no no uh on her amongst gentlemen and baseball him\nOr her on her my themes that these the in the front office guys and that's an interesting way to put up with the gentleman's game and\nYeah I Know someone like me like I'm a nerd like over thinking things and I I'm okay with that but I can understand if ... if somebody's getting home from work they want to relax watch baseball game and they said they're scratching your head trying to figure out what the heck is going on\nYeah I think we've got doing a good job of explaining what's going on but at the same time it's just the fact that having to do it and you know I just it's the first time I've ever seen in my life when I when I start happening I'm just kind of like did he get hurt or\nYou know what happened but it's again everything is so strategic now and you know having those wealthy why didn't match ups or that it's so funny I look back at all the left or right in that up and you know a lot of times in my career I'll pitch it\nAnd I would get taken off the left the you look back over my career I'll have to ... to the other games righty throughout my whole career\nAnd you you might not get the opportunity to do that if you came up at the ACLU had a different time we we see that you know with the ... the major league level\nA brand new ... and an opportunity to face ... Michael could for do because they were short on outfielders and the guy shut that can actually hit the south pause how much of it is\nGetting those wraps and not having it be and something that you're told well you can't do this and um you know at least ... having to become a mental thing I suppose\nI Love him and gets left for me to help get me a lot and they can try to get a lefty I had to do everything right I had to make sure the my shoulder and after the ... that led the ball travel and get a little bit deeper sucking handle it so it actually got my piling better call it the other writers that I was facing a lump hitting that's left is\nWhen we're talking again with Marlene Anderson format right now spent this past year as the head coach uh with the Brooklyn psych loans\nAnd we'll get into that in a little bit how about the play last night Marlin between ... and ... Aguilar a Aguilar I guess he has his fought over an extra piece of the bag than you normally would see him Machado clearly went out of his way to kick his leg as he was running by\nAnd the players we've seen come up through the system maybe if you saw enough of him and the Mets uniform this year to you know have had to take on a what you think of him\nBut I think is a guy you can get you know bottom line is concerned about it he's got great coordination of barrels of all\nThat's the kind of guy you know so you can teach the fundamental to what you can't really teach you gotta and shit like that um they will put up numbers you can sit in it you know gets everybody big league pitch a\nDoes the counting guys you want to kind of people around you know see the glass a little bit smaller hopefully he'll be able to you know this is Joe ...\nGet a little bit better and you'll be able to play in the middle and still you know that's the only thing you're worried about but it was very impressed with what I saw it you know I spent all the time allow them in spring training in a life the fact that he's just he's gone the love the Aspen loved it on a baseball field I think all of this past or injury History Channel where\nPeople for a little bit a he's a guy that you hear the guy that you just have to take advantage just as long as you can also get it so\nWe just start saying that novel is bad everywhere now I Hope not [laughter]\nSo close to eight I have now is that that was one of the things that are about ... what\nThe heck is this how about you\nBut now that you know the ... that's an old school if they do a lot of some of the guys I'm back in the day if I'm not mistaken I think Larry bowl is one of those ... you know here's my manager he's talked about the novel is that back in the day so\nIt sounds like you've got the coach and bug or you are you hoping the sec\n[noise] oh yeah I'll I'll you know now that I'm On my door to the caller's give the\nKind of on their own thing now and you know I'm a baseball fan but it it's a lot of the fact that getting back on the field and been a part of ... your family yeah yeah that's the thing that I like about it and you're able to mentor kids kind of became a baseball one kind of these guys out to be professional you know ...\nUh baseball and ... and all this stuff is great and all up in the middle east for twelve years and if your career but you're still had a chance to load than God does because you've got to spend more time and live outside of baseball than you are in the in the end of this fall\nAnd there's no doubt that anybody or to teach these guys in young kids had to be a professional it is\nYou what you were able to accomplish over the course of your career and [noise] and afterwards and congrats or again now the college degree and uh we really appreciate the time Arlen best of luck going forward\nAnd he found the land thanks what's called she called let me come over here and speak to you\nYeah now as great a Marlon Anderson a former Matt and a former Dodger as well or if you remember September of oh sex and he went off a for\nThe Dodgers down the stretch that year uh and uh you know he's got ties to some different teams organizations but a good to you know the right kind of guy you want to have in the fold\nAs far as the New York Mets are concerned with that quite frankly take some calls coming up eight hundred three two one zero seven than can be a real quick next season preview and then\nUh we will have Eric bowl into Newsday was covering the Arabs see as a joining us at the top of the hour it's the sports don't repeat McCarthy on the voice of New York ... W O war today\nI'll get back to baseball I'll see as their phones have Newsday will join us from Houston coming up at seven oh five and then we'll actually be carrying a bat game I hear on W O R pregame coverage beginning at seven thirty uh but as far as\nThe New York Knicks go as they open up their sees it tonight it against the Atlanta Hawks on one hand it's an opening day another sport to look forward to and if you're a giants fan that dream has sale the Yankees are done baseball's done around here\nUm so it gets something else to get excited for but it's it's kinda like the old Family Guy bit with the Mets where it's going to be tip off than the season is over because it's just the nature of the NBA\nFor one point is that there's only a handful and handfuls being generous of teams there even capable of winning the championship and then the next and they are in this process of developing some young players trying to put together a core\nAnd attracting a star free agent to come to New York and the next of course would be beginning the season without their courage dark ... as well as it will take him some time to get back from surgery this past offseason a but for the next year yeah it's a new coach David face Dale\nIt's about building um but that's not necessarily get a breakthrough when there's a lot of stuff to do in New York a lot of other sports to follow a boat I find interesting is the NBA is a whole\nThere are three\nTeams that have a realistic shot of winning the finals can we go to five maybe I'll give you five but the warriors there's such a favorite that if you put a hundred dollars on them and Vegas you don't even get a hundred back [laughter]\nI liked his winnings and that's how much of a favorite the Golden State warriors are going into this season and that was the case of last year as well I guess how that ended they won the championship and to have a sport\nThat is one that ... rewards the best team\nIn the way the basketball does because that doesn't happen baseball the best team is not always reward you only when two thirds of your games in the regular season and then in the finals or in the playoffs anything can happen in the NBA the best team wins close to Ninety percent of their games\n\nOr at least those historically great teams suing the warriors put together this dream team outfit with Kevin Durant are joining the crew\nA it is\nAlmost a done deal something terrible has the habit of injuries I mean stuff you can't even imagine it in order for them not to be that team\nAnd I wonder I actually think it is better for the sport\nBecause with all sports and with all the ... you have to windows into enjoying it one is through your team in rooted for your team to win now for the NBA for about twenty six franchises\nThat there are going into the season it for the next it's what it's for them and you know even tricking yourself into thinking they're going to make the playoffs this year but\nThere's also the ability to follow the game nationally and no sport has been growing more nationally than the NBA and a lotta people credit to social media and and the players have more personalities and that's all certainly a part of it but I think one thing that does help\nIf you're an NBA fan and you want to know what's going on even if you're not even for casual you will know what is going on with the teams that matter and their seasons will be the soap opera that your favorite baseball team is if you watch and listen to their games every single day you know\nWhen the warriors have a loss and how they're going to respond because they become a hyper localized almost even as a national team\nYou know what's going on in LeBron's sees it every year when he sits out a game because he needs the rest are you going to know the key injuries on those teams and the personalities involved in how and extend even beyond\nThe star players because when you do watch those teams are good to be rewarded you're going to say\nA a great shot from Steph Curry a drive to from LeBron James you're generally going to see their teams win as well which isn't the case and other sports and I think\nUh as frustrating as it often 'cause your team doesn't have a chance it works for the sport as a whole and the warriors you love them you hate him but you care\nAnd you tend to watch more than you do say the Boston Red Sox cigarettes tucked into them and the Arabs see as it gets the Astros coming up stealing signs all this trickery spy stuff going on in major league baseball get the story from Eric bowling the Newsday right now in his up to\nBecause ah any team that's accused of doing stuff like this uh it's always what we do things the right way to the other teams that we have to protect ourselves\nDrunk a ... and we say that the obviously across the board I'm not singling out the Astros in this respect as though\nThe Astros don't have the best reputation in major league baseball I was texting well what it was some executives from other teams today and in one one guy texted back to me and said that it that this is the least surprising controversy and it'll be history considering the organization\nNow so the ... there are no victims here as we chat with their goal end of Newsday so it correct me about gay details wrong here but it was a gentleman by the name of Kyle mclachlan he's hanging out in the\nUh in the photo photographers well and basically he's using his phone to record a certain things that they're happening out there how do we know more about who he is because as far as that\nLast night he wasn't quite a member of the organization\nNo he he was a a is Jeff ... now again the ... general manager when he was talking about it\nA couple of hours ago here at the ballpark a described him as a a still in college\nA student who was an intern with the organization um and so he didn't really shut too much or more light on it than that but then he criticized the Yahoo a new order pretty extensive piece on it the late last night uh for\nPosting his picture instead of you are going to post anyone's picture post mind and and you know the response to that as well if you were the one who is standing somewhere in a camera well with\nA credential that doesn't allow you to be in the camera well and you are the ones that keep pictures than\nThe media probably would have posted a picture of you um so you know ... and the guy had no business being in a camera well know however you want to parse this one a big I shouldn't have been there a he's not a photographer or that's what the camera well is there for\nA year and he was actually thrown out before or during excuse the game three of the division series against the Indian two different times by Indian security was asked to leave and finally did and and something similar happened in Boston in game one uh you know did it impact winning or losing\nNo probably not but um it it's one of those things look it's a topic that's not going anywhere because the technology is continuing to develop a and it's a ... you know ha inch when he was asked about it before the game deflected a somewhat in of course the higher ups never know anything about any of this stuff\nUm but ah and I and I say that with all\nAh do sarcasm but the one thing he said that I certainly agree with a hundred percent is that uh this is bigger than us this is bigger than you know any one team and he's absolutely right about that because it is a league wide problem and and the commissioner's office is going to have to address it in some way shape or form\nI remember we just ended a telescope you know [laughter]\nAnd it has been paid in ... and you you hit on something a and Lou now at mentioned it today again a this has been a part of baseball for as long as the sports spent around\nYeah well you get further away from it it's like it's pretty clever medical telescope all light system and uh there was a tricky giants are back in fifty one but it's still it's cheating at the ... bowl into of Newsday right now how about the red Sox they shrunk all this stuff off\nOh absolutely yeah I mean it it's it's all you know like ... it's one of those things where look like I said the red Sox got fined for doing sharing that was against the rules last year or ... with the at the apple watch and the dog out so\nUm and and it's not clear exactly what advantage they gained from its so every team is trying to gain an edge along the margin that they\nThey the margin between winning and losing so slim and anything that a team can do to uh to swing the advantage in their favor or they're going to do even if it's kind of a gray area or even an area that's not so great I'm so\nI'm you know the technology is there it's being used for a lot of good things that have aided the game and then it's certainly been used for some you know let's just say more a borderline nefarious\nWay why [noise] and I'll be closed the case on the Astros eyes
