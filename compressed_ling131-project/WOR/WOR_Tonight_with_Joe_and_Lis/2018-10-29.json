take those kinds of risks have a different approach and\nYou hope it works out you know we saw we've seen with the Golden State warriors they hired a player agent to be their general manager worked out in a big way of course you already had stepped Korean house so that helps out a little bit\nOf a Brody bandwagon and ... it's not as if the Mets cupboard is bear here are the\nMinor league system has improved over the last year a Jacobs ...\nHas solidified itself as a true ace in the sport and near a number of other a piece is that the Mets did see emerge over the course of the second half of the season so you know what exactly well the challenge be upper Brody bandwagon well plus he's only got to worry about the Mets\nWell how about saving New York sports here it has been a brutal stretch\nDo you know it is possible to be a fan of all New York sports teams\nAnd have gone\nA hundred and twenty eight seasons plate without seeing a championship team if you're a fan\nAnd and this isn't even that oddball a combo in fact it's my combination Mets jets islanders mix on Long Island group new school teams if those your teams you haven't seen it seemed when a championship since the Nineteen\nEighty six myths as a hundred and twenty six championships that have been awarded since\nYour last saw one when you don't have the cops had a long drought at least the cubs fans mad Michael Jordan in the winter it's not as if they never had anything they had my dad go for a while there with the bears\nThey weren't bereft of anything and for that group of fan not only do your team's not when you see your top rivals both in the town\nLike\nThe Yankees won a bunch the giants the rangers have one and it's been a while for them to you've\nAlso seen in the city rivals Boston now heads on Lebanon titles since two thousand unless you're in New York I mean as a whole with six extra teams with extra teens about five extra teens\nSix titles\nAnd that includes the two thousand Yankees and the devils won that year as well and you can basically locked them off or to Boston has gone on this insane run here\nIt is unbelievable how terrible stretch this has been overall for New York sports ... and again if you are\nIn that group in in a lot of people they either have the giants or maybe you're from New Jersey and you have the devils instead of the owners you've seen some teams win\nBut there's not a worst city to be in then that kind of drought\nProducer market I went through before the show and what what are the awful sports cities that come to mind Cleveland now they want a long time maybe one recently with LeBron James uh\nChicago White Sox they're kind of a forgotten team there well even one or back in two thousand five\nUm Atlanta\nRight the Braves kind of ... well they still want to Ninety five and they've had something they're even Miami they haven't had a great run over all but the Marlins they do it's two titles since Nineteen Ninety seven\nAgain if you're a fan of certain teams in this town you haven't seen a winter since the Nineteen eighty six minutes thirty two years ago\n\nYeah we're frustrated maybe you could watch the end of the game or like me you did stay up and then a lost half of your Saturday\nWas a\nNobody out at worst than poor producer mark friday night thinking but typically you're out at midnight than your user Sharon nice my off\nNow know is near you be compensated you'll be All right you were a working a baseball game a World Series baseball history of all that in your favor here but uh\nWhen you don't know exactly when it's going to end or I'm sure at a certain point you've got to be thinking\nWell this game ever\nAnd or expected to just be here until Monday [laughter]\nJust play straight through the weekend so when max Muncie hits the home run you're not the most ah a motive person in the world but what was your reaction\nOn my hands went up in the air I was very excited I was like yes I finally get to leave [laughter]\nThoughts or sets of post game show obviously but at least I knew when it was going to and I got home and five and a five AM yes\nIn the pouring rain but I was saying I said to you that day I really hope I get out of uniform the nor'easter it's yeah and then it was right in the middle of it you didn't have like the either storm it lays I I don't think there is no I Know I Am in a nor'easter yeah I guess that there's a fair point\nBy a ... yeah I mean it's the seven plus our game it's a World Series game\nIt's hard to whine about how late it and when it was so dramatic it wasn't particularly well played but it was entertaining if you had the ability to stay up\nI'm someone up until two AM every night and even I was kind of in and out of consciousness uh the last few innings there but I was up in Muncie at the home run\nIt is not ideal however your\nHistoric moments are occurring at about three twenty five ... eastern time it was right in that area Margaret somewhere around in\nThe winter they're happening around three thirty in the morning that's not ideal I talked about this last year and again it's not much you can do about Eighteen any game but the Dodgers Astros\nGame that was game five\nIf I remember I was on a Sunday night it was on a Sunday night yes\nThe ratings for that game very interesting because I saw something that you wouldn't necessarily expect to see but of course makes sense so we know baseball has the start times at eight o'clock because of the west coast and you want to maximize your viewers and\nTo some degree that means being convenient for everybody in east coast here in the west coast viewer\nWell that Dodgers Astros games last year was high scoring exciting back and forth big moments home runs as much drama you could ask for in a baseball game and that's what they started losing viewers as that game went deeper into the night after about a eleven thirty\nThe ratings and the viewership started to drop\nSo you're going past that line you're messing up now you don't have your maximum all audience and my question would be ... and I get this wouldn't be popular on the west coast\nBut if you're going to have a chunk of your audience missed some of the game\nIs it better for them to miss the first couple of innings because they're getting out of work or busy during the day or would you\nRisk they're not being able to see the end\nAnd you know three thirty in the morning getting again it's Eighteen ... it's a it's a wild a fair but this happened last year to where they went past the point where people are willing to stay up to watch even when it's the most dramatic and the ultimate\nNet can be an issue\nAnd that game it was going late even for nine innings forget about what it becomes when it's Eighteen\nUh but uh but yeah have you stayed up ... you got your\nPay off the home run that kind of came out of nowhere there were still rally that built up it was just that one big swing and ...\nAble to take care of business on a ... game three and then uh the red Sox ultimately game four and five taking the series and uh then is\nThat and now we head into the off season the ... bandwagon as their next general manager it's a big free agent class far bigger than the last few years many Machado Bryce Harper headlining I don't think either player did themselves a whole lot of favors this season\nWith how they hustle\nEffort how they react in certain situations Machado stepping on the parents just fought at first base as we got another first baseman split the other night uh unbelievable and not a likeable player or based on what we saw this October upper man image out who\nI forget about becoming a villain you know Alex Brecht and made himself a target on his back with some what he said Aaron Judge by New York New York but that steps in good fun ... may Machado of course and yell and she's right he's a dirty player\nA you know did he do damage to what could happen this free agent off season and my guess would be no\nBecause these teams they look at the numbers to look at the analytics and hey you bring a certain amount of production to the table we're going to bring in and pay for it I'll be very interested to see how that plays out but I Am interested and we get it is a little later on the show based on what you saw for many Machado\nPositive and negative\nWould you still want the Mets to make a run at him and the same way that you did prior to this postseason eight hundred three two one zero seven to ... talk to Steve ... general manager about that\nAs well as a about a player agent taking over as the next year and the Mets nobody knows what it is to be a general manager the Mets are like Steve Philips will chat with him when we come back sports don't repeat McCarthy on the voice of New York seven ten W O R [noise]\nNow you're in the W O R sports\nAnd it's now official official as just a few moments ago the New York man sitting at a press release saying that Brody band wagon and it has been named the clubs thirteenth general manager in franchise history as we've told you will be introduced a tomorrow in a press conference to thirty ... full coverage that tomorrow night's\nUh here in the sports the only six to nine a couple of uh tidbits in here Jeff will pond met C O o\nBrody is an extremely knowledgeable creative progressive and collaborative a leader who I Am confident will lead us toward sustainable success I'm very excited for fans to hear and see the direction Brody outlined for us\nUh Fred well upon saying Brody show to see as a progressive banker who is prepared for this role and his great business a baseball ...\nJeff brought forward an array of candidates and we all agreed that Brody is high character blend of analytics scouting and development ideas illustrated why\nHe will be a success in this role\nA and ask for bandwagon in his quoting here I'm beyond excited motivated to take on this new challenge Olympic Fred and Jeff for believing in my vision and abilities I look forward to beginning the process of getting the Mets to contend for a championship year after year or so it is a again a official official here\nAnd you know for ... bandwagon and tomorrow I'm sure he'll outline some of\nWhat that plan will be for the Mets\nBut the way that Brody is\nPainted here or by both Jeff and Fred will ... now a lot of the things that\nWe had heard about the reports that they were looking for somebody didn't necessarily fit into the analytics box or the old school scouting\nBox and I guess will be interesting is to find out\nYou know is the player Adrian Brodie bandwagon here it's just like a\nA compromise candidate where he does a enough to satisfy both Jeff and Fred uh and so they went along with him rather than\nUh the other candidates Doug Melvin more of a Scottish background do eat is not you know completely adverse to analytics and then I'm bloom who would be you know totally analytical\nAnd with his back\nAround you know exactly what you're getting that more new age general manager that you see hired around the game and he's the author of success or around the game as well and you know you can look at the world series that they just play it out and say well the red Sox are less analytical and the Dodgers and they won\nA look ah the analytical teams there in the mix the brewers the Dodgers the Astros there three in the final four the Yankees\nAre probably belong in that category at this point with the way that they have put together their team and of course they've had some good draft picks do and and that's a big part of it but you know they are one looking for advantages numbers and dad as well\nAnd they were able to make the playoffs and then when the whole thing\nUh but you don't tell me those teams don't have a ton of success when you look around the sports for the ...\nYou know they won't fit into a certain ... and it'll be fascinating probably take a while\nTo really determine you know what I wrote the bandwagon and it it's going to be all about uh the first things that will be intriguing and really his first decisions or some of those big decisions will be\nDoes he talk to Jacob ... client former client probably now about an extension from the Mets point of view I he pushed for that\nBack at the all star break now he is the one who will in part to add that decision along with ownership up\nOf your your clubhouse ah in some connection there but they're also can't be this perception that there are favorites of the general manager that if you're not one of his guys that maybe you're not what these guys hall and you know I think that that's a salad that sort of separation ladies who have to come with\nA come up with it's got to be so part of trying to figure out what to do with it so I'm you know I I think that that you know as a general manager\nWore about structure knew more about the organization or about you know uh the process and less about individuals and uh you know the role of that relationship with the ... most out of a\nYou know if you're the general manager to try to do that and you probably stepping on the ship your manager and the coaching staff or it so it could certainly be helpful to help understand players\nUp but I think that that\nUh you know the the the way that it fits for an organization was you're building a team it's different than taking care of individuals with building a team everybody has to sacrifice and so why everybody has to to be asked to do certain things to take certain response groups take certain rules at times\nThat comes to conflict with what is the best interest individually for a player a ads you know he has that they're going to understanding about the impact on the players' side of it\nMhm but you do is he willing to to make that decision that isn't the best interest of the team and not only the best interest of the individual player\nHow about oh I Know we spoke a couple of weeks ago about this position a you talked about if you were a candidate you want to know what the chain of command is going to be and and how this front office is going to play out is there any indication of bat based on who they hire here are being a you know former player agent\nWell you know I think that that it's hard to do like he is he's the coast it whichever managers and I'm assuming this does so part of the ... where a problem with Jeff will ... subway because there was an established relationship there uh but you know I think that that look with every\nNew general manager has to do a it is that with a team but due to the gate your first time general manager a circle pond recommended this anyone's right\nYou need to have ... people around you and the and and the the the I think the most important ... of a general manager going is to say I don't have all the answers\nThat I don't go everything done I mean we're in that I have to learn as much as I have to guide directed elite [noise] I have to learn and and that you have to learn the people that are working with us for you are and they're not they're just sort of tell people what to do I think that if he goes in with that sort of mentality\nWhere you know she's your people feel like they can ... thing for them to do with information then he's got a shot to make the best decision if it goes with I have answers a and I don't have questions then I think are going to be more of a challenge for him\nAnd we're talking again with Steve Philips and broadly bandwagon and will be the next general manager of the New York bent introduced tomorrow to press conference or at two thirty or just you know quickly with the off season coming up to huge free agents Bryce Harper Manny Machado\nLook I'm a channel for the moment based on some of the controversial plays the he was involved in in the postseason when he talked about with hostile to Ken Rosenthal of the athletic would you at all be scared off of going after many Machado this off season\nYou know I wouldn't know you know I I Would make sure that that\nAh I mean these people have to understand that that uh you know there were so low that square she made some bad decisions are but\nThere are three players Ron Paul out over a hundred sixty two games and it's because of the fact that it is such a fiscal crime and sometimes they make a calculated decision to pull back a little bit save some of the energy because ... is a crime ... were tearing up so he\nHe can't east part of it I also think he was growing up to maturity part of it is I think that that when you're young stars in a in an organization that you got drafted whip and you come up with it or what happens is you get to the point where\nUh people don't really want to confront you and I think it's important that whoever is the manager\nOf a star like a beta Machado\nThey have the courage to be able to hold them accountable are and to to tell them what the expectations are not just left to react on the back end of it so uh you know I I I'm not scared away by it I Want talent that I'll vantage person all manage the personality\nA and you know I think that that also where the votes to your deal\nHe's going to have to accept and understand and be able to articulate is understanding of a level of responsibility would you come to that sort of back a star you can tell the face of voice leader ... and uh and that with that comes through some responsibility for the way to go about this leading the team\nYeah and it ended up with that being a factor than that you become the leader of because of this big contracted do you think he's ready for that\n[noise] yeah I Do I think I think that I think he's he's not necessarily going to be David right but I think that he could do things the right way I think there can be more accountability on um uh and you know go God doesn't make the perfect players\nHe does a and you know we all of them have things uh that you love and other things which they have more of a an ill is you can't have twenty five rock holds on your team up whatever the cause is one\nWriter and uh you know and and and a guy like that so I think that that gives me the challenge\nOf ban is a challenge or a ... place to do it makes sure that she understands low accountability and then hold him accountable for it and don't look the other way and I think you've got a chance to maximize value of the contract so maybe they'll these teams back up but I got to believe that the vast majority were it previously will still be at a\nSteep fill up the always appreciate it thank you okay my pleasure thanks\nAnd you hear the bond series exam ... network radio I thought so much Steve I had to talk about and your phone calls coming up eight hundred three two one zero seven ten the like the ... the bandwagon and hired would you worry about the ... going after say a ... or this off season or or just straight up bringing on\nAn eight hundred three two one zero seven ten we've got to the jets the giants are a little after seven thirty it's the sports don't repeat McCarthy on the voice in New York\n... W. O. R.\nW. O. R. sports though when you look I have on Dan W O I [noise]\nThink I think the ... the film than say a whole lot of overlap between being a player agent being a general manager of a lot of the things they do make a good player agent ... necessarily come into play in a big way in in his estimation as a general\nManager shore may be able to negotiate contracts or buy a seat belt also spelled out how you don't know how other general managers will view Brodie bandwagon in and then how other agents or will deal with him as well as he makes the switch and um you know one thing that\nI I've seen a couple of different spots is that I think\nPeople that are in front offices around the game aren't pleased about they said they\nDon't want the general manager jobs to go to people who have a theoretically paid their dues then in ... bandwagon and kind of goes around the different candidates so you know there is I think some jealousy and issues like that\nAre around the game with this higher and we'll get into that what will get your calls coming up when a little long with Steve eight hundred three two one zero seven ten calls after the news here's news that they\nBrodie bandwagon and it's going to need help and something that he might be able to do is is make the final decision on things and be able to interpret information from various sources right whether it be stats scouting staff\nYou know um [noise] other information that you end up here and throughout the sport talking to you know players other people within the game all all of these kinds of\nThings are things that he knows from being an agent that uh could be advantageous um\nBut yeah the the building of a franchise you know this isn't the scouting approach this is going to be someone who isn't going to have a probably a a clear idea like like who is Brody bandwagon and get a name and scouting director in order to handle the draft really keep you know tiny changes in that role does he know anybody\nWho's done that kind of thing I mean these are big questions that are going to happen to be sorted out a buddy he will have enough to help\nIt would seem initially that you should be able to get through the learning curve and it's going to be ... and there's no doubt about that I'll go to James in North Arlington hey James\nWell you know that's\nBeen the last Twenty years or so maybe sticking out of the box a positive note kicking someone that was an Asian\nI guess the old saying is you can't do it any worse but I Know they made the world series or ... years ago but it seems like\nThey've been so disorganized and and not ... ... they are in place but then again there's everybody else and that it close every other sport not just baseball can be the eighties but\nReally the best thing about the Yankees now is the continuity that they have had with Brian cash been in that position for so long\nYou're right and that's all you got to know nations they won the world series [laughter] she was a bunch of a great players that were so maybe this coming out of the box taking different maybe just a stable force it may be what the or the father and son\nCan get some ... understand the dynamics of the week\nAnd in one of the words that was used and appreciate the call or by Jeff ... was that sustainable success and out of a sudden we heard a lot in the Sandy ... years and talking about the Mets over the last five years here I I felt they were moving towards that until really the last year and a half\nAnd you looked up in the\nBarn system isn't what it was and didn't have ... the organization as a whole lacked death that was a problem this year when they had so many injuries that mid season\nThey didn't have guys they could call up even to be a bench player for them that were major league caliber they didn't have bullpen arms to go to any organization that could truly get big outs for them and be trust and we saw that even later in the season when the Mets were just trying to develop\nAnd give these guys and opportunity and it wasn't you know you you got to get it done or you're not going to be around anymore and you know because after\nAbout July first the Mets weren't play meeting meaningful games over the course of this year or so\nYeah um you know the the ... area where the Mets are going to have to get a little bit better here and I'm I'm I'm very curious what Brody bandwagon it's going to have to say I think that will be an important\nPress conference and still not gonna give you every answer because he can't just lay out exactly what the plan is going to be and what he said to Jeff and Fred well upon to win them over and and take this job\nI'm intrigued though and again I I like going outside the box\nI like taking chances in sports I Would go for two down for team like the giants did a a couple of weeks ago\nI liked that part of\nThe game I like being aggressive and it's easy to be safe in so many people in sports you know they have a lot to lose right you're a high paid coach you get\nCompensated well as a general manager you don't want to mess it up you don't want to rock the boat you don't want to be experimental it's why we see teams like the Tampa Bay rays who don't have much of a payroll they're the ones who say\nForget about it let's mix it up let's try something different and we're not going to get killed that we don't because you know there's not that much pressure on us but\nWhen the other teams when the larger market teams that seems bigger payrolls are able to start embracing some of those strategies taken some chances\nI think that works um\nI think that's how you end up on the top you know the\nRed Sox they made a big move stay he'll pay JD Martinez a lot of money has a free agent more than any other team baseball is willing to go to right\nYou know a high bloom would've made a ton of sense as far as the three finalists go in and I think that he would have been far more interesting than say Doug Melvin uh coming in here where dom ... would be more of I think\nThe exact same more of that Sandy older sin mold where as I'm balloon would have been totally analytics and would have been basically what\nYou see most franchises hiring a bandwagon and it is kind of this quirky middle ground or oh we don't really know exactly where he falls or on the spectrum overall um but yeah I I Would bet a few calls on that and I can understand the concerns of a player developed just because he hasn't had it\nAnd how will he utilize some of the people that are there you know Omar ... is that experience in a lot of different aspects of being in the front office and ah he's ah he's always you know had a great I uh for the game and and finding talent especially young talent at that\nAnd we'll be knocked out many years ago actually worked with Omar for eh forget what ... was it must be in two thousand eleven\nAnd all around I couldn't stop talking about how the buyer who loved ... at the time you know you don't have these guys right ah but you know he watched enough of them so and I've heard enough about him that this kid's going to be special in hobby by as this year and one of those contenders\nTo be the N. L. M. B. pay probably fall short Christian yellow but he's going to be in that mix and you know it wasn't that number one overall pick that everybody was all over yeah it was first round pick but\nYou know almost got a great I for that kind of thing and uh I'll be very interested to see what kind of role Omar ends up in in all this because you know keep in mind\nPulled Omar John ... especially they were involved in\nThe culling of candidates and building the list and you know ... even in the interviews on their first interviews along\nWith Jeff ... is the way that they set that up so those guys who did some involvement in who's hired here and you could imagine a both of them will will find a role under Brody bandwagon in here are ... and the car not as optimistic about this what do you think they\nSaid it's a horrible horrible I mean just it it's what the willpower to catch regime has been all about dysfunction\nAnd it's just totally dysfunctional fashion sixty seven and they just had a ... like this they had that kids who took a\nCharge that was the law at payroll lady wears out of it or at least was part of that organization that did that you're\nA kid that would have evolved volume analytics which is something that unfortunately that did not take seriously even all the teams that are at the top of the ... a big analytics changed\nThis guy that shot his last shot at making it\nExperience should play a development scary to the scouting it doesn't have those contacts what's he gonna do it for the organization it it it just doesn't make any sense whatsoever it's a little more where they get this guy is a puppet\nHere's the thing I really don't get this guy has to be a tens of millions of dollars as a player agent with the players that eat at all is judge station here now\nIt's a it's a different job you're you get to be part of a team\nYou have a winner a loss every day I think that's attractive for a lot of people even if he might be a you know giving them money in this whole thing [noise]\nI just don't get it again it's just show up on it it's what\nThey see how it plays out before you were casting a dysfunctional around and and appreciate the call ... you know one thing um\nI I ... I read today I'm trying to find where exactly I read it but one of you know ... first moves or in some of the he was told that he could build up that analytics department a little bit and uh that is that you ... I mean I think that he is going embrace analytics and while\nHe has an applied it in the same way as time bloom who would have been my choice for GM and and I agree with you on him I I think that's the\nSafer choice and the choice that you see more of a round the game a\n... bandwagon an as an agent you still have to know what he's in vogue around major league baseball and what teams want to hear and want highlighted as your marketing your free agents so\nIn that way you know burly bandwagon and has used all of these numbers all this information just for a different goal instead of looking to find bargains he's trying to convince teams hey this guy will become a good player for you or a bargain\nOr for you so you know\nAgain it's outside the box I have a hard time saying it's a terrible choice dysfunctional choice or great choice because there's just so much that is absolutely unknown\nBut what I Do like is I'd rather see a team take a chance then\nStick with the status quo when it hasn't worked two years in a row I Do not think Doug Melvin would've been an inspiring choice I was happy with either hind bloom or Brody bandwagon ... would have preferred bloom they go with bandwagon and\nI'm intrigued I Am ... and I want to hear a a ton of what he has to say tomorrow I'm you know no doubt about that in and get a better idea of how his relationships allies players going straight to there's a there's a lot to it even beyond the will there be any good at the gym or eight hundred three two one\nZero seven than we can mix it's a Mets cause a little bit later we're going to get into the er the jets loss yesterday twenty four tender the bears coming up or what kind of situation is Todd Bowles in and\nI Would bowls the way that he reacted after the game yesterday where he was pleased with a lot that he saw up from ... ah that's coming up sports don't people currently on the voice of New York seven ten W O R above [noise]\nNow here in the W O R sports though [laughter]\nOh the jets\nYesterday on another defeat three and five they dropped you now halfway through this twenty Eighteen sees in the same record\nThey've had the last couple of years or twenty four tend to feed at the hands of the Chicago Bears and this was interesting after the game\nA head coach Todd Bowles did see some things they like\nI'm very proud of winning foreign stayed together is the first game the entire year that we said together as a team and fought collectively execution was not great obviously and we got to make more plays and we know that and we're going to stay the course and these guys are going to stay together and therefore together\n... minimum requirements one of the first games they stuck together\nIn a game where they had just over two hundred yards a total up and so and we bring on right now from the Associated Press covering the New York jets Dennis was acting a desperation that's coming out and how are you tonight\nI'm doing great you are you doing I'm\nGood at what do you make of Todd Bowles a singing praises for teams effort sticking together in a game that was not very pretty to watch yesterday\nI I think he's trying to put a positive spin on the situation because let's face it Pete it's hard to find any positives at this point especially coming out of that game and I and I think I'm more so than um the locker room saying together I think he kind of men\nJust these guys going out and trying you know so that that's that's where we're at now you know that these guys in all three phases are trying hard and they're playing hard and uh you know there's three and five a third straight year\nAt this point and we have the last two seasons ended up at five and eleven each year so they need to turn these things around and have some actual positives talked about moving forward or else ah things might get a little ah hot under the seat of Todd Bowles by the end of the season\nThey should do this a team that has a a young quarterback that is clearly talented in ... but you look at the rest of this roster Dennis where is where they progressed over the last let's say two or three seasons\nYeah I think that's that's the thing that\nWhen you look at the team and how it's\nBuilt when you look at the draft picks up my ma Cagney and has brought in and then gotten rid of as well I mean we've seen a lot of guys come through the door and and leave and go back out the door I'm from the draft the recent traps and I think even from the it's the classes a prior to that and\nI think that's the problem that there aren't there aren't enough players adding to the ... you know players who might have a been a death\nPlayers are from the two thousand fourteen draft you know there are there are many guys left from that class you know and I think that's that's the problem so they're trying to kind of\nUse band aids by bringing in guys and taking fliers on guys and you know it's ... some of the moves have worked out I think are bringing in a guy like every Williams and that will help long term I think he'll he'll be fine I think Darren Lee has progressed um he's not great he is not maybe the number one pick you know the first round pick\nThat everyone expected him but in his third season he's shown signs of improvement so", "year": "2018", "show_name": "WOR Tonight with Joe and Lis", "city": "New York",
