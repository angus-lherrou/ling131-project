per guest includes access to a private villa with sixty\nNow is what you bring up a great point and I was ... that led to my next question because both sides are claiming that this will be motivating tool for the midterms which are less a month away so which side you really think motivates more\n[noise] well I think Democrats have been motivated they're going to stay motivated you know democratic women are on fire you can't set fire on fire they can't get any more motivated so I don't know that it helps Democrats as much it'll it'll help them maintain their intensity\nBut Republicans were cool they didn't have anything to get them out to the polls go go reelect swamp\nIt wasn't working and now they do now they have something which by their problem is they want and successes uniformly fatal in Washington you know we all survive failure we'd get up try again we're angry we go out and vote\nBut success makes people complacent and that's going to actually hurt Republicans a little bit\nI see Trump now going into a suburbs which are not too long ago a lot of the analysts were saying oh he's got no chance there he's going to places now which people were writing off\nMistake drill to stay home go to red states the suburban vote is still\nDominated by angry democratic women and and I think that's going to hurt Republicans look this is helping Republicans in red states like Tennessee in Montana but this is hurting Republicans in states like Nevada and Arizona where\nYou have large suburban vote and uh and that's going to the intensity there's not going to cut Republicans way look Republicans still have a very good shot of keeping the Senate the house is still looking bad for Republicans\nI wanted to ask you this hour on with Alex costs the honest NBC News political line was drawn to this this week every time I I'm guessing you've done the math uh what does it look like right now in the house\nI think uh I think it's going to look rough for Republicans I Would have said a few weeks ago the Republicans could lose forty to fifty seats [noise]\nNo I think they're going to lose the house but maybe only by ten Fifteen maybe twenty uh but I think it's going to be much better a bad situation is going to be a little better\nAlex how do you think there's a big New York times story that the beltway has been touting about the Trump family tax evasion how was that really playing with voters\nJeep Donald Trump plays fast and loose like he does everything else shocking news breaking news in it no uh no one cares more about their own paychecks which seemed to be doing better than whatever Donald Trump did\nYeah you know I have a friend we were talking about that times for me and said jeeze I Want to hire Donald Trump's accountants who wants to pay their taxes\nExactly nobody loves the Irish nobody loves Washington nobody loves government nobody wants to pay for it\nSo much to say the or the Democrats take over the house does that mean the ways and Means Committee which will now be run by Democrats does that mean the subpoena the president's tax returns\nThey'll subpoena the president's tax returns that means Jerry Nadler from New York who will run judiciary will open investigations against Kevin maybe try to get him in ... to impeach Trump beach Kevin\nChaotic hearings on anything that walks talks are crawls in Washington or the first two years of the Trump Administration will be forever known as the call and we're\nSupposed to be on this sounds like it'd be excited that it great for the newspaper business great for radio\n[laughter] hey I one last question Alex were you\nWhen I see the protesters and I see these strident feminists going crazy literally clawing at the door of the Supreme Court it puts me in mind the old silent majority that elected Richard Nixon do you think there's a wide group of voters out there who are just appalled by that kind of behavior\nI think so I think there there's a you know the Supreme Court was the last respected institution in government and those days are gone now it's it is a\nPlace where you play politics just like everything else it has it has crumbled their respective stature that it had and I don't think we can ever an scrambled eggs\nAnd All right Alex ... of ABC News political analyst joins us every Tuesday at this time it's going to be fun Paul Alex\nWright Alex good luck to watch\nYou know I guess the most people are saying the Senate cannot be flipped but now if that were to happen there will be well raise the town crazy I think the Democrats that smear campaign against cabinet backfire in many ways in many ways hey uh Eddie in\nPaterson one of the way and we're talking about the tragic limo accident said in your driver yourself any\nMore than guys had he not only told me to make the law I just wanted to mention and regal is not going to like this because I'm a Republican is always advocating\nFor business is regulating themselves you know self regulation Amazon some work in this case you missed company had been wanting to regulate it in a drive Robin would have been prevented man\nMaking gun regulation is good yeah\nWell we don't want we don't want to not regulated entirely I agree with you though at either they've got to look into these limo drivers in these crazy limousines that they're constructing\nOut of control you know he's right obviously

I guess people\nAre her for fans didn't want to hear her tilting left in fact you know the president I thought it was being very kind when he said\nI'm sure that nothing or\n[noise] let's say that I like music about forty five percent less now\nThan I Am a ... oh so two weeks ago he was that I hate air on them or listen to what other saga again I never paid them for a Taylor Swift fan but what are you guys think of his big dust up eight hundred three two one zero seven than if you want to give us a call will squeegee in as we await\nDr oz arrival but all of a sudden Taylor Swift who was totally non political now [noise]\nHeard Michael some of the tweets that came down against or they're absolutely we're killing her on social media from you know people who are on the right\nNow when the real question is do you think these celebrities I mean pop singers and actors you think they even should take political stance you ... do you care what they have to say about politics you want to hear what Barbara Streisand has to say about the president United States about Kanye\nWho certainly at the end of Saturday Night live give this whole speech about Trump\nYeah should they just keep quiet and perform or hey let's go to Bob in a college point New York ...\n[noise] I Know and I was telling the lady I think ... ... ... the hanging around those Hollywood people too much and uh this is what happened she ...\nYeah she wants to be with the liberal elite I bet the way to say if someone hangs around with the left that means they're you know Bob really\n... ... ... you better watch you watch out you're going to hang around me I mean a lesser every show well that's why it's good that Dr Ross was coming with CPR nine twenty three to help you guys out because you may\nNeed it what's your opinion on that I'd be curious and what do you think about sports figures when they um when they come out and make political statements [noise] you know I Know that at the national anthem thing bothers you will be on the field well yeah I don't mind\nAnyone who has something to say on our own time they're the only time that I'm I'm a little bit of you know I I'd rather not seat intrude on the field of play right so you know athletes have days off their time off if they want to be involved in the cause that's fine hey I Am in Brooklyn what do you think Gabby good morning morning\nIt's MORNING I Can't lift books that have a voice just like any other entertainer act with I mean it can be a bit annoying contrary to like my opinion like I disagreed with her but at the same time Tanya is out there and if you're more leaning towards the right kind of like go Kanye if you're leaning towards left\nNow you're like how to like go Taylor but I think that we have to remember that the end of the day\nThese people pay taxes on they have a voice it had a ... a a a very wide ranging audience I think that we just have to be acceptable\nThat this was you know that they have what they haven't been many athletes and collaborate in the car who have done a lot of good work I'm getting a message out because of that why they might just think that we have that whether we like it a lot I personally you know\nIt was ... let's get video showing how it works as well put this on the side just as fast\nSo that if you have someone who has heart failure or who ... who has a problem with their valves instead of opening their chests ... heart surgery we can just put this flipping through the growing open it up patched elite puts the mitral valve and close it and it showed you can reduce the chance to go into the hospital in half and the chance of dying by almost forty percent but it has to be\nDone in a doctor's office by Dr obviously\nIn the hospital but the bigger point here is American medicine actually works\nIt's a one two punch we need people to stay alive do CPR keep them alive and get them to the hospital and the technologies and medicine to dance so dramatically now\nThat we had the ability to get people through things with mentally invasive procedures that they can go home the next day with\nSo things like cancer which I was ten years ago we started the show is ... you know it was a bad news story yeah nowadays we make in fact we've got to show this week on march AT T believe it or not\nThe ... the Japanese tea ceremonies he actually reduces cancer so cruel and somebody's ... vitamin D because of er see around that one of the things by ... does we believe is help your body immune system function better and so we can fight off things like\nCancer as an infection so there's ... we're making daily but they had the party with lifestyle ... and that's really the essence of white America should be healthier nation\nSo when you have something like vitamin D you can get that in the sun but then you're told her don't be on the sunrise much cause you might get skin cancer I take a little thing every day that's one of the part of my graduate this little pill that\nThen there's the peppers and what I Would do take a pill\nA ... but there's controversy 'cause a lot of people getting their blood tested to see if there was a low which sounds good but it's expensive\n... and I think the reality is if you're older frail bones gets a little check make sure numbers adequate but for a lot of people just take the vitamin D and I actually I'm okay with the little sun exposure ten minutes a day fifty minutes a day is fine so folks darker skin is that enough if you live in the cold weather you can't go outside in the wintertime so this time of year start taking vitamin D\n... does vitamin C. help ward off cold uh it's unproven I take vitamin C. personally mhm but I'm not sure\nDr oz always a pleasure we're going
