{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "The architect of our core strategy that really what trading is is just the transfer money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing\nI think that's an important concept to remember because it's not like the money just grows on trees and all of a sudden it shows up in our account right what happens is there's a buyer and seller and\nThere's a transaction that occurs and there's a winner and there's a loser and a lot of times we we forget about that side of the market but the markets are really just a conduit and this is one of the ways I explain it to my classes as\nThe markets are a conduit that just hooks us all together that's really all the marketplaces it's a meet up\nWe all go there to hang out and what do we do there well we buy and sell stocks and people who want to sell stocks show up with their stocks and people who want to buy stocks go there to buy stocks it's just like a farmer's market but at the stock market or commodities market\nBut it's just buyers and sellers and money transfers like a farmer's market when I buy tomatoes money transfers transfers from my account into somebody else's account and it's the same thing in the financial markets and a lot of times we don't realize that\nAs we're losing somebody else who made the right decision is actually out there making\nYeah and they're also living their lives most of us right now which jobs are stressed out we're worried about losing our job especially with a correction comes again\nMost people are just one paycheck away from poverty and so a lot of our students are figuring this out how do I go from being emotional to becoming strategic\nAnd the way they do that is to get the proper education learning how a three hour session can completely change your life and you know Ryan you know I've talked about this over and over again\nHolidays are coming up it's that time of year again\nEveryone's going to make their resolutions yeah right well that's kind of silly because the resolution is basically your intention to do something in the two biggest ones we hear what\nI'm going to lose weight this year ... out of ... you know out of out of debt and made our money but the difference here right now is don't just make it a resolution make it a promise to yourself that you're going to figure out a way to get more financially secure\nYeah I remember my grandpa used to say this and I remember hearing somewhere else too but I'm just gonna give him credit for it but it used to always say\nUh the goal without a plan an executed will plan is this is a dream you know go without a plan is a dream and and that's one of the things that we spend a lot of time on an online training academy is that step by step plan\nThat step by step process on how to accomplish the goal because\nAny and we are we're going to come up to the holidays here pretty quick and all of a sudden everybody is going to plan out their New Year's resolutions I don't remember all the statistics we went through it back in January on the show but it ended up being something like within four weeks eighty percent of the people have completely given up and I'm not even thought about their New Year's resolution and part of that is there wasn't an executed will plan\nThey didn't know exactly what to do tomorrow and\nThe only ... could plan right now is the gyms knowing they're going to start running their commercials in their ...\nAnd they're going to make a killing thirty bucks a month but at the gym memberships skyrocket but at the same time that you're putting our our best foot forward and giving us an opportunity to reach that financial goal is critical out there as well and and we have to do\nWhat we have to do what it takes to accomplish the goals we want to lose a little weight we got to spend a little more time on the treadmill\nAnd we want to make a little more money we've got to get those skills and one of the places where we can really start bringing the knowledge that we can work our way up into that skill set is I don't want to have to classes and we've got this stack of this decade tickets is dwindling we must be towards the end of the show but we got a few tickets left we do know that give away let's do it\nRight now I've got to have to class coming up in your area and happy

eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at oats EA Wall Street dot com\nAnd see if you can score some passes there there were ...\nThe other things you guys are working on right now as far as your instructor team to really help people take control their lifestyle help people do the things they want to do\nTo help them get over procrastination right I mean it's amazing how many people spend so much time watching TV procrastinating\nComing up with the reason why they can't do something and what have you only needed to take maybe a third of the time that you're doing right now either procrastinating of watching TV just to learn how to trade and make more money\nSo I ask students all the time you ever wondered what your life would be like if you can quit your job or if you could spend more time with your family a lot of our students now are starting to actually\nMake money while they're on vacations I have June one of my students recently and she sent me a postcard from Costa Rica and she said it's great I'm playing golf as has been my dream but I'm also trading on the trip and of course when she came back I asked you trade before after and she went\nBefore of course so she'd get up early in the morning because the one thing about having an education and being able to trade in any time with an Internet connection that computer is there are several markets to trade it's twenty four hour marketplace right now so the rules have changed and people are finding that they can take back their lives\nAnd actually start doing some of the things they want to do as opposed to working for someone else it which is what is the required to do of themselves\nYeah there was a there was a book I read a little while ago called the world is flat and it talked about a lot of outsourcing in a different kind of business strategies but it talks a lot about technology and how technology has really kind of\nLevel are made this playing field a very level and it makes a it makes it difficult on some businesses to be competitive and it makes it easier on other businesses to get going and that's very true inside of the markets because with the with the Internet connections that we have with the data streams that we have\nIt it really is this this this marketplace where it doesn't matter what your background is it doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter even how much money really you're getting started with everybody has access to the same information inside of the markets and so it doesn't matter where we come from it only matters where we're going and we stay focused\nKind of on that go hand in that we do everything necessary to accomplish it and that's kind of that great it's a great relief point where you you get to a point in life or you go you know what\nI can do whatever I whenever I Want to do I don't have to go and do this I can go and do that and that's what that financial freedom is\nThat's where your sleeping easy at night and there's really nothing to worry about and a drop in the market is just another opportunity to give yourself a raise now one of the things that we can do to help a few people get into this point to take that first step right getting started as the most critical step\nIs it looks

patients and if you have questions feel free to call was about sixty two year old bad\nHe as a single man without children and he saw me a year ago as PSA went from one point four to two point six to ... just in the euro just told them just to come back for a follow up here say remembers\nPSA had doubled from one point for the two point nine other normal levels PSA prosthetic specific antigens considered for less than that is usually considered okay more than that is considered war is so but I see plenty of people who have cancer with a PSA less than four\nIn fact if you get our prostate cancer DVD will send it to you know charge to two part new DVD you'll hear an interview with a man who has a PSA just like this man is because they went from one to ...\nThe doctor didn't even recognize it was a problem the patient himself recognize that a problem got a biopsy and then came to me we treated him or to them about twelve years ago his name's Ralph and it'll be in the\nDVD can watch it yourself and here's interview\nSo for this man he's had a PSA that had doubled from one point forty two point nine but the urologist didn't recognize it\nTold them to come back well the patient came back and now the pie essays jumped to more than six [noise] and he has a Gleason seven cancer and now it comes to us wanting treatment\nWhen that doctor now who kind of missed the doubling of his fiance now wants to do a radical surgery or the man for a Gleason seven\nAnd we know that radical surgery for Gleason seven has a sixty percent success right we have a Ninety percent success rate here\nAvoiding radical surgery avoiding robotic surgery avoiding in general the impotence and incontinence and radical surgery that comes as a\nPackage often with radical surgery and the ... robotic surgery at the ... the man will end up Ninety seven percent of the time was sexual damage\nAnd eighty percent of the time with urine area damage or wetting his pants so we know why this man is here he's here to get better results yes at least in some cancer\nHe wants our Ninety percent and he was at one of the biggest super duper pooper scooper hospitals in New York City and they just wanted to cut on him well that happens so frequently that the doctors want to cut the chemo or cut their came or cut or chemo\nAnd it's better to stop it come over to thirty for Broadway and think and think and understand before you get caught or came old caught and came out there so many better treatments and other treatments that you can learn about this is not going to lead them and we have a caller on the line how are you today\nHello callers he's gone Steve so You're welcome to call back\nAnd we want to hear from you and we will be happy to hear from you if you wish to call us back we\nAre live on the radio at one eight hundred three two one zero seven ten one eight hundred three two one zero seven ten just give us a call and we're happy\nTo answer your questions about sixty eight year old woman she comes to me she has [noise]\nAh she's divorced she has no children and she has a recurrent right breast cancer and the upper outer quadrant shed Thirteen Years ago she had\nBreast cancer treatments she had lumpectomy and standard treatment for DC I asked which is a pre invasive or I'm not invasive breast cancer at that time she was recommended to hormonal therapy and studies show that hormonal therapy will in cruise\nThe odds of success well she declined that\nAnd now she has a phone us in the breast she doesn't have mammograms for several years and then last month she had a mammogram showing a leash and in the arm and then the ... the armpit and she had a biopsy showing cancer so she has cancer in the breast where she had it before\nAnd she's come to us for treatment because she wants to try to save her breast and this is the work we do\nThis is a woman who works for UPS she recently retired high examined her and she has a ... and the breast of focus and regularity it right at the incision site right where they cut on her years ago in the breast\nSo were staging are up we're getting a PET scan and blood test to see exactly where the cancer is to see if there's other spots besides the breast and that's what we do and both to every patient not every patient but most every patient who needs that\nWe stage up see where the cancer is and then based on that we are for the patient all the options all the choices\nOf cancer treatment and I want to speak about a gentleman who is fifty six years old he was born in the ... the Caribbean and he has a T. one see prostate cancer he wants he has to stage which means it's a buggy prostate it's confined to the prostate [laughter] but it's PSA was rapidly rising\nUh before it was one point for jumped up to three point eight other doubling and he also has a Gleason seven cancer\nIs a black man we know that the death rate in the black community is double every other community we know that one in six black men will have prostate cancer to one and twenty three black men will die of prostate cancer\nAnd we say that to raise attention raise awareness because if we can find prostate cancer early in\nEvery group black white yellow green would ever any religion any race if we find prostate cancer early the success rate is much higher [noise] so if you find the prostate cancer for example the Gleason sex PSA six success rates Ninety five percent\nNow this man's fifty six years old ... has three children is high blood pressure diabetes and cholesterol and as as a positive family history\nListen to this his father had prostate cancer his brother had prostate cancer and his uncle died of prostate cancer while says lots of cancer of the family and the rapidly rising\nPSA add the Gleason seven cancer I examined to him he has a buggy prostate\nAnd he wants to be treated he wants to have the best chance to be successfully treated he wants to avoid robotic surgery radical surgery wants to have our Ninety percent success rate and he wants to avoid radical robotic surgery with a sixty percent success rate\nSo there's lots of reasons why this man is here and there's a warning sign and the teaching point if you're a family history she get checked out even if you don't have a family history but rapidly rising PSA\nShe get checked out and you may want to get checked out in any event to know what your PSA is so just give us a call at two one two choices to make an appointment or to get a forklift and we have a caller on the line Yes sir\nYes doctor I have a question or are we supposed to show yesterday about people calling in with the unexpected like lumps ... have a question for you and comes to him has an unexpected lump or up on their head\nIs a serious preferred method that news news to determine what the cause of that bomb or a ... a biopsy\nWell anywhere in a lump or bump is so there's lots of different places in the head to head as everything from the neck up so it could be the ... the year\nThe guy you know there's lots of different places in each place is different\nAnd sometimes you can do just an ultrasound sometimes is a CAT scan or an ... so it depends where what the size is the extent of the location of\nAnd each person has different like I talked about a few minutes ago getting giving advice over the telephone over the radio is very very dangerous because often people don't really know how to describe what they have or they don't have a full\nUnderstanding of what they have and that's why it's really so important to come into thought one thing for everybody each person is unique\nAnd we do different things for different people really\nAlso do apply obscene as well\nDepends how suspicious will be doing let's say during the ultrasound and you see assessed while most likely you don't need to do a biopsy assist or not cancer ship a solid mass somewhere than biopsy so every circumstance is\nReally different we treat each person uniquely it's not a cookie cutter place every person is uniquely ah comes with a unique story and these are unique approach you try to do something logical that's least invasive\nSometimes I get a patience to my office and the surge and wants to cut open their neck\nYou know do a neck section for a lump I just had a man actually this week he's about eighty years old\nAnd it's incredible story at a mass under the tongue something like Michael Douglas Michael Douglas also if you remember his story went around to various doctors for a year so not getting diagnosed got misdiagnose well this famous exact same stories eighty years old lovely wife lives in New Jersey\nAnd as a mass under the tongue you've seen by about four or five doctors had biggest hospitals in New York and New Jersey at the ... most prestigious hospitals and he had biopsies and they missed that\nThey did PET scans cat scans MRI's for two and a half years and this mass skips on growing it finally comes to me\nWhile she had a CAT scan last September we called for the records I examined her she's got a mass eleven centimeters the my fist as ... centimeters so it's bigger than a man's fist\nIn Nebraska with multiple nodules red and raise broken through the skin and the breast is distorted and there's bleeding and ... and she's got a mass of the armpit it's three centimeters that's more than an inch\nAnd we staged her up and we talked about all the options and well she now wants to be treated with our treatment shit five years of concoction animas drips and vitamins and drops and\n[noise] nothing worked and you wouldn't expect to all those concoction so work and finally she came here and most likely this cancers gonna shrivel up that's what usually happens you have a high success rate\nRetreat many many women with breast cancer some with early breast cancer some with late breast cancer some with primary breast cancer in the breast itself some with modest addict breast cancer we have high success rates where we attack the cancer\nThis is the work we do and I came to New York Thirty years ago as a big hospitals Ninety seven percent of the women were losing their breasts for breast cancer treatment\nWhereas in my practice Ninety percent of women were keeping their breast so it's a big difference the women weren't different that cancer wasn't different there was only one thing that was different and that was the motivation and the doctor who are for all the options a woman can have missed acting if she wishes that's your choice\nBut she shouldn't be pushed a mistake to me against her desire against her will and this woman was fearful she was fearful that fearful go into the hospital and he couldn't understand why she was so fearful of going to the hospital\nAnd finally she has come here to Thirteen it before Broadway where we treat women with breast cancer most commonly keeping the breast intact\nThis is the work that we do ...

violation of a pancreas cancer that spreads delivers a stage for cancer [noise] there was diagnosed two years ago you had diarrhea was seen by the doctor there the mass of the liver biopsy was shown to be cancer\nAnd then he went to a super duper pooper scooper place and they started systemic therapy\nAnd he was treated for more than a year and a half with fancy treatment with no treatment is about ten thousand a month so lots of treatment\nAnd didn't do very well he had blood clots which is a bad side and often people pancreas cancer have blood clots so warning sign you sort of blood thinners and he got re scan the cancer was growing he's been short of breath for a month and a half\nHe's had a cough or a month and a half he's eating poorly\nAnd he has a new skin showing a mask growing and deliver it and do mass they'll live flowed called the gastro ... load\nAnd the pancreas mess so he's got the bankers growing delivered grow up\nAnd it's been an systemic therapy which just is not working and the man was he was at one of the big hospitals he was so afraid of coming leaving there and getting a second opinion\nHe wasn't afraid about the cats are growing and the liver you wasn't afraid of the cancer growing the lymph node he wasn't afraid of the cancer growing in the pancreas he wasn't afraid of cancer causing blood clots but he's afraid that they may find out that these seeing Dr Lederman well what did I tell him and his family I said look\nIt's your life you can go wherever you want if you want to come here for a second opinion and go back to that hospital You're welcome to do that they're happy to see you know the year and a half of chemotherapy at ten thousand dollars a month that's talking about two hundred thousand dollars of treatment they're happy to give them more chemo\nMost people have bladder cancer is just do not want to have radical surgery\nSo he's here how does a treatment work will patient lays on the table as a stereotype to frame first in America we have the longest track record treating bladder cancer is focused the radiation in the stereotype to crime it's not invasive easy treatment you come and get treatment\nIs a butcher in New York City you can get his treatment and then go back to work which is very different than if you had a radical surgery he probably be out weeks maybe months maybe never get back that's a big difference we have a high success rate is high quality of life\nAnd with us most likely he'll keep his quality of life you'll be urinating on his own and have his normal sexual life as well it's a big difference compared to losing losing\nA flatter had so many men and women wish to try to save their life was ever possible\nEarlier in the show I talked about this eighty three year old man he's married he has two children\nAnd for two years she's had a leash on the tongue he\nWas seen by multiple doctors the biggest hospitals is seen by a a tea and he had a second opinion in another hospital very big hospital\nAnd then the biopsies that neck of the tongue and they just missed the diagnosis they put him to sleep at biopsy did they did sleep under anesthesia ...\nThen they went to another super duper because New York city head of the section and that Dr at one of the biggest hospitals wanted to open up the man does not do it ... the section and finally the man came to us and that's what I said to him I Believe you able to sway with cancer\nAnd we can diagnose and treat you quickly it's been two years he went to multiple doctors the biggest hospitals low and was able to diagnose him until he came here we put a needle into that mass pain Leslie easily\nWith no cutting no bleeding and sucked out cells and they were square was cancers rent a PET scan of I'm the same day she had a PET scan of the biopsy all within an hour he got fully staged up whereas for two years he went to the biggest doctors the biggest hospitals and got a big goes sake\nSo finally he knows what he has which is a square of his cancer the base of the tongue that's the bottom part of the tongue\nThat holds the target place\nSo the cancer started there in these two years when he was misdiagnosed the cancers traveled to ... got bigger and more painful and we were able to diagnose him and we've offered treatment that most likely will cure him sort of talking about cured of cancers the head and\nNeck would treat many people with nasal ferrets cancers\nWhich aired about earlier in the hour those cancers mouths cancers vulgar or cancers and throat cancers in\nKansas of the gums this is the work we do highly successful work with a great expertise and a team of experts to work together at Thirteen before Broadway if you wish for this man\nFinally after two years he has an answer his stage three square was cancer the base a thong for next note involved with and most likely he will be successful treatment if he comes here to search for Broadway that must be about a man who was born in New Jersey got ugly snake cancer\nSeven course positive he has a PSA seven states T. one seat police in the eight\nTo ... looks up to the microscope you could open up our prostate booklet which I Do it right now if you if you had gone to the most famous surgeon in America for Greece and ate cancer of the success rate is twenty three percent only which means Seventy seven percent failure rate\nCompared to us if you look at our data at our data is on page or nine of a booklet for Gleason a cancer you'll see a doubling\nMore than doubled success rate high success rates that the majority of men cancer free Rob Gleason eight nine to prostate cancer so there's lots of good information in the book was\nA great reason to call up and get the booklets in their hands or come to our office at thirty days before Broadway and want to speak about a Seventy one year old man who\nHas a lung cancer had a ... lung cancer to lumps are moved to parts of his\nOf right lung removed actually two lobes removed or one of the biggest hospitals and then the better study cancer and he had radiation in the clinical trial\nThat we know the clinical trials are usually failures of success rate is very very poor hit more radiation in more chemo and more immunotherapy then the cancer recorded the ribs you was triggered by the chief of radiation that one of the biggest university hospitals\nIn New York City and well the the doctor ordered a PET scan and the cancer was growing in the ribbon eating through the ribbon\nPET scans positive and they set them up to his home to die this is only sight of disease\nThe SUV which is how much radioactive sugar was involved in those ribs or other cancers grows up to nine and the patient came to me because he was so upset he was in so much pain he was seen by one of the biggest doctors they send them home\nTo die that I saw him I showed him a PET scan at that place showed the\nCancers eating through the ribs that that are radiation doesn't work get radiation and chemo and surgery didn't work and they send them home to die the pet scan was worst a CAT scan was worse and the CIA doubled it was thirty five up to Seventy we offered localized treatment and that's what he is most likely going to choose\nWhen all the other places send them home to die we offered innovative treatment to try to stop this cancer and get them in remission and

went to the Christian Science Sunday school and heard Bible stories and how they were relevant to my life how they could and rich might be\nA and then I found that these two books they just they they became my friend's guides and constant physician\nAnd they were just always there\nThat's great and uh so it sounds like you you had a good relationship with the pasta right from the get go\n[laughter] you know to me it's been just a automatic thing when I have a need I just turned to these books and whether it's a a familiar passes I Know are sometimes I just open up randomly in and see where the inspiration leads because I found the it's the spiritual ideas\nIn these books that move fought and won salt moves that\nAnd what I mean by ... moving is just moving off of a materialistic or a limited or selfish base and I start to recognize the spiritual nature of what God has created us to be\nSo when you I'm sort of started hearing about this as as a child can you remember any specific experiences where you felt the comfort of the past or really felt that this pasta was communicating to you\nOh boy there's been just so many times [laughter] go from physical healing I remember one time I was\nMy twin brother and I we were playing little league baseball and um I was playing shortstop and this is the biggest fastest guy was hitting the ball and he's Mack the ball and hit the ground and took a bad hop and hit me right I'm all and so I'm San during around and those can figure eats you know\nA around the field as they're scoring runs uh-huh everybody else afterwards kept us oh you're going to have this black guy made a lot of pain and stuff like that and when I got home and I I just my parents just kind of\nLove me and cared for me and just open up the Bible and started just reading just comforting passages and the next morning there was no black guy there was nothing it was just immediately dismissed and so it just over and over again whether it was a\nOvercoming chicken pox just in a matter of twenty four hours or\nI'm just all sorts of things that kids get into when they're playing in the woods in Texas [laughter] and the main thing was feeling unafraid that's to me that's what the pastor has brought me a feeling a sense that I'm not a victim I'm On afraid that I have dominion over my thought\nAnd therefore I can control my body\nMm well that's an extraordinary thing for people to have isn't it I think everyone listening will think that that's that's what I have well how does the pasta helped us to find that that demeaning in that sense if you like both or is he over every aspect of our lives okay\nRepublican Matthew in the Bible I Love it\nI read it a lot and then it starts off saying when he was coming down from the mountain it's talking about Jesus when he was come down from the mountain great multitudes final Tim and behold there came a leper and worshipped him saying lord if ... if not will now can't make me cream and cheeses put forth his hand and touched him saying I Will be though clean and\nImmediately his leprosy what's Clinton's than\nThe over the years when I'm looking at that I I think about the mountain and that was that physical elevation or was that a spiritual one this with God and that and that's what the Bible and science ... teaches me is how to pray\nTo gain that one this with my God the infinite mind or life with those with capital spelling that there and sending them star named for God in in that sense that um\nIf that will that can't make me clean and he says\nI Will that sense of well I'm gonna try wasn't there any sense of fear trepidation but it was just that uh dominion right there I'd gone given dominion that Jesus expressed so fully in what we learn in science and health that's called the Christ that\nPower of God that dominion over situations\nAnd then in science and health I I like where she says take possession of your body and governance feeling an action arise and the strength of spirit to resist all that is unlike good gone has made man capable of this and nothing can be sheet the ability and power divinely bestowed on man\nAs you were saying that he thought I was thinking of another phrase or the Mary Baker eddy uses a high or an ... a consciousness um and and so it's like consciousness of a a a one this with God that really is is always the underlying truth isn't it for all of us\n... I mean it's who we are and what were made to do and to be where we're here to express into glorifying God and that God is majestic love powerful soul ever present spirit\nAnd these wonderful ideas of God and it is demeaning that comes out to the consciousness about one this with God that ... confined to people who are members of a Christian Science judge is it\nNo not at all it doesn't matter what we humanly appear to be\nBecause of the human sense I'm discovering through my work with the pastor in the sense is that the human interest to limited sense just kind of like the upside down backwards of what is really going on because we are spiritual ideas of a divine spirit\nWere beautiful expressions of a divine infinite soul\nAnd and the more we kind of embrace that and then we can put that in practice by\nDismissing the thoughts that we have to be a victim of some kind\nAnd we find that as we're learning these ideas and starting to express them and ... them than others turned to us for healing and then I found that anyone who reads the Bible in science and health\nYou know pretty consistently they become everyone that comes around them becomes healthier and happier unholy or for having met them even though they may not even know why that's taking place\nSo you know do you have an example you'd like to share that just shows how that that really looks in practice\nOh boy I've got so many or talking about what the pastor and how it guides I ... I was thinking about face so I was looking at different things I looked in the Bible where it talks about the\nYou know a building his arc uh then I looked in in a statement he bruised and it was talking about that as well and so as I was kind of spiritual anything\nMy thought about that for Mary Baker he writes face if it'd be mere belief is is a pendulum swinging between nothing in something having no fix city face advance to spiritual understanding is the evidence gain from spirit which review sin of every time an established as the claims of God\nAnd San referred to in this statement is ascendant believing that you know I'm just not completely go running our lives so you know as I was pondering the importance of facing I received a\nCall from a man and he had been driving out of state to compete in that kind of annual steer roping event than if you've ever seen the stair roping events they are quite something takes a lot of physical\nActivity and all of a sudden he was not feeling well at all and um his wife wasn't aware of this and then all of a sudden they\nThey arrive at the event and also many tells her well I'm I don't think I can do this and seals wines with while I've been feeling\nWeak and nauseous all day and the feeling fame for the last couple of days\nShe says well maybe this is a wonderful time to maybe call the Christian Science practitioner and um [noise]\nHe was he was not a Christian sinus himself but he'd seen feelings that happened to her and so he said sure and so she can dial the phone and she left and then\nSo I started speaking to him and I just said a few words 'cause I knew he had need to get in to do the event and that was about the end of it but he sent me an email\nI can read it too if you'd like kind of he says at that point and reason that I had no other choice if I wanted to compete in the event I decided to give it a shot and so he he did call me\nSaid the practitioners first words or something like well we just got to get it right on there and he continued with the moment the practitioner started to talk at all became a blur I felt as though there was this great goodness flowing through my whole body and his if a weight was being lifted off my shoulders and went immediately from feeling ill to my normal self\nI realized that I was hailed and then took another couple of minutes for me to realize that the healing wasn't just temporary but lasting\nI'm I moved on with my day and then give another thought even the possibility of feeling ill I was able to compete and it turned out to be one of my best competitive days I Won a silver buckle and he continues he says that evening after putting up my horse and equipment and I called a practitioner\nThank you told me to know that God loves me that sounded pretty convincing to me is I had just had this wonderful healing and I felt gone from off and then the wife was real tender wife wrote and said\nSally ... ... ... New York the following is a pain program W allies airing in this program constitutes neither an endorsement of the products offered boy the ideas expressed in\nToday's show is provided for entertainment and general information purposes opinions expressed or those of the presenter only we make no promises are guarantees of investment performance online trading academy is not a broker dealer certified financial planner or registered investment advisor enjoy the show [noise]\nWelcome to the show if you're a first time listening or we are fleas very pleased to meet you my name is Ryan and joining me today I I always like I almost always say joining as always but every now and then later you get pulled out last somewhere and we have\nShown that comes in with us but that is not today once again what are we back to back to back weeks where we've been able to have Larry Larry Larry in Studio on the radio with us\nI got Larry Jacobson here Larry how are you doing doing great Ryan how're you doing this way of doing awesome and for our listeners out there Larry is the top instructor and online trading academy and the director of instructor development\nSo it's easy to see why usually referred to him as the brains of the operation out here\nBut one of the things that I Love about this show Larry and I get really amped up for this we chat about it a lot will be getting ready for the show and\nThis shows a ton of fun to do and and how can it not be a ton of fun when we're just talking about ways where we can really generate more income inside of the financial markets and we usually start to show off very similar way it's all about consistency 'cause at that point never changes right that point never change it's all about consistent income it's not about\nMaking money once right it's about making money over a period of time and having that consistent stream of income that you can count on\nRight that you can count on not something that well hopefully this works out raise that that that step by step process that can generate more income in our lives whenever we're focusing on the consistency side of the things\nWe also have to take into consideration well we want consistent income we'd have a consistent strategy the market goes up down in the market also could go sideways right an unchanged market lately we've been having a lot of that down market we've been having a lot of those\nFour hundred point downs on the on the U.S and people can have it or foreign point down on the Dow and even the other day you know what other foreign points backup and so it's almost like a a a a reminder of of springtime back in February and we had the big drops in the big rallies or stuck in this area of volatility again is which is one of the things they call a traders market\nAnd it's a traders market because it kind of those by and hold situations can be a little bit painful and so having that consistent approach of being able to get in and get out as the market is kind of\nRocking back and forth it's something that can be very simple but also very lucrative and so what are some of the things you guys are doing right now Larry what's your instructor team really help people kind of harnessed this volatility and generate that consistent income inside the market's great question right you know at first and foremost I just want to say it's so great\nTo have some people listening and a lotta times our students are constantly focused on how do they get their financial futures back we just mentioned you know you've had this volatility in the markets and most people who don't know what they're doing a freaking out right now because they see the market goes down then it goes back up it goes down and they're waiting for a sign\nWell the sign has been it's already passed because right now you have so many opportunities in the market to learn how to make trades in the markets go up and go down\nAnd most people have learned their whole lives only make money when the markets go up when it goes down it's a bad thing well we're here to tell you right now it's an excellent thing when the markets go down because markets have a tendency to fall three times faster than they go up\nAnd if you look at two thousand of the year two thousand they Wall Street made the most money during this time when markets we're correcting them they were when the markets or even rallying and this is called shorting the market it's completely legal\nAnd a lot of people have come to the academy have realized that if you want to know what it's like and you're wondering how to get your life to a place you can quit your job to spend more time with your family then you want to start learning how to trade that's really where it begins Ryan\nAbsolutely and what if somebody came to you a ... and they said hey you know what the over the last three months you've made this much money at work\nHow would you like to make that much money in one week right because that's really what's happened over the last little bit of the markets have gone down we have erased three months worth of growth in the markets in one week's time well imagine if you could get to the point where you looked at it down market like Larry was saying it as an opportunity to generate income\nLiterally taking that opportunity and being able to make money as the markets are going down now in one week that if the thing I like to point out to everybody is the difference between ten and twenty is the same whether you're counting up to twenty or whether you're counting down to ten right if you're going twenty down to ten it's the same as ten up to twenty\nRight so when you're making money on the way down that's one of the reasons why we talk about how it's like getting a raise as the markets are going down as long as you understand how to generate that income and you have that skill to generate that income\nIt's like getting a raise in this case if you take that kind of apples to apples comparison it's like making as much in a week\nAs it was it making it in three months so imagine you're your employer coming to you and saying hey how would you like to make as much as you made in the last three months in one week\nWhat would your answer be you know I Would imagine that everybody that's there would be yes\nYou know and then it would be well what do I have to do to be able to generate that income well what do I have to do to be able to make as much money in a in a week 'cause I did in the last three months where you just need to have one more skill you just need to have the skill of being able to time a bearish market and it's just like ... market it's just the other direction it's very simple\nProcess and it's something that like I say that we're talking about earlier is can be very very very lucrative and a lot of times a week and come back on to this because we want to do a little a little give away to help people get started but a lot of people look at it as and there's more risk and the thing is is there's not more risk and in some cases there's actually less risk\n... market than an abortion market but one of the things that we can do to help people get started Larry's we get a big stack of tickets here for our show today we say we give away some passes to one of these half day classes definitely especially if there's somebody out there that now believed to hit a point in their lives when they realized they deserve more we gotta we gotta help them Ryan absolutely is right now we've got to have to a class in your area\nThat have take classes where you'll see exactly what it takes to really generate that income whether the markets are going up down or whether the markets are going sideways and just a second you're going

up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nBut Larry that's one of the things I think people kind of miss on in a down market as it is we think oh it must be more risky and in some cases it's actually you can prove it out to be far less risky and it down market with how margin and different things work but at the same time\nAnything that we don't understand where usually afraid of and isn't it just mainly fear that holds people back from accomplishing their goals so absolutely you know and in fact\nI'll share a story last year with my students Jim the other day it was funny we were talking about this whole concept the fear of leaving a job\nAnd the worst thing that ever happens to any of us especially if you're listening is it all of a sudden you start working for someone else and then your net worth is tied up and to what other people define it to be let me explain what I'm Talking about Ryan so yeah I remember the old story of the frog and the frog can jump as high as it possibly wants to\nBut if he would've frog in a box and you put a lid on top of that box and all of a sudden the fraud tries a couple of times to jump\nBut it's the lead even when you take the little way the frogs still will not jump higher than it could be for\nAnd that's kind of most of us out there and we start getting into these routes we're relying on a paycheck for somebody else you start to believe we can't make any more money and what's great ... and a lot of other students\nAnd we've been doing this for over Twenty years right now is that feeling of when you first start making more money than you do at work because then all of a sudden you're this frog again you can jump very very high and all of a sudden that cap\nThat you've been believing your whole life has gone away and that's the sad part right now 'cause most people out there are stressed out that they have to stand a job they have no other outcome or vehicle when reality you can go ahead and you can short the markets\nSo great analogy like when I use is each week and I like using it as well I've said this over and over again when you're learning how to short the market meaning you're able to trade when the market goes down\nVery legal coach ... and the great part about it is I think of yourself in a car right now and you know you want to go somewhere but if the car only one and drive and never went in reverse\nYou can eventually get there it's not going to be cost efficient for gas or time but you'll have actually get there where why would you want to do that\nPeople do that everyday Ryan with their trading they're only looking in the markets to go higher and as you said when the markets go lower it could be an opportunity to buy at a discount it doesn't always mean there's a problem with the stock\nYeah absolutely right there there's opportunities all over the place and and I love what you're talking about what the frog because\n'cause it it you know teaching a class last night and I have another session with the with the same group tonight and you know I was talking about how a lot of the the the obstacles that we have to overcome our mental right and and what you're talking about the frog hitting it's had on the box and you move the box and all of a sudden they can jump up\nIs that it it is that feeling that we're putting on ourselves right and we we have the whole ... I Can't do that type of a conversation and I have a five year old son who who over and over the words I Can't or or just not even really allowed in our house because we do start to put\nThose or would you start to put those binders on us and and make it so that we realize oh if I jump high it's gonna it's gonna hurt my head it's we stop even trying you know a while ago they are you know I'm ... years and years ago they they said it was physically impossible to run a four minute mile a this ... about a week ago there was the world championships for Iron Man and Kona\nBut it's just buyers and sellers and money transfers like a farmer's market when I buy tomatoes money transfers transfers from my account into somebody else's account and it's the same thing in the financial markets and\nA lot of times we don't realize that as we're losing somebody else who made the right decision is actually out there making\nYeah and they're also living their lives to most of us right now which jobs are stressed out we're worried about losing our job especially for the correction comes again\nMost people are just one paycheck away from poverty and so a lot of our students are figuring out how do I go from being emotional to becoming strategic\nAnd the way they do that is to get the proper education learning how a three hour session can completely change your alive and you know Ryan you know I've talked about this over and over again\nHolidays are coming up at that time of year again\nEveryone's going to make their resolutions yeah right well that's kind of silly because the resolution is basically your intention to do something and the two biggest ones we hear what\nI'm going to lose weight this year they come out of out of out of debt and made our money but the difference here right now is don't just make it a resolution make it a promise to yourself that you're going to figure out a way to get more financially secure\nYeah I remember my grandpa used to say this and I remember hearing it somewhere else too but I'm just gonna give him credit for it but he used to always say\nUh the goal without a plan an executed all plan is this is a dream you know go without a plan is a dream and and that's one of the things that we spend a lot of time on an online training academy is that step by step plan\nThat step by step process on how to accomplish the goal because in the end we are we going to come up to the holidays here pretty quick and all of a sudden everybody is going to plan out their New Year's resolutions that I don't remember all the statistics we went through it back in January on the show but it ends up being something like within four weeks\nEighty percent of the people have completely given up and I'm not even thought about their New Year's resolution and part of that is there wasn't an executed plan\nThey didn't know exactly what to do tomorrow and\nThe only educated plan right now is the gyms knowing they're going to start running their commercials in there and you know\n... and they're going to make a killing thirty bucks a month but at the gym memberships skyrocket but at the same time putting our our best foot forward and giving us an opportunity to reach that financial goal is critical out there as well and and we have to do\nWhat we have to do what it takes to accomplish the goals we want to lose a little weight we got to spend a little more time on the treadmill\nAnd we want to make a little more money we've got to get those skills and one of the places where we can really start bringing the knowledge that we can work our way up into that skill set is that at one of the happy classes and we've got this tack this stack of tickets is dwindling we must be towards the end of the show but we got a few tickets left you know they give away let's do it\nRight now I've got to have to class going up in your area and they have their classes where you'll see exactly what it takes\nTo really live that life that you won't get your money making money and and I was like to see what he got two dollars or two million dollars you'd be able to see exactly what it takes to get that money generating that income that can really sustain that lifestyle that you deserve now include with your passes it's going to be a professional insiders kit and this is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nLessons on topics like enhanced the retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional and Saturday it makes it so you can get started right now\n... we need you to call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com and see if you can scores and passes there\nWere some of the other things you guys are working on right now as far as your instructor team to really help people take control their lifestyle help people do the things they want to do\nHelp them get over procrastination Ryan I mean it's amazing how many people spend so much time watching TV procrastinating coming up with a reason why they can't do something and what if you only need it to take maybe a third of the time that you're doing right\nYeah we the crafting of watching TV just to learn how to trade and make more money\nSo I asked you to solve the time you ever wondered what your life would be like if you could quit your job or if you could spend more time with your family a lot of our students now are starting to actually\nMake money while they're on vacations I have June one of my students recently and she sent me a postcard from Costa Rica and she said it's great I'm playing golf is has been my dream but I'm also trading on the trip and of course when she came back I asked you trade before after and she went\nBefore of course so she'd get up early in the morning because the one thing about having an education and being able to trade it any time with an Internet connection that computer is there are several markets to trade it's twenty four hour marketplace right now so the rules have changed and people are finding that they can take back their lives\nAnd actually start doing some of the things they want to do as opposed to working for someone else which is what is the required to do of themselves\nYeah there was a there was a book I read a little while ago called the world is flat and it talked about a lot of outsourcing in a different kind of business strategies but it talked a lot about technology and how technology has really kind of level are made this playing field\nA very level and it makes a it makes it difficult on some business has to be competitive and it makes it easier on other businesses to get going and that's very true inside of the markets because\nWith the with the Internet connections that we have with the data stream so we have it it really is this this this marketplace where it doesn't matter what your background is it doesn't matter where you from it doesn't matter even how much money really you're getting started with everybody has access to the same information\nInside of the markets and so it doesn't matter where we come from it only matters where we're going and we stay focused\nKind of on that go hand in that we do everything necessary to accomplish it and that's kind of that great it's a great relief point where you you get to a point in life or you go you know what\nI can do whatever I whatever I Want to do I don't have to go and do this I can go and do that and that's what that financial freedom is\nThat's where your sleeping easy at night and there's really nothing to worry about and a drop in the market is just another opportunity to give yourself a raise now one of the things that we can do to help a few people get into this point to take that first step right getting started as the most critical step\nIs it looks like we've got ten tickets left this must be the end of the show so before we on the show before we before we before we sign off Larry what about doing another give away\nIf others did was helped ten people right now be able to figure out how to spend more time with their family absolutely it's totally worth it\nAbsolutely right now we have a half day class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes really generate more income multiple streams of income and really live life on your own terms after all it is all about the financial freedom now just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes the one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a good time to pull over\nIncluded with your passes it's going to be a professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nLessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional inside her kid makes it so you can get started right now\n... we need you to call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ...

thanks for joining us sorry go away it's my pleasure Terry tell us a little bit about your book or\nYou know well sure ah it's ... it's the story of two very unlikely or people or Al Smith\nWho was born on the lower east side of Manhattan ah he was a a grandson of a Irish Catholic immigrants are dropped out of grade school dropped out of St James school in on the lower east side or right before he was supposed to graduate from eighth grade\nAnd sort of ... made himself into one of the great but\nSadly forgotten a political figures are of the early ... century not just in New York but in the United states say he was the first Catholic to a win a major party presidential nomination he ran for president in the Nineteen twenty eight and was defeated however that year\nAh to succeed him as governor of New York he chose and\nThe voters also chose a guy by the name of Franklin Roosevelt with whom he had become very friendly Roosevelt of course did not grow up on the lower east side of Manhattan he grew up up up the river Ninety miles north in Hyde Park or he was from an old money uh\nPatricia in Protestant background or had gone to Harvard or as an undergrad went to Columbia Law school so these are two very different people [noise] uh nine years apart a Smith was born or nine years earlier than FDR\nBut in New York in the Nineteen twenties they sort of came together and in at least in my telling a created a a a acidic space and indeed a political party\nThat was much more open to the outsiders in American society as they were to find in the twenties and by that I basically mean Catholics and Jews the sons and daughters of immigrants or from the uh\nMid to late Nineteen century So Frank how is the story about how these two very unlikely people came together in New York at a time when New York really was the you know political powerhouse of the United states\nAnd and created a ... a political atmosphere that was very different from that of the nineteenth century\nIt Turner you said that Al Smith was largely forgotten but I got to tell you my favorite political event and I got to go to work for the first time in two thousand sixteen is the Al Smith dinner\nHeld this past week we sell this past week on a Thursday evening that phrase so they knew when he when Haley with the with the speed\nJose thanks for being with us thank you so much for having me Jose what's an undocumented undocumented citizen if you're undocumented you can't be a citizen Kenya\nOh well that's the whole conversation on our house so I'm undocumented I I grew up in Mountain View where I'm On what I'm Talking to you from right now I'm I've been here twenty five years since I was twelve years old so it's just kind of you know America is\nMy home this is where I became whatever it is that I Am now um and I would argue that citizenship is more than just\nBorn here and having the right person to be here [noise] um I Would argue that citizenship is actually\nBeing a contributing part of this country being a part of society and engaging in society and I would argue that documented immigrants actually exhibit a great amount of ship that is beyond papers and beyond laws\nNow is that you're thirty seven years old now so you been here for a very good about a quarter century what have you tried to become a a documented citizen in in that time\nSo I I also happen to be in journalists have been a journalist since I was sixteen years old\nI'm and I found it a hounding that we talk about this issue so much you know a president you know\nDonald Trump got elected president because of this issue and people don't know that there is no line there's no magical line for people like me to get behind a quarter ... just get legal [laughter] like you just ask you that question like I'm supposed to just like turn on a switch in the kitchen\nOr it's like going to the DMV or I mean like I Want to I Want to get my car registered yes you do\nYou work like the fact that most people including journalists whose job it is it warmed up probably think that it's just easier that tells you kind of what the problem\nIs I think what's a what's asked this question though who say I mean if the ... do you believe that countries have a right to have borders oh I can control their own borders into control who could come in and out of the country so if you accept that so if you accept that and say OK in your case you were twelve years old when you\nCame here so you were a kid and you must have been a visa right when you came here so you were inspected when you came into the country\nI was twelve so I actually don't remember I\nRespected meaning that McCain came out of but I Am so you went through customs\nYeah yes although again I don't know\nWhat to be perfectly honest I don't remember that entire process all the number was I was introduced to this man and the Philippines to my mom told me with my uncle but I'm Filipino so everybody's an uncle you know we have huge Catholic family right so then I got here and then my grandfather gave me a green card with she said\nWas my piece of ID I remember odd about it\nI went to the DMV forty years after writing to America not too far actually from what I'm Talking to you right now\nUm when did it in the apply for drivers from it and then found out that the Green Party say no I'm actually not when the woman at the end be said that it was fake I thought\nI thought she thought I thought she thought I was Mexican yeah whenever anybody's it anything about him you know illegal anything or fake papers he was always ... ... ... and so she was wrong right and then my grandfather confirmed that yes um\nHe did smog over here you know he paid four thousand five hundred dollars she's a lot of money for a security guard\nI'm In his plan was I was supposed to marry a woman I'm a U.S citizen and while waiting to get married work under the table job with a janitor at the market\nSo that was the plan and then of course when he said that to me you know I was just I didn't know that was the plan and I actually just came out to him at that point is gay I told him you know look I'm gay I Can't\nLie about one more thing right um so that's what I read the book is structured you know lying acting in hiding the that is what make twenty five years of existence in this in this country has been about\nWhile well but believe it or not and I think you know the so it was like because you've you've commented on it but I'm not sure if you know this monsignor\nA school in in Mountain View California is now named Jose Antonio Vargas school they did you go to school the ... does that mean like you get to use the gym anytime you like I mean I mean that's got to be a ... all joking aside I mean that's got to be a big honor the fact that are on documentary and yet now people are learning in school named after you\nYou got all of America that's the one thing I mean the other thing is all I keep thinking about actually yesterday I just met with the principle of the school after my Jones and the principal and he was just giving them more details about the scores from ... to uh\nGet it right into fifth grade and all I keep thinking about is that at a time like this and you know this is the most anti immigrant era in modern us history the only a knowledge is times ... is really the nights when right when we were boring Italians and Greeks and polish people from coming here [noise]\nUm [noise] all I can think of this at a time like this every community has to really decide how they define American\nRight in my community Mountain View where I'm from right I Want to you before Google got here [laughter] my community decided that I'm One of them because this is where I'm from\nThe paper's dumped ... mean anything in the end I I Know you said and and this was a\nA conservative argument that that is made against an undocumented immigrants where they say you know you don't pay taxes and you said undocumented workers pay taxes you paid your income tax and state and federal\nThan the two thousand Fifteen there was a forty two thousand dollar tax lean against you from the IRS she was that it was that a mix up because of the green card I Know you hate it so I don't do it but uh that's a conservative said see that that's that's Jose being hypocritical\nWell actually we await as they look so let's talk about hypocritical right so we're not supposed to be here according to the government\nBut according to the IRS we're supposed to be taxes pay taxes so I ... I actually have paid so much taxes I should be a Republican in so much [laughter] so when I came out as an documented seven years ago to and then you know basically out and myself and said okay like\nI'm here at that time President Obama was wording about four hundred thousand immigrants so if I'm here\nDo you know they're not you know to them that you want me to pay into the system like what exactly is this contract that we have as many ways is All right it's an understanding between of government and a part of I'm part of this country\nOr what what you learned in what you well basically has the right\nSo the government said the so again think about it I Am paying taxes to the very government that the teams and works like I contribute to that entire process\nBut if you're out there a lot like you're doing it every right now and you'll be all you know I don't like 'em to sound like it would be pretty easy to find you and deport young yeah but he really\nGoing to be at a Starbucks you know what I mean any harm us in America does it you don't mean coffee ... matter he would do I am more than happy to pay the taxes I ... I would've check to the department of treasury for forty five thousand dollars the department of treasury was more than happy to\nCash a check yet to say I am and you know what the question I Wonder is ... ... I'm I'm going to perish with a lot of a Mexican American sort of Central American uh parishioners and uh and and I remember having an experience where somebody found that somebody was undocumented which completely threw me I had no idea\nUh I I Want you to talk for a moment about the psychological component of\nBeing here uh and and being an American but not being an American you know\nI I mean I have to say I've been traveling the country nonstop at about seven years and when I go to places like Arkansas and taxes and you know Wisconsin I mean where would the Catholic Church be without immigrants documented or in documents\nRight I mean the Catholic Church in terms of um in terms of\nThe congregants and people the families that so many of them are ... families documented or an ... so I just wanted I observed to the psychological toll and that's really what I Want that that was my golden writing the book because you hear so much about this issue but yet we don't really understand what the human toll is rising\nSo leaving little anecdote um I was an event ... months ago just have about a minute Jose so um and this this US citizen young man whose parents are undocumented said that she still worried about his mom and his mom said to him my son don't worry die just the hiding me\nTwenty and he will continue to hide yeah\nSo that is that gives you a sort of a window into what the mindset is that of undocumented immigrants\nAnd the notion of hiding the stress and everything that's associated with kind of hiding it takes a real takes a real toll on people and\nThe way in which they and wish to live their life and try to live healthy integrated lives who say I'm very grateful for you to spend some time with us here in the arena it's deer America notes from an undocumented citizen\nJose Antonio Vargas thank you very much for being with us and look at the book goes I think ... thank you for having me thank you all for being with us and the word hold you will in the palm of his hand\nThey're proceeding was a paid program W O Lars airing of this program constitution either an endorsement of the products offered for the ideas expressed Shelley you are you a exhale age detail in New York\nI'm like well I have one for early voting is starting in many states and any mega our Powerball winners of our area is Len Burman and Michael Ritalin on Monday six to today I'm On the voice of New York seven ...
