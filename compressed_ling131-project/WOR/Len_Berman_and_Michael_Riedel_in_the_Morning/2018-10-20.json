{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "How we're concerned that it will ah manipulate\nThe information at a strategic level that will harm our interests are not only you know interference of elections\nUm but uh certainly and jeopardize our dominance in space our satellites of course the Chinese have an anti satellite capability they're\nShooting literally for the moon and they're building a capability to put a space station up very shortly\nNow they're doing the types of things that maybe twenty Thirty years ago we as the United states we're\nWe're talking about I'm beginning to do while they're rapidly catching up and you know this is caught our attention that's why\nYou know the president and the Pentagon\nAnd wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as\nUntrue competitors are near peer competitors across the board and it's not not just the military it's economic it's diplomatic ah it's all these other areas that\nShow national capability and national power and we're finding that our adversaries are are doing quite well thank you\nHow concerned should we be with the fact that Google arguably one of the most powerful companies in the world I knew a monopoly on the distribution of dissemination of information\nOr appears to be in bed with the government of the People's Republic of China and it's helping them\n[noise] censor information in that country\nAnd they're manipulating algorithms so that they can monitor your own population and of course they won't negotiate any longer with the Pentagon on you know those types of things on the use of the cloud et cetera um that that's disturbing um\nYou know they are a U.S company and you would think that they would have some allegiance to this country and not become a pond in the hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're\nDoing I suppose to a certain degree because they see a rising Chinese economic power and they want to be part of the success of that a country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates or be the world's\nLeading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five you know somewhere around there um and unless something dramatically happens in a very different way they're going to achieve that they're going to have\nA leverage using what I outlined earlier the belt and road initiative which is pouring hundreds and billions of you know maybe a trillion and a half\nAcross the world and arguably at least sixty eight countries where they're buying infrastructure and thereby markets and they're controlling information flow you know you I see the the Internet and what can be used and what can be so they're strategically doing some very bright very smart things\nUh but when you look at their autocratic regimes and their president for life under President Xi and the amendment of their constitution and you're seeing something similar\nUnder putting with the possibility of ruling for a long period of time and the collaboration across all these fronts\nSharing of technologies and kind of they kind of have to love one another because ah the rest of the world doesn't seem to like them except they're holding to them because they're being bought up to a certain degree by the Chinese\nI'll ask you um about\nSaudi Arabia and how important it is the United states uh to maintain this\nAlliance with a bad actor in a bad neighborhood or given of course the show he um the brutal slaying of of a cause she'll be um and how that might mean there is there a dominoes at\nPlay here obviously I'm Wondering ... with what your thoughts are on how we should proceed or how the United states where the Trump Administration should proceed ah with with Saudi Arabia and how that plays into all of this a sort of this do Cold War scenario\nYou know it's never simple as that and the cars so sugary a situation is is tragic but if you've been watching Mohammed bin psalm psalm and you\nKnow the crown prince uh you know he's probably been cut down a few notches here recently especially with [noise]\nAnd those so called ... and the the desert which uh he was expecting all these uh donors and investors to come over and pat him on the back and giving more money so we can develop a true economy that's not based solely upon the\nWilliam um we have a lot invested in the ... the Saudis we have a lot of Americans over there are a lot of technology they're totally dependent upon our arms of course\nThey should go to the Chinese or Russian but they don't want to because ours typically are much better I think the big question and that part of the world one is oil\nOn it and how are they going to use dollars in the future but also Iran Iran is not to be a cry for with and of course their their major adversary against the Saudis\nAnd the Russians and Chinese or or wind up with Iran and were lined up with a yard a regime\nUm there were ... they they've got um you know a way of doing things uh that uh certainly in the west we're not all excited about 'em but the reality is that um\nYou know a friend of mine you know my friend you know what the expression Richard a friend of my enemy is my friend or something like that that\nThe idea being that we we have to have partners in that part of the world it's a dangerous game this airplane receive\nThat evolved over the years in Iraq we see it in Syria [noise] you know even you know what I'm reporting or we're just welcome\nPresident Sisi of Egypt up and to Moscow for for this within the last couple of years and\nYou know they made big arms deals and they're talking nuclear power plant in ... uh for these sorts of issues are on the forefront if we abandon the Saudis now\nOh more times just flying by and looks like it's going to be a nice full weekend um it was nice yesterday and although it has been pretty chilly I've I've kinda gotten used to that Seventy and eighty degree weather this was a\nKind of a quick change here but hey that's what happens this time of year already looking back at the news this week obviously most of the uh news dominated by the killing of the Washington Post columnist Jamal ... he was pretty much executed in the Saudi constantly in Turkey\nA President Trump is come to the conclusion that he's dead um we don't know if I'll fish ally you'll know officially who's responsible but um you look ... everybody knows the Saudis did this right it's just a matter of who you're going to pin the blame on a and I think it's also pretty clear that this\nProbably was done at the behest of not the direct order from the crown prince Mohammed bin salaam\nThe question is how do we as the United states of America deal with the deliberate execution of a reporter who was critical of the Saudi regime\nDo we want to um cancelled contracts worth a hundred billion dollars that will probably caused an economic hardship here or do we want to separate ties with the Saudis\nDespite the fact that they've been held full and are dealing with the the Middle East issues as they exist now and uh I guess kind of helping in the fight against terrorism mobile you really don't know really don't know and then you know obviously the Saudis were involved in a\nSmall part may be a major part in the nine eleven attack so why are these people our friends uh you know this is this is foreign policy sometimes you deal with people you don't like\nSometimes you deal with very ugly characters and I'm ... I I Can't we can't impose American style morals in every country we deal with I mean these countries are they're their own on their own so\nUh it's a very difficult decision for the president he's promised severe consequences and I think there should be\nYou know you don't want to be ... around with a country that that executing people like that but\nThen they can live with North Korea to\nNorth Korea I mean I became ... brother with a rocket I mean there's there's brutal people out there so I'm kind of hard to know what to do and what his right um you know it's not right what happened to ...\nUh I don't have the answer I don't know the answer and ah you know I I Know there's a lot of wringing their hands here how how dare the president wait so long and a cover for the Saudis but it's very very complicated here's another complicated issue Annette ... caravan of migrants coming from Honduras\nTo the U.S border with Mexico now that's a long walk I mean any of them Honduras through Central America and Mexico to the U.S border\nAnd a bill will be here and a couple of weeks the president's threatening to send troops there to stop them from coming in now I got to ask you\nAs an American citizen we have four thousand maybe five thousand or more obese migrants who want to flee Honduras coming to the U.S border we want to do you want to open the door and say come on hey we got ...\nWhat what do you think you think is that the best thing to do\nDo we vet them a I'm sure there's some pretty CD characters among that group don't you think\nWhat do you do do you open the doors and say come right in I think that's what the Democrats are saying uh I think a ... ... you can't you can't let them come in there's a process for entering the United states\nAnd it has to be followed although from what I have heard I think there is some kind of a deal with\nThe Trump Administration and the government of Mexico to the kind of monitor these people and to maybe weed them out and if there are some hardship cases where asylum or sanctuary is necessary but it might be provided this crazy I mean these are very complicated issues I have a look at\nIt got to bring up this one the cofounder of Facebook wants to repeal the Trump tax cuts\nNow Chris Hughes is the guy's name he spoke to CNBC and basically he claims just a third of Americans have reap the benefits of the president's tax cuts\nProbably because a lot of people in America don't pay taxes you don't make enough to pay taxes and the taxes are predominantly paid by people at the upper end of the income scale so that's why only a third have gotten the tax cuts so uh what the democratic senator Kamala Harris has decided to do\nIs to introduce a bill to repeal the Trump tax cuts\nAnd instead use that money to give five hundred dollars a month\nTo people who are poor\nNow that's a that's a brilliant idea\nThat's a ... and now that's what's at stake in the mid term elections face speaking of politics my Kelly from the Bergen record is going to be joining me in the next half hour of talk about that big Senate race over New Jersey a Bob Menendez facing a very tough challenge we'll see what my Kelly thinks about that\nAnd uh hey one more thing speaking of a kind of crazy laws the NYPD new right to know act took effect yesterday\nSo basically this was in response to the controversy over stop and frisk I was not a fan of stop and frisk as the ... the way it was implemented during the the Kelly years uh and so any time there was an interaction now between a police officer and the person on the street\nOr the officer has to give you a business card that will identify the officer and provide information on where you can go to complain if you didn't like how you were dealt with\nAnother brilliant law more overreach All right it's the job on the Saturday show good morning to you especially parents from Alice Stockton wrote Seaney and just I'm I'm we're going to be

I don't think I've talked to about it but I I really think the big problem here and I I don't like seeing it his ...\n[noise] [noise] yeah so if it's one of the ... the kid at the rules that you have\nNot even sure that she can now he is if you think he's going to be the guy is okay let's shoot 'em up and she's not going to play in behind it offensive line that might\nTake his progress back a couple of years ago right but\nI think at this point if you think he's the guy or could be\nThe guy in she would've got and the good news is always complain of last year when they took Barclay\nWith the number two picking a quarterback they're going to have a top five this year so not tours\nYes I Know they're going to have another horrible yeah but this as a giant fan too horrible years in a row and you're not used as I used to you know a a a quick turnaround there were so much more than\n... back in the way is five and I\nThrew 'em but look at the the jets are are doing well a Sam Donald their quarterback pick seems to be the right thing for the jets\nI think this is a relatively easy call or should be an easy call for Murphy but as in so many cases that he ... his first year in office he keeps tripping over himself up and you know uh with with someone ...\nYou know a credibly accused as somebody of sexual assault there is a\nProcess the on how they should be handled it and Murphy I think uh didn't really get out of the box fast enough or this he said he said so caught up with with this little bit there's going to be an investigation of this the legislatures involved and and various\nPeople notably uh uh the the the the defense attorney Michael ... who was involved with the British gate trial oddly enough has been hired by the state legislature to help conduct some sort of an investigation so uh yes there's there is a\nThis this issue's going to be investigated but I think for a few days there Murphy looked very very decisive on it and and I think these these kinds of of of of\nYou know management problems keep cropping up with him my criticism of Murphy's that he he just seems very experienced right now and I think his first year in office is is a real burning curve for him or\nThe problem is we've got some real problems not the least of which is this accusation of sexual assault but the other problem this looming ... you know constantly ... to ... uh the background is a New Jersey transit which is what\nThousands of of people in New Jersey use every day and they just can't count on it anymore and I think Murphy is running out of time before he needs to fix this problem\nNo he's done a couple of news conferences and made a lot of statements on these things but we haven't seen really action\nThe trains need to run on time it's ... it's a it's a cliche but I think politicians\nNeed to make the trains run on time and if they can do that they will earn the trust of the people and Murphy has pretty much squandered this whole year with New Jersey transit he knew this was a problem coming into office and what did he do he he he he\nYou know call for some big study of New Jersey transit and you know I wrote a column about this was a waste of time we all\nKnew what the problems were New Jersey transit [noise] uh you know and and yes things are happening he's he seems to have pulled its good people to run the transit agency but I think computers are really losing patience on this I give birth the only a few more months on this will before it blows up\nAh okay my Kelly from the Bergen record here on the job on Saturday show a couple of more minutes let's let the let's talk about President Trump and his handling of this a ... a killer uh I've seen some of your ah tweets and posts and uh obviously you're not pleased with how this is going\nNo no I mean there's clear evidence that this is a journalist was murdered in ... in brutally murdered and um [noise] you know and I think Donald Trump has has kind of you know him and hard about how to handle this up\nThere there are several problems here and and and this is you know once you get um I'm actually writing a column all of this ah for Sunday you know the United states relationship with Saudi Arabia has has been has been challenging and this goes back to nine eleven when when\nYou know there was clear evidence that the Saudis were\nInvolved in some on some level with the hijackers and that story has never been fully you know flushed out and\nAnd once again we have another serious criminal act by that the Saudis seem to be involved with in this case right up to the highest levels of the Saudi Government and I I still think I I think the\nPresident has really kind of botched this so far I Hope he gets his act together because this is really really important you know we're talking about freedom of press\nAnd and the basic safety for for reporters and if if if the United states does not take a tough stand on this what we're going to look really bad in the eyes of the world and frankly the eyes of the of the American people\nAre my Kelly from the Bergen record a great guy folks check them out and look forward to seeing your column tomorrow on

Alzheimer's and the general population by thirty six percent ... percent lower risk of Parkinson's disease Louis body dementia vascular dementia now the other thing I tell you a couple of strange things about officials that you'd never cash\nSelfish laws protect you from a heart attack and from sudden cardiac death that's great I mean come on krill better job has additional ingredients in it so krill oil ... from sudden cardiac death and attack better than fish was\n\n[noise] but is it creates plasma ... and that's one of the reasons why it's so successful acting your memory knowledge and protect district or to make the brain work and where do you ... a tiny bit joke a tiny bit of chicken\n\nAnd while\nYou're not getting ... officials she's Alps or a good source also but you know I don't ...\nI'm\n... make the structure of the brain she'll besides the krill giving the three facts that make the memory work and reduce inflammation would bring they also make the structure of the brain\nAnd help the brain cells work better help prevent brain cells from dying\nThey also built bomb this is weird there's certain things that build bone that you would never guess I mean we all know Cal ships important for your bone and exercise and eating your green leafy vegetables I think everybody knows that certain forms of vitamin e build bone called took all trials\nGreen tea builds bone but the krill oil builds bomb it helps prevent a hip fracture\nBecause krill creates plasma allergens and plasma allergens are very important to the substance and integrity of the cells in the

extract so special cartilage Exxon special and college and is on special so maybe I'll just talk from my hard on the college college in is a structural protein\n\nMany tissues and your body have a very large college in content but here's the problem\nAt the age of twenty five year college in production slows down when you're growing your body is very efficient at converting dietary protein from eggs or some chicken or some beans and to college you\n'cause you're growing you need more college and you need more structural tissue you need more connective tissue and natural college and mix but once you stop growing\nThe body doesn't have a lot of surplus\n\nFactors et cetera college in production structure slow now the body gets a little mean about it\n[noise] so by the time we were fifty\nA year college in production has slowed down let me do the math twenty five thirty five or thirty seven percent now that's important\nBecause college in accounts for Seventy percent of your skin a major reason why people get some damage I mean ... excuse me a major reason why people get this coloration from sun damage or wrinkles from\nDamage is because they're not replacing chicken with new college in\nSeventy percent of your skin is college and the other thirty percent is mostly a long chain carbohydrate called ... which sticks on to the college in and these things hold the moisture in ...\nHave actually shown that when you give people what sun damage college and it helped to repair the damage\nHow when you get older people college in its beauty that radiation from the inside outwards you literally are filling and the wrinkles your ... literally your skin producing cells become dormant in your fifties because they don't have enough college in ...\nWhen you gave us fifty year old college in or thirty five year old or Seventy year old [noise]\nThis skin producing cells called cyber blessed to come back on line and they start knitting together skin on your skin

about ten studies of older men and women getting rid of wrinkles and rebuilding Michigan the coloration stuck to go away we called up ... can you call it liver spots it's caused by pollution\n[noise] college in also makes your hair and nails\nAs you grow older there's less college in content and your hair so you hit gets that kind of fly away wispy than look it looks like it's then again when you take the college in your hair performers and is in fact younger and fills out it looks a lot thicker and it's it it has that youthful appearance\nSay what your nails your nails will grow and they won't ship and they won't break and that's almost foolproof\nBut while you're improving outside you're also tremendously improving ... college in interacts with\nMinerals and fish oils to create bone\nAnd vitamins a vitamin D vitamin K vitamin C beta carotene there they're all involved it's complex building bone is complex bonus complex because don't forget all your blood cells and your immune system come out of your bone rank your white blood to your red blood cells you play let's deal combating a ball\nNon GMO all of our products at all of our ingredients are non GMO so they're not

could help we're getting help from the caller Jay checks\nSo to college in actually helped to repair the joint the cartilage has prevented from getting worse\nAnd between the two it's like a great treat the any do you have to do both know you could do either one\nBut I find like even the worst case scenarios I'm helping people that I never thought I could help Whitney pain when it was so much

capsule easy to swallow you take a once a day you're done you will thanked me\nThe last thing on special of course I didn't leave myself enough time has grape seed extract so let me explain what that is a little bit grape seed extract is an unbelievably powerful antioxidants\nAnd it's such a strong antioxidant data near proves the working ability of your big blood vessels your arteries\nArteries carry oxygen rich blood away from the heart showed supply artery supply oxygen rich blood to the brain and the bank original liver and kidneys and your muscles and everything you scan\nAnd high blood pressure takes place in arteries that's where it generally takes place that's she won the heart problems it's giving pressure to the arteries to carry to plug throughout the book\nShelf the arteries don't work well if they're ... and the heart squeezed the heart has to pump harder and faster to push the blood through to get the blood to your brain and your kidneys and your muscles that center\nThat's high blood pressure so wide open up your blood vessels it's actually a gas as like inflating attire educators called nitric oxide\nNitric oxide is unbelievably unstable it's easily corrupted and then it becomes noxious it becomes harmful or it's converted into something toxic for the blood vessels coal production I drink\nThe grape seed is such a powerful antioxidant it works better than other antioxidants it stabilizes the nitric oxide and then the nitric oxide is available to pump all open your blood vessels and because of this you have improved blood flow and they've shown even and people were clogged arteries\nPeople with heart disease that when you give 'em grape seed just fewer strokes and heart attacks there's a lower need for um a bypass surgery and ... of the heart because the blood vessel rocks you working better blood flow is more smoothly and dependable and you have a lower risk of clotting\nGreat shade has powerful research behind it that it

European no fence I just don't I don't I don't see it I think everything hinges off of what the Fed's doing but uh that's just how I take it I mean I'm not as learned as you are\nBut I I don't I I it appears to me this is just as somebody who maybe as soon as you know you are or it appears to me that the fed is almost trying to derail the economic gross we're experiencing I mean it it\nUh I don't know why we should have rates or be raised anymore we've raised him enough the economy hasn't cratered but we have experienced\nA to a mini corrections in the last you know so many months wouldn't that be time to stop or the rate hikes for a while\nI Do agree with you about this there's no need for the fed to raise interest rates inflation is\nLow as it is about inflation is extremely low and extremely stable\nSo I agree with that my my point is that even if the fed does raise interest rates and it seems like we're stuck with it that's what they intend to do [noise]\nAh it isn't going to turn upside down now you mentioned some setbacks and the stock market or lose while I'm In February and another one very recently\nThey don't seem to cover all ages all we've lost the fed is actually

anymore\nWith downturns pauses or Amy stock market panics\nNow a ... when I'm when we're talking about the history of interest rates\nWhen when did the fed kind of start this and I also want you to talk about later on inflation because and and flush this out for the average person you know we hear this stuff and\nIf you're in finance you kind of know a little bit but the average listener I think's clueless as to how these all kind of are interconnected even when you said you know inflation is low the average person might say hey you know I'm On my cost of a\n... a gallon of milk is

no such thing they give you a pint for the cost to half gallon used to you used to ... you know what I'm saying\nWell yes we have lots of inflation over the years when I say inflation is slow low now that's because we haven't really had any substantial changes in the average price of all the goods and services in the last year or two\nSilver the issue and ... and the history of the fed involvement and industries goes back I Would say the best place to start looking at this is around Nineteen thirty nine\nWhen they don't break the wall\nOr in Europe or the United states already was starting to put a full of eventuality that they would be ... involved in the end the war and they needed to be financially I'm ... I'm well equipped for that and the fed began at that point\nTo a fix or not exactly to fix industries but to get involved in the interest rate market and it did so in the market it was a ... influencing alone to bond prices on long term bond\nYields a bike in Nineteen thirty nine forty and this and of course when the U.S didn't go so in ... he won a there was a a logic Spanish and in this plan\nAnd their idea was to keep interest rates as low as possible so the federal government could borrow very favorable rates in order to finance its war um but\n[noise] and ah evolved over time it was a a effective during the war and then after the war\nThere was a short period where the fed really didn't have a function of salt\nAnd it shows that the any of the Nineteen fifties and of course we had another war that time the Korean War but at this point the fed has moved over to take a more interested in short term interest rates and the fed began to peg short term interest rates\nRoughly at the time that the Korean War came to an end and it's being Peggy short term interest\nRates ever since\n... were were David ... talking about the history of interest rates so basically the fed has been should we say manipulating do you think it's been a constructive force in the economy and negative force\nFor my opinion is that it hasn't been constructive that she'll find many many economists who think he turns ... this is very\nDisputed my own belief is that a financial markets couldn't take care of their own and that the interest rate that they come up with\nIs the ... straight to allow the economy to operate without any frictions once you start manipulating interest rates creating uncertainties and frictions wish for that so that's my personal point of view\n... and and we're seeing this too with a lot of people questioning the independence of the fed now and I'm trying to bolster their independence and in some way\nA ... like the U.S Supreme Court members there there are appointed by the president but they're trying to say hey we're independent no matter what and we're not going to let the president and tell us how to\nAccommodate a by their party you know it it's been sort of a staple but what about the the the onlookers who says you know\n... when we had a president that was maybe ... more palatable the members of the fed interest rates were kept a low for a little too long\nAnd they always invoke you know these various rules\nTo say well no we were following this role but then when you looked at the rule or that might have caused for negative interest rates and I want you to flush the sound the way that our listeners can sort of understand what's going on with\nNegative interest rates the Taylor rule inflation in the next segment because I think a lot of people are are kind of clueless on that their eyes glaze over so we're going to\nTake one more or the next segment to break down all of these rules that the fed uses\nAnd we'll talk about inflation up next this is Josh ... the financial quarterback and if you want the window of opportunity review there is a seven year window\nOf an opportunity to potentially get smart about taxes on your retirement\nThe smart retirement book will be yours free when you schedule and keep your no obligation review will be in New York New Jersey Connecticut Long Island in Pennsylvania so call us now waited eight Ninety they Josh shady they ... five six seven for don't touch that dial eight I deferred\nVehicles such as moral one k.'s and IRAs sound good up front but did you realize that when you retire you'll have to pay taxes on all your earnings you can legally minimize your taxes when you withdraw retirement funds with tax free IRAs and other tax favorite accounts\nCalled the ... ski advisory group now at eight eight eight nine eight eight Josh that's eight eight eight nine eight eight J.
