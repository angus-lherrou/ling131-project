someone to run against Susan Collins you know they're going to try to uh go after all of the senators who voted\nFor a cab and all the ones in a swing states we have close in tight races but what's very interesting and this Joe is what the Democrats did not bank\nThis fight has energized the Republican base and\nThe Republicans now who may have been a little lethargic a little disappointed in Trump maybe not going to turn out for the midterms they see that this fight to tear down Kavanaugh is the preliminary to the fight to impeach President Trump and I think that's going to turn them out\nYeah made this and and it's the weapon of choice is character assassination right somehow someone Trump is\nKind of immune to that he ... he is that when you can say\nI mean they have said the worst things possible by this guy and it does just sort of bounce off his back\nYeah I I well I'm trying to say why why can't you destroy his character because I mean we all we all know the\nFlaw exactly nothing is going to surprise that are on the most genius thing about Trump is it's all out their baby is who I Am you voted for me anyway so bring it on because of the people who supported me they're just kind of shrugged their shoulders and say yeah tell me something I didn't\nKnow him ... ... in case of Kavanaugh he ... he was brought up on something you did in high school\nAnd the capital came out as a boy scout studio is a good man coaches sports never did anything wrong so when all this the ah stuff came out about his drinking and his alleged sexual assaults that didn't compute with the image that he was putting out there so that's why I became a problem\nFor maybe it's better to start with the unclean image as opposed to as a boy scout\nGrab by the you know what you're saying [laughter] mayhem self a meal and you know land\nOr at any time during the day they weigh in on all this stuff out confirmation the left wing going nuts that really fascinates me one eight hundred three two one zero seven ten one eight hundred three two one zero seven ten so now\nBecause the left wing is so furious so furious that cabin I was going to the Supreme Court there's already talk about old fashioned court packing that Roosevelt tried to do back in the thirties when the Supreme Court was not supporting his new deal policies and he wanted to expand the court there's already talk now on the left\nOf expanding the number of justice is from nine to eleven so when a Democratic president is is is in the White House he can put her she can put a more left wing or is up there to redress what they see as the imbalance on the court tilting to the\nRight well that's not going to happen for another six years at least\nKnow what do you see and and the other thing too there is talk and it was congressman Adler my congressman who was talking about impeaching Kavanaugh if the Democrats get\nControl of the house of representatives that's never been done if never admitted on what grounds ... what do you think that would stop them you know that would stop them no not at all but there's no grounds to impeach him know and if they impeach him then why why stop at him why not impeach Clarence Thomas to dredge up all the Anita Hill stuff try to take a bus down I wouldn't put it past the Democrats are trying to do that\nYou know I think that Ruth ginsburg may have done something like ... and her family in her early years\nWell when you talk about the partisanship\nOf of Brett Kavanaugh how can you possibly be fair and rule on anything that uh the left wing brings before the court what about Ruth Bader Ginsburg who came out publicly and said she couldn't imagine this country if Trump were elected president how possibly if if some of the issues surrounding Trump get to the Supreme Court how could she possibly rule fairly\nFairly when we know that she was against terrified that Trump would be elected president it's going to recuse herself\nIs going to be interesting to see how the court comes down with some of these decisions um I I was reading over the weekend they say now John Roberts\nThe chief justice will be the swing vote yes so but I you you don't know what Kavanaugh's going to do all these guys are a wildcard right when they get in there they you know on burdened by any allegiance they can do what they feel is right\nThat's right well I think you know the the issue of roe v Wade my mind I don't see Roberts or even Kavanaugh voting to overturn roe v Wade I think both of them believe in what they would call settled law\nAnd I think Collins pointed that out that are not only a capital has said that Roberts has said that and Gorsuch the other Trump numb appointee all have said it it's settled law yeah now\nThe left wing that the this subtler thinkers on the left wing the few and far between\nBut do they see possibly the court chipping away at roe because let's face it what the left wants is blanket Robie way they actually want to say when everyone to abort the baby you can afford the baby that's where they want us right right and then little by little states can go at it talk about it and put restrictions on it that the court\nMight uphold on the state by state cases that's the concern on the subtle thinking at\nThe last the scenario that uh I've heard is that\nThere's going to be one state may be a state like Mississippi\nMhm that says we want to ban all abortions right then that case will slowly making its way up to this court right or they may be may I I don't know in in New York Governor Cuomo was already sort of worry are strengthening the abortion laws and he's not going to make it a criminal offense it would be um\nAnd there's no regulations on those things the ah from what I heard\nIs that you know a vehicle as it's made has to go through crash tests and all the meat all safety standards but that's only in its original right and but you're right it is modified it doesn't have to go through any more safety um upgrades or safety testing you can do anything you want as long as it\nPasses the safety testing a short time around it's a ... in its original ... which doesn't mean anything exactly laid\nOut I was looking at this thing and I I couldn't figure out how it could stay Richard enough not not the collapse in the middle it was that at all and obviously has like I beams or something underneath\nThere is a number of issues with this case yeah yeah I ... and again we haven't even gotten into the background the driver right right well that could be an issue\nListen when ... when this story came across my phone yesterday I I thought it was a\n... it didn't seem right to me when when versus Eighteen people killed in car Eighteen\nYeah where's that uh and then it turned out they were Eighteen to twenty see I thought the majority of the people would be bystanders yeah yeah who were killed and then when I eat out their twenty were\nIn the car [laughter] that was a ... a a new report\nSays temperatures will likely rise by one point five degrees Celsius between twenty thirty and twenty fifty two if global warming proceed at its current rate report released by the un Intergovernmental Panel on climate change says countries must take unprecedented steps to prevent global warming\nRemorse how worried when you got up this morning where you about\nTemperatures are rising by one point five degrees Celsius between twenty thirty in twenty fifty\nI didn't sleep last night because of a massive change massive oh my God you know I don't change the world the end stand why I brought that in there that doesn't that doesn't seem like it's worried about somebody is trust me they are [laughter] and they're all the United nations I get on the speeches today about it I don't bring in more to worry about it the okay All right\nAre they are literally clawing at the doors of the Supreme Court did you see the women the other thing they weren't clawing at the doors of the Supreme Court the left wing\nIt's going insane and Joe and I are going to have a little fun with that when we come back next chance to win a

O. R. dot com slash and Michael if a if you're into this kind of the okay All right so your favorite football team as the giants yes I don't think they're looking so good well I Will tell you this they look better but they still lost [laughter] I'm a first\nTime in um a long time they scored more than thirty points while thirty one points they came back Eli Manning look like you know old Eli driving down the field in the final minutes or what happened rolling a touchdown but go ahead\nBut there was a minute an eight seconds left Carolina gets the ball and the giant defense holds them by the way there was a\nCouple of crappy calls by the referee including one I thought the the giants had stopped them a lot farther brought back and they've got a first down anyway they got into a position for one of these long feel go sixty three yards which is\nA long way that's not not many people can make it of course it's the giants in Carolina makes it and they land [laughter] I'm\nGoing to now Michael [laughter] oh my\nGod the jokes are just seeing a yeah I'm kinda used to it by now [laughter] I was oh del ... junior doing oh del back\nUm junior or they really got him into the game he caught a touchdown pass through a touchdown pass to bake they tossed it to him and then he through to a fake one Barclay for touches on the joints and he looked pretty good um he did create some controversy here's patch trimmer the coach of the giants and oh Dell\nHas a big lift us you know typically when you're in a tight game and you have something good that happens [noise] um [noise]\nYeah kinda jumpstart you your your team and your emotions I thought that was a that was really well executed by everybody you know the way where we had a scheme to the way the guy's blocked it than the throwing the catch\nWhat they did is they throw the ball in the backfield too I'm Barkley mhm and everybody goes to him\nAnd then I'm Sorry to back them and then Barkley the running back sneaks out all by himself way out in the field say throw to him and he gets to touch on those are very ... very clever right um but the family the giant ended up losing the jets one though they did yeah they broke up three game losing you never know what kind of team this you're going to get what the jets sometimes they're terrible sometimes are great\nSo they get a thirty for sixteen win over the Denver Broncos have been like stadium so that's good very good for the jets now you're not a big jets fan right now I really don't care I mean that that's you know I pay attention to the giants jets are good for them [laughter]\nBut uh we do have the Yankees and the red Sox we have to talk about I us okay that resumes tonight and I was up in a ... a Cape Cod where all the Sox fans were out or going crazy with Red Sox [laughter] you gotta feed her place up there man\nWith a lot of beer drinking they all have his boss and cabbage and where you're New York Yankees cap when you were up there you know I did take it\nIn the short with me Jean said you are not taking that [laughter] you think they they probably would have attacked you yeah so anyway\nA Red Sox when the first game Yankees one Saturday Night one wanted to come back to the Bronx for game three this was the pivotal game right now when I went vis won't have to win one more\nSo um I think the odds fever the Yankees\nAre they are going with Luis ... who did a great job in the wild card game against Oakland so he'll start for the Yankees ... will be the red Sox pitcher of all these are former yanked but you've got to favor the yanks are going to play two games in the Bronx they only need we need to win too\nComing down that incline over a couple of hundred feet or maybe even a thousand feet it would it would build up quite a had a baby so that would be a dangerous situation\nYou know as an amateur investigator here I Know we have the national Transportation Safety board are going to look at everything analyze it very scientifically but you've got to think this is either a something that involves the driver\nWho had no clue what he was doing or a medical issue perhaps or some sort of mechanical failure on the part of the vehicle because you would not go into a T bone intersection\nAt that rate of speed if the if all things being equal correct\nNo absolutely I mean I think the NTSB is well worth of everything as well state police but I'm absolutely you would be breaking pretty heavily coming down this incline anyway and and to hit it at you know witnesses put it at sixty those sorts of things are always a little bit [noise] uh you know for squishy but ...\n... it had to be going to have significant rate of speed the cause of the amount of damage and also keep in mind that safely said yesterday that most of these\n... people inside limo\nDidn't survive impact so we're talking about a a a of a ... a very heavy vehicle that less than we were travelling at a pretty good clip or in order to cause that that that rates of death that quickly\nAnd Jesse tell us about the people in the limo four sisters I Believe and they were celebrating or one of the sister's birthday and she was recently married yeah\nIt's I mean just in terms of the human cost of this it was pretty terrible one time we lost four sisters and other family lost two brothers or at least two of these couples were or in our marriage you know they they have kids um there were cousins in in in the vehicle\nUm so it was really a a gang that that you are reporting showed you know there were a tight knit group that works out for a Saturday afternoon um and then of course there were two bystanders who are just going out on a you know Columbus star weekend to\nYou know by some ... or something at a at a at a store and and we're we're hit as well so it you know just in terms of randomness of this and the and the and the human toll toll it's it's pretty fast like\nIt is it's it's horrific and uh uh do you know if the NTSB it's going to do another briefing usually pretty good about this process in the first one they don't really tell you anything the second one they have a just a little bit more information to\nGive in to help us make sense of this I think that's what people are trying to do and how ... how to Eighteen people in the car to people are walking down the street guy you know you got to tell us something\nYou know I talked to ah stay place is part of some sort of bracing state I\nThink they're the lead agency at this point you know the you mentioned plane crashes it is remarkable at the last\nThe last time we have this many people killed her materials ... was two thousand nine and that was fifty people end up playing outside buffalo [noise]\nUm and I've covered your minor plane

uh\n[laughter] I don't want to read [laughter]\nApparently and I don't want to let it flip flops and not a big\nWe've got some sad news these super suicides are they just\nBecoming ... there was another one this happened last Monday fifty eight year old guy house still Luna fifty eight year old he has been over a driver seventh for higher driver to commit suicide amid financial problems\n... most of these you know normally has been taxi drivers because they spend millions of dollars for tax medallion\nIt's worth only a couple of hundred thousand if that now so this is a a ... driver who um I well you know I guess as a driver you have to invest you have to buy your car you get a license and do all the required to get up and moving and it's tough out there with thousands of these guys your hands with thousands of these guys\nTo to make a living so there was a a memorial service for um a vigil yesterday and the TLC commission Mira ... showed up and\nThey chased her away accusing her of being a murderer oh because she's with as well as the TLC attacks and lose the mission and yeah yellow cabs they haven't well they they and they haven't done anything to really help any of the drivers but I don't know what they can do you know these are business decisions Jamaican\nUh business conditions change yeah absolutely so would you know what do you want the government to make up the difference for you\nSteve in the case of ah the Democrats regaining control of the house how do they play that ... what do they do then do they let this cabinet thing rest or do they continue to pursue it [noise]\nWell I think there are some real red hot so in the Democratic party who\nAre threatening to try to impeach judge Kavanaugh or should they win the house I think that's crazy and it it would backfire it would that look like sore losers and they um uh and and I don't think that that's going to hold the day I think more sensible heads will prevail but\nUm as we've discussed before you in the house of representatives by only one vote just one\nAnd you control all the committees you have all of the power to issue subpoenas or you have the power to investigate the Donald Trump in all sorts of ways you look at that big New York times story than enormous story about Trump's finances\nOne of the things they said we we learned a lot about Trump but we still never got his personal income taxes\nFirst thing Democrats are going to do if they win the house is going to subpoena his income tax records [noise] um and so they have would have enormous power they could hire new staff investigators researchers\nThey could make life miserable for Donald Trump and the Republicans if they win the house by only one vote so I'm a a sideline do trying to impeach Kevin Orr rerun this fight would be a stupid sideline they've got a lot of more tempting targets to go after\nThe curious to get your take on the impact on that New York times story now I Know in the beltway it's been played up and it was talked about on the shows all weekend long but\nSome people I'm Talking to just you know regular voters like jeez I Wish I could have hired his accountant I mean people don't like their task is I mean [laughter] story the backlash in some way people think well that Trump family's pretty clever they got out of paying the IRS I Wish I could do that\nA short and look at it it it's not a news story that Donald Trump or his finagle down his taxes and uh and and the fact is that or if he\nHad nothing to hide he would have put out his taxes long ago but he defied all convention and the by never releasing his taxes even though he promised to do so at one point so um yeah I think people are that the truth Trump backers are not in any way\nGoing to be a disillusioned or a dissuaded by these stories I think you're absolutely right about that but you also have to look at the fact that at the core of\nUneasiness with Trump particularly among as I keep coming back to these college educated women many who might have voted for Trump but they were never\nTotally comfortable with his temperament with this character with his honesty and this is the kind of story that just is one more brick on the load in of itself I don't think it matters very much but it adds to a picture\nOf someone who um who is not quite trustworthy not quite honest not quite forthcoming\nI'm and I'm doesn't play by the rules and so yeah I think there are the people who are disposed to before I'm going to say yeah go forward Donald you know I mean he's a we've known all along who he is but you know I'm\nI think there are a lot of women voters a there's a fascinating Washington poll pose a poll out just this morning let me give you two statistics\nThey took a poll of the sixty nine most closely contested house races okay and white man without a college degree\nSaver Republicans by twenty points white women with a college degree favor Democrats by twenty seven points that's a swing of forty seven points\nSo this is not just a fault line of ... of reds versus blues dams versus wraps this is a fault line along education and gender lines that is very significant is going to play out in the fall\nSteve what do you think happens to Susan Collins now ah I was impressed with her speech in the Senate but I see that Democrats are pledging three million dollars to run against are already\nYeah well I've tried to take her out before um I think in the end she if she runs again she's probably going to survive that was a very very thoughtful speech um she tried to end did effectively show a lot of sympathy for Christine Blasey Ford a lot of sympathy in general\nFor women who have been victimized by sexual assault\nBut she was trying to say that\nWhatever might have been true she if there was no evidence corroborating evidence corroboration has become the new buzzword in Washington right pace collusion [laughter] as the word of the year and a and the fact is that she was right in saying\nWhatever else was true no one step forward to support a glossy forwards I'm\nA account so Collins I think has a very defensible\nA point of view stressing fairness to Kevin ... I think the Dems will run against her but she's very well in\n... and I think she's going to survive I mean\nWe got thirty seconds a bombing in his New Jersey is he in jeopardy\nI think so I'm a you know uh I mean in the end that's a that's a very blue state and again uh they're going to be out there also a lot of house races in in New Jersey where a lot of a ... Democrats think they can take two three four seats but um but then there's this blemish ... men Menendez has a lot of scars and I'm\nA I Would not put that solidly in a democratic camp but this is one of those races that could really be an upset at the same time the Democrats take two three four seats back in the house of from Republicans\nRight Steve Roberts ABC News political analyst thanks a lot Steve appreciate it okay when we come back we've got some entertainment news for you Mitch McConnell\nThat they were all that\nAnd ... one of the alarming things you can say about this crash shoes that it is the greatest number of people killed in a transportation related crash in ten years\nDo little tidbit here coming from CBS News or one of the victims tells the Washington Post that they were supposed to be taking a bus this group was supposed to be on a bus but um something that I guess the bus broke down this is plan B balloon limo was plan B yeah\nAnd then one of the victims or send a text before the crash\nSaying the ... appear to be in terrible conditions\n... just visibly well I don't I don't know what that meant um you know the sometimes these things are old\nAnd uh so you know again all a lot of course all the lawyers will be used there because they're the ones who were going to fly over you know obviously it's a condition of ... for the limo the breaks and the condition of the drug or the ... to me if I if I had to look at a suspicious aspect of this now it would be the driver got to be the driver got to be the driver [noise]\nHere in New York City police looking for the boyfriend of a woman who was shot and killed last night uh Bush with Brooklyn shoddy Sanchez was shot several times leaves hunting for suspect Gabrielle Rivera and Brett Kavanaugh he is taking place in the highest court in the country he was technically sworn in Saturday after that fifty to forty eight votes\nAnd President Trump those announcing that an official swearing in ceremony will happen this evening Jill he does it that's going to be a TV opportunity I'm sure so this will be another victory lap no opportunity so uh that's what's going on as we await word on what caused this crash ...\nAll right thank you Jeff and Joe just said he was going to go taken the Lady Gaga stars born movie today is that the senior citizens matinee you'll be going to Natalie threads near citizen [laughter] if you give them your AARP credit I think you get a discount\nI Will get a discount [laughter]\nI just can't see Bartlett seen stars for and frankly it's basically in a theater by himself because it's a Monday afternoon\nNo actually we looked on fan Daniel yesterday the only two seats are bought for the show we wanted to go [laughter]\nAll right well there's a there's a wheelchair access then we're going hey when we come back is it Columbus Day or is it indigenous people's day Alice Stockton rose denier street reporters he's out there to find out what do you think plus you won a thousand bucks your next chance was coming up at nine o five and seven ten W.

R. dot com slash Lenin Michael it's\nIt's a cylinder it looks like it's made out of concrete but in fact if you touch it spongy stuffy nose like soft home not quite sure what kind of foam\nIt is you know it's like the peanuts that horse you know it's an alien alien you think oh you think it really well\nIt looks so they shut it does does but I think everyone within ...\nOnly ... you think it's a well where the ... and they're still in there [laughter]\nYou think they're scuba diving [laughter] ... tablet they've adapted to the aquatic life aim for their noses are probably ... not in our own\nVery suspicious because if somebody was missing this somebody with a no no and that's\nFine yeah I I lost\nThe well but it may not be yelling may be part of like sort of a top secret satellite that maybe the Chinese or the Russians have out there spying on us and they don't want to acknowledge that BP\nWill the space junk is the other thought well what is the space junk floated a lot of junk\nIn getting through yeah there's a lot of junk floating around out there old satellites that aren't active anymore they're just flying around\nAliens too but you think somebody would be able to identify the substance\nAnd you would think so yeah this this could be this could be good who do do do do do what will you know I Hope the people who found that I Hope like if they eat this afternoon they don't have stomach pains in something of a stomach like an alien remember that favorite\nScene I'm looking at it ... it really think it's very eating fish\nIt you've seen\nYeah it's weird it's very strange is there like a little cockpit and there were people could be sitting it looks like there could be and how tall would you say these people who might fit in with the ... little little people little people you think they're green\nOf course they're going to be with big bug eyes [laughter]\nWhy\nOr why one I'd alien\n... do you do you believe in a life other than earth\nMy do believe I Do believe that there probably is life but I don't believe that it's a beans I think it's probably amino acids the building blocks of life I\nI don't look up in the sky and ... there's there's nothing else out there most of them are just dead pieces Iraq I'm afraid\nNo we are alone Joe all of that is that's up\nThere in dead rock all there is us kind of thing that I think they're I think\nThere is life I think that the building blocks of life I think they're amino acids I think we'll find things like that maybe even on Mars where they found frozen water things like that possibility but I don't think you're going to find you know eat tee up they're riding over the moon on his bicycle\nOh John Williams on and so I'm looking to argue with them but I'd rather I'd rather fight ET though than the alien and aliens I don't want one of those big things that has a pundit\nShoots out at you and each or brain oh I'm sure they're all friendly [laughter] check out this bit of space debris or maybe it is an alien object on our website seven ten W. O. R. dot com slash Lenin Michael seven ten W. O. L. dot com slash led to Michael we may not be alone\nAnd we got a hurricane coming to write my only well it's of course\nIt's a tropical storm Michael ... and Michael is going to be a problem probably\nHave been around for quite a grown man around on land I doubt it\nOh boy I'm going to put this morning overland tropical storm [laughter] and uh he's headed for Florida\nActually the Florida Panhandle is what they say at the moment um the governor of Florida said he is planning to declare a state of emergency it's four counties\nIn the panhandle uh and um the the problem I see is after it hits the Florida Panhandle it's going to veer little east\nAnd go back into the Carolinas with more rain oh they already got had once they are absolutely soaked both of the Carolinas or so from Hurricane Florence ... you were just down there right yeah notice did you notice the well the image I I I was a Hilton Head which is\nYeah and it was not the garden of eating you know the left with like you to believe that all before Columbus before though the west before Europeans discovered the continent of America it was a wonderful place where everybody lived in peace and harmony Rand naked through the forest\n[laughter] I Know there's another ... I was kind of fun to me about it [laughter]\nOr something I wanted to get into this is a story that caught my attention in the New York times now I'm a very big supporter\nHardcore supporter of the state of Israel one of the\nPerhaps the only democracy there in the middle eastern great country had been two times or I Love the Israelis I Love the spirit of the place you know they they literally the Jews made the desert bloom when they got Israel and the farms and great stuff but now there's a wave of anti Israel sentiment\nThat settling in in the Democratic party you have a lot of these young hardcore left the Democrats who've been nominated to run for Congress in safe seats so they're probably going to win\nAnd they are now breaking with the tradition of the Democrats who support Israel\nChuck Schumer big supporter of his ... you know the Democratic establishment is always supported Israel but these young guns these hot shots these lefty ... they of course the Israel as the occupier\nThey see Palestinians as the occupied and they are taking direct aim at Israel and some of them are calling the United states to stop funding Israel stopped giving Israel money and stopped giving Israel weapons\nBut in terms of a political view and a political stances that helping them well\nThis is a question for the Democrats Republicans see a crack now that they can get in there to price some Jewish supporters and many many Jewish people are Democrats and support them credit because they're lentils where they think they can Bryce some Jews back to the Republican side because of some of the things that these\nYoung Democrats are saying now there's a fellow named them Johan Omar he's a Somali American Muslim he's running for an open house seat in Minneapolis he's denounced the occupation of Palestine\nA Rashida ... she's a Palestinian American Muslim she's running in Detroit She thinks that ah Israel should not get money from the United states anymore and our very own\nMs ... Cortez running in the heavily democratic district in the in the Bronx she has come out and she has denounced the occupation of uh of Palestine to\nWell I think that's probably a political move for based on the constituency that they would represent right\nMhm but the question is when does anti Israel sentiment\nA hurdle into anti Semitism as it has done in England if you've noticed Jeremy Corbyn who's the late ... a leader of the Labour Party he had to fend off accusations that a lot of his supporters a lot of the people in the labor party are anti Semitic and he has not done it very very\nWell well I I think it it kind of unfair to say if you do not support Israel and you have any sympathy for the Palestinians then it's it's anti Semitic\nI kept me is it's not automatic I think\nThere's some anti Semitism on the left I really do see that specially in England I think you see that I think I think a lot of the left wing feels that Israel's become a bully state and they some of them compared to Nazi Germany\nThey see it as a bully the bully or the Palestinians and the bully years the aggressive powerful ones the Israelis\nWell I you know I I guess the Palestinians I mean they are impoverished and um\nWell in some ways Joe they only have themselves to blame because Israel has extended the olive branch over and over and over again Israel wants nothing more than to coexist peacefully with the Palestinians over backwards over the years and then they\nGo in and establish the settlements and you know ... well they they run they they go into the occupied lands put their settlements up and you know so maybe that can be viewed as a hostile move\nWell they went into those occupied lands and he puts settlements in there because those those towns they weren't hotbeds of of terrorism and radical young who aside bombers and they thought the way to break that up was to go in there and occupy some of these places where a lot of the suicide bombers are coming from so it was a move of self defense\nI can completely understand Israel's position here I mean they're surrounded by people who don't want them there who don't even accept their existence mhm so\nThey have to be strong I I understand that completely\nAnd you know at the national anthem that Israel is this land is your land this land is my land from the era border to the Arab border from the era boarder who the Arab\nPlan was for you at this rally at a time when I got to hear it everywhere we\nSee people who want to push us into the sea well there's no doubt about President Trump support of Israel well that we can be thankful you already see move the embassy\nTo Jerusalem but it's very interesting it's got to be very interesting to see how these hardcore are Democrats who are anti Israel they're gonna they're gonna windy seats but I don't think the Democratic party is going to be in trouble if it goes all out against Israel\nBy the way up a copy of Cortez was on MSNBC this weekend saying that things are so crazy in this country that she has to provide therapy for her constituents providing therapy for her supporters\nOh my God help us All right when we get back we're
