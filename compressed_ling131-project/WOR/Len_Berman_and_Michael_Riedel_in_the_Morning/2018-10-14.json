{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "From a certain way or education or background\nThere's simply people that are ... and they're passionate about learning something new again I mentioned this earlier the number one mistake than most people make with their money is they think they can do this on their own and then they'll go to the education later well that's the wrong thing to do one creates bad habits\nAnd number two they never do go back to the education 'cause they blown up the money they had\nSo what do good students do I talk to them all the time number one\nThey realized in the twenty first century that they could take a laptop anywhere in this world right now it doesn't matter because as long as they have an Internet connection and their laptop\nThey can trade all over the world in fact we had a student named B or and he's in San Diego and a lot of times are students feel it's too hard they can't do it well not only has ... done this and his left his job which is exactly what everybody wants to do right we want to quit a job you don't love to do something we do love\nHe's become a excellent trader and he's also now started funding his wife's real estate business\nSo the two of them are doing something together\nSpending more time together spending more time on vacations in family but the important thing here Ryan is it they're loving what they're doing and there's so many people out there and if you're one of those people hopefully you can see how you can benefit from just learning a skill that can give you the freedom that you desire\nYeah absolutely and it's it's kind of interesting is we're as we're sitting here talking about and the lifestyle of a traitor I'd just literally receive a text message from a dear friend of mine and it just popped up on my phone and he was actually somebody who got me started in trading he was one of the first people who said this is how you open an account these are the steps that you go through\nIt very very first conversations these just become a lifelong dear friend of mine and he's a huge ski bum he lives up in Salt lake you just ski travels around it as a great time\nHe just texted me with a picture of snow ski saying hey can you use these this season or should I take him to the ... because if I go up to Salt Lake users bum a pair of skis from him rather than a hall in mine around\nBut it it's just there's just so much freedom that can come with it and it and it really ends up just pulling down to a couple of basic steps a couple of basic as you were saying changes or actions that need to be taking because I think it's very critical it's very important it's it's very powerful once we do understand\nThat that the poor is just the state of mind right that passing over opportunities repeatedly and it's something that can be really easily changed just by stepping out of our comfort zone right just by stepping out of our comfort zone and doing something different we talk a lot about\nKind of cliche statements on the show here but it's because they're so true and they're so useful and and it goes back to if we've always done if we always do what we've done will always get what we got and if we're completely satisfied with where we are than than great let's continue to do what made us so happy in the first place\nBut if we want a little bit more for trying to cook it created a little more income if we're trying to create a little more freedom if we have a specific goal\nThat we're trying to accomplish that we haven't been able to get to we have to make the necessary changes and that's one of the life lessons that my grandfather shared with me my whole life growing up he would hold up his five fingers and I would have to ... the first one is no your business is the second one is be converted\nAnd that converted one as a youngster I honestly didn't understand what it meant and as I got involved with trading and I really started to go kind of soul searching down is is this something that's gonna work for me am I going to be able to do this\nThat converted when I started to realize was make the necessary changes the necessary metamorphosis do what's necessary\nAnd and and in the beginning and that was the one I was kind of didn't put as much emphasis on when I was like ten eleven twelve even Eighteen Nineteen twenty you know but then as I really started into my my grown up years I started realizing\nHow be converted that pointer finger of the five to me became the most valuable because if we don't make the necessary changes we're never going to accomplish that kind of outlier goal\nThat were after that one of the things we can do to help a few people get started with this as we've still got a few tickets we can give away let's change some lives right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area\nThat they ... ... exactly where it takes to really take control of the finances really taken truly a retirement account generate more income inside of the market's really live that life that drafter and just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes one of these half day classes to get your bones writing if you are driving now is a good time to pulled over\nIncluding with your passes is going to be our professional insiders kit now this professional insider kitten makes it so

zero eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nNow Larry one of the things that I always like to say and I said it earlier on the show is doesn't matter if you have two dollars or two million dollars it's all about getting that money working for you and really getting it to generate that income so you can live the lifestyle you can reach the financial freedom goal that you're after\nBut what are some of the things are what are some of the other kind of examples I Know you have your bags and bags loads of these these examples for our students that you've talked to that we're in one place that are now in another well the first thing we always understand here is that with\nTrading it's simply a transfer money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing\nAnd what's really sad as people will get themselves stuck to think about just time right now people can sit in front of a television for hours versus going out there and learning a skill that can help them and every year and you were coming up to the holiday season again we can start seeing all these Jim commercials again right\nCause here comes resolution time and one of those things I hear a students say over and over again is beside wishing having had more time was\nThis is the year I Want to get out of debt and I want to turn my finances around and what's amazing is how many students\nCome in through the classes that we're doing right now\nAnd simply imagine what their life would be like if they can learn a skill to help them generate more money\nAnd that's the key it's about doing something taking action and getting out there to change your current situation again if you're a coach shovel and something that you are really interested in learning how to do there is no limitations here in fact one of my students June\nShe actually came to my class and she said all she wanted to do is play golf in Costa Rica and so she started realizing that by learning how to trade gave her the time to do that I said it's great just sent me a postcard and she did and she said she was trading 'cause that's a whole another piece of it\nPeople go on vacation Ryan right and they decorate the vacation they're making money to pay for it and so I asked June trading before after golf she goes\nBefore of course and I love that of course\nYeah we're talking with a group of students just a little while ago that did a big trip through Europe and I remember him saying\nYou know where we were trading out in Europe and we made as much money out on our trip was we actually spent on the trip and so it's kinda fun to come back from a trip with a with a with a flat balance or even being up after having a great uh after having a great time\nAnd that's the thing is it doesn't matter where you are you just have to have an Internet connection it doesn't matter where you are and it doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter what your background is it's all about just proactively identifying good opportunities and that's really what we introduce you to show you exactly what it takes how to do that\nInside of the half the class and we are pretty much at the end of the show but before we end what are you saying we do know that give away\nYeah let's give at least ten more people the opportunity to get some tickets here\nAll right right now we've got a happy class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you'll see exactly what it takes\nTo really reached that financial freedom generating more income in the markets like I always say if you're why is big enough you will find out how how is out at the half the class now just a second you're going to have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these half day classes to get your bones writing if you're driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluding with your passages are professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nLessons on topics like it had senior retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional insider kit makes it so you get started right now ... century twenty when he did a call now and reserve those seats\nThe number is eight eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at ...

Lederman working at radio surgery New York Thirteen\nBefore Broadway where we treat patients with new and recurrent cancers if you saw that segment on a major TV network now you know the background\nNow you know the the day the radiation was not current data that's how they were able to manipulate the data was not a randomized study and yes the surgeon was gloating but he was floating for not any benefit of what he unfortunately\nHas provided so to learn more give us a call at two one two choices or better yet make an appointment doesn't meet about prostate and other cancer treatments find him start to go Lederman we'll be right back\nThere's huge differences in cancer treatment surgery is removal of part\nOf your body and can result in complications even spreading the cancer it's invasive and might result in life long changes came more chemicals in your body from head to toe to try to arrest the cancer might work early later cancer mutates to outsmart the chemo resulting in toxicity without benefits\nStandard Archie has collateral effects too I'll reasons why Dr Lederman his first in America to perform body radio surgery to attack new a recurrent cancers directly noninvasive lead paint Leslie with invisible beams outpatient therapy in minutes triple\nBoard certified Harvard trained doctor Lederman so many people seek Dr Lederman for the treatment of new a recurrent cancerous most anywhere in the body to avoid surgery or chemo\nFree booklet DVD called two one two choices\nTwo one two choices most insurance is Medicare Medicaid accepted\nCalled ... two one two choices Thirteen eighty four Broadway at thirty eight for appointments called two one two choices\n[noise] welcome back to the radio surgery our doctor Gilead I'm In the leading cancer prostate cancer not in the in the first New York for ... century [noise] first in America\nAnd in the western hemisphere finding radio surgery you can also call Dr lead a minute to when you're killing for free informative and DVD hey Dr Lederman whereby\nWe're back on to continue on I Want to talk about the Seventy six year old woman she's widow she ah has adopted children she presented with multiple medical problems she has breast cancer high blood pressure diabetes cholesterol and she had breast cancer treated in the\nPast she added treated ... by the eight ten months ago one of the big super duper big hospitals in New York\nAnd she had two surgeries on the breast and the armpit and shit treatment there\nAnd she comes to me why because she has this big mass growing in are growing so one is the breast\nAnd that was treated at this big hospital and meanwhile the same time that she had this breast cancer she had this mass and the growing and she told them about it and yet she doesn't recall anything being done about that she was seeing the cancer doctors there no one said anything about it and they kept on getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger\nAnd so finally she came to me and so here\nAt registered in New York we tried to put the whole case together we try to treat the whole patient rather than just having a microscopic vision of one thing we tried to take care of the whole patient with their cancer\nAnd yes she had the right side of the breast cancer\nBut in er grew inches a mass the size of a fist and she was insistent that she never had a biopsy was never was told what this was and we got her records and in fact she had a biopsy but their doctors number told her that she had a biopsy apparently she was put to sleep for breast surgery\nBut she never was told about the biopsy for the\nEngland on mass and she was never told ... number one that had happened to number two what it is and number three they never spoke to her about treatment for it so of course shoes upset she came in got records we found out that she had a second cancer unrelated to the breast in the grind\nThat they knew about nine months ago and totally ignored I Know sounds hard to believe but sometimes truth is stranger than fiction we've got a PET scan we worked or up where you saw exactly where this lymphoma was\nIt's we're actually was where it is\nAnd it is growing in the left growing and so the pelvic notes the adjacent lymph nodes I spoke to about all the options and she chose to proceed with focused\nBeam radiation for this some form and now it's a big mess and a painful mass and most likely our treatment will make it go away most likely will go in remission we never can promise anyone anything because medicines like not like that but we have lots of data\nOver many many years about\nRadiation and radio surgery for the treatment of ... farmers and this woman's\nIdeal selection is to come to us to have the the cancer lymphoma treated with focus the radiation all within minutes a series of treatments and we'll follow up and most probably she'll feel this mass shrinking and farmers usually most cancers that we treat actually shrink up and most likely this one will\nAlso don't speak about the Seventy three year old man he's a man a married he's the father of three children know he went to a hospital and one of the five boroughs for prostate cancer yet standard radiation there and now his PSA is going up with a PSA this prosthetic specific antigen is a good test to see how\nThe cancers do and then of course after\nTreatment the PSA should be going down to zero well in his case it's going up up up now he has a general doctor or your allergies Dr\nAnd your doctor saw the PSA going up and just started among hormone therapy at no time did he do any cat scans or bone scans to see where the cancer is or get the records from that hospitals to see how they gave the standard radiation because if the cancers\nOnly in the prostate within their second line therapies that could give this man\nA second chance to be cancer free hormonal therapies don't cure anybody so for this man number one lesson is\nStandard treatment is not all the same not all surgery and radiation saying there's lots of differences if you look at our book with for example if he had a PSA\nTen to twenty standard radiation would only give about the sixty percent chance wars our treatment would give about Ninety percent chance so of course it is best\nTo have the first treatment first\nYou should always have the best treatment of the best treatment first means it's less likely the cancer will come back\nSo this man unfortunately had standard radiation elsewhere one of the big hospitals now the cancers come back and now he's in the pickled number one because of the cancers back over to the doctor started hormone therapy without staging um Oregon a stage them up quickly to see exactly where the cancer is if there's evidence the cancer traveling\nWhile getting all those records and providing him\nCopy so lots to learn get the best treatment lower the cancer is be staged give us a call at two one two choices two and two choices and wanna speak about a woman who came in she's sixty one years old she's married\nAnd she was fine until about nine months ago when she's about fatigue she was so tired of that you went to bed for a month\nAnd then she started to lose weight and have back pain have abdominal cramping symptoms and decreased appetite and she lost forty pounds over the last six months she went down to the weight of a hundred and Eighteen pounds and she's five foot tents which is a tall woman\nWho was really slender losing forty pounds\nIn six months and she tried acupuncture didn't work she tried Chinese herbs doesn't work she tried mega vitamins to dump she tried antioxidants to the or extra variety of things that don't work\nEventually shut the CAT scan which showed a mass the pancreas and she had a biopsy would show to add on no cars not what the pancreas shed or ... or blockage that blockage was taken care of with a stand and she came to us for treatment and she's been in so much pain she's taking\nSeven Percocet which is a kind of narcotic pill every day should on seven Percocet she has a mass the pancreas she's lost forty pounds she's really suffering her by the way grandmother died of pancreatic cancer at age fifty five\nTreat them commonly with a high degree of success so most probably she will be successfully treated\nCautious stage for cancer and we I asked her if she wanted chemotherapy or surgery or other methods and she's really happy with radio surgery right now it's out patient\nWhile tolerated relieving pain getting her where she wants to be and that's where we want her to be which is to be pain free cancer free and live for normal life I was talking about uh sixty year old woman who came to us she is single she has no children but she has while she has a brother and friends from church you came with\nSix people for consultation she first knew about her left breast cancer with the nipple on the left side became inverted this is about seven months ago she never had prior mammograms which is another lesson we could learn something\nEvery program we actually learned many things on every program mammograms should be useful she was sixty should never at a mammogram shed distortion of the breast which is another learning point and distortion of the breast as a warning sign about breast cancer she also had masses in the ... the armpit\nAnd she had cancer that traveled to the muscles behind the breast women to have ... muscles we often don't think of a woman's chest that way but in fact just like a man ... travels muscles are important for movement of the armed men women have got Carl's muscles just like man\nShort cancer markers where elevated C a twenty seven twenty nine was elevated Seventy eight\nSo she had a distortion of the breast nipple became inverted chip masses under the arm shed masses clean the muscles now she tried chemotherapy at another facility and it worked in fact I got new and old scans that we had them compared\nIn work just she hated chemotherapy she did not want chemotherapy even though the cancer was progressive it was all\nIn one area the breast under the muscle on the armpit and she chose to proceed with\nFocus the radiation which we treated her and now the cancer's not ... and ... of course get a new pet CAT scan and new cancer markers to prove to her and to prove to us to show you also that our treatment does commonly work and that's what\nWe're hoping for working for and also honoring the patient's wishes we believe that the patient is the president of United States of their body and of course\nEveryone has the president of their body or should we felt that way that's how we treat the patient and we believe where the advisor we're not the president of your body or anyone else's body for we're happy to offer advice if you wish to come to us in our office at thirty for Broadway don't talk to about a woman who is\nA it was here this week she's Ninety two years old very spry woman she came with her husband she's been married\nAnd sixty seven years set a breast cancer\nIt was a matter of static she had a PET scan that was positive or she was in the shower last month she got a large mass and the left for us that's how she first learned about it\nShe had a mammogram and the pet scan a PET scan by the way is in the tea pet scan is injection of radioactive sugar scanned the whole body see where the cancer is cancer usually likes to eat a lot of nutrition and sugar is an easy nutrition some people it Romney's they think if you don't\nEat sugar the cancer will die well that's not true cancer just eats whatever wants to eat for a PET scan sugars easy thing to put a radiation label onto and see where the cancer is\nAnd so her PET scan showed that the cancer had traveled she's got a mass that's about six centimeters the breast of the mammogram show that at the pet scan showed it\nAnd also the pet scan showed cancer and the\nArmpit and some cancer the bones and and the breast and she wants to have treatment number one because the breast as painful number two it's a big mass number three it's eating through the nipple area so if this cancers and stopped in the breast they can well either through all the skin and destroy the skin and\nBecome infected and bleeding so it's very important to treat the breast cancer and were able to treat it anywhere with a high degree of success or she learned about hormonal therapy and chemotherapy and surgery we talked about all the options but she wants to have focused beam radiation to the breast to try to relieve the\nPain and drink the mass the masses about six seven centimeters that's about three inches in the left breast under the ...\nAnd just above the nipple area\nTheir skin changes called code orange which is a French term for orange peel so the skins being involved by the cancer and there's about a three centimeter mass in the armpit so for her we've done our work we've advised her we discussed everything and\nWell most of the information was already available to the patient and the husband none of her doctors ever described it\nAnd ah she felt fortunate that we were able to describe it and give her copies of her paperwork so she actually knows now exactly what she has what needs to be done to get rid of this cancer\nThis cancer is affecting your left breast and armpit and possibly fall and says well she is more than Ninety years old\nBut Ninety year old people want to be treated and we shouldn't be prejudicial taxes even laws against it and the fact she's Ninety means she's probably more likely that she's going to hit a hundred than me so I Believe that every patient should be informed the options and she's certainly\nWith it she looks like she's sixty nine Ninety and she has a good head on her shoulders and will make the right decision for her and we know that that's true for every patient we just try to provide the information and the answers and answer all the questions patients have\nSuch a guilt Lederman word cancer treatment doctors at thirty for Broadway Broadway and thirty eight street where we treat patients with newly diagnosed and recurrent cancers even a standard chemo radiation or surgery didn't work has wanted isn't tolerated\nYou know a lot of people are shy if you wish you can call me with medical questions at two and two choices that's our office number\nAnd we'll send you a book Clinton DVD we have separate booklets about brain body prostate and second opinions so give us a call put one in the mail along with a DVD or better yet come to our office at\nThirteen any for Broadway and pick up what you want whether it's spraying body prostate or the whole slow pick off for yourself and your neighbors and your friends and your loved ones and your co workers I guess had lots of people\nHelp others by providing this information so feel free to do it there is no charge of DVDs and also MP three of our top radio shows You're welcome to listen to those at home as well take a short break we'll be back if you have cancer questions give us a call or just sit back and learn\nLearn learn when doc delete 'em and came to New York from Harvard Ninety seven percent of women in New York We're losing their breath as breast cancer treatment but Ninety percent of duck to lead them in patients\nWith breast cancer we're keeping abreast ducked delete 'em and an outspoken advocate of brush saving therapy educated women about choices to arm every woman about breast cancer choices breasts same whenever possible and as I went every hospital thought standard radiation\nIt was okay Dr lead them and had a better idea\nInnovative don't delete 'em and first bought ... radio surgery to New York and body radio surgery to America meet Dr lead them and breast conserving therapy over decades Thirteen eighty\nFour Broadway at thirty eighth coal two one two choices to in two choices about breast cancer treatment most insurance is Medicare Medicaid accepted for fresh second opinion called Dr lead them in breast cancer treatment called two one two choices two one two choices called duck to lead them into day two and two choices\n[noise] looking back to the radio surgery our doctor Gilead I'm In the leading cancer and prostate cancer ... for the first New York for ... brain radio surgery first in America\nAnd in the western hemisphere plus finding radio surgery you can also call Dr lead a minute to killington for free informative and DVD pay Dr Lederman whereby\nWe are back and we're here and that's what we're doing is learning together every day actually were on the radio every day and talking about health care and learning about talking about a Fifteen year old man he\nCame in these black which means that higher risk for prostate cancer has two boys is a nursing assistant in New York City has been doing that for twenty five years as a mess and the growing it's been increasing in size and pain I examined him I value added him\nHe has this mess it's about six seven senators who got 'em test it out and well what does he have well he has a hernia which is not something to worry about is fixable but we also checked him for PSA and this past say was more than seven which means he has about a thirty percent chance of having\nProstate cancer so here's a man with no symptoms but no one had ever check the he's in the nursing profession who works in a big hospital known it ever check that but we checked them\nWhy because at high risk and in fact he is an even higher risk now with that high PSA so again it's a sign that you don't need to have your symptoms are wake up at night to have a need for evaluation don't want to talk about a woman who's fifty seven she is from Azerbaijan and the former Soviet Union\n... Michel cancer and she has extensive disease show's massive adding up to the ... lymph nodes lots to learn about\nShe is single she's cared for some degree should not fully caring for herself\nFive years ago ... bleeding shut the DNC and then she had a hysterectomy for and the metro cancer at one of the hospitals and the five girls she was diagnosed with metastatic cancer the cancer from the uterus traveled to the lymph nodes shed chemotherapy it didn't help\nAnd ah he wasn't certain he called his friend who was the chief of radiology at a big hospital and he said well Dr Lieberman's ride it'll never get the pet scan in the morning and ah he said get the CAT scan now to the pet scan of the few weeks\nAnd the patient to the lake that he liked the idea of getting the best test\nASAP why should he get radiation exposure and get an regular test today and then wait for the best test for a few weeks that makes sense to him\nHe liked my logic he liked the idea to get the best test the staging immediately and nowhere is a software gets cancer was and he called me back that night and he said okay Dr Lederman you\nSaid you can do the test you get the test from in the morning I'll be there and the next morning at seven AM he was there and hit the pet scan nine o'clock you walked in my office\nWith the result in his hand at three copies and I usually asked the radiologist that we work with to give the patient multiple copies so they have copies in their hand he walked in my office and we gave him the report and the report was well it wasn't the best report for him but he had that those rather than waiting another month\nHe had cancer and this off I guess and also it spread to several lymph nodes\nHe wanted to know what the best treatment was I thought the best treatment would be to treat is a success with radio surgery to keep an open so he doesn't lose the ability to swallow losing swallowing is just terrible and we know the chemotherapy only works temporarily\nHe wanted to chemotherapy because it went into the bloodstream but he wanted radio surgery to treat that mass the esophagus than the adjacent lymph nodes\nFive treatments we did it we shrink down the cancer he's been eating ever since and he had the chemotherapy to so he's had kind of another study randomized study of his body of radio surgery to the\nLymph nodes and to the south of geo cancer mass and chemotherapy to the rest of the body the chemo went into a vein and spread to the rest of the body and now he came back this past week for a follow up test the pet scan shows the radio surgery worked\nVery well the cancer shrink greatly and the lymph node that we treated near the esophageal cancer went away completely which was the great news that proved to him that our treatment\nTruly works the other disease well he had\nChemotherapy for the other disease and it just\nDidn't work I called up the chemo doctors had patients here doctors here and he said oh and I said\nThe radio surgery work the cancer this off ... shrank but elsewhere where he got chemotherapy just doesn't work and then the doctor said well he didn't come for the chemo and it's a fair analysis because of the show up for the chemo did receive what I recommend it\nAnd I said well OK he'll come over and talk to you and then I talked to the patient the patient says well the reason I didn't show up as\nIt was so devastating the chemo that I just couldn't take it the radio surgery was great and easy and I took it and well tolerated and now I see that at work like you told me the most likely what Dr Lederman the chemo was just devastating and for that reason he wasn't able to show up sometimes after chemo was bad\nSo it's funny how different people see different things that came of doctors a patient who wasn't showing up\nFirst chemo whereas the patient was saying the side effects\nOf chemo and he didn't like the side effects of the treatment and he couldn't tolerate it so yes he had the radio surgery for his ... cancer it worked\nHe took as much came mostly could it doesn't work\nHe wants us to treat him now to these other areas and most likely our data shows more than Ninety percent chance who can stop or shrink the cancer where we aim the beam and that's what we intend to do our tree would just take ... minutes it's very well tolerated highly successful where we attack the\nCancer so and this man do we have proof yes is this what we do every day yes we have a\nTeam devoted to this work yes where we the first of America to do this work yes refers to New York to do this work\nYes why because there's so many patients in whom surgeries not feasible or surgery is not one that came out doesn't work or a Q mold doesn't provide the quality of life a person wants or it just doesn't shrink the cancer or status\nRadiation too long to much standard radiation give too much radiation to the healthy tissues had a little tiny doses compared to our treatments so there's lots of reasons to investigate stereo tactic body radio surgery which we brought to the western hemisphere\nAnd therefore have the longest experience so tactic brain British surgery and stereotyped ... brand ready to surgery both of which we brought to New York\nAnd have a long track the longest track record in New York City oh talked about a man who just came up from\nTexas He's fifty six years old he's single he's been working in the\nTexas oil industry as you've probably heard the oil industry prices are going down the tubes and he lost his job because of the oil industry's is laying off their workers Roy came to get checked up because he's urinating every hour is spasm and he's a ... year at age so much\nAnd he got checked up his PSA was a hundred and twelve remember

details\nGod wants the best for us desires the best for us give us the best to us\nBy learning to or by trusting in learning to yield to that divine intention trusting in God's will of good for us it open so many more doors than just a personal pushing and pulling and demanding and hoping opens for us\nYeah I find it's better than I could have even plan\nMy exactly exactly\nWell do you have an example on your own life that you can share where you really saw this truth\nProbably have a hundred with but I'm only going to give you one [laughter] I applied for a position one time that I really wanted I mean I really really wanted it and I wasn't taken\nI wouldn't say I wasn't turning to God for guidance because I really was\nIt was a good job and it would be a blessing to many people so I I felt guided to apply it was a good idea to do it but then I wasn't taken and I didn't see it at the time how much I had yet to learn about not pushing my own will to go faster\nOr further than God was leading me at the moment but even when I didn't get what I wanted God really was leading me and in fact leading me to apply several more times for the very same job each time there was no\nAnd while it was disappointing each know compelled me to appreciate the good that was at hand and to learn to develop the opportunity\nUse that word before me I learned it actually that I can bloom anywhere I\nCan bloom anywhere that God plants me and that was really a good and healthy lesson to learn now the last time I applied I remember clearly asking God if I didn't even bother should I even try again\nAnd the interesting came to me than in following God's leading I should apply but that it was also safe to trust that God was leading authors those whose job it is to decide if I get to do it or not\nAnd you know I never thought of that my focus has always been so narrow just on God guiding me and my really wanting to do it but that wasn't my decision God was leading me to apply and that was enough\nI felt the love and my heart I felt God's love for everyone in the decision making process I trusted them because I trust God to be guiding them so I bought and that time I was taken\nBut you know what I now know I actually would have been fine even if the answer had been no because I could see God was taking the lead and every single point\nIn hindsight I can see how different my circumstances where how much better prepared I was and how I wouldn't have had the same routes experience in that work had I been taking any of those other times that I asked\nGod's guidance is such a precious thing deceit\nIt's an invaluable thing actually to find divine good really is our best advocate a loving parent to his children God demands the best for us and the best of us and I think that letting God take\nThe lead is key to living a life of blessing and a life being blessed well Michele\nThanks so much for being with us today and for sharing your incite it was a privilege I've been speaking with Michelle Nunn is\nA Christian Science practitioner and teacher based in Paris, France [noise]\nHello I'm Margaret ... a Christian Science practitioner from East Hampton New Jersey I'd like to share an experience I had\nWhere I saw the importance of listening to God's guidance and letting them take the lead\nAbout Thirty years ago my husband and I went from Boston to Cleveland for the weekend we drove over a two day period stopping overnight in Williamsport, Pennsylvania before we left the car had been acting up on occasion\nAnd it came to me to adjust to my husband that we rent a car for the trip\nBut he said no he was handy with cars and was able to repair it if necessary so he was not concerned I did not pursue the matter further as I relied on his good judgment after all he was in the driver's seat\nJust this week Dr Cleveland the car began to show signs of trouble\nThan when we left there we had not gone very far when it really began to ACT UP we had to stop every half hour an ad oil and water so we sort of left alone it was not an easy ride and I'm sure I had to turn to God many times\nDuring the day I began to fail on well and one way stop for the night in Pennsylvania I realized I was hemorrhaging\nIrish frightened and wish to very much that I was home and set of miles away in a motel for Christian Scientist it is my custom to turn to God and prayer in all situations and this was certainly needed now\nI don't know recall specifics thoughts that came to me but the basis of my prayer would have been that God is the only cause and creator and that man meaning all his his image and like this holy spiritual and good\nBasically I recall that I'd just lay still during a long night and acknowledged God's old power\nI took literally a Bible admonition to be still know that I Am God from\n... I'm forty six I was grateful for my husband's quiet support and I knew that he was praying to there was never any suggestion that we should seek medical help\nIn the morning we began the last leg of the trip the physical condition had not yielded but it wasn't as severe as it had been the night before\nWe still have to stop the car and replenish the oil and water about every thirty minutes\nBefore we left that morning have stocked up on oil and water so that all we had to do was stop along the road\nAs we got closer to Boston there were a number of places where there was no place that you could pull off the road and stop\nBut I was grateful to every time we needed a place there was one and so we made it home\nAs we were riding along and I was listening for God's angel messages one came from science and health with kids or the scriptures by Mary Baker eddy ended completely met the situation\nIs mind is the only actor how can mechanism be automatic\nPage three Ninety nine\nThat completely wiped away this thought of any power apart from God no power apart from God means nothing beyond God's control not car and not the body I knew that was the healing and it was\nWe made it home and there was no further problem with the body\nWhat I learned from that experience was true absolutely trust the angel messages that come from God and to recognize that they are angel messages and not human will\nMy husband apologized for not taking my suggestion to rent a car but it came to me that I couldn't blame him because I had not really recognized it as an angel message from God and so I had just sort of suggested it to him\nSome years later he told me that he had learned that whenever I said to him it has come to me that he always recognized that it was the result of prayer and not human will\nI think we both learned really listen to God and to let God the the driver's seat\nThat was Margaret Wiley Christian Science practitioner\nFrom East Hampton New Jersey\nAnd with me now to talk about living God take the lead it's only ... Simpson thanks for joining us today thank you well Lena I Know that you have come to expect God to care for you and direct your life\nYeah and you know through my study of Christian Science and in prayer I found that we all can feel God's guidance at any stage and our experience and share or we can pray to steal God's guidance for the bigger things or the more major life decisions\nBut we also can feel God's guidance and the smaller day to day activities too and listening for God's guidance doesn't require human sense of maturity it doesn't matter what age you are older or younger\nI've learned that you know as we turn to him in prayer we find that it's only natural to listen for God's guidance interaction all throughout our experience\nWhich you have some examples that you can share where you really not only listen for God's guidance but got a really great answer to\nIn my younger years I remember feeling impressed with the false adjusts and that I couldn't steal God's guidance because I felt I didn't completely no God\nAnd I began to pray daily to no God better I really you earned\nShow is provided for entertainment and general information purposes opinions expressed are

enjoy the show [noise]\nTo the show as your listener\nNames right with you as always my great friends structure down the street is\nEveryone wants to be like and that is because he is the brains of the operation out here that's for sure\nBut I got Larry out here and Larry first question for you is how that you're doing doing great Ryan how're you doing I'm doing wonderful excited to be out here with you all doing the show this week we have a lot of fun\nAre doing this show and talking to you our financial family out there across the airwaves\nAnd one of the things we always focus the vast majority of our time and I would say every time we get on the air and every time we can get you in front of a group of people is really talking about income and talking about how to how to generate more income inside of the financial markets and one of the things we always stress and I I Know we'll spend a lot of time on it here today\nIs how to really get that consistent growth that consistent income in the markets\nWhether the markets are going up and whether the market's going down whether the market's going sideways and and that's really the the key is because there's three directions and and as individuals were very comfortable with the buying hold\nKinda bullish mentality of you know we we invest into this we invest into that we hold it for a long time and hopefully when we hit retirement it's just worth or it's just worth a heck of a whole lot more\nNow what are the things I Want to get some of your feedback on it's always a fun show starter is really the consistency side of things because really if we're going to have consistent growth in the market we can't be direction to lead dependent to know what I mean by that is we can't\nOnly profit if the market goes in one direction I don't I don't know about you but one of my favorite things\nWhen I teach a half day classier it on a treaty academy one of my favorite things it's really work with the class and get them to viewed down markets as opportunities not just bad things you know so many times the down markets are viewed as well that's so bad 'cause people are losing money and well that is true if we're just in that bullish biased as markets are going down\nWith the right knowledge of what the right skills those can be viewed as as great opportunities to make money I mean if you go back through some of the major\nCrashes that we've experienced and you can you can find the ... of the world the pulses of the world and you can find the the word billionaire next to their name at the end of a lot of these crashes and so it's always interesting how how how maybe made on the way up the billions are made on the way down\nAnd ... it really just boils back to consistency we want to make money we want to make money on the way up and we want to make money on the way down but what are some of the things you guys are working on what the students right now or some of the some of the new tools you and your instructor team are are are laying out there right now or to help people become more consistent and less direction dependent instead of the market\nWill this last week it's been beautiful I mean everything we've been talking about on the show together I'm Talking about this for weeks now waiting for the opportunity to see the markets correct and come back down and as a result what happens starting off at the end of last week into this week as we got everybody's wish that\nThe market started coming down it comes down three times faster than it goes up and a lot of our students were taught that once that market goes down you could actually make money shorting the market it's called shorting where you're actually selling in the market\nAs opposed to most who by the markets so a lot of our students shift from that fear of oh my God the market's going down I don't know what to do I'm gonna lose money to well I can actually learn how to make money if the markets go down it's simply doing what the banks do\nBig banks are always out there to make money with the markets go up down sideways and what a lot of our students seeing we tell them is do you see how this would benefit you by learning how to trade in more than just one direction\nAnd when you look at even the difference between let's even just say a mutual fund versus a hedge fund and mutual fund is generally just investing into a long position and they called a mutual fund 'cause it's this joint effort between us and the financial institution but it only makes money is the markets are going up but it doesn't mean that strategy is never useful and that that product has never useful that's not what I'm trying to get out here\nBut as it's going down those phones are generally losing money and we're paying fees to be involved or to be invested into that fund you look at the a hedge fund type strategy and and that word Hedges pretty critical because\nHedge is meaning that there is a position that propped on the way up and there's also protection or even a position that could profit on the way down there so when you start looking at things as far as the market's going there's multiple directions in the market the up down into sideways\nIt's critical to make sure that we have strategies kind of like that hedged mentality that can make money if the markets are going up down or sideways and you're one of the things they talked about in one of my classes a long time ago was or wasn't imagine if you went to work then they said hey you know what\nWe really like you you're a great candidate we think you'd be a great fit for the company\nBut you can expect to be laid off one third of the time one third of the time we're not going to pay\nYou know and that's really what happens if we're only trading any bullish direction anytime the markets are going sideways our retirement account or income account is laid off\nAnytime the market's going down a retirement account or income account is is laid off not to not to even bring up the fact that maybe it's it's deteriorating a little bit especially as the markets are going down\nBut one of the things that we can do is always okay with you Larry when things that we can do is we have a big stack of tickets right here we are just kicking the show off we've got a bunch of tickets we can give away and we can help a few people out there get started becoming more consistent in the market by by doing a quick little give away for these passes that our to our ... classes what are you say let's do it\nAll right well right now I've got a ... class coming up in your area they have their classes while you'll see exactly what it takes to be more consistent in the market making money generate more income as the market's going up down or sideways now happy classes about three hours long and if you would have set up passes\nThrough these half day classes that is going to be your investment just a little bit of time spent three hours of your time any financial education scenario rather than maybe on social media or watching TV sounds like a good investment to me well just a second you can have a chance to win a set of these passes or one of the happy classes to get your bones ready and if you are driving now is a good time to pull over\nIncluded with your passes is going to be a professional insiders kitten other kids packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nLessons on topics like enhanced in your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional inside of it makes it so you can get started right now\nGoes to enter your twenty we need you to call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nThere is we stay on kind of this consistency track because of this this consistency conversation I should say you know you talked a little bit of a a little bit about shorting and that is a great opportunity make to make money as the market going down what are some of the other ways that people can diverse\nTwo different directions you know we hear diversification as far as I Do have a little commodities have little stocks have little bones but how 'bout diversification as far as different directional vehicles go\nWell you can always sit here and say we know that when the markets go down there's usually people pulling out of the markets Marty money's going somewhere either could go into gold\nIt can go into bonds the cool thing that our students learn here is it doesn't matter your background your age what you've done before we teach them how to read a chart so it's a stock short bond chart gold shark\nThey're able to start learning how to trade in the beauty of learning what shorting is is that again a lot of people have been told their whole lives when the markets go down it's a bad thing will last February\nGoldman Sachs may two hundred million dollars in one day by simply Shorty in the market now that day imagined that we did a little piece of it I'm not going to be greedy you know but if you start to learn how to treat like the banks do then it's amazing\nThat all of a sudden you can start learning a skill that can make your money and not have to sit there and think about a second job or to get into a bit later\nBut one of the ways I look at this and I get this analogy all the time when people are just simply trading one direction or they're waiting for the market to always go up it's like a car imagine that you were told you can get in a car tomorrow and you can drive somewhere but you can't put the car and reverse\nYou're going to go in a lot of circles eventually going to get there but you know it's a lot of time energy and money getting to the same place if you simply had all the tools to get you there faster so a lot of what I'm seeing our students learning for the first time is it they're becoming\nDirection ... they don't care if it goes up down or sideways as long as the markets are moving they can learn how to make money and what a lot of them are seeing right now is they could create more freedom for themselves because they're able to make money no matter where the markets go\nYeah absolutely and I ... I Love the analogy of the car and there's so many so many other analogy that we could pull into this that in in I always say in real life you know outside of the are investing life in our normal everyday life we there's no way we buy a car that didn't go in reverse right but so many times we find ourselves in investments that only have one direction or one avenue where they can profit\nYou know it's it's the same thing you go back to our you know go back to high school education and where was your stock picking class where it was how to balance a checkbook class right the law to check it out right\nI just dated myself victory over there but it is it is true though I mean we we really didn't have that stuff and so we're left to to rely on the quote unquote professionals really guide us through this process where unfortunately they make a commission off of these transactions and I say unfortunately kinda tongue in cheek there because that's okay with me that they make a commission that's that's\nWhat they do for a living your real estate brokers make a commission when they sell real estate so stockbrokers should naturally make a commission when they sell stocks\nBut when we buy a home it is up to it was up to the individual to make sure that they're buying the right home for them in the right market place in the right area that the right payment the right everything it's up to the person to do it\nThe broker just completes the transaction and unfortunately it's up to the person to also make sure that they're making the appropriate decision when it comes to their investing but when it really boils down to about Ninety nine percent of the world\nThey realized in the twenty first century that they can take a laptop anywhere in this world right now it doesn't matter because as long as they have an Internet connection and their laptops they can trade all over the world in fact\nWe had a student named B or and he's in San Diego and a lot of times are students feel it's too hard they can't do it well not only is beyond done this and has left his job which is exactly what everybody wants to do right we want to quit a job and I love to do something we do love he's become a excellent trader and he's also now started funding his wife's real estate business\nSo the two of them are doing something together\nSpending more time together spending more time on vacations in family but the important thing here Ryan is it they're loving what they're doing and there's so many people out there and if you're one of those people hopefully you can see how you can benefit from just learning a skill that can give you the freedom that you desire\nYeah absolutely and it's it's kind of interesting is we're as we're sitting here talking about how the lifestyle of a traitor I'd just literally received a text message from a dear friend of mine and it just popped up on my phone and he was actually somebody who got me started in trading he was one of the first people who said this is how you open an account these are the steps that you go through\nIt very very first conversation these just become a lifelong dear friend of mine and he's a huge ski bum he lives up in Salt lake you just easy travels around it as a great time\nHe just texted me with a picture of snow skis saying hey can you use these this season or should I take him to the ... because if\nI go to Salt Lake users bum a pair of skis from and rather than a hall in mind around but it it's just there's just so much freedom that can come with it and it\nAnd it really ends up just pulling down to a couple of basic steps a couple of basic as you were saying changes or actions that need to be taking because I think it's very critical it's very important it's it's very powerful once we do understand\nThat that that poor is just the state of mind right that passing over opportunities repeatedly and it's something that can be really easily changed just by stepping out of our comfort zone right just by stepping out of our comfort zone and doing something different we talk a lot about\nKind of cliche statements on the show here but it's because they're so true and they're so useful and it goes back to if we've always done if we always do what we've done will always get what we got and if we are completely satisfied with where we are then then great let's continue to do what made us so happy and the first place\nBut if we want a little bit more for trying to create a little more income if we're trying to create a little more freedoms we have a specific goal\nThat we're trying to accomplish that we haven't been able to get to we have to make the necessary changes and that's one of the life lessons that my grandfather share with me my whole life growing up he would hold up his five fingers I Would have to name all of them the first one is no your business the second one is be converted\nAnd that converted one as a youngster I honestly didn't understand what it meant and as I got involved with trading and I really started to go kind of soul searching down is is this something that's gonna work for me am I going to be able to do this\nThat converted when I started to realize was make the necessary changes the necessary metamorphosis do what's necessary and and and in the beginning and that was the one I was kind of didn't put as much emphasis on when I was like ten eleven twelve even Eighteen Nineteen twenty you know but then as I really started into my my grown up years I started realizing\nHow be converted that pointer finger of the five to ... became the most valuable because if we don't make the necessary changes we're never going to accomplish that kind of outlier goal that were after that one of the things we can do to help a few people get started with this as we still got a few tickets we can give away let's change some lives right now I got a half day class coming up in your area\nThat the cost of ... exactly what it takes to really take control of the finances really taken truly a retirement account generate more income inside of the market's really live that life that drafter and just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes one of these have take classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a good time to pulled over\nIncluded with your passage is going to be our

three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if\nBeing colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com and see if you can score some passes there now Larry one of the things that I always like to say and I said earlier on the show as it doesn't matter if you have two dollars or two million dollars\nIt's all about getting that money working for you and really getting it to generate that income so you can live the lifestyle you can reach the financial freedom goal that you're after but what are some of the things are what are some of the other kind of examples I Know you have your bags and bags low the view of these examples of our students that you've talked to that we're in one place there now and another well\nThe first thing we always understand here is that with trading it's simply a transfer money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing\nAnd what's really sad as people will get themselves stuck think about just time right now people can sit in front of a television for hours versus going out there and learning a skill that can help them and every year and yet we're coming up to the holiday season again we can start seeing all these Jim commercials again right\nCause here comes resolution time and one of those things I hear a students say over and over again is beside wishing having had more time was this is the year I Want to get out of debt and I want to turn my finances around and what's amazing is how many students\nCome in through the classes that we're doing right now and simply imagine what their life would be like if they can learn a skill to help them generate more money\nAnd that's the key it's about doing something taking action and getting out here to change your current situation again if you're a coach shovel and something that you are really interested in learning how to do there is no limitations here in fact one of my students June\nShe actually came to my class and she said all she wanted to do is play golf in Costa Rica\nAnd so she started realizing that by learning how to trade gave her the time to do that I said it's great just send me a postcard and she did and she said she was trading 'cause that's a whole nother piece of it people go on vacation Ryan right and they get raid the vacation they're making money to pay for it and so I asked you or your training before after golf she goes oh\nBefore of course that I loved that of course\nWe're talking with a group of students just a little while ago did a big trip through Europe and I remember him saying you know where we were trading out in Europe and we made as much money out on our trip as we actually spent on the trip and so it's kinda fun to come back from a trip with a with a with a flat balance or even being up after having a great after having a great time\nAnd that's the thing is it doesn't matter where you are you just have to have an Internet connection doesn't matter where you are and it doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter what your background is it's all about just proactive we identify good opportunities and that's really what we introduced you to show you exactly what it takes how to do that\nInside of the half the class and we are pretty much at the end of the show but before we end we used to do another give away your let's give at least ten more people the opportunity to get some tickets here oh right right now we've got to have their class coming up in your area and a half the class of ... exactly what it takes\nTo really reached that financial freedom generating more income in the markets like I always say if you're why is big enough you will find out how how is out at the half the class don't just to say you're going to have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these have to classes to get your bones writing if you're driving\nIs a great time to pull over including with your passages are professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhanced in your retirement strategy\nHow to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional insider kit makes it so you can get started right now\n... when he did a call now and reserve those seats the number is eight eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up being collars nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ...

after a small plane crash in the Atlantic off the Hamptons yesterday\nHe thought it was a perversion out the true religion and he had been taught and he was offended by that so he was on a mission mission to persecute and punish\nJewish convert to Christianity in fact he was he had sought permission from the Jewish authorities in Jerusalem to go to Damascus in Syria to round up these renegade Jew now Christians who have become a waivers and Christ and take them back to the authorities for punishment and imprisonment\nAnd he wasn't counted on the road by Jesus Christ too blinded him is wind it for three days a and he went to Syria for three years he learned the gospel direct revelations Jesus Christ\nAnd even came the most the fiercest evangelist though of Christian History the foremost ... expanded doctrine\nAnd the reason he's my favorite is I think precisely the reason God shows him to be the greatest evangelist and Christianity and that is that he was of superior intellect he was persistent and he was there was it was committed to what he was doing he was\nSuch a believer in God and so strong and passionate\nThat when he was converted he had this intimate knowledge of Judaism and that knowledge helped him a\nExpress the gospel to this to the Jews who lived at that time in ... to the gym tile\nBecause he understood how the Old Testament was a foreigner to the new tests and we don't get rid of the Old Testament as Christians Christians I think of this crazy idea that the Old Testament is not scripture\nIs the first part of to God's two part story yes the new cabinet replace it wasn't super sees the all Kevin that God didn't mean Christ didn't come to abolish the law but to fulfill it is the end\nOf God's promises and the old tests\nAnd so a hall is the greatest six moment of that and I think largely because of who he was what his background was his knowledge of Jewish history in Jewish law and how the Old Testament\nUh now that he could see it through the prism of the New Testament with hindsight and understand how it was all or running or run or to the New Testament the new cabinet\nHe was he was perfectly situated to make that case and spread the gospel help spread the gospel route the Roman empire at the time\nDo you think it's important that Paul identifies himself as an apostle ... would you say it again I think it's important that Paul identifies himself as an apostle\nWell yes because he needed credibility he was pronouncing the gospel explaining the gospel to these churches that he form and there were false teachers et cetera the form these churches just like you would expect because human nature doesn't change that false teachers in these charges like in ...\nUh and he was\nYou heard about them a drawing people away from the true faith and so he wrote these letters heartfelt letters where there's a motion on his slave with his authenticity are\nAvailable for everyone to say\nUh and he wrote these letter saying come back to the truth they don't follow the false teachers don't fall prey to the uh Hagen secular influences of the\nPeople who follow the goddess what got us effort id and corn a hotbed of sexual immorality and I dollar for each duress address those people directly now some people have asked me on these interviews well\nWhat would call safe at churches today\nA ... because they they are doing the same thing I say\nHe would say exactly what he said in these letters because what he said to these letters though written to local church just work to become inspired scripture they were ... and and so he would just turn a letter overtone hey here's what I said no apply you human nature's universe let's timeless and\nAll of these instructions and you'll be fine\nDo you think acts of the apostles a significant in that it's also the apostles you other eleven who then recognize or twelve who then recognize Paul as an apostle as well\nWhy in fact they did recognize Sam or there may have been some difficulties at first that James and Peter and all of them recognized Sam ... pain or even reversed to\nA polls writings difficult at times but as inspired word of God as scripture all wrote him and self in Timothy or Seventy that all scripture has got great his\nHis uh he he was clearly recognized as a possible in fact he wants to even read gift theater because Peter sitcoms to peer pressure not to eat with\nThe gentile convert some of his Jewish friends are said don't eat with them all was outraged by this because Peter had been told specifically by got in a direct vision or that there is no gentile or Jew we're all equal before Christ we we\nI obviously will break bread with them it's outrageous that you want So Peter was abused and humbled any then went for your call or not recognized as an equal heat or what not affect and he has a corrective action that way\nI Want to go back to the beginning of this interview when you talked about the fact that you had resisted you had your access to the word of God but you just resisted the word of God\n... you know if someone who's familiar with the Bible and and the you know they're not sure what to do or how to read it or how to even get started doing it what what is your advice to people who are seekers like yourself okay\nIf I sat resist that I miss about what I meant was negligent lead didn't attempt to ... um because I I had\nBeen sections about it that it was one way or whatever I wasn't\nInterested in reading the Bible itself I figured it was in ... uh I didn't know where to get started I mean I looked at it before obviously a growing up sure but I didn't know where to get started and so my advice to people is to actually read it and maybe start off with\nThe gospel of John which is so the logical and it'll help you understand Christ dual nature holy God and fully man and so I think that's a way to start but\nAlso read the Bible from start to finish get steady aid these books by the way that I've written are designed to help people it's I consider them like a a a series of Sunday school lessons where I'm trying to help people\nUnderstand what the basics of the scripture are and what they really mean so

his holding in Obamacare was very surprising I think to a majority of American I was shocked that\nYou cannot understand what happens when someone gets light tenure they put on the black robe\nThey

I mean do you think this was politically a good decision for somebody who was a rising star she's still young forty six years old rising star in the Republican many Tatars central presidential campaign ... yeah\nWell she she she knows that she addressed that went through food there in the White House was I'm not running of nobody Bernie I'm not doing it or not or if you've never do you never know what can happen between now and twenty twenty right that is true and it's really funny because President Trump\nKeeps charting her publicly and he did in the in the session with ... in the White House he keeps saying I think she'll be back I think she'll be back I think she's coming back I think he grew really fond of her which is really funny because if you're reading ... exactly you remember what it's about his army remark very publicly you can replace the United nations of bathroom pretty easily\nYeah so where do you go from being you went into a basket or I mean John Bolton becomes NSA Director so where do you go from\nThat I I Want to take her at a word I I don't know Nikki Haley you think ... she ... she wants to walk away from it and consider what our options might be because I I think at this point or options or rather probably substantial\nIn in in a and I think she was ... from getting out before an implosion in the Trump Administration that's what a lot of people say she gets out now she's kind of unscathed she's rounded out her career she has the public policy at the international policy experience to kind of really\nJumped on her but she is on record so it's no she can't run from her record this and that she can't run away from them and I don't think she anticipates them imploding ... so I think she just I\nYou know that's a lot of spotlight I ... a that's a lot of spotlight to have on you all of the time\nAnd this is a woman who's married and his family and remember she you know she's she's a family member or a mom in a in a wife as well as everything else\nDina Powell Ivanka Trump who's going to be the next ambassador to the United nations\nI don't know as long as it drops has absolutely no way it's not going to be her okay Dina ...\nIs is the name that gets mentioned a lot of recurrent out our best to Germany gets talked about quite a bit but when he was asked about it the other day Trump said no I ... is doing a great job when I was doing a great job for us in Germany [laughter]\nDoing a fantastic job and you know don't forget he was considered at one point maybe for the best are shipped to NATO So I suspect that Trump wants to keep them there so the list starts to narrow down ... I wouldn't be surprised at the Dana pal but\nI you know military Clinton goes on CNN and says ... Democrats cannot stay civil that this is this conversation has got I got ... what does that mean I don't know and then and then you had\nA former attorney general Eric Holder down and down in Georgia is Stacey Abrams rallies talking about you know Michelle Obama used to say when they go low we go high no no no we don't do that anymore when they go low we kick them because that's who we are now in in I got into discussion with somebody about this just the other night\nI don't think this is a good time for Democrats to be doing this because it's not a Republican who went on record saying confront people challenge them on the streets is not a Republican that shot a baseball team of congressman sort of Republican who who are you know\nStormed into restaurants and and ah and disrupted a disrupted as senator from from having dinner with his wife Republican who's done all of that is urban Democrats I Would think at this point Democrats would be trying to dial that back and take the kind of Maxine Waters equation download\nBad ... you know what it seems it seems like Trump is is kind of really so much fuel is on the fire him on that but the Democrats don't really get hit with the with the label of being the flame throwers that he really is the one who's\nWell no he does and and he brings it on himself I mean let's be really honest he he does that and then you and you know some people have said that you know when he went after for that actually it was a turning point\nIn the Kavanaugh here and there was a cringe there but that was a cringe worthy moment for me I was embarrassed I I work yeah I think most people were yeah but but people have said that that was actually a moment where things started to turn around for capital\nThe this is the problem is it's like having gotten too and this this question as a person of faith right on your doing politics\nFulltime ministry ears right before you can can apply so at the time I Believe it was three or four years minimum so I I see that but they don't want you know green minister coming in right deal with things like I did they want you to have a few things under your belt like marriages and funerals and counseling and ... and\nSo you go into the military and you're in for how long before you have your first deployment\nAll of three months while liberal wow I literally showed\nUp to Fort Stewart Georgia on February first two thousand seven that was my first day of active duty and deployed for Fifteen months on may believe it was made ten may twelfth somewhere there of the same year so just over three months I couldn't even spell colonel\nWhen I was [laughter] was your caller to millions on right [laughter] you're so far\nAnd was all backwards I probably had the flag on the wrong shoulder I ever\nAte at green could be and uh went to war and learned a lot you know early on that the best\nSo what year was that that you went what you wish that deployment did you say\nTwo thousand seven uh started in May of two thousand seven and we came home July two thousand eight\nAll right so and when you were over there what were you doing over there were you with one unit or were you traveling around or how did that work\nUh I was with one unit and I was traveling around as well so we got there it was an infantry battalion and they kind of sliced off some of our little companies within the battalion and put them in different places and so I Would go around and see my guys on a pretty regular basis\nI went on patrol with them on\nA I did go on a few patrols with them I wouldn't go on the some of the ones where they were like really after somebody yeah I'm In new is going to be a firefight but if they were just doing the Ronald patrols are going to help build the school or the water pumps in the village I Would go out and do that stuff but then\nSo what was most stressful for you know\nGoing out with these guys guys and gals\nActually going out with him was enjoyable I I enjoyed that part the stressful part in what ... what contributed to really our marriage problems when I came home was\nJust that the mounted yeah a law clerk Fifteen guys on that call them and we had over Ninety wounded so this was this was no longer um I\nIt it it was just a it was it was it was full on combat during this time in my heart I honestly frankly was not prepared for that level of grief in my own heart and uh\nAnd I tried to attract a process that with some buddies over there I just did not do well so that's where the the combination of all the stress and anxiety and tension really came to a head when I came home once I was out of that environment where where'd you go wow I had a lot of things tucked away and my soul that I did not handled properly\nDid you were there was this impossible to communicate I Can't imagine it would be possible but maybe was were you able to communicate this with your wife or it was just the sheer amount of grief you were carrying impossible to process and share\nIt was impossible I didn't even know how to communicate it to myself much less my wife and so I think I internalized a lot of it um I wanted to be with my buddy who I deployed with more than my family which is a sign that there's a big problem\nI I Know that now um but when I came home it was it was almost like my wife and my children and the rest of my family they just didn't understand and so I wanted to be with people who got it you know what I mean who understood where we ban I didn't have to explain myself to them they didn't have to explain themselves to me\nSo the hard work looking back would have been to sit down and really download this and process it with my wife and\nFamily what can I\nCan I can I ask you like ... ... what was that moment of awakening there'll be did your wife sits you down knock you upside the head I mean how does your wife suddenly communicating died\nShe tried several times she kept saying we need help you need to talk to somebody and I I just missed it I didn't think I had a problem um but when she finally said we're going to separate and so you figure this out that that was the wake up moment bailout oh well maybe maybe I Am a bigger jerk then I've given myself\nCredit [laughter] how did you handle that as a as a you know as a man and then\nAlso as a clergyman [laughter] right yeah there are two different\nElements it's like I'm dealing with this is a man and my marriage is on the rocks but I'm also a believer and I'm kind of dealing with this as a faith man and and um and on top of that I'm I'm One goal to preach the gospel\nYeah another nominal why she's still my quick solution was I Need to get out of the army\nFor a couple of reasons one any time and space to really rescue not only my family but my own heart and in speaking council and go to counseling submit myself to\nSome ah brothers and sisters in the fate and really kind of start over and processed this but also I didn't want to be a hypocrite sitting in a\nA counseling situation trying to get young a soldier's good solid marriages family advice when my own life was just falling apart under me so I actually was on my commission which is a big deal for an officer\nThere is I needed I Need it out and uh thank God that the army recognize that um I Need it out and I needed out quickly so they gave me not only a quick out but also an honorable discharge because my service up to that point\nAnd so it really made it easier to come back in later which I had no plans don't come back in but once I did decide that the army had made it easy for me to come back in with that honorable discharge to start with\nWell you obviously your story ... in in the movie indivisible is about what you and your wife and it clearly is centered around the military\nBut speaking was listening to you as a married man I can tell you even those in you know there's well not in the military have challenges and their relationships with what is it do you think that the movie in your experience can teach all of us about relationships\nIn in a particular marriage ... relationships\nYeah so uh when when I came home I didn't fully appreciate what my wife had gone through she was also alone for Fifteen months but with three children and grieving spouses back here and the stress of living every day hoping she doesn't get a knock on the door\nAnd so when I came home I I felt like my experience was more significant than hers but guess what she thought\nNothing at all all that she had had a very significant year and she had\nBoth we both wanted to be heard we both work in the end it wasn't until we finally stopped\nUh being so selfish and staring at our own belly buttons that we began to fully appreciate one another again and what she gone through that had gone through and that began the slow rebuilding of our marriage was we really\nMean simply I hate this it almost sounds cliche cliche but we just stopped being self centered and we started appreciating and loving the other one for who they were what they had gone through it no longer just feeling sorry for ourselves about what we uh got\nYou know when we think about the military we think about our heroes and I'm curious who you think are the real heroes of indivisible\nOh my goodness well uh the the true heroes Jesus Christ of without him he ah without his uh the resurrection has everything to us right without that he's just nice teacher but the power of the Holy Spirit in our lives because\nPrices rose and incentive is Holy Spirit to live in power that that is our our our ultimate hero or but also uh his his his people on earth but the body the worldwide body is price who came along side of a Heather and I did not recover alone\nWe needed our brothers and sisters and tries to speak the truth to us even when we didn't want to hear it\nWhen she wanted to leave when I wanted to complain the more we had people telling us the truth that loved us enough to tell the truth and also finally the soldiers who\nSigned up they volunteer we still have an all volunteer voluntary military and they sign on the dotted line to die for you for me it for everyone and met that powerful that I get to go to work every single day with people\nWho remind me of what price did for us\nChaplin Darren Turner a is at the center of indivisible great

Tennessee\nTed Cruz is looking like he's going to hold on to Texas Florida Arizona Nevada Montana and Missouri are in play\nAnd according to the real clear politics dot com nap so it's going to happen early on the next thirty days or twenty days or is the Democrats are going to say we're in it for all the money in holding on to ms zoo Montana Nevada\nPicking up our zone a holding on to Florida holding on to Indiana they're going to pull out of Tennessee in Texas and basically you're going to have a battle for six states but here's the thing even if the Democrats when all of those six the Republicans still\nHave fifty according to the real clear politics map\nAnd do and if you think about it and Heidi Heitkamp will probably lose in North Dakota so if the Republicans pick up two seats it's fifty two forty eight if they pick up one is fifty one forty nine and we hold\n'em we meaning you know the conservatives are but what's interesting about this is\nA this is kind of intriguing Florida could go any way uh I don't know why the Republicans aren't playing in Florida I think if I was a betting person two of the six break Republican and and then sold to four\nOf the six so\nThat's why my my own God I think the Republicans hold on to the Senate if the Republicans lose the house and Senate yeah you're right I mean all bets are off and that's probably what you're seeing with some of this uncertainty in the market although some would say it's cyclical things were going up they need to take a breather\nThat house map is different and the Republicans have really a if there are no toss ups according to the same polls the Democrats go to a five to two oh one\nAnd was\nQuite interesting is the Democrats are really doing well in historically red districts if you look at New Jersey to\nA Seth Grossman against\nA who's that Jeff van drew Jeff Andrew is running more as a conservative\nAh but you know he will be aligning with the Democrats we won't be governing that way so uh but he made a lot of friends while he was a state legislator a Pennsylvania five and six historically very Republican and then there's a bunch of historical we Republican seats in Pennsylvania Minnesota\nMichigan and then there's a bunch of\nToss ups so if all the toss ups\nBreak and all the toss ups are now currently Republican although it I can see a scenario where the Republicans when the Congress too I just have not been impressed with the pool of candidates they're\nPicking and they're they're giving away certainly clear seats so I'm\nNew Jersey three they put his a toss up that's Tom MacArthur verse Andrew Kim I don't see Tom MacArthur losing that\nUh some of these polls I think are a little off I Would say that's a leans geo pay and I'm and I'm looking at the real clear politics map but who cares about a wins or loses you have to be prepared right now so what what questions do you have\nAny fault series for example um what what is it possible that\nThe if the Democrats take power they would say a two way with the text T shirt benefits of treasuries or something like that I mean it is\nNow here is a lot I'm I'm not telling me to go to treasuries I Am saying there are fixed assets classes that you need to look into at times like this um the the if if the Democrats win the Congress the New York times is actually proposing\nTo and to some of the four oh one K.\nAnd so there there's a lot here where the four one K. tax differ so there are some interesting articles that I'm seeing where now there could be a a\nWith the four oh one K. so I I see the problem is taxes\nGo up although that might\nTake to to seven years to fully realize that why they're that's why there is a brief political window of opportunity where you can sort of take advantage of these low tax rates while we have them\nAnd many of your calling us at eight hundred three\nTwo one zero seven ten and getting are or what to do if taxes are raised review okay so basically are the four oh one K. is getting sharp criticism\nFrom\nAll of these people and what's interesting Republicans have considered a cut in four O. one K. contributions as a way to not raise the taxes but to raise revenue so that's something I'm a bit concerned about so I don't I don't know if\nThat concerns you but that that would concern me some of the loss of tax benefits as far as treasuries\nAre\nWhat are you know if the broader question is well what can I Do to make sure I have some money that is non market determine\nWhere you could look at treasuries he could look at maximum funded insurance contracts you could look at municipal bonds are generally a more conservative you could look at certain types of fixed and six indexed annuities so there there are a lot of options for you\nOkay now right [noise]\nAnd we'd love to go through those more conservative options for you and the Trump tax law a\nAnd this is in the New York times says the Trump tax was back to haunt House Republicans in key races I don't know I think if they would have adopted some of my ideas they wouldn't have had these problems I think the Trump tax plan needs\nA redo so we'll see any other questions right tanks wonderful so\nGive us a call ... eight hundred three two one zero seven and calls for the no obligation market\nReview aided eight nine eight eight Josh aided eight nine eight eight\nFive six seven for if you have questions on stocks bonds mutual funds or whatever question who have no question is a dumb and so give us a call ... who do we have next soaks",
