Tyler Moore one to the charity softball game method asking her once he was in that show I'm trying to remember who else and that was it I never met them\nTonight I wrote a sky theater column about Mary Tyler Moore when she was in a Neil Simon and ah she was a little older and she was having trouble learning her lines and Neal's wife\nDelivered a handwritten note from Neal to marry and the note said either learn my lines or get out of my play wow Mary's left it down on the table in her dressing room walked right out the stage door and\nBringing it back yeah I when I met her you know\nYou know your image of people is you know she's cute Mary with turned up ... tough yeah she was a tough way and she was smoking away and I just didn't see that image I just that and she said why would a pretty late like that be spoken away like a tribute\nAnd get it if you ever want to get a glimpse of a cut of the real Mary Tyler Moore her ... and see her in the movie ordinary people whom she said she plays a great novel mother\nWho's right and really good and she was wonderful and the Mary Tyler Moore show us oh and I met them a Valerie Harper when I'm trying to think of the people I Know those who actually met at one time or another\nI had a a just a quick story for it I had a friend an actor and he was a guest on the Mary Tyler Moore show and he arrived or for their first reading the script and all the chairs were out there and Betty White was there\nAnd he said he was the guest Akron city where should I said and the Betty White's oh sit anywhere where democracy around here so we sat in the middle charged oh no no that's ...\nThat's ... ... democracy Sony and make it a president Mattis may sign up the defense secretary\nMay signed the order today Trump wants between a hundred and a thousand troops on the southern border this was an addition to the Twenty one hundred National Guard soldiers there is already spread out along the southern border this was the combat the caravan\nHeading this what got no problem with that you got what seven to ten going maybe to fourteen thousand people come in there who knows who's in their gang members terrorists we have no idea\nComing our way we've got to secure the border this is precisely what the troops should be used for all the image that they're coming right here at the level of cards right in the being pushed over here\nGot to get the anyway I don't really know national guardsmen\n... over there don't they just uh offer support to the customs and border people they don't actually get out there and do the work they actually do backup work and all that so I don't know what the troops are going to do but the okay\nWell what do you what do you think should be done I guess let him come in you know\nI've said proposed do lend something has to be done at seven thousand people or they're not coming in okay what's some of them are going to get in okay and they come into your house because I used to be able to do and when I was under the border and wave and go back\nOK okay we've been round the bend a hundred times about Sarah Huckabee Sanders was left\nTo defend the president yesterday because he's being attacked by the ... well you guys called the mainstream media they say he should in some way be held partially responsible for all the rhetoric that's going around the these days with these so called bombings anyway eras Sarah Huckabee Sanders yesterday\nWe're gonna continue to do everything we can to provide the resources they need to investigate and hold the person or persons responsible for this I\nFully accountable okay so then of course you went out to say one person who's not responsible in any way ...\nThere's a a big difference between\nA comments made an actions taken the president is certainly not responsible for sending suspicious packages to someone no more than Bernie Sanders was responsible for a supporter of his shooting up or Republican baseball field practice last year the idea that this is that the hands of the president is absolutely\nThat's rather media was an angry mob there Germany screaming\nStoner there'd be stowed very ended I'd had their pitch for it I thought I had a obviously\nShe went on to talk about how negative the media is towards Donald Trump in some quarters\nNinety percent of the media attention around this president is negative despite historic a job creation despite the fact that our economy is booming despite the fact that trade deals that everybody said couldn't be made have been made despite the fact that the president is trying to insult law and order at our border\nAnd we have Sarah how can we do like PR worked for this show I mean really she's we could do the rug be a wonderful show us the best show ever\nBut I Would ask Monica Monica well she's gone now but I mean you have to understand that blackface is deeply offensive to African Americans you can't they used to call it blacked out you know they would put the charcoal on their face and do a minstrel show that is racist and offensive and it touches a raw nerve in this country and she just went right for it blended into it\nYeah but again I think that was her only offense ratings were great they say they will sensitivity training I Apologize you know let's let's bring us she tried to apologize to well your apology but then she brought on a ... blocks that came out like our broker but then she said I Melvin\nSaid that bone headed thing where she said that inter apology and and I learned that that um minstrel shows in blackface or fences to African Americans I learned she just learnt that now might just talking to al ... you're talking about this\nI learned that given the history of blackface used an awful way by racists in this country it is not okay for that to be part of any costume Halloween or otherwise [noise] I've never actually seen kind of person\nAll right well she goes on from there hey this is where a Dan is hope well junction dead you agree with me about something\nI I I find that I it's it's a dark day land I\nReally do they\nMegan Kelly has it raises your body I just think she I'm clearly way Patrick you know\nI ... [laughter] but I just do things to slip by the time it was silly\nAnd um I don't think she should I I think they had it out for a good show\nWasn't doing well the ratings were down this was a way to get her out of that multi million dollar contract\nYou know anyway she's fighting that she's fighting the claw all of her sixty nine million bucks we'll see if she get ...\nGet it we we can find common ground and politics\nThan you and I are going to go out to have some beers\nWe might we might might they don't don't limit yourself yet then you know what to do with eggs out when I talked to di\nDi di di di feel bad about that I ... when you said that we're happy to drink before we meet with the big brass last week yeah and I offered to pay I said I'll get it and he offered I said no let me get a boy that while I went back so fast\nAnd then the brass came and they picked it up so we got off well like I said you came to my neighborhood because we're right across the street from where we you know I'm trying to be polite nice you're supposed to say absolutely not no this one's I didn't you didn't\nDo that for a second I Want to go into shape for a new car and I say is that the best you Okay John in Brooklyn and what do you have to say John was up\nHey good morning guys Megan Kelly who I Am not a huge fan of spoke like every commonsense person who would say if a white individual wants to portray a African American individual you need to change the pigmentation up your skin\nBut you actually need to do that to portray the character or the individual Eddie Murphy did it in the Nineteen eighties and that task ... where he was an African American undercover as a white person knows anything about it so like any comments that person would say well I Need\nAnd you're the the the make up to do that\nYeah but can equate with a white cat and yet the minstrel and\nSee what the problems we keep coming up with different rules for people like Michael you said well we'll just deeply offensive to some of the problem is you don't have a right in America to not be offended we can't run a country or a society based on who's going to be a senator who isn't going to be offended when we get away from being free\nBut it ...

your watch golf\nAs far as DNA or your prints off the devices in the mail what's new on the overnight is is a uncouth front\nEleventh package a that was apparently mailed to a senator Cory Booker ... so I don't know the uncut from right now but a stroke indication that there is\nWow I'd not heard to where it is right now yeah it's it's it's pretty much breaking so\nI started showing\nIt doesn't appear that they're all coming from this one post office\nIt would appear that way now you have to understand when you come when mail comes into New York it's a I don't know if that's a centralized location or posts looks up look I'm not sure\nUh but when it comes to the New York it flies in the ... he goes to a centralized location on the west side of it and then shipped out to post offices around the city so um I don't know if that's the same situation there whether it's a centralized location or it's a small post office once wrote this\nAnd see if someone in law enforcement what do you make of the fact that most of these devices were\nMaybe all of them were not real bombs they were designed to look like them but really weren't\nSure we said from the from the geckos possible I Do so it's it's ... it's unknown right now if they were able to explode if there was enough current within the battery pack ... to to generate explosion now I Do believe\nOr let's say um [noise] let's say a black powder that's a that's a explosive device within the pipe itself was there enough courage\nTo explode that that to be decided at Quantico, Virginia right now it's unusual\nThat type of um [noise] triggering device on or something cents a bale it's quite as usual it looks almost uh almost like it's a it's a hoax but there is that material so hoaxes not associated with that with the resources\nAnd what about some of this other a powder white powder that was found in some of the packages that appears to be non threatening\nI haven't heard of that because of the response on that what that was a just recently rice who was sent to a president so President Trump so that's always a scare prices is as deadly as you know however most of the white powder a couple up so we get in New York city turned out to be ...\n... where I don't know what else is\nWrong with the proper boy says the former New York city chief of detectives in and chief\n... is is it possible that just one person walked in a ... a a ... in Florida the postal facility with eleven maybe packages now that one may have been headed for Cory Booker is impossible one person just walked in with a Lebanon throw him in the mail\nIs possible and if you ... someone like that because it can move with a big box labeled he sees all these now if that does happen hopefully this video there hopefully the surrounding video that you can identify this person we can get an image and put that out\nTo the public down there you go to other identification that way so yes it is possible or know if it's if it's a it's as if it is right now but uh that's where this guy's just go\nTo the point is it that too early in the investigation to begin to develop a profile of this bomber\nYou know it's it's not as you're always looking to um help you would have got to find that by some profile\nWho has who has a a grudge against anyone is already prior\nUm threats coming out of that area so that's for the local police department to the size is this someone who's quite notable down there was a lot of noise at one side of the political issue or not it was it looks like a political issue here so no it's not too early

o'clock News Let's go right to thirty rock Alice Stockton Rovenia looks like they're negotiating with Megan Kelly she is out of NBC and Alice what other people saying they're\nOkay most people I Know I didn't like her poor said she had to go if I just say that shall I go I was kind of getting the same kind of answer I thought what am I gonna find Megan Kelly and so I went outside the box this guy said she was sure nice to look at and sharing your story\nYou know I Know what's politically correct\nA white person can have on black\nIf he said playing a role where something I I don't see anything wrong with it and\nGrew up in a long time ago but when we we used to have a play every year and\nFor six guys or girls dressed up in blackface and\nThey told jokes and it was perfectly acceptable back then and I grew up in West Virginia and\nI don't I don't think it's a a a racist state but\nThe gist of what I thought she was defending\nBlack face for Halloween it wasn't that the gist\nOf why and yeah yeah I think that's particularly offensive\nNo no I mean it's what the person's eyes you know you can have a white face and if you do sound like racist or bad that's that's not right\n... ... ... okay they find that political correctness gone you\nKnow I just think Megan ought to be able to say what she wants to free speech in America and I think that we're getting too wrapped up in all of this [noise]\n... you think she should have been fired no\nFor that comment no I mean think of the things that [noise]\nDifferent people say I just think it depends on which side of the aisle you're on depending on how you treat it\nSounds like she should have been she's pretty neutral she's not in one son and all of the other day if the guests are pulling out of the show and advertisers are pulling out and you don't have the ratings you got a big problem their\nBottom line now that I ...\nWell I think people say things that they don't have a meaning behind it\nSo sometimes you say things that you don't have in ... and I think that's the difference you don't think she's a right to I don't I really don't think he should have been fired idol did you like or shall I Do like our ship when you're like about\nAs I mean their personalities that's all that's all I mean I'm not there to have somebody tell me how to think anyways\nJust because you're on TV doesn't mean you control me and how I think that's my personal Vance disappointing\nTo know I was on TV all those years I thought I had a great model ... yeah\nAll those years she has to go to kinda got a little bit\nOn the other shows that have been to watch their anyway and I in fact she came on afterwards after we got ready to go where [noise]\nI don't think you say those kind of thing I think that's inappropriate so they fire of all a fence a city in today's day and age yet\nIn yesterday's DNA found but I think things were were different of a point you know and there was a lot of things that was acceptable that probably shouldn't have been\nAnd you know for now for someone who's on TV to say those types of things to say that and then to say that if they don't understand I think is I think that's the part if you're someone on news [noise] you know you have enough information any easier to information\nThat than to say something bad to be like oh well I I didn't know that I think that I think that's the second part is one thing to say it and say look I made a mistake but to say it and say well you know we I never heard that phrase before that's the part where I think you you stepped over a line\nYou know outside just tend to think of her ratings were great ah they probably wouldn't have fire that's what I'm thinking\nYeah and I yeah I think a lot of eagle at\nTo shake great rating of ... jumping out on her but she just had one after another and what's interesting is that it was this hard charging lawyer she was the one that was going to get to the truth and she was ... and then they try to make her a woman trying to turn me and the Natalie it's never going to happen\n[laughter] she was a phony\nShe went to the your guest why that however I Will say she likes hey so that he'll be like hey that's all it wait at the end of my a lot a couple of weeks ago with our kids watching tight as she looked like she was having a very nice time\nSo I don't know maybe she does her kids and she wants
