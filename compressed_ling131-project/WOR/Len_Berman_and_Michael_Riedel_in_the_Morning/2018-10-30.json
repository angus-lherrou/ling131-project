has\nAnnounced they're going to do something about it they're now going to assign a one car from every police precinct dedicated to spot inspections a private sanitation trucks\nUh and uh they found all kinds of violations that's what's a created this thing and we let's hear from the department of sanitation uh this is the crackdown and the cheapest apartment NYPD Terry Monaghan\nThey're running red lights backing unsafe we went to section [noise] ah we we looked at their equipment and there's a lot of violations and you're making the trucks unsafe and Dr\n... apparently they went looking at

twenty cents thousands of people hit or killed by trucks\nOne town who many reckless driving in someone's life thinking alive\nSo and so what happens hours after this announcement a private sanitation\nTruck owned by five star cartoon ran down a by cyclists Fifth Avenue and forty seven ... ... ... ... you know right near a Fox in ... in a dish and to just bad driving and has what is driving me have bad trucks\nYeah I didn't know that because all bad driving I see I've seen them come down to run one way streets the wrong way here just this morning instead of pulling over to the curb to load in the trash block of votes right in the middle road yup the rains I had to sit there and I had to wait and I'd say late\nGetting you know this is a garbage\nTruck and they take pleasure I think when they do they do I think they just like an absolutely ... got to look at this cops that this is according to the story about this which I read in the daily news or cops in the nineteenth precinct on the Upper East side and the six to ... beach Brooklyn\nSpotted private garbage trucks blowing through at the lights and driving the wrong way well that's what he was a dry on the wrong way he's big trucks rung come down to one way the wrong way\nThree four in the morning they're coming down the wrong way and honestly I never and I'm sure it it happens but I've never seen it happen within New York city sanitation Chuck it always the trap that I have no problem with yeah\nNow are just before we had some news this story with New Jersey transit is just unbelievable uh uh uh ... among Claire bound train stalled at six thirty near Newark several be forty five minutes turned out it was two hours and people were overheated they said they were too sick passengers they said fights broke out\nAmong the passengers were you sit there for two hours to see how nice shiny and the train\nBefore it was cancelled so this was doubling pat\n... uh this is the this is what they uh passengers heard\nRight now really\nGotten warmer than ours are trying to do it quickly and\nForty nine percent unfavorable in the Republican Senate candidate there's behind so yeah she's being very aggressive much more so\nAnd he can be in many places because this is based versus base there since World War one trench warfare here and so that's where he is most useful\nHey we're on without ... defined ABC News political endless in Washington joins us every week at this time so Alex is everything now all about the midterms obviously this statement coming out you believe it is about the anchor babies and he wants to sign an executive order outlawing that and then\nSending the military to the border I mean you know the commenting common for weeks at a time but man they're going to the border right now is this just all about the midterms a week from today\nWell I got out by map and according to Google or the caravan is about a two thousand\nMiles away moving at twenty to thirty miles a day I show or by the time\nThey get here they'll be a you know twenty people left\nAnd it'll be twenty Nineteen so it could be about politics yeah that might be one [laughter] but\nBut there's a bigger story here and the story is of course borders should a country have\nBorders can you be a country Without Borders if an army of two thousand people is coming here Democrats are saying hey that's not a law and order issue that shot a threat to the law and order in America Republicans are saying it is it's as big things about both parties which is why it's effective for Republicans\nAnd someone sent you about the president's war against the media and uh I I Know lend has been critical of him and I got to tell you I'm a I think he has some foundation here\nUm it really is in a nice one of the accusations is that the media is what a ... or what is driving the country apart\nAnd when you look at the news coverage is each to separate versions of the story so there is a divide being done by the media here\n[laughter] well my from just did a survey yesterday which are going to be putting out this week on political division in American who American hold responsible\nThan when you ask\nA they certainly blame Donald Trump about three quarters of America\nBut when you ask them about whether the news media's responsible for division ten percent or people blamed the news media in general then blamed a little trouble yeah high eighties they also blame a political pundits and commentators but we don't need\nTo get so Lynn ... see I mean you said a bunk bunk that he's blaming the media for driving the country part is that people believe that it's happening he he is onto something there I think you're going to have an argument is\nJoe and uh I I Would love to be the first time Lynn is right but it hasn't happened today\nA lot of Americans see how my last my last appearance on it and I know that a lot of Americans\nSee that that division that we have in the country is exploited by media as a business uh they become\nPartisan agents whether it's envy MSNBC on the left box on the right CNN on the left Fox's sucked away all the Republicans everybody else as Democrats to appeal to for eyeballs in ratings so yes Americans see that it's a political division is the news media is is is\nWell I was I Would argue what came first the chicken or the egg but I have a feeling we'd be going round and round them this but tell me you mentioned your company I'm not familiar with what is your company do\nOh well we have a company called purple a little bit of a Republican reading democratic blue and we help corporate America big Braves and industries fight for their rights to succeed sell stuff in America in this polarized political environment so\nWe ... from doing campaigns awhile ago made it over the wall having a look back\nI got to tell you Alex that's a tough business I'm a win\nNo you're trying to sell a product to a whole country and we have this divide it especially now I mean if you support Trump than you automatically have fifty percent of the people who hate you and vice versa so I'm for business has got to be very tricky\nIt's a tough time but it's also\nA there's such a great hunger for Americans for some things that brings us together when you ask Americans also if\nIf if diversity should be something that divides us just emphasizes our differences are diversity should serve or larger unifying purpose so that\nOur great individual fish in a cheap something great for the nation people want us to come together so desperately may be the candidate is out there somewhere I just don't see them today\nHouse we have uh just under a minute left but I put on a two yesterday and maybe this is can be your next polling thing you do and it got some traction as soon as anybody remember when we were happy and any chance of getting back to that time\n[noise] [noise] well [laughter]\nI don't know where it's going to take some tremendous change because Washington is old dysfunctional it's a big old factory in a local full world it doesn't work very well either Democrats or Republicans show both\nEither party or both parties going to evolve to actually give us a government that works\nState too hopeful at the moment [noise]\nAll right Alex state soon because maybe next week he'll say I got something right so\nA back Mr purple\nThemself Alex Cross the ABC News ... region\nAre coming up next a\nNow now this will be appealed to I don't think it's going to I may not stop it but the the state has ruling and I believe it is gambling by the way it is yeah of course with absolute worst is gambling yeah and they they couched it and and Cuomo I had a bill passed and all this stuff but what judges wrong it's gambling so this may not so fast that New York's\nThe argument with fantasy as you weren't betting on the outcome of the game so then technically it wasn't a gambling but if you're in the state of New Jersey you can bet on sporting events now it's legal right now it's like you've got to be in the state of New Jersey right you can do it online or at a casino in\n... but that's still isn't going to put FanDuel a draft things out of business because they have these other ... that they won All right Joe Bartlett says Benji Lima he's won two Super Bowls Joe you got to you and you're like giants fan and it was the last time we won the Superbowl well it's been a while yeah middle forty six and we're going on what I think it's two thousand ... well ... or\nEven beyond that but here there's a thing you know what ... and I I really feel bad that I I say this because I really admire you lie he's a tremendous um guy as a person just spend a great player I'm loyal to the giants but I think we got to shake it up now\n... is this ... I don't think he's the answer no who knows but should have drafted a quarterback no no no no no no no no no no um but uh the problem I see is the offensive line can't protect the line Eliza veteran quarterback and he can see it coming ... could get creamed well\n... how much longer will be a giant or will start how about the Mets today will officially named Brody van wagon in general manager\nPlayer agent so he represents or represented hum I'm\nJacob ... so the players are now going to start running the teams I guess now he asked them to go to ... think he that's a good move I don't know anything about him but to have an agent well why not you know about running a team he's now called the former clients felt Jacob the grumble 'cause it was not a current client\nBase right
