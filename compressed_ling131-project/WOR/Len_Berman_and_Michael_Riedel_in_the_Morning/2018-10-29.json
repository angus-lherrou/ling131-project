Michael Riddle has the day off and I listen I'll be honest it affected me probably more because I'm Jewish and just the thought of\nPeople in synagogue and I've thought of that I've sat in synagogue and I've thought of some wacko anti Semite coming in with a gun and it it's crossed my mind it's not it's not like it never crossed and stuff I never think of it and that's why\nI think a lot of Jewish people like myself just so he actually was it finally happened well it'd be because the just the rise of anti Semitism or or the terrorists you know I don't always think of anti also the ... as the terrorists are anti Jewish well many of them Islamic radicals so\nSo I think in general and you know it wasn't necessarily think I'm a white supremacist or or a personal one political spectrum or another I was just thinking of just the terrorists to get that same kind of feeling when you're in a movie theater I don't feel as much but I Do think about it and I know your time oh yeah I mean you look where the exits are\nOh I see I don't feel targeted in church although I don't really go to church that much anymore but um but you know in a movie theater I definitely am conscious of where the exits are\nNow of course the president called for armed guards I was the first reaction as synagogues and we've been kicking around a re in New Jersey wanted to weigh in on that issue well good morning right\n... ... ... here at the bottom line the only way to stop the evil\nYou know the difference is if you have someone on site\nVersus someone drive five minutes to get there is three or four people are getting kicked off every minute until someone with a gun they're stopping person so to assume that or or just you know let's just as long as the fantasy that is never going to\nLearn what you want to you want to have armed guards at at a rate you want to have armed guards at just about every facility everywhere\nNo it's just very vulnerable ones yeah I mean if you feel that you know you need to be protected they get guards\nAre you suggesting that people bring their own guns are you suggesting that uh yeah he's in a two tier a security guard who is on whatever\nDoesn't that say look at I mean Harry they want you to\nLook let me talk here if people have the right to carry ... I'm Sorry if there is off duty cops let them have men there there's plenty of a retired army people that need work they can do it too\nI don't know I looked to me I think it's the wild west Joe ... well I agree as everyone issue that everyone out of the cops do who shouldn't home that's the danger you'd probably get more people killed that way I think I saw this was a ... some of the president went to a rally this was in southern Illinois on Saturday and I thought this was rather telling\nYou don't mind [noise] I'm going to tone it down just a little bit is that okay [noise]\nWell you're from Illinois at a fairly much says his\nCrowd doesn't want them to tone it down there you had a a a shooting at eleven people dead and the crowd you know give us the old ... dazzle\nWell he's trying to pump up people to go vote land I mean this was you know it wasn't a memorial service\nSo of course some of the both the house is listening it was unbelievable Joe I I've I was flipping between Fox\nNews and CNN yesterday two different worlds nobody was just the ... same issue a Fox was saying was the Democrats who were full for their rhetoric and and CNN was saying the Republicans in the press it was like the exact same moment they were both accusing the other you know you you like\nChoose your tribal warfare and that's the point of view you take apparently\nWell both sides have really ramped up the rhetoric and I know you just want to blame one side of here with times I think that you know there's a lot of people\nThat they think he is the one that's instigating these types of violent to think of ... I'm sure they want to blame for the pipe bombs and uh you know there's probably people think that he embolden this guy to uh in Pittsburgh\nBut you know it's on both sides both sides are of vicious with the rhetoric Joe\nUnderstand us both sides all I'm saying is that he is the president United States and I think his words carry a little bit more weight than Maxine Waters words and when he says the media is the enemy the people and it's a Soros thing and the caravan and lock her up and it's okay to body slam a journalist and its low IQ Maxine Waters I just think\nHe he's the president United States Joe I should be held to a little higher standing I here's a Mike Pence the vice president's supporting his men\nFrankly people on both sides of the aisle use strong language about our political differences but I just don't think you can connect to threats are acts of violence\nSo he's against saying you know I'm sure and listen there are people on the left are saying that the president I I I raise the question doesn't embolden a white supremacist ... for questioning what well not a can accuse anything I don't know if it goes aid to be to see\nWhat would a conversely on the other side what about the guy that shot up the Republicans had their baseball practice was he embolden by Bernie Sanders I don't think Bernie Sanders ever called for violence the way the President Bill offices body slam those reporters that there'll be enemy than people again I can you take that that comment I think he just I\nIf white supremacist feel embolden these days that's a question a lot of hurling any accusations which of course you're accusing me of war but the uh the precedent last night uh his tweet was the fake news is doing everything in their power to blame Republicans conservatives in me for the division and hatred\nHas been going on for so long and our country actually it is they're fake and dishonest reporting which is causing problems far greater than the understand so it's the news media was only there to\nLend the blame ... blame lies with the shooter\nThat man or the person with the weapons not what the president has said or not what any political figure may have said the blame lies with the person this guy ... hours he is the only one you can blame for the shooting in Pittsburgh\nNot suppressed so example of manual last night a bunch of ah well the mayor was there a cardinal Dolan was there a Al Sharpton was there so they're all at the same message or here's the mayor\nOf New York city will never succumb to hate\nWill never allow ourselves to be divided we have to show by our actions and in our lives\nAs these acts of hate are not changing us in any way in fact they're causing us to reach out to each other\nSo now the hot button issue is armed guards because the president is always one of his first comments today or when it happened on Saturday that if there was an armed guard that synagogue maybe this would not have happened\nHouses of worship do not have to have armed guards to be able\nTo practice their religion that's not America [noise]\nYou know the president should have consulted with somebody before he that gave that first comment his initial reaction to the shooting Pittsburgh should not have been that I'll agree with you on that one land that they had\nSome kind of a protection inside the sample\nMaybe you could have been a very much different situation I\nMean it's a conversation to have I don't think that's the first thing that should come out of the president's mouth and I think he should've been a lot more of the healer in chief which are the heat on both sides have done a better job but he doesn't do that well\nWe all know that yeah you can't do it\nThis would be a case for if there was an armed guard inside the ... they would have been able to stop it may be that would have been nobody killed [noise]\nWell the uh Brooklyn borough president uh Eric Adams former cop mhm so here's where he had to say\nI'm calling on law enforcement officers off duty that are of all faith to bring their hand guns to their houses Russia\nWhen you think of that well I don't know I don't know\nDoes it get you feel any safer All right so ... you go to your synagogue and you know that maybe there's some ... guns in there you feel better\nI well you know you're talking to me yeah I mean I Am not a big fan of gun I understand and I never think that more guns is the answer I don't like to be around people with guns to be very Frank with you but that's just what you asked me to\nAnd I'm not I'm not saying I'm anti Second Amendment which I'm not but I just don't I think the second amendment was written for other things in mind I'd rather miss\nTo say police officers one has to be on duty wouldn't have visited the officers festive\nMatch for surgery\nSo he's advocating that off duty officers bring their weapons\nIf we are police officers standing in front of the church and\nWe can say is room for a police officer or to to to be inside churches were the\nWell that's a fair point why do people make that point you know you're you know you do have a security guard out sometimes outside or in many synagogues a security guard as inside with the metal detect yeah and look at these I mean this would have gotten to know like arm fortresses with the um the heavily armed officers outside them now\nHere's a cardinal Dolan was there last night\nWas Pope Francis said this morning room too soon for the entire human family it's a particular woman for the Jewish family and we love you and we give your prayers in civil the the\n... yeah yeah so everyone I mean everyone\nOh Laura is calling from Harlem morning Laura how are you today\nOn good morning Lynn yes oh my God\nOh my goodness my heart really goes south but when I send you the thousand emails that I said when you land this is what it's about\nThat oh like the letter rate\nIs going on both sides but the president of the United states\nHas said oh and then you know something he can easily do that it's not a ski and they can easily do it and then it annoys me because people like Joe why they constantly find excuses for one\nThey scratch off ticket from here and they can't even give us a hundred dollars when we when why that I don't know they never have it we don't buy scratch off or anything over here and you want and they haven't had the money to pay you you know we tend to think of the plate\nI'll see if you take a scratch off to another place they'll pay it off or something I guess any place with higher right\nI guess they visited LA doesn't pay out their tickets when they when they were a lottery ticket there\nAnd you're wondering why they're closing ... some odd they're out of a\nWhite guy may have

quitting showbiz then they took that story away and then uh he was on with James court and you know they do that the car pool All right yeah ...\nThat was Michael ... and the reason why he is been

filling in in uh when we picked up our New York post this morning which is ... paper a and saw the endorsement for governor were you doing in any way surprises that the first endorsement that Mr Marlon narrow has received\nHe may have done some from upstate but um you know the the New York post is probably going to be ... you know ... was leading this way anyway they right they don't like Cuomo but I thought it was interesting the way they um\nThey justified the endorsement of mon air over Cuomo they said he came to office with Cuomo with a lot of promise and they're disappointed but bill in line was the best for me Andrew Cuomo has become a prisoner of his deep personal flaws\nAnd national ambitions of New Yorkers are paying the price New York desperately needs to head in a new direction\nNew York remains crippled by crushing property tax burden and crumbling infrastructure and by the way do you have any idea what Cuomo's agenda is for the next four years should he be re elected to say when he's reelected as he said no no well to run for president I think the gender so a couple of years ...\nIf you walked outside the building in Tribeca and ask people who's running against Governor Cuomo what percentage of people they think with no one maybe really yeah mark ... he's the duchess county uh executive what what's the latest polling\nWe haven't um I I don't ... you know what I Am the ... real clear politics poll you know that they do all the races they don't even pull New York 'cause there's not a brace really ... doesn't even not even a race Cuomo's gonna win\nElsewhere and well you have the amid terms a week from tomorrow him and I wonder I mean the president had a kind of interesting comment you for the day he thought everything\nWas really going well for him and the economy and then there's this little um bomb thing got underway arming stuff that ... stuff without the way the nervous that Bob or to get the way on my agenda\nYou know the real news happens sometimes but ah I I saw the story of political they're talking about what's likely to happen after the midterms what's gonna happen with Trump's ... and they said that uh he's expected to oust Jeff Sessions will sure yeah I'm\nA and they say a defense secretary Jim Mattis is probably out interior secretary Ryan Zinke e commerce secretary Wilbur Ross homeland security secretary accused the Nielsen right\nAnd of course about Kelly ... well yeah it just said well he's not a cabinet member Bush you know Nikki Haley has already said she's got me up so I guess will be a lot of turnover after the midterms 'em and rubber motor will be fired Rosen here either be fired you ... do you think oh finally released the Russia report as soon as we get past next Tuesday\nWhen uh don't you think we should have a report by now we should have had it a long time ago yes one of the people remember this is an investigation going on [laughter] I Know do I don't know I I assume it's going to come out after the election\nSo what does this headline misses out of a a may ... made the press all over Hillary\nTwenty twenty she said I'd like to be president you know that really I mean yes she's she's dying debris president what she said there's no way she could really there's no way she's going to run\nNever say no to Hillary oh boy I think that would be a huge ... here she is she was doing a question to answer aware with somebody\nWith recruits Recode I don't know maybe some organization lady named Kara Swisher was interviewing her this was friday night\nNow [noise] now ... why well\nWell they asked her okay do you want to run again she said no then people grown no and here's the money on\nLike to be president okay [laughter]\nThink hopefully when we have a Democrat in the oval office in January of twenty Twenty one there's going to be so much work to be done\n[laughter]\nIt's like to be president and she followed that up with work ... ah that I feel very well prepared for\nI Know come on get you think she should just I don't know I think she should run run Hillary agree with you know we're going to be president route and I would run the no she's not going to just give it a step talking about and run\nLet's just put it this way the loss to Donald Trump never ran for anything and hosted The Apprentice okay you're lost to Hillary I don't think you'd be smart to have you on this path we have Donald Trump\nBecause of Hillary Clinton probably do we have Donald Trump because of Hillary Clinton any other Democrat probably would've beat him even Bernie Sanders using some yelling yep wow\nThat is crazy so you're saying if Mickey Mouse had run against Hillary Clinton yeah Disney would be the winter White House ... isn't that crazy\nAnd you know Hillary said yeah you know we'll talk out she's so we'll talk after the midterms [laughter]\nCome on wouldn't it be great to have her back on the campaign know falling down everywhere tackling I've\nTold you a hundred times of the shows a lot more interesting with Donald Trump is president than it would have been with Hillary Clinton was president and and and lend for all of his foibles and\nI'm ... shortcomings\nTrump is is a much better person in the White House than Hillary Clinton would ever be\n... well we can debate that but I I'm just saying from a from a new standpoint it's a lot more ... even from a productive in the ... well that's open ocean would it be tweeting of course you would never hear from her increased security at houses of worship we've got our Stockton rosy\nStaked out a temple Emanuel will will have the latest you next chance a thousand bucks is coming up it is nine o'clock\nYour smoking is is Fox they rated\nNumber one seven ten W O R voice of New York and high heart rate\nAnd you can cut up some branches but\nThe tree will continue to grow\nSo the synagogue is not reasonable and its current form he uh as I said was residing over services at the time\nI didn't see the stars and and the beautiful tribute to people on until he put a little bit of the news last night and I saw it in person this morning and then I for a moment I felt like I'm sitting at the cemetery and this is a mess of Muslim\nHis way home and it's been desecrated\nBook about the tree of life synagogue now Lynette Letterman is the former president of the synagogue and she uh well she got into the political ankle here\nI Do not welcome the president to him I said hey\nBecause he's the purveyor of hey states\nWell she was on CNN obviously she's on one side of the fence here\nFor half a critical um\nTowards that come from him\nI'm Around that we know what you know to a point of view is but it depends which seem Iran and that's how you feel about him what went down I mean obviously some people on the left thinks the president's to blame people in the right things the less started it with all their hate speech let's go to our Stockton roasting outside temple Emanuel Ella increased police presence there Alice\nYeah there is a security the frying they hear any sixty\nFifth street where I Am and then on a sixty six street there's an entrance to a school and it's a some kind of a day care preschool thing going on here and um they have a walk through security those\nI'm here at one each straight on sixty street I asked and it was it if you always have to walk through a detector when you go through and they asked me to leave\nPlease vote away that I was in keeping their jobs while they're yeah they're they're taking very seriously as they should day as they should be I think\nPeople are lining the children in the morning and I'm you know it's a little unsettling to walk\nPast a house of worship and shake counter terrorists with people all over the place not to mention the NYPD cars show you know it's still pretty well off in the minds of the Upper East side or is this morning what happened over the weekend\nThe worst thing that I ... in my lifetime\nThat happening on us soil [noise]\nYou know it affects everybody no matter what religion you are and I think all of us look at those people as you know the most victims that you know that we're in the wrong place at the wrong time and it's just so unfair and it's unfair to the families and to everybody that was touched by this and everybody is touched by it\nMost of these are older people just a Saturday prayer and I just I get emotional thinking about it to al ...\n[noise] [noise] yeah I mean you know just going to church yesterday I our past airways just settle upset about it you know that's supposed to be a safe area now you have Eric Adams ... president talking about how you know he can carry it with them and I asked\nThis guy bill that you just heard from a Patrick you just heard from you know what do you think about that it should we start having shit security armed security guard at houses of worship\nAnd everything is relative I I Will\nSay this the more protection we have\nThe safe we are but I don't think you can stop this I don't think you could stop people\nI think it's impossible I I Wish there was a solution but we can't one hundred percent ever do that everything is a risk what a place of worship should not be a risk but unfortunately it is I feel like now is do we have to pray at home in order to be safe and that's sad\nYou wonder if you just have to stay at home because you know if someone's who's up a mall or a movie theater or wherever I mean when you stop yeah that\nThat's certainly not is not happening in New York City for all the people that I found here shaking like that there were even more people who are like oh why\nOh yeah I heard about that yeah I got to go to work\nOh yeah yeah there's only security here but yeah oh yeah there's more today you know that's just not going to stop people from living we can go on living and uh certainly New Yorkers um we have a way of doing that of all moving on going on I'm\nKeeping an eye on what's going on around us but at the same time moving forward with our lives because we just can't be fighting ... to ...\nYou know staying in our houses for fear that somebody might be outside\nYou know waiting to get us it's ridiculous so\nUm it's just it's just a ton of all this was a horrible shooting and we're going to hear about more about that there's going to be more rallies and I'm Laura leaders will be speaking out about this but I'm In the meantime a candle across the city you know you're going to the increased security\nYou know I'm a Alice I I think there's a lotta temples that have already increased security prior to this incident in Pittsburgh um I I Would think most of them have it is probably not a publicly acknowledged but\nHave you heard that you know
