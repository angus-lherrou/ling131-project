certainly believe that we exist and so the the old game is is that they don't want us to know that there is there they want us to think that this is our own feelings our own thoughts and some of it is\nAll of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits are but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back everybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nThey work on them for on people for a while you leave these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed people who move into a home a and there's a lot of negative emotional\nEnergy drugs or something\nI practice something called modern actresses and and that is that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that ... homes because people have lived in there to generate both positive and negative emotional energy is which are unseen but we feel um\nAnd it accumulates in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and so do negative spirits\nAnd so they are attacked people and homes we don't take care of our homes we clean them\nWash windows when you move into a new place the carpets paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies and so to monitor spirit's just play on that\nAnd they come into the our environments and generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy at thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nThose kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air\nIs thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whatever and doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern extra citizen deals with the idea of that first the negative emotional energy has\nTo be removed by\nSomebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises in different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest is an effect would you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent priest Seychelles and freeze exercises\nI don't belong to any particular religion because I work\nWith people from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who are agnostic atheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work\nFor the Internet ever came about um I wasn't touching anything anyways doing personal clarion so I wasn't touching anybody anyway it's really it's not necessary there's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it\nAnd it it it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates\nAnd spirits need to be\nWith you know sometimes there are already in the home sometimes they come into the home the sense of family that's having a problem\nOf emotional energy in our living environment and they're ripe for attack\nAnd so it it's called may be a professional habit we're one and I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies are energy field\nOr and also how to maintain the clarity of the living environment so it's kind of like having your carpet cleaner come in first and then you can if we create our own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent and something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion I'm not the only one\nThat are qualified extra systems just about every religion\nBut they but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that I did people call up and say well like I called you know a local parish even though I'm not no I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic\nMost of the not going to happen again right uh I Do think though we should probably rethink the idea of living very close to the water it was a story that are impacted me the most this week um\nI think to be that little crush up in ... familiar with that part of upstate New York uh the roads are they're all like that rural roads they wish twist and turn and sometimes you're not sure where they're going but\nUm what's sad about this is the the people that died did the right thing\nThere were Eighteen people in a limo they were celebrating the birthday of a young lady she and her three sisters were in the ... with their husbands and some\nFriends and um the ... goes through a stop sign crashes into another car and then down into a ravine and everyone has killed including two people that were on the street\nAnd you said you would you say yourself what happened how could this happen and we're finding out now that number one that limo should not have been on the road it failed a safety test ... brakes were suspect and the driver the drivers should not have been driving either\nHe was not qualified to drive that kind of a vehicle with so many passengers never proper license and uh the owner of this one company apparently was aware of that\nThey were also aware of the fact that that limo should not have been on the road in fact the guy but they charged apparently was in that limo at some point and was pulled over by the cops up there in scary and they told them hey ... ... you can't have this on the road get it off the road yet\nHe's still ... still let it go out with Eighteen people in it and uh we know what happened\nNow funeral services for ... who was the young woman celebrating her birthday or three sisters and their husbands\nAre going to be held today this should not\nShould not have happened and we are joined this morning again by W awash Alice doctrine row seat last\nWeek we did a story about air being be over in New Jersey and done a fair just one big we had to take a look at New York city so what's your story there unless\nIt's a whole new ball of wax as they say Joe city council voted forty five to nothing in July to make it more difficult for people to rent their apartments to tourists to practice the city says raises rent increases gentrification and disrupt neighborhoods because short term rentals can be more profitable than long term lease as\nJonathan for a long as they housing organizer an advocate working to preserve decent safe affordable housing for tenants in New York City\nWell they're renting a tourists that's the thing they're they're basically you know flooding what's called the multiple dwelling law which says that you can't rent out your a unit for less than thirty days if you're you know for not there and so\nYou know air being me is is taking apartment units you know out of the Affordable housing stock by renting them out to people coming in for a week at a time for maybe two weeks at a time turning them over cleaning amount and then renting them again to tourists when they really should be a ...\nOkay so he's fine with people just renting out a room in their home\nBeing a large share of air being nice income comes from a operators who own multifamily buildings and rent on multiple apartments within those buildings that could otherwise be rented out as permanently affordable housing attendance in New York City who are just trying to stay in their neighborhoods\n... lives doubled ... says that's not what their research finds\nTime entire home ... in New York City account for only point ... percent of the housing market that we're talking about a very very small percentage of a building very rare circumstance can be getting wet\nAnd another thing that research finds is that host they're being harassed\nYeah oh what a shame\nThis law allows for the policing of short term home rentals which are being be blamed on multi million dollar campaign funded by the hotel lobby which is intent on intimidating New Yorkers than that here's how that's going\nTo come to my home and they bang on the doors incessantly sun and back at the same time [noise]\nI Can't deal with that kind of stress\nI think if someone says what are they doing you\nKnow ironically and thankfully no summonses because I'm not doing anything wrong they just come and they bang on the doors they look around anywhere from three to six inspectors at a time and then they leave [noise]\nThey've been in my house more than a dozen times never finding a thing they\nSneak into my windows they open my trash bin [noise]\nYeah they came to my house and as they left the one of the person that I had other ways of getting into your house so instead of saying I I Will take a warrant I Will do any of that he basically threatens me he's tried for intimidation that was his goal\nWhat do you think of that that's that's pretty soon you know but everybody in be I I Know a lot of people have used it it's it's a great option especially coming to New York city you look at a hotel five hundred eight hundred thousand dollars a night\nAnd a lotta times their book you yeah and for air being being good at a lot cheaper than that right so there was it but the but I I again the city is trying to protect the hotels you\nWrite that you know what you own the house and shouldn't you be allowed to do\nWith what you want with your house and this\nWas like you know ... for houses right that's what I'm saying and that's why I rent money you know now everybody has a a car service if they have a car everybody wants to houses in the hotel business if they want to be\nRight and you know what here's here's a a this is Lee Thomas and um he's the head of the home sharing association and he says they're really not in competition with hotel\nThe problem is the hotel industry feel that we are in competition with them early not [noise] um people that come into the city to use air being bees or any other kind of platform homework home sharing\nDo that because they want to be able to come in for the city hotel industry made record profits or last year I Will not take anything away from them but they do want to be the only game in town and I think that's really unfair\nSo air being day by the way brings in one hundred million in tax revenue a year for New York state so you would think that somehow we can keep the hotel people and the people who want to use air being day happy\nYou would think so I think there's probably a middle ground here\nYeah well when will find that anybody is anybody's\nGuess W all wars Alice Stockton Rossellini thank you very much with the air being B story there on the job on Saturday show [noise]\nRunning on Wall street this week\nWas a couple of days from the markets big big losses and then all of a sudden now

Doug where you want to begin today\nYou know I I was taking photographs with my iPhone like all of us do right we just take pictures of everything these days um you know things with the mundane things that look interesting and I was taking a picture of um what looked like a bird well was a bird that hit my kitchen window\nAnd you know when you see a bird that hits class you can see like this kind of white kind of dusty and I'm\nA outlined right most of the ... there was actually know bird by the way on the ground I just have to say so all bird lovers though that a bird to not lose their life for this incident and\nAnd I took a picture of it\nStart looking at it and it's like oh my word there is a ghostly looking and she's a woman can see your face it's the picture for us in the book [noise] um\nAnd I'm like what in the world's happening [noise] but what that happen though actually gave me some peace and that's the piece that I speak of it was like oh my gosh maybe maybe it's true what what I've heard and read and seen on\nTelevision and certainly in movies that it all doesn't end right when when someone passes\nThat's good to know is there a reason people will see a ghost were spirit\nIs there a reason um you know I think\nIn a lot of cases is gonna sound really area very but work with me for just a second on it [noise] um I think when people have the eyes to see they can and having the if you will the eyes to see and and quotes um 'cause I just realized that nobody can see what I'm doing if my hand on the radio if you just have no eyes to see\n'em that means that you're open and\nSo if you're open that means you're actually looking for something and so I think I think if you're willing you can\nUh-huh what about communicating with the spirit world\nWell that started to happen after because photographs [noise] um I had an ... I'm\n... I'm sure most of your listeners have heard of the word like Claire like Claire voyage and you know I'm Claire audience and and Claire is used um you know when you have that ability to communicate with the other side and\nI was driving to work one day and um I heard clearly and in my car which mind you\nI'm it was totally quiet and no one else is in the car with me I just called a bunch of people I was um you know looking to talk to and no one answered and uh but I clearly hear this force in my car that's just put your other hand on the wheel\nAnd then it said there's going to be on it said that it's your phone rings don't look at it in fact\nDon't answer it there's going to be an accident and within sixty seconds the two cars in laying in front of me on the four or five in Los Angeles California\nCollided oh my gosh\nAnd so events happened and where I was prepared nobody hit me I didn't have the cars in front of me because I was ready um and that day\nI ah\nYou know I was that one dominoes that didn't fall because I was listening because I was paying attention and I trust it and that was Claire audience there's a lot more of the story so encourage those who are interested to read that\nStory agree look a lot of great stories in there to talk of her Julie ... I'm a I got to ask you um is we're um\n[laughter] ... is is the reason why these people are trying to communicate with you a ... or why they appear spirits I mean a lot of people have died over the years why when we come back we're it's\n[noise] you know here's what I've learned which I think is really fascinating\nUm because it's still fascinating to me is that what I Believe that happens on the other side is that there is um there is a natural balance as there is you know what we see in the physical world\nUm there is a balance between light and dark says those who are who are dealing with some of the dark um\nSpirits um I have stuff for you to to help you uh see through that in my book and and then also the you know the the spirits that come to um you know give us peace and find ease and information and things like that [noise] um\nSo I I I think there's also hierarchy where there are some ... you know some people if you will that it you know when they crossed his Red Cross over after they've passed um there's a hierarchy of those that are you know kind of lower and kind of higher so people who lived a really great life and that you know I'm\nI've tried you know try to be good I guess is maybe the best way to say it [noise] um\nI said at a at a higher place where they can come back and communicate really easily there are those that didn't listen I wouldn't say I'm murderers gonna you know get a get a a fast pass to the top of the hierarchy\nWell that's good you know the right\nJust not there they're going to have probably have to um you know struggle a bit and try to even understand what happened to them and what they need to do\nYou know if you believe in reincarnation which I Do is is when they come back the next time but that's why I think you actually see a lot of pained looking\nWell the way it works is you can earn next year up to Seventeen thousand six hundred and forty dollars if you earn more than that that's when you would start I'm losing benefits they would take away\nOne dollar in benefits for every two you earned over the limit so hold on a second I'm going to do some quick math\nAnd see that means you could earn up to about fifty three thousand dollars next year and get some benefits\nUm ... as I said you don't start losing them till you go over to that\nYou know Seventeen thousand four hundred and sixty dollars or six hundred and forty dollars but this is how it works if you went into Social Security and apply for benefits and you're under the full retirement age of sixty six they're going to say okay do you plan to keep working don't lie they do\nFact check against I arrest records may not catch up with you immediately\nYear or two from now they might and they'll send you a bill hey look we overpaid you by thirty three thousand dollars we like that back right now in a lump sum that create some real problems so if you want to collect early and mind you your benefits are reduce speak cause you're collecting early\nCompared to sixty six honestly estimate what your earnings are going to be and what they would do is withhold the first few months of checks until those earning restrictions are satisfied and then you would get a payment later in the year so yes you could go ahead and plot apply for benefits\nBeing aware that you might not actually get those benefits for several months\nUntil those reductions had been satisfied\nOr do you understand what are we going to take a short break when we return we'll be back with Mary Beth Franklin taking a a final batch of calls the eight hundred three

usual people love to hear you Mary Beth\nSo they're a bunch of calls sharing and Bob\nGo ahead you're on the ... the financial portable back Sharon go ahead\n[laughter] hello thank you very much for taking the call my question\nIs if\nHusband and wife has been working and they're both make about the same amount and are moving into retirement is there one of them that we should read 'em\nDiffer pills Seventy my husband's two years older than I Am and I'm I just don't know which one we would differ but I Do understand we need to defer won\n\nThe bigger benefit to defer up until eight Seventy if possible because that means they're benefit do the\nDue to the delayed retirement credits would be thirty two percent higher\nThan it would have been at age sixty six and the important part of that is when one spouse dies the bigger Social Security benefits continues as the survivor benefit and the smaller one goes away but the really important question because there was a change in the climbing rules\nA few years ago is what is your birth year is it before Nineteen fifty four\nIs after\nAll right you can't choose which benefit to claim if you're born in Nineteen fifty four or later\nOnly people who get a choice of gee pay me as a spouse in my own benefit keep growing our people born in Nineteen fifty three or earlier when was your eyes been born\nNineteen fifty five and both of us are off\nBummer yes you're both out so what I Would say is I'm One of you should probably go ahead and claim it full retirement age that might be you if your benefits like the smaller that brings some cash flow into the house or in the meantime it takes away a little bit of the sting of having your husband waiting till Seventy to get his benefit\nAt Seventy he'll claim you'll get this nice big benefit um which will continue what both of you are alive if he happens to die for which statistically is likely you would effectively inherited his entire benefit including all those delayed retirement credits and your smaller benefit would go away\nOkay mine is the larger so I really think and I'm the youngest\nSo okay that gave me wondering if\nI have looked at Josh and crunch those numbers because of the time delay 'em and yes you would get the bigger benefit but the fact well at how Josh crunched the numbers\nAre lost opportunity costs as important long jeopardy army been encouraging people to get a life insurance physical to see what their actuarial ages because that plays some some role in all this so uh gives ... Ninety Josh and we have\nA software that we can put you in and also give you a copy of Mary Beth book\nAnd he did he ... he Josh when you schedule and keep your no obligation what to do with Social Security review\nA murder we we're ... we're going to get to them I have a question I'm getting a lot of ... kind of\nAlong the lines of your article that widows or getting seriously bad advice windows can take their will benefit is at sixty but generally you would recommend they wait until sixty six sixty seven depending on their full retirement age liquor\nOr here's the thing to keep in mind anyone who collect any type of Social Security benefit whether it's survival retirement spousal if they collectively for their full retirement age and continue to work they may lose some or all of those benefits so yes\nWidows are eligible to take their reduced benefits as early as age sixty and that might work for some people but if they're still working it probably doesn't want\nMake sense they you know if they're survivor benefit is bigger than their own they may want to take a reduced retirement benefits first and when they reach full retirement age switched to that maximum\nSurvivor benefit thing to keep in mind is retirement benefits and survivor benefits are two different pots of money you can collect one type first and switched to the other later\nBut in all cases if you continue to work it may not make sense to collect benefits before your full retirement age\nOkay great next we're going to go to Bob sixty three wants to know when you should take Social Security guard Bob\nBob Hi thanks for taking my call goes I'm sixty three sixty three in July\nI'm I'm getting a pension I retired in ... I worked in the building trades I'm getting a pension morale forty one thousand a year and my wife still works but my question is if I waited till sixty six\nAh I'd be using right now I'd get about twenty to thirty a month and every once it goes up a little bit so I'll be losing about twenty six thousand dollars a year right now but not caught the", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Len Berman and Michael Riedel in the Morning", "city": "New York", "day": "13"}
