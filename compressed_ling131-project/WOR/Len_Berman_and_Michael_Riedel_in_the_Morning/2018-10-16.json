I think you're right I think of the you know what is it called themself NBS the uh MS MS [laughter] MPs and the\nThirteenth oh boy he's interesting though because some people I saw this in the Washington Post they think that the king of Saudi Arabia who's given a lot of power to the sprints they should not to print out and find someone else 'cause there's prince has gone after a lot of people in his family and he started this war in Yemen\nBut he has like winning drive well he's the guy\nHe's very clever that he's cozy up to the west is let the women drive\nIs let movies come in there is no he's very clever along those lines but the same time listen if this isn't the ... that went wrong they were going to bring this guy and kidnap him and bring it back to Saudi Arabia is a journalist right now that's not just peaches and cream right there that's how we're supposed to be doing with journalist so right off the bat they were doing something that was totally a borrow\nSo what are you supposed to do a journal sit down and give him an interview well\nI think they should could that you and bringing back after ... ... that's what I think I probably thrive in the ... by a bit like that actually really I Know where the powers I chose you have to power a very very well [laughter]\nFaking I Want to go see a Broadway play and I got a house out of that oil money and everything is going to hate it but I've got ... ... ...\nHas got to be fine so what do you think the er the Proud Boys Lynn you think here's a question for you do you think that they should be allowed to speak anywhere or what they say is so hateful they should be prevented from speech Cuomo seems to him the other no he's all upset that the Republican club even invited them to speak\nI think and and I it cuts both ways I thought it was absolutely wrong\nWhen Berkeley wouldn't allow and culture to speak I mean that's just ridiculous I mean I think people and free speech just fine where crosses the line is if you advocate violence though I didn't hear the Proud Boys what they're going to speak about in what they're going to say\nAdvocating violence is not protected by by the first amendment you know it's a\nFree speech but not if you advocate a vial you can't yell fire in the ... not being hit violence you just can't you just can't get up there and say oh we're going to chop off the heads of all the people on the left that's not protected by the first amendment so I think you have to be careful what they say but in general the answer to your question is they should be allowed to speak wherever they want us to be\nYou know I I Am still concerned about this because now you can be getting to this territory where he defined well what does it mean and you can call for if somebody calls for a revolution\nThat is technically advocating violence nonetheless says we need a revolution we have to overthrow the capitalist we have to overcome them and say yes so ... is that hate speech land I think should they be silenced ... I don't say you're a sensor you believe in censorship I\nDon't believe in advocating violence on either saw how you're going to and I love that I yesterday I made a little bit of a little funding I said you know there were bad people on both sides\nAnd that's the guy said yeah do you study like Trump\nDoesn't that wasn't show Trump said there were good people out there are no good Nazis ladies and gentlemen so when somebody says there's good people on both sides that's nonsense I was making a little twist to that by saying they're bad people on both sides and here there were I mean it was the end he for guys who had what masks on and get started going into\n... and they started it too it appears from that video so they started in the Proud Boys finished it but they're looking for nine Proud Boys to arrest so he has this getting political al because the police feel oh well we got to be a bipartisan yeah by part ... that\nIs what I'm getting the same as you know they went after people who started it but now Cuomo's denouncing them they think well we better round up some right east too so looks like we're being fair\nWell that's what's wrong with that [laughter] you just want to know the only way you know that's that's that's an accurate but I think if they obviously if they broke the law and then they should be around it up if they're having this all out brawl on the street\nUh that's probably something you should look into if you're running the police department to New York you know if they speak again in New York when I'm going to get your tickets find\nOut that

I Do I look like Lindsey Graham do you I don't know what sanctions they should impose on Saudi Arabia that you do look a little thanks a lot I don't know what they're going to do I want it to you want to you want to just several ties with Saudi Arabia doesn't make any sense either way\nCongress is going to have a lot to say here 'cause I think if the president doesn't do things Congress will as they did with Russia but let's see what the president was saying yesterday\nHe says they have to find out [noise]\nReally first day what ... what they know\nWhat's going on some ... going to find out and it'll be on the scene and all that first hand knowledge and all of it all figured out right yup okay but not much is going to happen\nIt's a terrible situation is a question about it I don't like it one day\nAll right what else did you have to say Mr President\nWe're working very closely with Saudi Arabia I Would certainly and they were trying to figure out what happened and they want to know what happened also so a lot of people are working on a\nTurkey and Saudi Arabia have mild by the way Saudi Arabia\nKnows exactly what happened and if even if a guy out that's what they even if it was an interrogation that went bad the interrogation was going to kidnap him back to Saudi Arabia and in prison him because he dared\nTo be on complementary about the prince that's what it's all about the prince has gotten all those great glowing publicity 'cause he's allowing women to drive and he's put in movie theaters but the truth of the matter is is a bad guy and the show gave the journalist has written that and that's why they're out to get them while they got um\n[noise] well this is what are those are times where Donald Trump's a string of uh is is not a straight pitch a weakness is\nBluster with which we expect Trump to deal with situations is not what's needed here this is something that is handled behind the scenes to these people have a tremendous amount of leverage on the global economy as well as our allies in the fight against terrorism\nSo for right now Trump to squeeze them publicly which is what the demand is is a is not going to be productive over all the U.S interest elapsed the battle Trump is fighting I'm ... but again diplomatic grace has never been his strength or subtlety so\nLet's see what the ... and Madison is of the world can pull off here\nBut ... do besides just cut back I was ... any idea what a lot of sanction would look like other than cutting back arms sales\nArms sales is really what they need the most we can't really threatening them economically\nUh in any other way I mean that there are now the second largest oil producer in the world we're the first we can continue to expand the American the Aleutian energy a restrictions that the key to American energy off the global markets but there's really not a lot of liver each other than arms sales which is the one thing we don't want to do\nAnd Alex you think in the political arena the left is going to be able to capitalize on this troubled with Saudi Arabia now or is it just something that the American people are going to sort of shrug off\nI think the American people shrug off this kind of stuff\nUm and I think they do understand that a little bit of a ... year the uh uh you know the the leader of Saudi Arabia say hey we didn't know our hands are clean somebody else was a rogue regime uh but I don't think it's going to have much impact on the politics here\nWhat is having a big impact on the politics here turns out to be the cabinet nominations\nThat has changed the world that seems to be the first time that Americans saw Republicans actually grow up there and stand up against Democrats played back in Washington\nAnd just stand up against the swamp which they were a part of and Republicans are now energized and I think we have a jump ball in the control of the house of representatives\nAs you look at these races for the house are they tightening up across the country\nI haven't talked to a Republican pollster in the past two weeks who hasn't told me that\nThis week surveys are better for Republicans in last week's wow and and so it is tightening up everywhere the new ABC survey still has the largest gender gap in history twenty two points women voting more Democrats than men\nAnd a huge advantage for Democrats except\nThe Democratic advantage is concentrated in the cities and they're winning in urban areas by more than they were winning but in the suburbs if you ask people\nDo you want to vote Democrat or Republican the forty six to forty seven race in the sixties six house districts that are rated is ... ... that's a jump ball Democrats may not take the house I think they're still favored while this is a huge change\nAlex you mentioned the political implications of the Kavanaugh story and how it's galvanized Republicans are the Democrats will say it's galvanized galvanize them especially among women so who really has the advantage there\nWell it's galvanized boom boom women but it seems to be helping them the most where they were already winning it's just hoping that by running up the score actually looking at those tossup races\nHere it's Republicans who lack the energy who now are energized Democrats are already on fire show it this was a pretty stunning development that is I think under reportage Republicans are catching up\nInteresting but Alex how about a women in these suburbs have it I you know they've got they've got sons they've got husbands they've got brothers I get to say that I'm not a pollster here but I get a sense and talking to you know moderate women that they don't like\nA country where an allegation can be hurled at you and destroy you\nWell we're seeing both thing I think that's right for for a lot of women in urban areas ... it's like Andrew dice clay is running for\nPresident [laughter] our\nFire to come out of the vote but in another America what American\nThey saw like
