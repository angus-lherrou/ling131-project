seven seven ten W will walk past\nThe McCarthy break up and mix they open up with a when Ellsworth pivotal game five of the ... will cover at all and give you our NFL pictures well it's all the sports down six then I said I right here on the evidence\nW I Walk in\nMind rises shine six fifty four on a whole is going to be a cold and windy Thursday or in a big town and\nAnd Michael read all the Saudis story I it's just a major major international story it's not going away I'm just wondering what they're all waiting for\nThe trial maybe they're just trying to coordinate their stories there is no good story they kill the sky they brutally killed the guy it's going to be tied to the prince\nAnd and the United states has given them cover and I think that's wrong I think ... you know wish there were many calls and and now you're going to say the left wing media there were many calls that the United states should be taking the lead in this investigation not turkey this was the United states resident and a journalist out west\nThe U.S now now now that Allison what happened this guy's terrible and the Saudis did it no question about it but the United states\nHow can they take the lead it happened in Turkey alright it's tricky that takes the lead it didn't happen in the United states so that's why the Turks are investigating and they're leaking like a sieve they're providing all these grisly details this guy ...\nHe walked into the embassy to get a proof of a divorce from his Saudi wife so he could marry his Turkish fiance soon as he walked in and apparently according to the leaks coming out of turkey\nThey grabbed him took him into another room\nShopped his fingers off she's decapitated him just barely got audio and video of it and on the audio this is all alleged now because no one has heard this audio but the Turkish officials but the guy who sort of in charge of the dismembered ... tells the guys doing the membrane that they should wear earphones and listen to music while they're doing it\nNow the problem is one of the people who has been identified\nAs part of that Fifteen men hit squad there are pictures of him you can see in the post this morning with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia down in Houston He was part of the crown princes entourage so it's very difficult to make the case that the crown prince did not know what was going on but don't you\nThink we're being a little bit too laid back and we keep saying well the president keeps saying you gotta medicines will proven guilty and now he's he's taking on bridge at the notion that the U.S and he are giving a coverage or trying to cover it up when it comes to this prints\nGiven come with that being said Saudi Arabia is a very important ally of ours in the middle east\nAnd it's starting to now I understand that were the days they buy all these weapons from us and\nI understand but really I mean at some point you got to say wait this is all about the mighty buck how about what's right and what's wrong\nWell it is a tricky issue it's not just about the weapons that they buy from us it's also about their the or the bulk work against our real enemy they're Iran I mean Saudi Arabia is a major player in the middle east you're not going to have any peace between the Palestinians and the Israelis without the Saudis involved because they control the Palestinians in many ways\nAnd they are uh the buffer against Iran trying to dominate the middle east look at our over the years our allies had been brutal people you heard of Stalin well we fought Hitler was style and how many people that Stalin murder Nineteen million people in a ... fan and he was our ally that's just the way the politics of the world works I mean I think\nProbably what the Saudi should do if they really want it to squirm away from this they're going to have to take down that crown prince there are a lot of other crown princes they gotta zillions rich Saudis over there they should not came out\nAnd put somebody else in that would solve the problem is up to the Saudis we can't take 'em out\nBut you know what if you're going to be fair here and he should go on trial\nIn Saudi Arabia but that's not going to happen no horse or a little while fat or probably not going to take them down but if they did he should be held accountable and it's not going to happen by the way\nA democracy Yogi had written one last yeah column at the Washington Post published today\nThey said they were holding off publishing his column in the hopes that he was alive and you come back and help edit this column but now they're accepting the inevitable but the whole tenor of his column well here's one line Arab governments have been given free rein to continue silencing the media and an increasing rate though it's all about\nYou know media ... and that's why he was so ... so called dissidents because she rose up against the uh the Saudis and others in in in the middle east to silence journalists\nAnd he used to be very close to the ruling family in fact I think he worked for them at one point\nAnd was bull loved of western reporters because he had all the inside information and scoop on them\nAnd I think maybe originally he was in favor of this new crown prince who was liberalizing estate letting women drive and showing movies but then he turned on him because this guy is also has a very brutal side and also there's the war in Yemen an awful war in Yemen that the Saudis are stoking and he turned on that too\nYeah here's a similar to the president addressing it yesterday\nWhile he wasn't a citizen of this country for one thing and we're going to determine that and you don't know whether or not we have to find out what you know whether or not we've said they up here I'm not going to tell you [laughter]\n[laughter]\nThat's good that's good yeah somebody I mean ... anyway playing with the press he's he's having a good old time but I I think we should be a little bit stronger here and uh and and not just say well we're sending a lot of weapons so we're not going to do anything about it\nAll right we'll deal with this throughout the morning also here's the big question for you is Mario Cuomo a chicken\nQuestion and the answer my boss around a chance to win a thousand bucks it is seven o'clock\nYour smoking is a zoo Fox they rated number one seven ten W O o voice of New York and high\nTell me this was Cuomo's attack is that he's a criticizing Trump I think the Democrats have a big problem if that's all they've got if they're going to go either to the mid term or to twenty twenty and all they got us criticizing Trump I don't think that's enough you gotta you gotta stand for something you can't stand against something they they got what what's the\nDemocratic platform I think I think you know that's a mistake if every college tuition while you're going to go see it every day or health care and\nTax the rich ... into the country act we abolish ice yeah ... ... well I didn't have a platform than they should have said we just don't you want to play out there that's a bad life working so [laughter] where are you politically where am I I'm sitting\nHere trying to get through the day like anybody else [laughter] actually tells me the Sienna college poll has Cuomo up by twenty two that doesn't mean that that's not it it's not a landslide I mean it's a big number it is I think that was it was the Nixon number what's was much more than that wasn't in the forties\nThe advantage over Cynthia Nixon yeah yeah I don't think she somehow got under his skin yes you're in New Jersey\nWhat's what's going on with a Mendez and you can have this whole thing and the and I took out an ad against Menendez about under age\nKids well he accused him of having sex with under age prostitutes right right and uh apparently he got that because the FBI did investigate the allegations right for them to charge whatever broad\nBut you know in politics he was accused of above that's factual statement yup you can say that yeah you know here's what Bob you've now how's how's that pulled them and that this is still up a little different points semi I the last one I saw a lot of them that's not a huge no no thank you can I can take 'em down you can you can can take off a yeah\nHe's I think he's gotten a little momentum going here as well here's a huge you'd have to say about this or add\nAnd now we have an FBI sworn affidavit that outlines of very detailed allegations with\nWith with substantial corroboration to it\nBut the people in Jersey deserve to hear about is\nThat true as their FBI corroboration of that under racing is just an investigation\nWell there there was an investigation obviously and I I mean that that's been a long standing allegation yeah I don't know I I think we're all part of the problem is there was another happened in another country so right what countries it happen again but I think it's ... yeah he went to use much of the yeah\nWe went to the Caribbean with his doctor and had a little uh you know ...\nWhere I'm at the end is fighting back I mean when you use words like slime ball man you're slinging it\n... the ... bowl attack ad tells you everything you need to know about Republican Bob you but he's a slime ball he's in the ... and he's a liar\n... well you want to hear some of the ad that they put it I Do is the ad that has them all Boston and New Jersey\nWhen will we as a society begin to believe what was\nThe under aged girls who were according to the FBI whoa\nWhoa that is rare
