I really do like that\nAre already coming up next to one of our favorites our Kavanaugh correspondent is coming up uh she is ABC's Trish Turner boy we have lost to discuss this all came down after we went off the air on friday a and that's all coming up after the news it is seven o'clock\nOn some of this is talk station feels rated number one seven ten W O R voice of New York and\nYou you you know you're not quite clear what's going on but clearly stumped things going on and so they stay out of their own they're gone for quite a long time we know they didn't exit out the back and said this we eventually they're and they're they're in this anti room for about an hour and a half and then they even tell the story\nYou know there were so many people back there from the committee at one point they even the two men like shove themselves into an old stone ... on that in that answer your ... further by themselves but they contact interestingly they um they contacted a Rosenstein and uh and Chris Wray\nDirector or the FBI and the deputy\nAttorney general and they you know that just like to try to learn more about you know what what could happen in a week with an FBI investigation and I think it's like let's just it was so much overwhelming pressure and so many open questions that he thought\nFrom his reasonable friend Chris Coons who was basically begging for a week when he gave his speech you know look I'll just\nIf you will week I Will agree to this um it's the right thing to do\n... ... here's the thing though that makes me cynical about the Democrats move so\nThey got what they wanted which is an FBI investigation but now what is the very first thing they say well the scope is in wide enough it's being restricted come on it what they want is just to find out anything any dirt on Kavanaugh because the ultimate goal on their part is to destroy him and prevent him from going to the court\nYeah it's interesting because I think two things can be true at once I think that you know the people who actually you know want an investigation on like a Chris Coons because he's really not a hyper partisan at all ... you know this is what he is looking for in somebody like Jeff Flake and Susan Collins a moderate but you're right\nYou're absolutely right Democrats want to scuttle this nomination now you know they are your questions about is about his truthfulness on that are coming out this is what Republicans feared you know a drip drip drip that could kill this nomination no matter what the FBI\nDoes so you know I I think that absolutely you're right on this\nThis absolutely plays into Democrats wanting to scuttle this nomination we're so close to the mid term I mean\nThat is you know they they're ... they're hoping that they take over both chambers of Congress and and then you know they won't really be dealing with a a SCOTUS nomination you know it's very important ... from President Trump at all they will have the ability to stop\nYeah so what do you think the timetable is Trish\nI think every eight I'm Talking to an says ah you know when we say well the FBI gets a week there and they will tell you quickly\nUp to a week up to ... they want it they want it shorter um and so I think the only thing that could change that calculus I'm is if for some reason senators flake\nCollins Murkowski if they are told in some fashion by the FBI that that the FBI as you know find ... following leads they need a little more time that's about the only thing but\nThen Republicans are going to have to figure out what do they do politically I'm ... and I hate\nHate saying that 'cause it's like there are human beings involved in this um you know that aren't thinking about politics we'd like to think but but that happens so you know it is what it is and uh they have to figure out if it's if it's\nIf they if they just tell the White House pull this nomination um this we can't do this or if this is truly a motivating turnout factor for their base because the base it's been really a\nDepressed ... so if if you're going into the midterms and you're fighting for a nominee that might be a reason for people to turn out who might not have otherwise done so absolutely so you know\nThat you know they've got some seats they could actually flip in red states where Democrats are like Joe Manchin of West Virginia and he's he there's a lot of pressure on him to vote for Kavanaugh yeah yeah\nHey Trish at one of the more incendiary charges against Kavanaugh was made by Michael ... representing ... sweat that that he participated in gang rapes and spike punch is behind the scenes are the senators really taking ... and the sweating to charges that seriously\nOh boy if they could ... says [laughter] because it's so odd that stormy Daniels' lawyer like brings these charges they get the number of Iraqis I got from Democrats like good alert this really true\nOh really telegraphing\nOh sure I mean if you could if you can imagine the worst person you know in terms of you know just ... you know bear substance of it all you know to bring forward ... allegations to be somebody like Michael ... I mean he just he loves we know he's going to run and\nTwenty twenty you know are we believe he is going to yes such political aspirations now he's a real bare knuckles drawl or and you know it just it takes a lot of the heat out but I'll tell you I think um you know Republicans are going to take these allegations seriously they're not um I\nI I thought in a really extraordinary move the Republican conference led by Mitch McConnell the majority leader they set out basically opposition research I'm under their own banner of Julie sweat ...\nSaying there's July all these that there's all these things that she's done where you know that make her less credible I was surprised actress before we run off the earliest he could be confirmed\nI think over we would be starting into the process over the weekend it'll ... it'll look really similar to what it did last night so you know like will be will be voting on a you know maybe a procedural motions over next weekend and maybe he is confirmed by the early part of next week if they get their\nAlright through Turner ABC News hour Kavanaugh correspondent I'm sure we'll be talking to you later in the wake ... banks rush that

many of the issues they care about abortion and same sex marriage for the bachelor and religious liberty all of which are ...\nOr it's not the Congress twenty six percent of Americans call themselves born again Christian and eighty percent of the eighty voted for Donald Trump he can see why from the airport Republican point of view it's absolutely central to please their constituents to push to on this issue\nWe're on with the robbers the ABC News political analyst in Washington and just before you joined us on the air I voiced my two concerns about judge Kavanaugh number one is a temperament\nIn that uh he went after senator is really you know fighting back against them and also the whole business where he went so wholeheartedly about claiming the Democrats are out to get them and blaming the mountains and I really had my dad says it's just a guy you want to sit on the bench for the Supreme Court who has a these political leanings\nWell it's a very important point look politics as it is always part of judges judges are all appointed by politicians by elected politicians but it Kevin O's whole performance is very much against\nThe tradition of the court a let's remember who Kevin ... is he work in political jobs for many years he worked in the Bush White House he worked for Ken Starr the special counsel investigating the Clintons um he comes from a very partisan political background has been on the federal bench for twelve years but even going back\nTo two thousand and six when he was a first nominated to the federal bench Democrats block his nomination cause three years everybody forgets this but he was gone for three years in part because of the very concerns you are talking about and in fact the American bar association at one point\nWe lose their rating from a very qualified to simply qualified because a number of\nPeople back then raised questions about his temperament and when you look at at at the anger and hostility and law partisanship and animosity he displayed the other day\nUh I think the concerns about how he would act as a judge or very ... very fair but it's a reflection of Lowell a larger trends here where you have a Supreme Court\nWhere you have conservatives appointed by Republicans and liberals appointed by Democrats and that too is very much against the longer tradition of the court where people do not impose ideological litmus tests but the last generation\nThat's been very much part of how the Supreme Court decision submit\nWhen I was going to say speaking of partisanship remember when Ruth Bader Ginsburg said she can't imagine what the country would be like with Donald Trump is our president that's pretty partisan from the from the left wing of the court is it not\n[laughter] that's true um and as I say you know is very clear you have four liberals all of whom ... on the by Democrats and conservatives appointed by Republican isn't listening that was not true you look at the\nJohn Kennedy's only appointment to the court was amending Byron White turned out to be very conservative yeah uh\nBut and yet a Potter Stewart a liberal uh was appointed by Republican Harry black man who was the road the weight opinion was nominated by Richard Nixon so she is a very different tone to the court today it's become the whole selection process has become much\nMuch more partisan but the one of the reasons for it is the point that just makes you guys remember this\nThe political system has largely failed to find solutions to these Cindy airy social issues that are very important to a lot of voters abortion\nCongress didn't decide abortion the basic law sit by a by the Supreme Court affirmative action set by the Supreme Court's same sex marriage sit by the Supreme\nCourt the role of religion and the public square sit by the Supreme Court so campaign finance\nCampaign finance or the one of the reasons why the court has become so politicized and polarized if that has become the venue for deciding many of the most incendiary issues in American politics not the Congress\nRight All right Steve Roberts ABC News political analyst joins us every Monday at this time thanks a lot spicy anytime\nWell Italy is a it's a policy now he's absolutely right the these these issues these issues that are ripping the country apart are being settled by the Supreme Court and that's why this fight has gotten\nSo Oh absolutely and in any any well articulated the base of of Trump and that's what they want and and and that's what they're getting I think I think he's going to go through at some point I really do\nWe shall see All right when we get Baquet your kid didn't make the soccer team what are you going to do call a lawyer\nWill tell you about that budget next chance at a thousand
