J. E. L. A. U. ... allow yes this is a small country in the world you'd never discussion ever hear of this and I you eat\nWhat country is that I set foot in Tacoma and reread it how about to vote no I'm not into to below ... that were almost ... to ... no nothing to do this\nNow I've not been but if I win the a hundred and sixty million dollars I Will make a tour of the smallest countries in the world and you can buy one [laughter] by the way we do a bone a segment every single day that we post on the website\nI Would say probably the best leverage we have is on um ... arms deals right now\n... do you buy into the um suggestion on the part of some other radio stations that the reason Trump is going soft with the Saudis is because he's got a lot of business dealings with them\n[noise] no I don't I mean I I think any time you get into that no the answer is no that I think that and I'm going to say is going soft I mean some of the biggest arms deals we had with Saudi Arabia\nDon't under President Obama and I supported them so let's be clear at this should not be a partisan issue or it's a difficult issue but it's one where we have to take a firm stand their stores it's difficult doesn't mean we don't take itself sense\nAnd how soon do you find that concerning that the president will say things like well a lot of them are putting told me he didn't interfere and then uh the king of Saudi Arabia told me he wasn't involved I mean I Am I'm a little queasy about those statements\nI ah was very critical the pros and we said that about voting a fact is I don't believe anything quote and would say the only uh\nExcuse if you want the only thing I Would say right now is the president may want to keep his options open until we get the final results to show that he had to rush to judgment others did give the Saudis the benefit of the doubt and now all the evidence is in we have to condemn them but other than that uh to me it would matter to me what Saudi set\nA again this is a moral country they have so many of their citizens involved in nine eleven acne against just yeah I was the one in Congress who sponsored the bill to allow Americans to sue the Saudis because of nine eleven so I Know a little bit off the Saudis\nRight now a useful ally in certain instances but we can't allow that to overcome the human rights violations\nCongressman how in the midterms looking to you is the Republican base a more energized now after the cabin on a hearing\nIt you know certainly appears to be but again it's three weeks to election I Would say what the uh the increase in the Republican base after Kavanaugh what's that ... that was back at the base mobilize but south Republicans to keep it mobilized that is not enough to sustain itself you know for the next three weeks we have to make sure that we do all weekend\nTo keep that base mobilized and it's going to involve other issues such as the economy such as terrorism and they were Long Island certainly have us Thirteen\nSo confident how has your race going you're up against a young woman named ... Gretchen surely as a piece of Newsday today talking about all the money that she has raised there are you going to have a fight on your hands this time it'll be a cakewalk as usual for you\nWell listen I I'd say every race seriously I think one thing it should be clear in that story is that as we call went to the final three weeks I have ten times more money than she does a few grays or advocate matter of state and then apparently she spent a lot coming into the final three weeks I have the money I think I'm\nA running I don't know twenty times more at the television ads to her as far as time I\nGuess probably Fifteen times ... whatever it is it's considerably more as far as television media social media but also more than that\nIt's money can only go so far I've been outspent in elections and they want or is that I've troops on the ground I Will volunteers I ever had before or a lawn signs want people making phone calls won't people going door to door\nSo in any event I have a really excellent shape but again it's three weeks or what should I say looking for granted I'll be working until nine pm on November sex\nHey congressman the Democrats are camping down talk of impeachment should they get control of the house but do you think if they do get control the house impeachment will be on the agenda\n[noise] I think there's no doubt there'll be a lot of Democrats who want to move toward a peach or whether it's the president or\nA justice Kavanaugh but polling will show and that's why you find democratic leaders backing away from that American people don't want that American people don't want a government disrupted they look upon that as interfering with the uh a process of the election we should fight or battles out during the campaign and on election day and then what happens after that you wait till the next election\nCongressman Peter king here's my question for you I I Know your lovely light ... a lovely wife Rosemary I'm Wondering what she thought when she read that the president United States cold day woman a horse face\nIt was absolutely because she thought it was wrong I thought it was wrong it uh uh\nThe story Daniels is not the ideal woman detractors oppose the United states you shouldn't be even saying anything about her ... her that way which was foolish was wrong and I am saying is optional shoe store and she was\nReally a whereby participated that's why like Peter can you tell me like it is he he's not phony like Ritalin Joe Bartlett ... oh it's a it's fine and dandy no it's not and the congressman pulled them out good for you congressman you ever I give Trump this advice congressmen when this was do you are meeting\nA little bit I'd like to know what's in ...
