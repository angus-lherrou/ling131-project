{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "They were slowly throwing it out like you know with hair dryers and stuff like that a little bit at a time with the intention of\nUh trying to get their hands on some DNA from you know frozen are preserved DNA and then the whole idea is to then bring back the wooly mammoth and that's going on right now a including a group that's being led by a guy at Harvard named church\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's\nIt's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all\nYou have to ask you know then we really want to do this and there's an even deeper question that I raised in the book and that is with all the genetic engineering we are doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts are do come under the category of genetic engineering\nWhy we're doing in is something that's never been done before\nAnd that is we are elevating recessive trade\nAnd we're in common traits in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining\nThe natural flow were to find the natural order of things and you kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice it's nice to mother nature\nYou know that one yet none I forget what it was the Marshall was margarine I it was very mired in for a merger and right now and we all know margarine is not so great for us right but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits and suppressing dominant trait\nWere flying in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price and he can't do that you're you're you're fighting against you know a ... billion according to science you know billions of years of evolution right where we need to do that if we take it on or who who's going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the de ... thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly your elephant\nYou know but much in the same way that we have a sweeter orange right where we have a a a a juicy or a beach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the ... the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky net and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about this guy I think his name as a Anthony ...\nIs a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car a division of of Google right and then went to Hoover and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so forth and so on but\nHe recently applied to the our son was granted I'm\nA tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence [noise] and\nYou know on the surface it sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing this\nHe's basically saying this look if we continue in the trajectory we're now on\nIt it it is inevitable that one day\nA artificial intelligence robot Howard by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because\nThey know everything they see everything they they don't control everything if we give them that kind of freedom\nAnd so we may as well to start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its good side because God I did that this technology we're creating will run amok\nAnd you know you start thinking well okay it's a little crazy this guy but you know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIs developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the champs it to you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around\nGo you know ... you write an artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off or her you know the the goat champion and so\nIt's printed that writing is on the wall in I mean it it's pretty clear that these computers are not just going to become fans there they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there are no longer just doing computation\n'em but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we both are we once spoke about being very good at that well you know like you they're ... they're putting it up I think they're generally like he was still pretty small\nBut you know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours that the day of the singularity that's for the day when all singularity him one day we'll have the equipment IQ you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so\nYeah on a ... I think the interesting these are the two is it ... the equation is which you use it a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's to say that that the average you know accusing it a drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might stay but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than\nLook I I don't know did did he did he a trigger these threats and the bombs no no no I I think it's a combination of factors out there both sides have ah revved up their bases and energize them and\nYou know what maybe it's not a bad thing I Know it can be dangerous if things turned violent and fortunately no one got hurt with these bombings I don't think anyone was ever intended to be injured by these things that was obviously a political statement\nBut um it's good that people are excited they they have taken sides they're paying attention to issues and we have the mid term election coming up\nIn just a couple of weeks less than two weeks away and we're going to have special coverage on W. O. R. I'm very very excited about this to Joe ... political a commentator is going to join me as a co hosts we're going to talk to him in the next half hour about the mid turns and the um [noise]\nJust the um [noise] well the energy that exist now with the vote coming up and just a matter of days especially given the latest situation we have the caravan that's coming to so there's a lot of big news items\nAnd issues that have energized voters and ... they're going to go to the polls and they're going to make decisions based on these types of stories and this type of a coverage I Will tell you one of the things that President Trump has been very good at\nIs sort of a controlling what issues are discussed\nNow there are a lot of other issues that you know could be harmful to him in terms of votes but we get these little red herrings or whether it's a tweet from him or an attack on the media or or something he says at a rally\nThat kind of gets it gets the news cycle spinning and\nIt almost spins out of control\nAnd it seems like this has been a a practice for most of his presidency and I think the news media is going to get a handle on this and um you know they they take him\nLiterally at everything he says in some of his stuff is just it's for a fact uh I don't think he actually believes all that stuff but he says but you know it's very good to just throw out at a rally um anyway\nBack to this uh situation with the bomber who was arrested in Florida yesterday um hopefully we we come to just I'm a pause you don't just take a pause in terms of the anger that is out there\nBut I got to tell you when you when you start talking politics you you almost can't have a\nA a discussion a calm discussion with somebody used to be easier you know I I disagree with you when we talk about this well it's yeah I I this is the way I see it this way you see it All right thanks let's go have something to eat now you end up screaming and yelling at one another and I don't ever want to talk to you I don't ever want to talk to you\nYeah absolutely so\nLet's let's fish chill now in terms of the election Americans I guess it it looks like highly motivated to get this bowed out we are ah like I said listen two weeks ago before the November sixth election eight million Americans have already cast\nTheir ballots in early voting and absentee voting we got to get that early voting here in New York New Jersey would not be so cool that you could vote early you just gotta send it in\nI I don't know but I think I wait a little closer to election day because for example if you sent your vote in last week and some states you don't get to judge your candidates based on this bomb story that we're hearing about today that's not a factor in your decision so sometimes it can be\nWell a little dangerous to vote early but nevertheless\nOr re high\nOn our\nEnd good morning we've got the news coming up here on the bottom of the hours right after the news dump our sales will join us with sports we've got the giants and the jets this weekend who knows what will happen with those football teams as far as the giants are concerned it's been a dismal season it doesn't look like it's going to get\nAny better of course we have the world series it's in LA\nFor the next couple of games the Dodgers didn't like the cold the Boston apparently so we'll see a much better they're doing in Los Angeles and they'll also coming up with the next half hour job country on the political commentator will join is going to talk about the mid term elections\nAnd just the fiery political atmosphere that exists here in the country this year and of course Joe is going to be my co host for our special election coverage on November the sixth right now let's get the latest news\nThank you very much forty eight degrees with rain showers at six thirty good morning I'm Terry ...

[noise] so it looks like they're trying to save money and they're going to\nWhat about dumping needle wells can [laughter]\nYeah no no no not ... I think he like I I I think what um what's gonna happen no I I I'm almost certain that this\nIs it at some point in the season Eli is going to get bench just like last season although it's going to be handled a lot better this time around and they'll put this a rookie that they just drafted a ... in there and see what see what I can do they have to decide whether they need you know where their next quarterback is going to come from\n[noise] and so there you might as well give the garage or your home and just drafted the\nCourage of your early in the division\nIt is that because um the uh the the silent a government you know the people who really run the show the unelected power um likes it this way because\nYou know they they know how to get their deal then\nI suppose yeah I I just think it's the mindset around here in the north east in general for that matter that you know ... it's it's very socially liberal around here and social\nIssues seem to to rule the day and you know what what can you say I mean it and New York is a city and uh that that is overwhelmingly I think it went something like this is Donald Trump's home town and I think he only got Eighteen percent of the vote here was that that tells you where we are now what an uphill battle I mean that's\nJust that's got to be the worst job in the world I mean I Know it's voluntary but to run against ... and when you know you have no shot I mean to be alone experience but I guess you got to put somebody out there I\nKnow we're talking with Joe conscious a media reporter and columnist for the hill let's talk about New Jersey I think the Republicans have kind of a slim hope they're given the corruption allegations against incumbent ...\nBetter than a slim ... cook Political Report right now they're they're the ones who away a basically percentages around who's gonna win what race and they just uh on friday morning\nFlipped the Senate race\nTo a\nToss up in other words ... getting right who are in a lot of people ... before this election uh running against a Menendez who has been around forever\nIt seems at an despite the fact that you know he has done some very shady things and and a lot of people think probably shouldn't be in jail suddenly now this thing it's a toss up and I can tell you a lot from the ground in New Jersey and you've lived there too so you tell me but it seems like all icy or you can science\nEverywhere and the only ... science that I see is that he's a court can you should be locked\nUp [laughter] well it's kinda hard it is kind of hard to support him giving you the accusations against him and he wasn't I'm acquainted he just wasn't convicted\nRight exactly it was basically a hung jury right so ah yeah it's not like he he uh was it was somebody approaches innocence and then now he's going to be able to move forward there is no enthusiasm\nBehind Bob Menendez whatsoever you can there seems to be so it just it seems like the poles keep tightening in tightening and New Jersey you know it's kind of like a member of Charlie Brown when he always tried to keep all Lucy pulled away the last second that's\nBasically what New Jersey has been for folks that have run for the Senate if you're a Republican but I think this time around because Mendez is so flawed that Bob ... and I think has a fifty fifty shot like the cook Political Report says\nInteresting I mean even governor Murphy staying away from the ... so um that tells you something about his toxicity\nYeah seriously I mean why a sitting governor it doesn't want to keep a Republican Senate if they're not doesn't want I'm sure he prefer it but as an out there I mean but what are you going to say that's good about\nMenendez really [laughter] oh yeah\nThat that that's going to be a problem I I you know I'll I'll go on the record right now I think you're going to win this quite frankly wow and uh and and it and Republicans adds to the Senate probably three or four seats over all\nYou have any sense of which party has the most energized voter out there whether it's Republicans or Democrats\nIt's even ... it used to be Democrats by ten twelve\nOr Thirteen points every all that I've seen a now it's even and that is strictly because of one name and that is Brett Kavanaugh when people saw what happened during those confirmation hearings and the way the Democrats acted but Dianne Feinstein actually holding that letter that she got from Christine Blasey Ford instead of\nPresenting it and running an investigation they're under the radar without the media involved and even after the confirmation hearings at least the first round she doesn't even bring it up and questioning Kavanaugh at all and then suddenly at the eleventh hour it gets leaked magically to the press and then we had that circus of the hearing that we saw and I think people overall just all look\nHere here's a woman that that has no corroborating witnesses and then the other accusers that came or even more ridiculous stories with no cooperating witnesses in other words no evidence whatsoever from things that happen thirty five years ago and they said boy this is dirty we don't like way the Democrats are running this and and suddenly a sleeping giant was walking on the Republican side\nJob well we'll see you November sixth ear on W. R. joke controlled media reporter and columnist for the hill thank you very much for your time ...\nThanks lots of water and some Chinese at night if you do any good places are out well\nFor sure I\nWill that'll do it but this edition of the job on Saturday show thank you very much for getting up early and joining me and thanks for a paying attention I Hope we'll do it again next Saturday morning beginning at six AM\nAnd I hope you join me on Monday morning five again with the first morning news and then at six o'clock is Len Burman and Michael ... in the morning have yourself a good weekend and be careful out there going to be windy for a lot of today a lot of rain and wind a\nNor'easter a on the weekend menu so take it easy out their job on this thing so long now see on Monday\nWe'll rated number one seven Dan W O R voice of New York\nDegrees and raining at seven o'clock this morning I'm hearing the ... and he liked attorney ...

that crew loyalists forty eight times stronger than fish oil is that true any sense\nWell you know obviously these are the girl guys talking right right right but you could look at it\nBoth ways let's get into cruel and just a moment but first let's pass the fish oil guys on the shoulder because you know you could say that the fish oil is better and stronger but we're talking about the concentrated high omega three fish oil here because it's higher\nThan the omega threes the E. P. A. N. D. H. here that are so important for the heart the brain the memory mood your eyes your skin your hair your nails so in one sense you could say well the fish oils better but\nIn another sense I have to hand it to the crew guys because in terms of antioxidant power krill oil is extraordinary and it's because there is a molecule and crew oil that's naturally occurring called ask the Hampton and after that then Steve this is one of the most\nPowerful antioxidants we've ever discovered Steve by one measure of antioxidant activity at six thousand times stronger than vitamin C. while amazing that the opposite in power in the krill\nAnd now as we're getting older fifty clusters like myself I'm fifty two and we don't make as many antioxidants naturally are antioxidants systems are kind of slowing down at the same time we're producing more free radicals naturally this is what we call it cruel omega fifty plus extra antioxidant power and extra chromosome number\nFive hundred milligrams of crew instead of three hundred that's sixty seven percent more plus the vitamin D so important for us\nAnd this is just incredible value folks they were going out and they were getting the colonel

product with the ... and the fish oil it's not one being better than the other\nThey're both great and this is the best of both worlds\nYou know thank God for purity products I'm Serious [laughter] seriously because when you think about where our food supply is gone and where we are today we have to have something that allows us to feel better as we age to age gracefully it's amazing to me was we try and that's why I\nLove the way the purity gives away the free bottles was you know people can be skeptical said it'd be skeptical but now they can be skeptical and they say okay you know what this sounds pretty important I'm going to give it to go it's only going to cost me six Ninety five [noise]\nAnd they get it and they try it out and what they start to see because it doesn't take long remember that joint study seven days\nTwenty percent more comfortable but they start to seize hey I'm more comfortable I feel better they notice their energy is better than they realize hey you know

you're like wow this is great stuff thank God for purity\nLet's talk about the heart health for a moment it's probably the single greatest concern that people face as they age so anything that we can do to boost heart health becomes really a top priority you know this I Know this and those folks out there and others as well and I know you mentioned earlier that\nOmega threes literally lower our risk of corner and heart disease do I have that correct because that's the same\nKnow absolutely and protecting the heart this is what put omega threes on the map back in the seventies Dr ... discovered you know how protective they were for the Eskimos ... bottom line is\nOmega threes prepared to heart in so many ways they promote a smooth rhythm uncle heartbeat important for the bodies normal inflammatory response in the heart muscle inside the arteries in pain state promotion\nIt was useful flexible arteries so important for circulation they promote healthy blood platelets activity help your red blood cell activity they support healthy blood pressure that's very important triglycerides so they do so much for the heart to simply amazing cardiovascular protection with these omega threes\nAnd it just keeps getting better than a you know I got a reminder when\nPeople have patients coming here all the time and I'm like\nAre you taking your omega threes I Hope you're still taking your omega threes you know they're afraid to say you know\nLike the omega three doctors take your omega threes and in fact if there was only one nutrient that I could take the honest to God if there was only one nutrient that I could take hands down to make it through his first most important nutrient ... and his crew in like a fifty plus the love the way to combine the crew oil with the fish
