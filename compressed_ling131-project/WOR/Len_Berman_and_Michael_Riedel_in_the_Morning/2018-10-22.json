and all the money really\nSome money is going to count more than morality hundred billion dollars Oh absolutely I'm changing my whole to it on this a classic morality come if you don't stand for morality what the hell do you got a dog yeah let's have into the almighty buck okay will suck up to the Saudis because we can sell them whether you're going to cats are really that's really taking the moral high ground you're going to camp\nHundred billion dollar contract for one journalist please\nHere's the other thing to learn a lot of people are drawing comparisons to the U.S pulling a support

IRA and all the ghost of the past the IRA come back to haunt the sound so winner usable numbers come in there is no where's the comedy they yeah they they danced ... without moving their arms because it's Irish [noise]\nReally you know that like in that we've already sold the gays and I had a segment you already know daily the ... you know a joke you dance this way because you're Irish without moving her I'm not commenting\nMight you know like I said earlier you eat healthy do you know when we\nCome back really one point six billion dollars for a mega obscene amount of money what would you possibly do with one point six billion you get a chance for just one thousand coming up after the news it's nine o'clock\nIn cash out again but and then the taxes will leave you probably what between five and six hundred million right not enough for you\nI'm just saying what would you deal with that I laugh at me 'cause I joke that well so purchases I'll buy a house well yeah you'll buy a house you could buy a house on the\nMood I'm going to buy a plane by sports team on a plane I'm gonna buy my own plane\nRight you can't afford the NFL to know that they can afford a local soccer too if we

food\n[laughter] and I said out of there [laughter] now you're [laughter]\nLife would be [laughter] All right so I mean the Saudi thing now the Turks say they're gonna tell all tomorrow mhm do you think Irwin or to or do on that well that's how you pronounce that they are the ones filtered again in a ... a you know do you think he'll release audio or video that's the key to me I mean\nI don't know if I Want to see the video that got him in his head and fingers chopped off but uh it does appear that they had the audio and that's a I'm sure they had the embassy bug you know the Turks and bug the embassy sort of how they heard it right uh and that's the way to to prove it if they have the videotape or the audiotape\nThere was one story that he in what they can cut off his arm as soon as he got in the dorm they chapters are mafia you walked in I I thought it was the fingers areas and then then his head\nOh boy only ... wow that's just unbelievable move and then they you know\nBut then the only an accident or rewrite it was a fight we didn't mean it was a mistake we had Fifteen guys one with the bones saw but ah I was a fight it was just a fair fight yeah I mean he got a little upset that well I figured they ... that would piss bail out of the [laughter]\nThe I Know it hurts his way out I mean what are\nWhat are you know you gotta fight like you're Irish [laughter] 'cause if you think about what it wants to pledge to one [laughter] he's got the Jacob did that and so if you're looking at it I thought you were outraged that this killing that we need\nConsequences severe respond [laughter] pretty funny to you know [laughter] oh I'm just I'm able to shake their hands [laughter]\nSo ... posture as with the Saudis are saying and I'm just wondering if there's any other solutions other than this guy's got to go\nI think NBS has got to go it's the only way that's not only possible solution though we will accept as a country I think that's the only possible solution possibly the only solution the world\nYeah will accept rise and the ... and ... and the U.S has got to go there a hobbit got it and saw him on he's got eight million cousins or somebody else who can take his place I'm sure yeah but he was the most most ruthless of them all apparently well they're saying that\nBoth he and the king knew nothing this was all a rogue operation well they they came up with the story really early because remember how how fast Donald Trump said to use the phrase rogue ... so this this was a story that they were concocting the beginnings Trump's getting tougher on them\nHe was a little ambivalent the beginning but now you lay statements are he's pretty tough well he's got to do something I mean it's just and again and I know you're going to beat me up for this\nYou can't put money over morality you can't tell me that well we got to sell them arms so we got to be nice we're already selling them arms a hundred billion dollars on their lives and not to demand consequences or not to have other kinds of sanctions is because we're going to make a buck I mean that's just not right\nI mean I think in some somewhere morality has the kick in if this is the country's going to be a beacon of the free world they need and he was like wait a minute just because they they need arms from the way they treat their people you know you're just [laughter]\n...
