correctly will be ... this was this is a funny story so Cuomo was putting out he's running against mark model narrow so Cuomo put out this Web things saying I'm\nMowing the arrows shady deals dot com so people should go to that ... um when he didn't do with the campaign didn't do for Cuomo was actually by that website so model narrow bought it\nSo if anyone goes to the mall and arrows shady deals dot com they are redirected\nTo Cuomo leaks out clever good job I learn something if you're going to do a website or ... or ... or ... at first that opposite sibling anyway very cute story there but I Can't believe Ninety six signs that's how much money or they just put some tape all for it or something a\nQuarter million dollars to Ninety six signs that's ridiculous\nIt is really sorry when we come back we're going to be talking to ABC News\nPolitical analyst Alex ... ... we're going to delve deep into all the Supreme Court circus of the cabin on nomination and your next chance at a thousand dollars is coming up after the news it is seven o'clock\nI think so but it's having an impact the other way to serve bourbon and women in in districts are congressional districts where where you have a lot of white suburban college educated women they're still fired up no\nI don't think this is going to help Democrats as much as it's going to help Republicans because the Democratic party was already on\nFire and you can set fire on fire [laughter] there were already they're already\nJuiced up but it's having that kind of impact I think Republicans so I think yes Kevin has a good shot still getting confirmed\nWow huh here's something that I don't think the Democrats banked on ... just you just touched on it but let's explore further Alex\nWhite guys you know middle aged white guys like me are saying wait a minute we're going to go down a path where riled up feminists think the allegation stands on its own and it's about time these privileged white guys get theirs that is going to make me vote Republican\nAnd you're seeing exactly that happened out there look I mean I think for a very believable witness in many ways\nBut you wish you could've named at least one witness who could corroborate her allegations and do you wish that may be one of her close friends Mrs Kaiser had said\nThat she remembered something but she didn't say that she said look I have no recollection of ever be at a party are gathering where Kevin O's president so [laughter] and you're right Michael I think what this reveals is that for Republicans this is about to people in who's credible but for Democrats\nThis is about Donald Trump and stopping Trump from putting someone on the court who would in their view said women back about a Woman's Journey to independence here and that is not so\nI think that uh Kavanaugh's ever going to be able to clear himself from\nA Roman Alex Cross the ... the NBC News political analyst will read all their Alex was being disingenuous he says well that's going to make me vote Republican he was going to vote Republican\nAnyway so he's just got to it's going to make me how morally it's got to make me about twice twice but I my\nMy concern is in it and feel free to shoot this down because ... does it all the time I I really thought the hearings expose the demeanor of cabin on and I and I thought there was some real questionable things that he did during that hearing that makes me wonder about his mental state to be on the bench\nI think some people saw it that way Lynn\nBut I think a lot of other folks saw this as a decent guy whose name has been drug through the mud to set a sit down with his daughter at home ten year old daughter and explain that he's not a rapist and people saw that he was out ration angry and he reacted the way they might have\nAnd so I think a lot of people saw Washington drag itself lower than it already was which we thought was nearly impossible\nAnd in line a good man so the Democrat argument might be hey we can do outrageous things but you can't be outraged we can burn you at the state but you can't come in we can ... these hearings but if you object then you are politicizing the nomination\nSo I think that\nAgain Democrats I don't think they're going to pick up a single vote because of this but I Do think we now have a Republican Party which we didn't have before these hearings\nThose are the senators will that Judiciary Committee I think represented the Republican Party when it started they were hiding behind the skirts of a female prosecutor right\nBy the time it was over Lindsey Graham you know I I think Kevin are kind of picked up the following flag of a party and retreat\nAnd change course and charged and the Republican Party went with him so I think the Republican Party found his voice again in a way and I think it November's now going to be much closer because of Brett Kavanaugh's outrage\nInteresting now you mentioned Heidi Heitkamp but what about a democratic Senator Joe Manchin from West Virginia he's in a deep deep red state or do you think he might wind up voting for capital\nI think it will I think that one would certainly be the smart political thing to do he's been very careful not to or not to indicate in any way to vote against him so I think that show vote still might get Heitkamp it's Collins and Murkowski that are going to be key but\nJeff Flake is what I think Republicans better be prepared to lose you know I think I think he has the courage to uh\nTo try to build himself a business in Washington After he retired from the Senate\nOr the ... who was interesting on sixty minutes I don't want to get your take Alex so they asked them point blank or are you able to be this honest and forthright in uh I'm and critical [laughter] and and all these other things because you are not running for office and he said didn't didn't skip a beat said\nYeah I mean the the state of Alabama\nI'm that week and perhaps\nThat's why his favorable rating in Arizona is in the single digits while we we asked these guys to go to Washington to fight for us and it turns out a lot of them only have the courage to fight for themselves [noise]\nAlright ABC News analyst a Alex ... thanks a lot for your time as always Alex we'll talk to you next week ... hours\nBut wow universities really entered the most parties as the Democrats are and you know one more vote

All right what's this uh\nThis story you found so I mean what I'm saying only funny in ... in the post what is it well or do\nYou know Bob Frederick she's a reporter for the good writer good writer always funny it says here President Trump on ... now I'm going to say right up front\nYou ask me to describe what this trade deals with Canada or Mexico I'm not going to be able to do it and I was a ... I did major major would economics okay I'm not\nI'm not going to pretend to know all the details on me into his soybean I Hope it works OK ... all credit Trump in great great job and I hope everyone lives happily ever after with the trade deal [laughter] anyway and says here\nPresident Trump on Monday lavish praise on the new trade deal is the ... with Canada and Mexico calling it\nQuote the single greatest agreement ever signed\nThis the greatest agreement hurdle greatest agreement ever saw in the history of all agree on ... so a ... ... did he ranked as he did do a ranking of the of the top five agreements okay I ever made number one of course is is the U.S Mexico Canada traded with a very\nFine agreement number to God gives ... bad but it's covered it for [laughter] a couple of the third the purchase of Manhattan [laughter] twenty four dollars Peter ... a ... agreement number for the Louisiana Purchase [laughter]\nEight hundred and twenty seven thousand square miles which is Fifteen million\nAgreement number five enough for behind the ... yeah the end of World War two with Europe so I [laughter]\nThat was pretty I don't see why that would tickle your fan that's funny no I wasn't I just those\n... Lawson president or does tend to hyperbole a little bit I understand no\nMap on I Would put the males would I Would put the agreement with Mexico and Canada above the Louisiana\nPurchase really soybeans are very important in this economy [laughter] I put it there so Jeff Flake who's been a big mover in shaker for this FBI deal yeah uh he was up in a New Hampshire yesterday ... and his comments were interesting\nTribalism is ruining this\nIs Terry in our country apart [noise]\nIt is no way for saying adults to act\nOf course he's the one on sixty minutes who claimed that he would never have done this if he was still up for reelection exactly but just to these ...\nI could never warm to the friends [laughter] long before he ran he talked about President Obama not being a citizen I thought\nItself is disqualified uh view cannot do that and then talked about John McCain in a derogatory way than talked about a\nMexican derogatory way and I just think that we've got to do better than that\nWell what's wrong with that what is he doing up there in New Hampshire do you think he's planning on running for the presidency do you think he's going to challenge ... that's a great question I think he's going to challenge Trump from the from the left will be a big mess he has a one percent approval rating in Arizona\nThat will be a big mistake for him I think it would be a big mistake for any Republican\nHe's a low energy talk about low energy low energy flake will ... like he will ah chew 'em up certainly\nI'm a proud conservative and a lifelong Republican [noise] that does not make Democrats my enemies\nGod low energy ... lake reaches across the aisle but only when he's not a ... minute that that's what they did not up for reelection because he couldn't be reelected 'cause he's so unpopular and ... why is he that unpopular these on the left 'cause he's at practically a Democrat ...\nAll right when we come back we've got all the best bites from the morning shows everybody's talking about Brett Kavanaugh and your next chance at a thousand dollars is coming up\nAfter the news with Joe Bartlett at nine o'clock\n[noise] New York's most folks they rated number one seven\nSo you think that if all that they have and I don't think he's line is that oh he drew it had a problem with alcohol when he was in high school and college that that should disqualify because he didn't admit to having a problem with alcohol he said he drank drank\nIt did lie about what a devil's triangle was in your book and blue fin but know that that doesn't just as well if I Am you know if there was some kind of proved assistance than actually happened that would be it wouldn't be the crime itself I said from the beginning just the fact that this may have happened was not as qualified\nBut if it does turn out that they've got proof which they won't but if they did then the lying in the cover up would be disqualified\nI think that's fair to say I have no idea what movie means I have no idea until you explained it to me the\nI'd ... explain nothing from a shelter in White House\nI'm waiting to see what the FBI report comes back with I certainly would not rule\nThere's plenty to believe and what he said but again it's very hard to sort through this until you have the investigation which is why we push so hard to make sure that took place\nNow he was on the Senate Judiciary committee was on the White House [laughter] yeah they got to raise it evident White House was or the White House\nHis ambitions are right out there I can tell you the whatever the White House so that's your former Republican senator All right this is a senator\nA Joni Ernst a this is from Iowa\nOr what message that censor when an end and America is that we are innocent until proven guilty and that's a great country and I have absolutely no doubt after reviewing eye doctor for a testimony that show has suffered from something very traumatic in her lifetime\nSimply that corroborate some was unfair and the witnesses that she brought forward\nSo what she's saying that women who come forward or they're the ones who are innocent until proven that are not in my cabinet no she's saying that she believes that something happened to Dr Ford but she's saying there's no evidence that was the first part of this listen to the first part\nOr what message that censor when an end and American Pie as that have we are innocent until proven guilty and talking about the women\nAre yeah she's taking a stand against her hyped up feminist sisters who want basically cabin ought to have to prove his innocence and she say no that's not how we do think things in this country you are innocent until proven guilty I see a rapid feminists are flipping that on its head well that seems to\nBe a talking point that the people who don't want to discredit forward because they thought that would be non PC are saying we do think something happened to her but it's just not him that's ... that's that's the argument\nCorrect one of the question is there is no evidence to indicate that it was him well settled however\nYou want with it what did he was on the calendar hooky a sly though either do it so that killed though I see you know you're just hurling unsubstantiated allegations out there to try to take you know I'm not I been lifted that's where the FBI I said I've been getting I said\nAll along let them take a breath and investigate it and by the end of the week they come back and say we found nothing to corroborate move on but yet but it's not going to come to a conclusion they're gonna like yeah you know and they were going to be at it is and then we're going to still put\nIt out there and then we're going to be right back where it all started and the Democrats are going to come up with another reason is trying to delay the the the company shares the evidence is\nDay we talked to mark judge and mark judge has recanted as earlier testimony and he's told the FBI blah\nBlah blah then they'll write it down without drawing conclusions do I think that's going to happen no I don't think it's going to happen but that's why I wanted the one week which was not a big deal you guys were beat me up over the one we were going to be in the same ... a week ago and all you know weren't\nWell they know and that's fine but ... but at least you took the week depends on a couple of wavering a it against like flake and Collins yeah the Murkowski but at least you took the week which I think is a good boys I'm\nGlad you that the boys could thanks so you are so condescending over their Lenny beat\n[laughter] I got ... got reading level I got a headache every boy [laughter]\nHow do we feel I miss ... be the\nThe Dave Clark five he runs

I may have all the guests today just a bunch of ... may as well uh what was she talking to Tom Brady his wife yeah gray supermodel in\nYou know she's talked about the facts about that she was down at some point a career and thought of suicide\nBut at at one point when you were in that apartment on the ninth floor yeah that you went out on the balcony and what was going through your well because [noise]\n\n\nThat way [noise]\n[noise]\nWell she was crying but apparently what is she talking about who's talking about this she couldn't talk about suicidal thoughts she's come out and said that I mean this is a beautiful woman making all the money in the world married to a Tom Brady and she's had suicidal thoughts at one point in her career which is tough never ... other people are going through\nIt's kinda sad so All right when we get back it's a miracle in Harlem that kid fell from my window and survived we've got W.
