everybody before we get into these crazy plane stories or let's take a call here from uh from Frank\nIn total a total loss and frankly that's only ... you don't want to drag\nYour good morning Michael inland how are you afraid of that and I'm at work\nOh well if you're on what's on your minds up\nA boy I tell you the ... talking about the caravan and not being spontaneous and most certainly is not spontaneous and I was just wondering if you had a thought on when you take the money will run out\n\nBefore they get to the border well whoever's money but it's definitely paid for these people that eat they got to drink that got to use the bathroom during vehicle somebody's paying for the gash do ... with ... ... when you take the money will run out where it will become a humanitarian crisis in CNN will be showing dirty dusty babies at the border\nA hot I planned it I you know frankly I think\nI think this may have caused a backlash rank because I think a lot of sensible people looking at the seven thousand people trying to swarm our borders are going to say you know what we need someone like Trump in there to protect the borders off\nI watched I watched Trump last night I was so I couldn't sleep I cause I get up at three thirty every morning drive down three into work and I try and thirty I'm Still wide awake just just it was just unbelievable watching him and listen and watch in the audience in there\nIt was just amazing and every once in a while just for fun it looked to CNN to see what they're talking about and there's a brick wall with that shot and it was it was what he must have had about what\nTwo thousand three thousand people were I mean they were a hundred thousand people trying to get into the Trump yup it's just you know I don't know how you doing Michael I got to you roll it comes every day\nNow I I don't know how long have you worked with ...\nWell yeah that'd be rough I mean I Know the holidays are coming up soon you're gonna have to take a couple of days off I Can't wait\nFor that apple we'd like both sides of every story that we've read about\nWhen it come on you know it's just your older guy you would have been around a little bit you know what's going on and even your other host or I won't mention his name he too young guys that they're in and usually like the younger guys that had your viewpoint and it just I I don't know it's just like you guys walking around you know\nThat makes them comes rank All right All right I think that I ... oh my\nGod so I got some crazy yeah airline stories here so Ryan air which was ... is a European airline they are facing some criticism because on a flight from Barcelona to London some\nPassenger got on and whatever as well as a goodwill every day and it was really nasty to an elderly black woman who sat next to him and he started screaming at are not going to sell the things he said well let me pick up your\nGifts although\nWell there you go if I have no rights well here's what are the ... here's\nWhat he says ... woman she tried to talk to him says don't talk to me in a foreign language you stupid ugly cow Oh thanks a lot but apparently\nThe flight attendants didn't remove him from the plane eventually they move the elderly black woman but they're facing a backlash because a lot of people who've seen this guy going crazy ... he should have been tossed off the plane as he should have been so\nFar as I\nWas\nSo ... it's a yeah what what do you say oh you live ...\nBecause they're an ugly black faster I think that's more than he was bond doesn't sound bond so lonely but you know I'm like you were saying is absolutely right one\nThey should've taken off the plane so what what was more upsetting is that they moved her I Know instead of moving here they should've opened the window open the door and from out here like men do where you put them because you don't want to put a neck to anybody else again another wing\nThere's the woman do see Gail what her five dumb down to a town called they called on my skin yeah\nIt's terrible yeah they should have rejected that guy now and I think the whole thing started because she was moving too slow for\nHim All right well here's another I mean this is on a Jet Blue flight the passenger and Orlando and another drunk taking on the staff of Jet Blue [noise]\nAggressive traveled traveling with an eight year old son he was arrested by police um I started going out and he was drunk was resisting arrest confrontation with a Jet Blue employee maybe I'll I'd hate to say this maybe just ban alcohol at airports in planes right all terminal wow that's a little extreme bats\nI think that's exactly right I think telling the American people that an army of seven thousand people marching on the border to come here illegally oh no that's not a threat to the law and order\nThatch the chaos that Democrats invite that Trump's message you saw chaos in Washington during the cabinet hearings Republicans are getting into the White House press secretary getting pounded out of restaurants a law and order so yes this is\nDonald Trump Bush message is what the Democrats are reinforcing here\nI think he's got a good a new slogan Republicans want jobs Democrats want mobs\nThat's a very good slogan and you know Donald Trump is the best the best political instincts of any predator in the political junkie and he is a is on message here\nThat's why this race has tightened up\nDemocrats had intensity their message was Donald Trump's gonna take women back back to the stone age take away their rights very powerful we were on fire but now Republicans are have this similar if not quite equal intensity thanks to Donald Trump\nOr used to finish it because I think that is right wing parade passing by and and the president just one minute after another just make stuff up there eastern Europeans and the camera man there's MS Thirteen I'm going to give a middle class tax\nCut whenever habit than other tax cuts and he's not giving a middle class tax cuts because Congress isn't even in session when are you going to focus on the lives of the president seems to be one and hourly basis\nOil in I'm not sure if if uh if we've heard this but ... isn't exactly new to ah to\nWhile he's taking it to a new art form Alex he really has no question\nNo question he's very good at it but I'd argue that Democrats in Washington it been lying on as large a scale as Trump is for decades telling us that we just send them more money and power they're going to fix every problem in America and every problem got worse\nThat's institutionalize lying and corruption and that's what Trump is running against so this idea that ah that somehow\nTrump is fighting fire with fire a lot of Trump voters would tell you yes he's given them just as good as we got\nAll right so Alex as you look across the country at these house races the Democrats still have an advantage\nI think they still have a slight advantage I Do\nThese off years or break federal elections and show restraint on Trump is very powerful a but it's not nearly as big as vantage as it was\nJust a couple of weeks ago\nI Would urge the Democrats to stop taking DNA test I Would urge the Democrats stopped talking about running Hillary for president and ah that one didn't work out so well last time so uh but it's it's much tighter the biggest problem for Republicans really\nIs open seats we had nearly thirty Republicans retire from Congress what does that mean\nThat means that the muscular campaigns income should add organizations and money they're gone so we're running new peas in the seats without money without organizations against\nIntense Democrat and and so my guess is Democrats will still take the house\nBut I don't know that I'd at my house on it\nAround with ... the ABC News political analyst from Washington joins us every Tuesday this time we're talking about great presidents will slogans of all time like nothing to fear but fear itself and ask not what your country can do for you and and we think Donald Trump has now joined the parade with his statement last night about Elizabeth Warren\nI abhor indeed and I know\nI think that's right up there with some [laughter]\nYou know you don't don't prove that you have strength to stand up to Donald Trump by by\nCaving in to his demand you take a DNA test you prove you have strength by saying yeah I'll take a DNA test when Donald Trump takes one to prove that Russian\nA good point you made\nHis hands to his family doesn't have small hands going back for centuries\nYou push back you fight strength with strict not by submission huge mistake for Elizabeth Warren\nYeah absolutely are I'd ABC News political analysts Alex ... he joined us every Tuesday at this time thanks a lot of al is\nGood to be with it it's interesting the thirty a Republicans are are not run how many ... do we know how many Democrats by comparison are must be a smaller number\nNo but it's a good point because the infrastructure you have an incumbent yeah they're so obsolete so maybe the Democrats can get it who knows All right when we come back Lenny dykes screwed up again
