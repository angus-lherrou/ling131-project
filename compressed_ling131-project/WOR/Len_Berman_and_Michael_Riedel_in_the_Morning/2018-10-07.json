actually trade while they're on vacation as long as you're doing it\nAnd the timeframe that will piss somebody else off and do you do that all the time Ryan is the idea that you can be making money anywhere you go and we have a student her name was Hayley she's younger she didn't want to want to work a desk job anymore she had recently gone through a divorce\nAnd when she decided to do is she wanted to pursue trading currencies and she realized that being in Europe was the center of the currency universe\nShe moved herself to Barcelona, Spain and she knew\nThat she was young enough it had time to do whatever she wanted to do a lot of our older students are really starting to reassess what's going on in their lives right now and they realize they got to keep up with the cost of living right things keep getting more and more expensive every year but imagine that you go in the markets for a couple of hours a day\nCommit to maybe one hour a day to practice\nTo get the skilled down and then you could start generating money that you can pass on to future generations your kids grandkids anybody want to help in the future\nYeah I think the key to this too is it's not about creating a fulltime job it's about creating that full time life\nYou know we talk a lot about financial freedom and that's that's really what it boils down to is being able to move to Spain if you want to move to Spain you know for for a while I spent my my winters in the Caribbean and\nI was living in Boston at the time and and I had somebody actually come up to me and say why do you go [laughter] I chuckle Everytime I think about it he said why do you why do you leave Boston and go to\nA Puerto Rico and the winter time and I looked at him and said have you ever spent a winter here in Boston and he was like well yeah and I'm like that's why when it gets really pretty freezing cold here in the wintertime and I'm running from it\nAnd that sort of the things that the the market's allow you to do is it doesn't matter where you it doesn't matter where you go as long as you have an Internet connection we've joked about it a few times Larry where back when I used to do that I wanted to go back and forth as I Would be down in Puerto Rico and I'd have that big a TNT air card hanging out of the side of my laptop\nThat it was almost the same size as my laptop\nAnd even my satellite radio down there like it only worked from like ... it only worked for eight AM to like noon because that's when the satellite was over me and so it was it was hilarious but where we are\nFrom a technology standpoint is is is light years beyond where we were you know twelve years ago Fifteen Years ago when when I was just getting started in this\nAnd it's kind of a fun it's been a fund evolution to see but for everybody who is just getting started right now it's like it's like you have no idea how good you have it I feel like when I talked to a new traders I'm like my grandfather and I'm like oh and I went to school I had to walk up pill both ways and the snow you know we had dial up Internet now it's just in the palm of your hand\nBut we have so much access to our money that really going in and just getting a little bit of skill and getting a little bit of a little bit of knowledge\nCan really go a long way we don't have to call up a broker and say hey you know what about this what about that it's just right at the ... of our hand identify the price we want to pay set the order and then wait for price really come down to you it it ends up being that kind of classic negotiating tactic\nYou say you know and my grandfather taught me this when I was like five years old I remember going with him and he was buying my grandma new car and he said watch this he says I'm going to tell them the price I'm going to pay and and as soon as he says no we're going to get up and walk away and that's really how you approach the markets you say you know what I Want to buy this these these shares a stock but I Want to buy this price and if I can for this price\nThat's okay there's lots of other stocks that I can go buy it a great price and you have to have that mentality and that is the mentality of the professional one of the things that can help you operate like a professional though is confidence\nConfidence can come from education confidence can come from building skill a great place to start that is it the half day class we've got a few tickets left before the show is over and we're going to give some away as long as Larry says okay I think it's okay\nAll right

chemotherapy might slow down the cancer for a while but it doesn't cure it\nAnd there's lots of people and I think glory as kind of insinuating that she's not so enthusiastic about getting chemo or chemicals in her body and yes there are other options and many people come here to Thirteen before Broadway Broadway and thirtieth street in the heart of New York city\nAnd we immediately go over all the options obviously I have not seen heard I've not seen her images and scans reports and cancer markers but\nThose are the things that we do we spend a lot of time with each patient and review all the information and discuss about all the options as but let's talk about what most probably is happening most probably she had this cancer the pancreas was probably grew and there were no symptoms\nAnd then it got into the bloodstream and there's a bloodstream between the pancreas liver and the bloodstream took the cancer cells to live or where they started growing in developing metastases that's stage for cancer [noise] so the idea of chemo was to slow down the cancer by giving chemo\nThe chemicals in the body to poisons the body we treat just the opposite way we're able to focus in and hit the cancer in the pancreas revel to focus in and treat the cancer and deliver all non invasive Lee those big differences number one with us obviously we treat the cancer and the pancreas liver\nThat's where the treatments go and it's not going to your hat on your toes and your nose and your ear and your hands and your feet with all those side effects so why does chemicals chemotherapy have so many side effects because they're going over your body and why are they so unsuccessful in general because they're going over the body so\nThe doses limited by the body they can't give enough to really kill the\nCancer cells are killed the patient so they give some dos which tries to slow down the cancer for a while but ultimately the cancer learns how to resist it and grow and spread and that's bad news with chemotherapy\nWith us we're able to attack the cancer the pancreas and we have high success rate\nWe've been doing this for decades you're done thousands of patients first in America first a New York first in the western hemisphere most experienced longest experience this is what we do and that's what we're talking about so that Laurie and everyone like Laurie\nCan learn that there are options is because the chemo doctors says oh you got the chemo for the rest of your life well a lot of people don't like that idea because came up for lost her life means you can never go away you can never travel if you want to go to Hawaii received grandparents or grandchildren\nIs stuck getting chemo or recuperating from the chemo or getting ready for the next ... even if it doesn't work then they change another came on tried for a while those or good try another one another and another one the other one another one until there is no more no more life was with us it's totally different phenomena\nWere able to send an invisible beams attack the cancer where it started for example in this case in the pancreas we can start anywhere\nIf you've ever lung cancer or breast cancer prostate bladder colon Iraq though a bone cancer or kidney cancer\nWe could attack the cancer wherever from head to toe primary cancers or met a study cancers and there's just a few treatments to trim with us takes just a few minutes there's a future events at our success rate is very very very\nHigh so for Ninety percent and that means adorable success where we attack the cancer most likely for the rest of the patient's life so it's totally different\nPhenomenon and then people often say with Dr Lederman can you treat stage for cancer can you can can you treat the cancer words traveled in the liver lung or wherever\nYes of course and you can call our office and you get information you can call even now and will mail you a package information about the work we do\nTo attack cancer most anywhere in the body soaring to send in beams attack the cancer hit the cancer with high success rates without the chemo without the systemic side effects\nAnd with high effectiveness rates so low right answer is yes we treat pancreas cancers every day we treat deliver metastases every day\nFor us in America do so and I do the cable doctors don't of course like way too much because they want to keep on giving came out\nWe don't care about them we care about the patient that's why I went to medical school to care about the patient to treat the patient we are not

though ... says blockage of the kidney the kitten he makes urine there and goes down the road or to the bladder\nAnd she went to one of the super bowl for places in Florida\nAnd they want to do a PET scan and a biopsy and she refused and then she tried concoction and chiropractor acupuncture and vitamins mega vitamins antioxidants all scams all scams I say that just so you don't get caught up with scams yourself\nShe said no real treatment no staging no nothing she never smoked which is a common cause of kidney cancers\nBut she was around smokers her husband and two sisters were smokers she's had severe pain\nSays left pelvis pen left hip pain inches other but a lie down comfortably she's lost wages gone through a hundred and thirty five pounds down to Ninety two pounds he's lost forty almost forty five pounds\nWithin months she had the CAT scan six months ago which showed hotter than a pro citizen the kidney mass lymph nodes\nAnd she had cancer going from the kidney all the way down the road or to the pelvis with no treatment and I examined her I met with her with her family and loved ones that we talked about all the options to try to get this kid's kidney cancer under control Troy\nMost likely you're a seal your cancer a field effect and\nSome people have defect so that they do have cancer all the way through their urine or system the kidney that you're the bladder and yeah we have high success rate in treating these cancers non invasive like her she's lost forty pounds in a few months cancers growing she's tried concoction scams which are\nNot gonna work we've offered to stage or up to see exactly where the cancer is\nWe've offered her ... she wants we've offered treatment we've discussed about all the treatments and this is the work that we do we do that every day and the good news department of talking about uh sixty one year old woman she was born in Ukraine beautiful blonde woman she's been the United states for thirty three years\nAnd she went more than a decade with a untreated acoustic drama critic norm as a tumor of the hearing nerve shed decreased hearing shed vertigo ... balance ringing in the years it's called to that says\nShe was seen by surgeons and she refused all the treatment she was afraid of paralysis deafness\nAnd finally she came here because she was getting worse and worse in her face was getting a week from the tumor eating away at the nerves and we treated her years ago and she is in remission\nThat big acoustic in Rome is gone or hearing is fined or faces fine she has no double vision numbness she's had no side effects no cutting are bleeding had she had open surge of someone opened up or had\nMost likely shoot be deaf and most likely should have damage to her face\nShe's a woman she's dating she wants to have a normal social life if she had deafness and facial paralysis you most likely would not be dating and then she came to us with the skin cancer and I know she's very cosmetically sensitive\nAnd she does not want anyone cutting on her\nNo she doesn't want a deformity on her nose and someone patching up taking skin from er about talks or someplace else and put it on her nose\nShe chose our treatment she trusted me because she had the treatment for the cruise ticket aroma she wanted a decade she waited ten years for that that goes to Rome a treatment Jewish shopping all over the world surgeons and others\nAnd finally she realized who had the largest experience with non invasive treatment\nWere the first to New York with brand radio surgery when all the hospitals all the doctors all the facilities thought their brain treatment was perfectly fine for brain tumors and brain cancer one doctor stood up to all of them and brought innovative non invasive\nPinpoint treatment with invisible beams of radio surgery\nTo you to New York to America to the western hemisphere and this is the work we do\nThis woman's benefited twice for treatment of the acoustic Norma still in remission and the skin cancer still in remission the cancers garner faces find her nose is fine\nShe is so happy about our work and that's why we like it we like our patients to be happy makes me happy it makes her staff happy and they were talking about a man from Portugal he came to the prostate cancer more aggressive cancer\nHe had a Gleason seven cancer Gleason devised a scale to tell us how aggressive cancers would be under the microscope sort of the microscope invade a scale from two to ten\nTo is the best ten is the worst everything more than six\nIs a more aggressive cancer\nWell this man had a Gleason seven cancer it came to me two years ago\nHe's from Portugal he's marriage you have three children as a contractor is high blood pressure yeah the biopsy at an MRI and he had to fall for us that it was a juicy prostate he way would wake up at night here in the daytime history was okay\nYou came to me that examined his prostate he has the tea once he stage prostate cancer\nWith a PSA that went up ten fold from zero point three the three point four within just a few years then now Gleason seven and four course well I should say one more thing\nI treated him two years ago and with only our achievement no hormones surgery know crowding\nAnd his PSA is zero his ex wife works is urinary life for access cancers in remission even though it was a more aggressively since seven cancer so we have excellent day that if you had that surgery most likely Ninety seven percent chance\nHis sex life would be finished eighty percent chance to be paying and dispense with us is fully intact good quality of life and his ... as a is zero so we have lots of information for prostate cancer\nAnd use it to grow and I imagine that's why\nShe's losing so much weight that cancer is eating away at our body I examined her she's got this twelve centimeter mass in the right breast it\nAs hard as large as a deep hole in the breast with a whole and you could look\nRight down deep into the breast with dead tissue and in fact the tissue\nAnd she has is palpable lymph node on the right side the rest of our example is normal so she has an advanced breast cancer and we talked about getting staging all exactly where the cancer is\nTo give her the best possible treatment about all the options we talk about all the options as you know to every patient who comes here\nThis is something that we do every day and we see many women with huge fun getting cancers we see many women with small tiny little cancers that even a microscope has difficulty finding that we're talking with a man from New York state he has a Gleason seven PSA three prostate cancer\nNewly diagnosed his two corps positively Seventy five\nHe's widowed he has two children these investor\nIn companies he had prostate cancer diagnosis two months ago his his hair was fluctuating between two and three hit a biopsy Gleason seven cancer he had a CAT scan and bone scan which were negative we usually for a lower risk patients don't get cat scans and bone scans\nBecause of the likelihood of spread of early prostate cancer is small but he does have a Gleason seven cancerous or the microscope it's a\nMore aggressive intermediate stage cancers blood pressure medicine I examined his prostate he's got an a large prostate and well as you know we have a Ninety percent success rate for Gleason seven cancers\nMost likely with us he would be successfully treated most likely with us all the treatment would be out patient\nComes and gets a treatment and goes home or goes to work that goes to his office\nWith us most likely to keep his sexual life and urinary life it's easy to understand why men like our treatment and their wives and girlfriends too because of course to keep sexual function is

story\nGod divine spirit is always with them and that now is my role in parenting to hold back\nMm Well Mark really helpful insights thanks so much for being with us today and for sharing them\nI just love being here\nI've been speaking with mark money a Christian Science practitioner and teacher from Cynthia Park New Mexico [noise]\nWith me now to continue our discussion of being parents had by God is Jane Hicks and from Brad sultan Georgia thanks for joining us today\nThank you read it here in ...\nWell you know we've been hearing so much in the news about the plight of children who are either without parents are displaced from their parents due to various hardships so Christian Scientist how have you been praying about the situation\nCan and I know and love thinking of the children we hear about in the news right on in large understanding and parent is which\nAnd to be our father mother God\nI learned a good lesson about this many years ago when I was teaching a group of second graders\nThis class had thirty four students to students who lived with both of their parents one lived with her mom was a single parent the remaining thirty one were led by their parents to live with someone in the neighborhood who was unrelated to them\nSometimes there'd be four or five unrelated children living with a neighbor and sometimes as many as twelve children\nThe parents would come once or twice a year to visit these children these parents where migrant workers who traveled up and down the east coast from Virginia to Texas they picked whatever was in season caught and pizzas strawberries et cetera\nThis situation was so sad to me that each day on my forty minute drive home after school I found myself in tears I couldn't imagine being separated from parents are being herded like cattle\nIt seemed to me that they were abandoned each day regardless of my tears I Would turn to the Christian Science pastor which consists of two books the Bible and science and help with key to the scriptures by Mary Baker eddy I went to these books for comfort\nI knew from genesis one in the Bible that God made man in his image and lightness and John one tells us that God is spirit some man is spiritual not material is the image and likeness of God man could never lack of father mother\nHis love or a home\nI research the word family father or mother sons and daughters and I knew that God's was everyone's father mother but the thought of being left with a stranger was overwhelming\nAs a research thing came to the Bible verse God said at the solitary and families I also reminded myself of Mary Baker eddy words God as a father and her mother her minister and the great position\nHe is man's only real relative in heaven on earth\nGradually I realized that these children had never been abandoned by God his love was constantly with Sam caring for them the children who live together even though they weren't related or especially caring for each other\nThis I saw was proof of God's care\nAnd then one day I overheard some of the children who live together talking with each other about the special dinner they had had the evening before the neighbor caring for them had cooked their favorite meal\nThe word God said at the solitary and families that's from spam sixty a verse six came to thought I realize that these children had not been abandoned\nGod had directed their parents to choose someone who would give them the proper care and then I realized they had shelter closing food and most important\nProof of God's tender love and care well needless to say I should know more tears I just rejoice than hearing from them about the things those caring for them did for them\nWell gee what a great insight into really who are two parent is you know you have people from your own life where you felt parents by God\nWell yes I have in my own experience when I felt ahead nobody that could help me and I had no place to live\nIn that situation was such that I had to move out of one place and was to move into another but my son had and come through in the place I was going to would not accept me so I had all my stuff loaded on a truck\nThe movies that he put it in storage but I didn't know where I was going to go and I was sitting literally on the floor in an empty house praying about parenting and about God being the father and mother\nAnd what came to me was a quote in\nThe first church of Christ scientist and missile any Mary Baker eddy says if we say that the sun stands for God\nAnd all his race collectively stand for Christ and each separate race from men and women it occurred to me when I was thinking about that that God was the father and we were his children and we couldn't be separated from God\nSo as I was thinking about that this lady knocked on the door and she's she was a neighbor and she said I didn't get to tell you goodbye but I wanted to come and find out where are you going to live in it so I could come visit and I told her you know I didn't really know because it enough they'd hold the place of what\nShe said oh I Know somebody and she wrote an address and the name and phone number on a piece of paper and she said give me a minute I'll run home and call them\nAnd then you can call which I did do and she had a garage apartment I Lived there for almost a year she was helpful to me and I was helpful to her was another sense of family of being parents had by God being guided to this new home and another time\nMy daughter after her sophomore year in college and went with two of her roommate to visit a third roommate in Bermuda\nAnd their her family owned a hotel there so they packed up and went up to ... and when they got there they found out that their friend and her family had gone on vacation so they couldn't stay at the family's hotel\nBut they put their money together and they they went on the other side is the island and they rented a room\nWell they got up the next morning and they went to the beach and when I came back they found a room had been ransacked the all their money had been stolen they don't have any money\nThey hadn't eaten that day and my daughter called me in tears because they didn't have any place to move to they didn't have a place to go there and I have any money to go with\nThey couldn't even change their plane tickets because it took money the ... book your flight so I told her that she needed to turn to what she had learned in the Christian Science Sunday school and that we would pray about it and what came to me was that I realized that God was her parent\nThat he sheltered and provided for her every me she was his image in line with\nUh realize that the er and false responsibility on my part we're trying to be in charge so I Would have to say no to both I told her to find a quiet place to prey so she went to the beach\nShe said she was sitting there she was bad on her tears when a man came up to her and he asked her why she was crying and she told him what had happened\nAnd he said is that how he owned a five star hotel on another part of the beach and he said for she and her friends to get their thanks to come and he would give them a room there which he did and they stayed there for the rest of the week and he never would accept any pay\nAnd he also invited them to come to dinner that evening\nSo they had food and then the next day\nOne of the room mates receive the money which was enough money for them to have food for the rest of the time but it was such prove to me that God never stopped caring for all of his children\nGod is the caretaker and that means that we are not just only cared for but we always have home that parenting Homer simultaneous\nThe Bible Paul says in him we live and move and have are being that's an act and to me that's the definition of family and home and that's true for all mankind\nWow Well Jane thank you so much for being with us today and for sharing your incite\nThank you read is so much for the opportunity\nI've been speaking with Gene Hackman\nRational to Georgia\nAnd with me now to continue our discussion about being parents by God is Christian Science practitioner Houston Agnew thanks for joining us today Kirsten\nOh I Am so grateful to be here with you\nWell I Know you had an experience it really taught to a lot about who the real parents can you take the beginning and tell us what happened I certainly can I've been a single mom for the whole time and reading my son\nShow is provided for entertainment and general information purposes opinions expressed are those are the presenter Ollie we make no promises are guarantees of investment performance online training academy is not a broker dealer certified financial planner or registered investment advisor enjoy the show [noise]\nTo the shows your first time that we are pleased to meet you my name is Ryan and joining me as always I say as always the last week he was out of a sign that he's learning ... teaching in Connecticut\nThat's a long ways from Texas I I was on the right country\nBut not in the region but to Larry's back with us today if you guys are with us last week we had John O'Donnell he's the chief knowledge officer and we call him the rain maker hear it on the train economy filling in for Larry's big shoes\nHere on the income generating show now one of the things that we love to talk about here is we love to talk about making more money hence the name right we're all about income here it's all about driving more income now it always ends up being\nIncome for retirement or income for today right we can use the income for for really whatever we want but it's all about having more income so that we can do the things we want to do rather than do the things we have to do no inside of our financial markets one of the things that we stress a lot we spent a lot of time on this show\nIs how to make consistent income and that's that's one of the things I Love having Larry out here out here talking about he sheds a lot of light on that subject as far as how we can make consistent income in the market and it really starts with a consistent approaching and all we mean by consistent approach is the markets go up down in sideways so we've got to have\nA strategy we've got to have an approach that can make money up down or sideways right now we've got that bullish biased where some of the greatest consumers of all time but Larry what are some of the things you and your instructor team are really having the students focused on right now to generate money and to be able to identify those down opportunities and those sideways opportunities\nWell it really comes out of the things that's about awareness and basically emotion right now\nSo the awareness is a lot of people want to make more money they think that making money\nIs simply working another job which is something we don't want it to where more importantly most millionaires you and I said this over and over again have five different income streams\nWhere you can imagine a millionaire and just want to go out there were five different jobs they learn how to generate income passive income or active income they just want to pay check coming over and over again and so a lot of what our students learn is how to go from being very emotional\nTo being very strategic and the way you do that is by following people who are already doing what you want to do and will cross referring to the big banks and so a lot of what we teach our students is\nHow the banks make money and most of the ways to make money is not just by going long where most people learn a trade that way\nBut also by going what we call shorting the market\nAnd that simply means when the markets go down it's not necessarily a negative thing it's an opportunity and so with ... self aware is understanding that there's more ways than what you might have been taught to trade\nAnd as a result you now simply learn which most people don't understand that their way to trade money in the markets is really simple it's a transfer money for people who don't know what they're doing to people who don't know what they're doing\nYou know when you're talking about shorting I Love that you brought that up because you know we have that Bush by us where we already know how to make money when the market goes up we buy low and sell high but the interesting thing is\nHow you make money as the market's going down the shorting concept you were talking about what what a lot of time get disconnected from that is it is still buy low in so high it's just in a different order it's so high and then buy low and so that's one of my favorite things about the half the class and and whenever I get a chance to actually teach one\nI really spend a lot of time really try to shift our mindset and then the mindset that the average investor has out there which is totally normal is down markets are bad\nRight we we we even hear it on the news and bad news they say oh it's such a terrible day on Wall street the markets went down the Dow went down four hundred points\nWell on days like that like back in February you know Goldman Sachs had the two hundred million dollar day on a down day just like that\nRight so one of the things I Love that I was just getting started off onto with with my point is I Love being a part of these happy classes and being able to really introduce people to how to make money as the markets go down\nSo they don't have to fear the bear ray you don't have to be afraid of embarrassed market bears markets just like polish markets are great opportunities to make money and even even sometimes greater opportunities to make money because at which ah which speed the market goes down it's that whole fear and greed ... principal the up markets are driven by greed the\nDown markets are driven by fear and you know I I remember asking a class once you know which which which motion was more powerful fear agreed\nAnd I had some you say I I I think it's greed and we chatted about it because most of the class thought it was fear and one of the points that I came to was if it was greed everybody would do everything in their power nothing nothing would ever standing anybody's way of making money but it ends up being fear 'cause the fear of the unknown the fear of trying something new\nConsistently stands and the way of people's people's ability to make more money and it gets back to your point of that is why most people go out and they just get another job rather than generating another stream of income like passively are actively via the markets because that's a safe zone they already have a job to get another job well it's not the most appealing thing\nIt's a little more safer for our psyche so those are some of the things we help our students overcome a so I Love that you went down the shortest path there because that is a great way to make money as the markets are going down and one of the things that we could do to help get a few people get started\nReally being able to see the opportunity and embarrassed market is we've got a big stack of tickets here that we are going to give away today where you say we pull a couple of these out and we give them with some more listeners let's get some people educated\nAll right well right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area\nAnd at the half the class and really it online training academy ... we focus on generating income as the marks going up in the markets are going down but the half day classes where you really get to see exactly what it takes to be able to do that\nNow I have to class there about three hours long your investment is going to be three hours of your time to come in and raise that financial like you to help you get better returns in the market in just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you're driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluded with your passes is going to be our professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional insider kit makes it so you can get started\nRight now ... we need you to call now and reserved those seats\nThe number is eight eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nLarry as we start to kind of continue down this path of making money in multiple directions we've got the up market we've got the down market you know what are some of the hurdles people have to overcome we touched on a few minutes ago as far as the Bush biased that we already have it\nBeing consumers maybe maybe you could take that into it into a ... expand on that ... for our listeners and even even anything else that that you work with or that you deal with when you're working with new students whether they have twenty years' experience or their brand new to the markets on how they really can structure things to make sure they're poised to profit as the markets are coming down\nGreat question right in the number one mistake that most people make when it comes to trading are investing is they try to do it on their own\nThey don't get themselves educated said no it's okay I'll do it on my own and eventually maybe I'll get around to some education\nThe problem is it's a very costly less and why would you want to spend all that time energy and money when you can learn a system and what I Love about the term system Ryan it's saving yourself stress time energy and money\nAnd so we teach our students is to trade again like banks do back in February last year Goldman Sachs had a ridiculously large winning day was ... million dollars in one day simply by shortening the markets and so I Want to use this analogy hurt me use it before\nIt's like driving a car if anyone said to you well you can go anywhere you want to go in this world right now but the car can only go in drive you can never put it in reverse\nIt'd be a pretty frustrating Dr number one you're educated enough to know that the car goes both directions well most people don't realize so did the markets you can trade when the markets are going up you can trade when the market's going down and what most people have learned\nBy coming to the academy ... becoming educated and not trying to do it on their own is if there's a simple step by step process to system regardless of how old you are your background your education level if you're somebody who's ... somebody's committed you can make money trading the markets like the banks do\nYeah and when you look at how we learn how to do anything that's really how we learn how to trade and invest as well it doesn't change just because we're in the investing world and and the thing that the thing I was stressed inside of my classes is that we focus on the skill and that was one of the things that my\nMy mentors really pushed on me about Fifteen sixteen years ago was focused on the skill and the money will come the the the issue ends up being is it's a natural tendency for us to stare at the money right out of the gate and we want to make I got to me I Want to make a hundred dollars a day we got to do that starting right now right rather than building the skills you have the skill you can generate the money but you have to have the skill first so many times\nWe tried to put the cart in front of the horse there and that's where the appropriate type of mentoring and teaching and different things like that can can can really help you know too many times we we approach the markets in ... and when I talk to people is very normal that did they say\nIf I say I I lost a question are you looking for a get rich quick program you know and and everyone always says oh no no no I'm I'm not looking at looking for that and I say well good 'cause that's not what the financial markets are this is where you really have to develop the skill to be able to go in and generate income but once you have the skill\nYou can generate the income but the skill has to come first and\nIt's the the patience of developing the skill that really determines in my opinion whether or not somebody as successful or not it's just like I I compared to flying an airplane I mean how comfortable would you be if you sat down a inside of a seven forty seven and you're about to fly from LA to New York\nAnd over the intercom you heard the pilots say well good afternoon ladies and gentlemen I just finished my Youtube video on drag versus lift we are ready to take off\nRight and that that's not going to get you there you have plenty of knowledge on on how flight actually works the mechanics behind it but as far as the skill to fly and navigate that plane of across the country that's a\nAnd that sort of the things that that that the markets allow you to do is it doesn't matter where you it doesn't matter where you go as long as you have an Internet connection and we've joked about it\nA few times Larry where back when I used to do that I wanted to go back and forth as I I was ... down in Puerto Rico and I'd have that big Eighteen the air card hanging out of the side of my laptop\nThat it was almost the same size as my laptop\nEven my satellite radio down there like it only worked from like ... and only worked for like eight am like noon because that's when the satellite was over me and so it was it was hilarious but where we are from a technology standpoint is is is light years beyond where we were you know twelve years ago Fifteen Years ago when when I was just getting started and this\nAnd it's kind of a fun it's been a fun evolution to see but for everybody who is just getting started right now it's like it's like you have no idea how good you have it I feel like when I talked to a new traders I'm like my grandfather and I'm like oh and I went to school I had to walk uphill both ways and the snow you know he had dial up Internet and now it's just in the palm of your hand\nBut we have so much access to our money that really going in and just getting a little bit of skill and getting a little bit of a little bit of knowledge can really go a long way we don't have to call up a broker and say hey you know what about this what about that it's just right at the ... of our hand identify the price and we want to pay set the order and then wait for a price really come down to you\nIt ends up being that kind of classic negotiating tactic\nYou say you know in my grandfather telling me that's when I was like five years old I remember going with him and he was buying my grandma new car and he said watch this he says I'm going to tell them the prize I'm going to pay and and as soon as he says no we're going to get up and walk away and that's really how you approach the markets you say you know what I Want to buy this these these shares a stock but I Want to buy 'em at this price and if I can for this price\nThat's okay there's lots of other stocks that I can go buy it a great price and you have to have that mentality and that is the mentality of the professional one of the things that can help you operate like a professional though is confidence\nConfidence can come from education confidence can come from building skill a great place to start that is it the half day class we've got a few tickets left before the show is over and we're going to give some away as long as Larry says okay I think it's okay\nAll right [noise] right now I've got a half day class coming up in your area they have to classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes to really live the life you want to live life on your own terms have that financial freedom but a lot of that just boils down to having the income to create that freedom\nNow just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes the one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluded with your passes it's going to be the professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons

Ga Wall Street dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nWere some of the other kind of examples you can share with our audience out there as far as times where where people have come in and they've they've got the ball rolling they've taken that initial first step and how it's gotten him to that point a financial freedom\nPlus consistency Ryan most\nPeople come in they make that commitment it's really pretty simple you know you have\nTo be willing to commit ... coach herbal beat a point in your life when you're really wanted to make a change if somebody's just kind of going from one thing to the next to the next\nYear really never going to achieve what you want to do it's all about stepping back asking yourself a simple question how's that life working for you\nIf you're not happy right now than you have to get yourself out of your comfort zone start thinking there are better ways to do things but more importantly learn from people who already doing what you want to do I have heard my whole life\nYou know going up at school that copying someone was bad well that's completely\nFalse you want to copy somebody who's doing what you want to do and who are successful so you need to be able to have mentors you need to be able to have coaches you need to be able to be somebody who really is willing to make a change\nBecause people don't change in fact on Stein once said the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome\nThis is how most people live their lives they'd rather just continue to be miserable not do anything different when there's a whole opportunity right in front of them to go out there and as you said giving up a couple of hours of your life where you can be watching TV or doing something else it's more important to invest in yourself to invest in some TV show out there\nAnd I remember seeing a as you were saying copying somebody being that the way you learn it it really is I I remember being in a in a class um you know ten Fifteen Years ago and I remember the instructor actually saying\nYou know if you want to be wealthy do what wealthy people do if you if you see somebody who is in the situation that you want to be in and if you follow them around all day long and you do the exact same things that they do eventually you will be in that same spot\nA and he brought up the the the the inverse side of that too and he said\nIf you follow somebody around who is making terrible kind of financial decision somebody who maybe it's a homeless person who's kind of lost everything and you do exactly what they do you know that's the same thing if you're copying that process you're going to end up in that situation and the same thing in the financial markets and it's one of the reasons why we teach\nOur students how they could identify what the financial institutions during one of the professionals doing what are the best people in the world\nDoing inside of these financial markets how can you identify that so that you can go in and just simply do what they do so that you can get what they got\nNow one of the ways there where we start this off one of the best way to do this has come out to a half day class invest three hours of your time she can see exactly what it takes to do that before we can do that I've only got what ten tickets left here we're at the end of the show is what that means\nAnd so one of the things is Larry can we give away these final time passed and let's\nGet some people educated haven't changed their lives\nAll right well right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area and they have to classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes to really live life on your own terms to be able to generate the income that you need to be able to do the things that you want to do\nNow in a second you're going to have a chance to win a set of pastors doing these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you're driving now is a great time to pull over include with your passes is going to be our professional insiders kit\nNow this kittens packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nLessons on topics like enhanced in your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency and much much more\nThe professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now\nColors to enter twenty when you get a call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ...

I I just ... to me when I kind of take a look at it I say look this this woman clearly had something had happened\nI I don't think that you can I don't think anybody who is listening to the testimony could think that something did not happen in her wife uh and I I'm not saying you know I I'm seeing her recollection is is probably true his recollection is true I don't know what the truth of the circumstances isn't it\nIs very hard to do you know there's the old expression why there is this ... memories fade a people die in evidence gets lost well we kinda here that one thing that was kind of surprising about the FBI investigation at least from reports\nThat I've heard is that they didn't give me some of the key players that you think they might have interviewed what what's the response to that bill\n... there's good reason why they didn't he talked for a\nCause she testified extensive was traditionally\nWhat about some of the people who would've corroborated her story\nMy understanding is they did speak to those people my understanding is that they did talk to them now the ... report is not public we can't read it to my understanding is that they did in fact\nTalk to those people and that no one could cooperate or story um so I I I don't know what much else the FBI investigation could've done except to\nPerhaps you look into did he was he was did you have an alcohol problem and I don't know that that's the purview of the FBI and I don't even know how they would do that for you know for something over Thirty years ago\nWhat what about this uh you know it seems like and this is the uh I guess part of what's going on is like the backlash against being a white guy um you know associated professor at Georgetown University secrecy fair so he did this week about the chorus I'm entitled white guys white men\nSupporting Kavanaugh's nomination despite sexual allegations of a sexual assault\nOr she said all of them deserve miserable death while feminist laugh as they take their last gas bonus we cast rate their corpses and feed them to swine yes Georgetown's president don't enjoy it\nDenounces the tweet but says university doesn't endorse or tweet yet we protect the rights of the community members to exercise their freedom of expression what do you think about what's going on at the academia\nA level of our society and how is that contributing to coarsening of the culture\n\nWhile I think the way it's contributing to the worst thinks this is playing right there aren't clear to see the first time I read the story I thought I got to give monsignor heritage and the call because ah it was a Catholic university what\nIn the ... university not a Catholic university it's actually an arrow whoa\nWhoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa oh up up up up up okay\nNot that rather than a say I'm not separating myself very what they say you're hearing Jesuit university they don't claim that they've got like ... where a Jesuit university\nUh well it's interesting because of those who aren't familiar this woman is a professor of security studies she talks foreign policy she talks about international foreign policy and as on on various commissions tweet has nothing to do with anything she talks speaks about\nAnd she has started trying to walk this back in the are speaking saying it was just\nIn a loser whoa word experiment\nShe was tall beat out there to attract cake or and then she called it a shot up through Tucker Carlson\nI'm a I\nStill don't think that okay I don't think that's how we should speak to each other I don't think that's how we should talk I don't think that it ...\nOf us culturally politically radiological you or any other kind of way by throwing out hateful horrible comments like that\nBill is this ever going to get better or is it ever going to get better\nWhen you gotta keep walking don't waste and do we my senior which keep walking and hoping that as we pass through these fires we're going to come out on the other side perhaps better I Hope\nYou know one of the things that it strikes me is you know the country lacks really an existential threat\nAnd you know maybe ... central threats kind of bring it together I think back when I was a boy you know are there was the evil empire the Soviet Union and\nThat was an ex a central threat right there was the concern of war and I remember the day after a movie about the dropping of a new place so that was a sense that the company would rally together\nAnd it seems like since there isn't some sort of existential threat and it's like we're eating our young eating our own\nIt's horrible no no it is it's like reading our own ... is in it and then and it's terrible I I\nI used to think to myself and I used to tell my kids you know it's been worse 'cause I remember I remember the mid to late sixties when a democratic convention in Chicago and things just it looked like the ... the country was about to burn down um\nBut you know what the I think I think\nWe may be entering a whole new level of ugly\n... ... you know what it says to me you know I was thinking to myself that ah that ah Christine Blasey Ford is really a symbol for how a lot of women feel that they've been treated or by men\nAnd our society and which is pretty terrible I mean it it seems pretty terrible because it seems like her experience is resonating with a lot of folks I don't\nI I that's my sense from what I Am you know in the people that I speak to that when I speak to him and they seem to identify so this says something that also needs to be addressed and decided that they that women have a field that they had been so put upon\nA by by men in society and it is something that ultimately needs a catharsis it needs to be addressed\n... I I agree and I just to take this back to just do a faith based perspective I really think that you know\nThis is something where our churches need to take a leadership role\nIn in in in and help not only Sheila ... is is it is a nation but remind us that in the eyes of God we're all we're all\nEqual we're all his creation in you know and I think if there's any time in which we need to be reminded of that if it is now in in hopefully you know there's this this is what's\nGonna happen perhaps it'd be awakening where we're where we begin to understand you know what we we're all in this together and ... my brother or my sister\nHarm's way so arms meal that's why you're on the show because uh you bring the perspective of faith\nTo listening to the news and we're always very grateful to that so thanks very much for being with us we're going to be back\nWith Jim Cavanaugh are he's gonna be talking about the Catholic cross menace crush Catholic outreach then we're going to be making the bill Donahue from the rise program and later Carlos from Catholic cemeteries as a whole crowd of people will be talking to stay with us we'll be right back\nHere counting hospital ... hair out ... something he only won ... weather as a paratrooper fifty eighty second airborne from New York City fire and then they called in general I was Patrick hung in\nThe terminal illness rabbits body this man's man yeah\nThe first one like that could not to not even an experience for just wasn't fair that he had to suffer like\n... he got he really has enormous pain and not only gave him the peace conference you also gave me and my family sounds to enjoy final smiling and laughing\nTogether one last time [noise]\nHow can we ever forget what you mean to laugh us truly how\nThis is Frank ... president the Calgary hospital where life continues coolest at seven one eight five winning two thousand thank you [noise]\nThe pieces of the financial investing in retirement puzzle continue to get more complicated feel confident that your financial future and Johnny Montgomery sky Chinese analysts and marketing strategist have the knowledge and expertise to help you understand trends and identify opportunities\nIn changing markets gold George ... seven one eight two three aid for eight zero zero for complimentary consultation and financial report or go to Jenny dot com Johnny Montgomery Scott Elsie\nFound that in Nineteen eighty five the Brooklyn veterinarian group located on new trick avenue has been serving their communities that means for over twenty five years\nDocumenting staff handle everything from the rights of heart worm please pick the vaccination x-rays route from a third\nOf seven one eight three three one seven seven Seventy five and again the number seven one eight three three one seven seven seven five pick out the website it's\nW.

Institute we've got a sense in a press here culture project generation life\nAnd we're of other things that are here that really you know insert that kind of inspiration for men and women to live out their Catholic faith so we're very blessed\nAnd it you know it's interesting there's a different flavor or different tone to the church in the northeast as opposed to other parts of the country right\nI think there's positives and negatives I think we're a\nKnow what kind of between New York in DC and Philadelphia were little frenetic a little too on the on the in the rat race here and we need to slow down probably a bit more but there is a deep there is a deep devotion that left in the face of the movie\nNow archbishop Chappelle he uh he actually has endorsed this program and has it he is deployed throughout the archdiocese of Philadelphia\nHe certainly has encouraged that yeah we had a wonderful meeting Chris Copeland I had a private meeting with the ship\nAnd ah this is funny he understands how church politics work inside of you said you know you found a way to work around me and the ... structures well done [laughter] you know he saw that really something like rise to the hearts of men can't just be a program or something and it down as as good as a lot of those things can be\nRealize this has to touch the hearts straight away a rise has been passing on man's man for the most part but are supposed to give a glowing review he's really been pushing it for us as well as other people in the church so it's really a grassroots movement\nYeah you know and then the collaborative movement I mean Christopher product myself in the ... Institute two filmmakers from the bottom project of a couple of years ago at the Vatican cardinals studios we really want it to be bigger than just one group and bigger than a program\nIt's it's really cool to be this grassroots a kind of um ground up kind of a thing for men and that's what we want to half Irish like that individual men walking together in these small groups rising up start being that live in in life to the parish in the church\nAnd how many how many minutes signed up for this program right now\nWe have a over ten thousand men from across the country and across the world over a hundred different countries it's really blown away we didn't put a lot of marketing really just so called to do it by God so men from Nineteen eighty eight years old married single divorced celibate priests are religious\nAll kinds of men are taking the challenge and on the online platform you can comment and reply for each of the daily videos and they're built each other up Krista phonics said this is what the Internet should have been\nKind of controversies that when uh people who are sort of notorious or getting buried how does the cemeteries handle those questions\nYou know I Believe it or not do ... get that question a lot look we we were Catholic cemeteries and we believe that you know after we pass you know our our lord and savior is going to judge us we're not here to judge anybody\nWill take you know everyone agreed to same a ... and you know we're not going to have make those decisions at that time that's where a higher power to decide how hard part of the lord\nOr tell us why is it important in your view that people like these guys are young they're they're filming ... why would they want to start to plan for a cemetery\nBelieve it or not as we all know death is unexpected and uh we do get a lot of young people coming in who maybe do not have older ah uncles aunts and they think that and they have no idea what to do\nNo one's ever discussed it with them because they think that's not going to hit us but sometimes illness comes upon us and they don't know what to do so that's why we're there to assist you if you decide to plan ahead you don't have to purchase just maybe just get the information ahead of time\nRight and if you think about it with the cost of a grave what's about the cost of a four person grave\nWell usually are are grades are really for three for three tournaments um and then it all depends in Queens it's a little more because of the availability so it starts at around six thousand dollars and if you want to go out to Long Island with the St Charles we have more options available for different budget so we started a thousand Seventy\nFive and you were very if somebody has no money they can get buried at cemeteries too\nThat's correct what they do is at your funeral home or call us directly if a person is indigent or just does not have the funds to that will do everything available to try to assist them help them find an eagle\nIf I'd barrel got his ... and white for Catholics is it's so important to treat the body with such reference after it passes\nWell you know if if you're if you're raising the Catholic faith obviously you want to continue that faith you know throughout throughout your whole life as far as all the Sacramento and you know the last thing you know we we try to uh get the information out there through Paris and so forth that you know you want to be in turn the Catholic cemetery to continue your faith in through the end\nAnd uh it's sacred ground you know ... whatever that means why is that important well think about if you follow\nMe I should I not go you know I got a beautiful spot Greenwood cemetery why not go to Greenwood cemetery why am I going to why am I going to a Catholic cemetery\nBecause Greenwood cemetery is as good as they are you know it's based they're open to all all faith we concentrate on our beliefs are are um daily masses basically intense as we think of your loved when we say praise for your loved ones it's a matter of fact we have two great to\nA really large steel masses one Memorial Day one for all souls they would just coming up from the second ... and we are we always remember we say you know basically the scriptures that we used to and we remember of your loved ones\nAll the time and that's basically what we concentrate on our Catholic faith in a Catholic cemetery is\nA when a person gets a grave now how do I they know that their loved one is the graves going to be taking care of well after they pass what\nWill happen just part of the price um that we give you a for instance like I mentioned to you before a if it's six thousand dollars would say for a grave part of that um we put aside as in doubt care which we used to know what's the little care yeah correct so now it's all included in the price we're not separate anything and not just put aside and another account and that we used\nTo take away but I guarantee you that the money is going to be there to make sure that the grave is kept up that ... well after a person is gone that's correct and that's that applies to a grave or a crypt or and it was the\nFirst person interred in a cemetery owned by St John cemetery corporate\nWild now you're really a ... and I don't you yes you did ours right in your face some you know and I was ready for it but I did not ready to vote on a long time ago okay All right All right and you have cemeteries\nAlso adds a transformation Paris don't you're not transferable transportation and Williamsburg isn't there a cemetery and transformation St James a cathedral has a cemetery plot\nThose are passed Paris or act which they're not going to be part of us but we do is we have um agreements or whether we kind of take care of it for them so everything has kept up\nAll right let my my mother and I have big fights because my mother says to me she wants to get cremated I tell her listen you're not going to have anything to say about it when you go so you're going in the ground she insists that she wants to be cremated let's talk a little bit about Catholic theology and what is related to cremation and that sort of thing\nSure well as we all know commission is on the rise and it's it's been rising were almost\nFifty percent in New York as far as you know the people that we see and uh as long you know we try to educate people that you know whatever their their desires at the end that's their choice and we will treat that body\nJust like if it wasn't a casket just if it wasn't a grave we're going to treat it were reference you know we we people will have the this misconception that's ashes was not as as the cremated remains\nAnd its ... weren't too because you know with the one thing that I experience is especially with younger people right so they basically say this is the cheaper option we're gonna get somebody cremated\nAnd then they end up putting you know their mother on the mantel and that's great mom's on the mantel she's always in the house but then all of a sudden you know the the the child dies and now the grandchildren they don't even they don't have the same desires single canola an Asian or ... or the person all of a sudden there were cremated remains end up in the garbage\nAnd another thing so it's important that if a Catholic does get cremated and they are permitted to get cremated one thing is is that the remains are not to be scattered they should be dealt with in a river why\nOne of the things that you and we encourage that they be entered in a niche or something like\nThat on Catholic ... grounds that is true and you know I I think if if you part time job believe me to do my job for him and I love it but I Do I get I Want to get it makes you might want to take All right\nSo let's talk about that promotion 'cause I mean it's kinda odd to think that there are cemetery promotions so uh make sure you buy your grave now when if you do what do you get you get obese or there's a visa to promote\nDepending on the amount of the type of of a grave or quit their niche that you purchase um the different options we will provide up to between two hundred dollar and up to five hundred dollar visa card for you know that's really more incentive\nTo get the word out there somebody's been procrastinating whether it be niches are are graves you know and they want to do something about what was it a little more incentive and you can come in ... ... it's not a hard sell or anything like that you know we we specialize in what to say the Catholic cemetery is a Brooklyn diocese\nYou come in and we treat you from beginning to end we hold your hand we to give you a nice tour all around will offer you coffee whatever you'd like to do and at the end you don't want to buy that's fine but we feel good that we gave you the information necessary I\nCalled is one of the things that's really a ... and I know in my own personal experience and I haven't given a little bit of a it's hard to talk about cemeteries and so I Hope I was being a reference I wanted to\nKind of keep it a little little white but really use the work that you do is incredible work and it's a real ministry and I've seen how you and the folks at Catholic cemeteries have really attended the people in very very difficult circumstances\nOr whether it's less of a child loss of a parent loss of a spouse loss of a sibling or and I just want to commend you for that work so thanks for being with us here in the arena\nThank you very much in it and I appreciate those kind words if you're into it takes you know everyone everyone that's every working together you know whether it's my bosses or everybody else you know they're the field or a staff an office that they do a wonderful job and I'd like to give them all the credit like thank you very much thank you and if you don't mind I just want to mention as far as a child\nA we have special areas just for children\nUm and they're very inexpensive very affordable and everything's included the opening charge\nThe the memorial on it so if God Forbid something like that happens you know he's reached out\nTo a thanks thanks Carlos now as you are we wanted to kind of turn things a little bit Robert that we have a little music here\nI Am so glad we have this well you\n...\nOver the years it's been a pleasure to bring you every Sunday evening on TV and during the J uh on the radio W our radio we've had the chance to talk to authors filmmakers inspiring stories of reporters are people who kind of talking about the good and bad the ugly trying to understand a new these news issues from me a Catholic\nPerspective a faith perspective and but\nImproved all good things have to come to an end\nAnd our shows coming to an end to and so at the end of October October twenty eighth the last show for in the arena\nWe want to let you will know that you remain in our thoughts and our prayers and hope to see you soon so you can always follow me on Twitter ... or you can get in touch with the flu St Joseph ... or just to let you know that you and your loved ones are all\nIn my prayers mean word hold you will in the palm of his hands\nThe proceeding was paid programming W O Lars airing of this program constitutes neither an endorsement of the products offered for the ideas expressed to sell you are when you ask ... eight detail in New York young people everywhere are making a difference\nIn fact has has helped a\nMy friends I made I have\nThat way of doing it for a very high\nPressure on me I don't\nWant to do Fox they rated number one seven\nKnow a company as a CPA it\nWhen I finally realized that was that if if my strategy for my clients was going to work it had failed\nSo in other words you know I I went my whole life or helping people just for their income taxes\nSo that they wouldn't have to pay their taxes today but failed to realize the burden of those taxes in the future at a uncertain date to be taxed at some uncertain rate\nNow the assumption is is that we're going to be at a lower tax bracket when we retire\nBut if we're going to be in a lower tax bracket following the advice of differing your income that means you're going to have to live on less income\nToday after you retire than what it was costing you to live the day before you retired which means a financial planner and a half to fail because I'd have less money to live on\nAnd that was that was that was striking I mean I just tell him more now legal and oh my gosh my clients have to fail my plan is going to work for them\n[noise] so if you have a four O. one K. for fifty seven four oh three B or IRA\nYear plan a repeat that for our listeners your plan has to fail if it works out or your if your plan worked out it's failing to watch that a little bit more as people I mean everybody has a four one K. R. IRA and they might find this a little bit you know alarming so\nOkay so Josh ... the ... the day\nFor you retire you're going to have a certain lifestyle correct sure the day after you retire you want the same lifestyle yes or I Want to better lifestyle well\nForget about the better lifestyle if you want the same lifestyle that means you have to have the same income\nYeah the day before you retire as the day after you retire now if your CPA is pushing you down the trail of the belief that you're going to be in a lower tax bracket when you're retired that means you're going to have less money to spend\nThe only way he can be right is if he's wrong ...\nAs he's getting your plan is going to fail because of failed plan means you can't live the lifestyle you want just she just said you wanted better lifestyle yeah you guys in my profession are leading people to an end in in every human resource department across the nation are leading people down a path to failure\nMhm [noise] now that because 'cause they're not going to have as much money to live on based on their premise ...\nThat you're going to be in a lower tax bracket the only way that can happen according to a four O. one K. plan is that you ... you're you're you're living on less well that's not the same lifestyle\nSo to flush out let's say somebody has a million dollars saved in their IRA\nDid good they are you know they they they were a good boy or girl in school they worked hard for Thirty years and they have a million dollars saved for retirement age if they pull money out of that IRA they have to pay taxes on it\nRight so that money let's say they're following conventional wisdom which is the four percent rule they're going to pull forty grand a year out of ... million dollars are going to pay taxes on it and they're only going to net thirty grand a year\nIs that kind of getting out here now I Know what you're going to cause I'm In the business we we've we've talked many times before but I'm just saying I I think we as maybe unconventional financial planners we can get it\nQuicker than the clients sometimes do because we've been hearing this stuff for ten Fifteen Twenty years\nAnd you've been a pioneer in the field\nAnd I grew up in the field because I was trained by people like you since I was you know Twenty one twenty two in the business so I never learned the bad habits that you had to unlearn but I think in [noise] sometimes you need to almost a on learn some of these things because right\n... ... when people listen to show and I said well Josh I did the Ross I did that insurance I I read position money from taxable to tax free and then I had a tax bill and am I counting while you're doing this and and then they for gets\nUh the whole strategy so I Do want to talk a little bit about that and kind of repositioning to tax free and some of the problem is that one might incur upon that path namely their account and may not understand right [laughter] right be that might be the bigger problem\nBut that was the question with the million dollar irate that that you take four percent out that means if that's all you've got\nThat mean you worked your your your your compensation the day before he retired was only forty thousand dollars if you're going to have the same lifestyle now if your compensation the day before you retired was sixty\nAnd you can only take forty thousand out of your IRA because otherwise you're going to run out of money before you run out of life Mm well that's a failed\nPlan the CPA legit towards a failed plan\nYeah you might have ... million dollars and I ... and Josh I'm not even talking about the taxes on that yet seen we as a nation we don't save enough for retirement even billion dollars is going to support a forty thousand dollar compensation the day before you retire\nAt ... you know you can throw Social Security on top of that that's great but the forty thousand dollars that you take out of the IRA is going to cause your Social Security taxes that's a double taxation is you're not even going to get all the Social Security that you think you're going to get\n[noise] wow\nWell we'll talk more about Social Security double taxation and the new book confessions of a CPA the capital equivalent value of life insurance\nOr going to talk about life insurance answer any of your life insurance questions also any of your tax questions as it relates to your four one K.

the issue here so\nWe'll go to\nA state and tax experts weighing in on the trip for report but first we have on your own with Josh Joe Lenski the financial quarterback guy Bob\nThe morning Josh Josh I'm very quick question the question is self employed and he makes over under a hundred thousand and uh I'm just trying to understand this twenty percent Dutch and do you have to put money into something in order to get to the doctor do you can just take twenty percent\nAssuming you're qualified for all the requirements\nWhat you're referring to is the twenty percent Trump tax write off if you're a small business owner which is great except they need to make it available for all small businesses even those of us in finance and medicine that's what I'd be lobbying them for however don't\nHold your or if he is not in one of those ... professional service types of industries like medicine or finance\nOr religious or measuring is in there it's religious\nBut he's it's a self employed individuals so he ... fine to take twenty percent off of his duties so let's say he makes\nA hundred grand as a rabbi\nOr heat and it's a self employed thing I mean I don't know if it'd be really self employed by your\nShow but anyway I you know I don't know whatever he does as a self employed religious individual if you take a hundred grand he gets a twenty percent right off of that hundred he only pays taxes on eighty grand not a hundred\nThen you get the priest standard deduction uh that's twenty four grand if he's married and fifty in over\nA twelve grand if he's not married\nIs he married to religious ... married no to religious organization\nOkay so he is not married so he would get the single deduction which is twelve thousand\nHe'd get the eighty percent right off which is about twenty you'd only pay taxes on about sixty eight thousand dollars now as a religious institution he could set up a four one K. and a four three be yet another twenty four thousand dollar right off okay\nSo he could pay taxes on essentially instead of a hundred grand if he made a hundred grand and the ... he can pay taxes on forty four rent this is where the Trump tax one's

previous ...\nMeaning it didn't make as much sense to divert because you get all these other right off and they don't get as many write offs and the rate is lower does that make sense so she\nJust confirmed at one point that you do not have to fund to get that basic twenty percent\nNo you don't have to fund but you should fund because the to use the hundred Grand Isle of ... right\nIf he makes ... self employed individual under the new tax wrote he's only going to pay taxes on eighty okay\nIf he if he merges this with a retirement plan he may only play attacks on forty four grand if he does
