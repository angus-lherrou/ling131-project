successfully launched from Kennedy Airport there can be I should say and on the state Nineteen Seventy five Saturday Night live premiered on NBC that\nThere was silence for a few seconds and I believe I I'd have\nTo look at the actual transcript or listen to it again but I think mission control says something like\n... and there's a malfunction yet just very matter of fact and I said oh my God\nI Believe they called it an anomaly yes yeah there yeah yeah your job actually 'cause I I\nI was broadcasting and don't you remember the ... ... ... and the pilot wasn't his uh his last words was I'm like go with ... ... and you also worried there seems to be able to see on the radio and it's just\nThere's an anomaly his homeland anomaly God and I have read that that you know the cockpit broke free yes and they they they were alive today were alive when they were headed back in Philly\nThing too I think and I'm always they they apparently um and I think in the case of course McAuliffe they had a personal recording device so they were sort of describing what was happening to them obviously when the the launch occurred syllables recording devices would have still been my best the home\nAnd I think that some of them there was evidence that one of them turned on the special oxygen they head and turned on someone else's oxygen so they were definitely alive\nSo when you say we learning the vices with their recording audio here are a lot of weird theories about what they said in the audio no one's ever heard that on a A R although the archive deep away somewhere it's never been really never been ... they were all sorts of theories about what they said in their arms of you know report cetera unfounded about him brain you know all that but we don't really think about that well we do know that they were alive\nIf you're just tuning in and wonder what we're talking about about four forty this morning our time and American astronaut anti Russian cosmonauts blasted off from Kazakhstan there was a booster failure\nThey had to make an emergency landing back in Kazakhstan and apparently they're safe they've been in contact with them they haven't reached the scene yet but they came crashing back there's actually video which startled me from Reuters\nOf of the a parachute and the and the and the [noise] you know\nAre actually bags are not ... that's the way they land in Ohio every single time you know that that is but mine is yes ... and Apollo they used to have those gentle landings in the ocean ocean float down you know the cap sold him with Russians do not they land on land why do I\nI guess I don't know that's the rate of the union for them I don't know I saw him\nI don't want to land the land I Want to go into the water ... those two guys may\nBe okay but that's got a shaky up and went on to the the thing is built to do that anyway so the video startling and apparently these guys are okay we'll have more in the morning I was on but if you just happen to be too and again that's what were you asking about ... you have the hurricane that now\nA ... and the CNN for one now I wasn't doing a lot of flipping I just had it on his back round there were like nonstop wall to wall of all their correspondence getting rain down in the wind blowing away I'm not sure all the networks did that but uh uh do you watch some of the coverage\nI did that hurricane went through really quickly though yeah it's All right down to a tropical storm now now that well known that we've been downgraded to a drop out but it went through Georgia as a category three right right but if it through which I guess I mean\nWho wants to hurricane slower fast fast when apparently is better than the slow one because those hang in there and drop all that water but they still have flooding and lots of damage and I believe the only only two people to too many are are dead but it could've been a lot worse well I have a feeling\nThat number may I think so I'll probably go there were fifty percent of the people didn't evaluate the the a lot didn't evacuate there was a lot of destruction I mean there's the houses have been destroyed\nI Can't imagine what happened on a barrier island we will be checking in a little bit later on in fact at the at the top of the seven o'clock hour peak combs remember we had him on from Panama City beach one of those barrier islands I'm\nCurious what happened there people will give us the lowdown but I'll bet you are the homes were destroyed powers out so I you know you fear that there's more than more than one or more than two who have died now\nI'm getting a little tired of the grandstanding from the reporters do who loved to show that they're tough guys by standing out there in the rain ... the wind blowing them and they're holding onto the guys do so\nMuch just a little too much yesterday because it really was just wind and rain at one point they couldn't show\nThey all want their Anderson Cooper moment

years ago I was ... and my niece and nephew my sister lives in the department from where the grandparents have read they built a house the grandfather passed away in the house\nUm so I Would watch it down and out of the corner of my eyes from the living room I could see like the door and kind of like a shadowy thing but I Know I wasn't afraid I was in freaked out I was just kind of like I\nBlowing power poles down with such forced that the poll added inverted than this one case in the ground with such force that it\nReally hit blew out of water line uh uh and the sound guys the sound was like nothing you'll ever ever hear again and it was this low\nBail full mourn the kind of sound that just you know makes you think haunted house and raises hackles on the back of your neck it was amazing\n... ... ah what FEMA up to what do they look like they're prepared for this beat\nYou don't have a free place to a lot of assets around here and the first order of business for FEMA and for local emergency responders will be to find out if anybody needs to be rescued as I mentioned you've got a lot of trees down into houses here and that's going to be a priority also\nPeople uh I don't think high water rescues will be a major issue here with a storm surge is is come and gone uh the flash flooding will just one of those tax so fast that there really isn't a lot of flooding in this area I mean even last night there was a great sense that in the payment was dry that was amazing I've never seen that after hurricane so I think\nFinding people who need help getting out of homes that have been demolished by the storm by trees falling and that kind of thing that'll be the priority today\nMe you told us yesterday that you thought maybe fifty percent of the people were staying and sheltering in place and this is kind of I guess makes it okay for instance the came through and they seem to be okay I guess in future storms people aren't going to heed the idea to evacuate I think that that may be a problem\nYou know I asked about that to a couple of people that actually several people who stayed and you know every one of them said to me I never doing this again\nI mean they were just devastated the the the shock of writing that storm out I mean the the four hours roughly of of this incredible when storm and and the rain no it left them are really really shaken and I think a lot of the people who did ride the storm at will be the first to leave the next time a storm it well\nThe storms not finished yet and it looks like the Carolinas are going to be hit with a lot of rain Pete\nYeah that could it get it again it's up to eight more inches of rain they really just don't need because ah you've heard the Cape Fear River and some of the other rivers there have just started to subside from flood stage and now it looks like there might be more flooding before this was all over\nThe before Iran I Know you're located in the Panama City Beach Florida you described it as as a barrier islands so I counted up\nThis thought that it was just going to be wiped out black and you give us some idea of what actually happened to this island\nYeah you know this was a resort islands or front Pedro there are a lot of really big condo buildings a lot of big a resort hotels that was damaged or at the holiday inn express resort and sweets uh the big canopy this huge canopy that overhang is that Dr Andrew drive it\nIt collapsed and crushed a number of cars thank God nobody was in there um I've seen a lot of street damage of power poles lying in the road it's going to be a big cleanup effort uh but I I got to tell you the damage here ironically was\nNot as bad as it was back on the mainland I can explain that that's just not the norm but that's the case of this in the store\n... alright ... comes down in Panama City Beach Florida Pete thanks for your time that guys\nAnd wow I just the the idea of a of a power pole and burning and the crashing into the ground breaking up a water main I mean that's crazy\nAnd then his description of the sound of the hurricane is like a low\nBail full moon ... all I think I said it was almost like a haunted house well this is a Tallahassee mayor\nAndrew Gillum now uh you have your doubts about putting him on the air\nIs that what you were saying yes yeah I ... you know listening to the governor's job here it's not the

should but it's okay to get rid of the ... bucks\nBut I was just curious 'cause I've never done cocaine in my life but as soon as I put her right to my mouse that literally mountains ... yeah it shows

got so many people say I wish you were running I'd be at their voting you know I'm not going to do it now because you're not running I should give me a favor do it just go out and that's what I'm telling my rallies go out and vote because historically whoever wins the presidency is you know better than anybody they don't do well in terms\nI think is is there for the economy is the best it's ever been ever\nThat would be an amazing no other way because that is true obviously the the guy in office always falls in the midterms that his party\nBut well don't forget the possible Kavanaugh backlash that some people think that the Kavanaugh was smeared railroaded and that has energized from space to get out there and keep the Democrats from getting power because once they get into power we know they're going to use all their subpoena power the tide is president up in scandal after scandal\nBut on the flipside many think that the Kavanaugh got off and away with something maybe that energized some Democrats so I don't know which way it's going to\nColumbus sticking his tongue out I mean when I was an issue where you where you are Shea you're rolling your eyes Emmys thinking you know I was\nOn it just happened to notice this thought his wife is a going to be on ABC with Tom ... that would be tomorrow night at ten o'clock and I do\nUh what happened is ABC is put out a couple of of soundbites for millennia and uh you know you know her ... campaign is the best and and it's about bullying at all and and she had this thought about the herself being bullied\nI could say I'm the most ... percent on the world usage you the most boring person one of them if you didn't have the right people saying about ...\n... says she's noticing no about social media yes but I taught at a time I've ever seen her react in that kind of way she usually just turns the other cheek yeah\nYeah well I mean they've been pretty brutal to about her on social media I think but I Am the whole I think she's probably popular\nDon't you think she's very popular so Thomas during the interview set end this interview was done during her African trip you said has a Donald Trump had people working there that you just didn't trust so that\nI'm a row so hello yeah let's see what the Milan is that about that he's been in office now almost two years\nHas he had people that you didn't trust\nWorking for him yeah did you let him know\nAnd what did he do that some people they don't learn\nAnd ... you know there is a lawyer a darn youngest has got to say who name the name but you know yeah I'll tell us All right and then I'm a okay the\nQuestion is is you'll hear the you're the one with the most control over the guy the one who has the most control over Donald Trump is Milan you one hundred percent is that true at least [laughter]\nI ...\nMy honest advice on on the norm [noise] um bad ... bad because I Want to\nI think that's probably true with everybody I think by very dry ... true with every what that is absolutely true and you know what nine times out of ten has got his right [noise] speaking of first ladies oh she'll Obama was on the today show how do we have to listen to this why do you roll your eyes to uh know barely\nShe's uh she's just launched the global girls alliance and so this is the girls'\nDay and uh she uh appearance on NBC's Today show\nThat show is that when you agitate a girl you educate a family or community country it makes no sense that they that this strain of\nGirls and women are not getting educated if they're not\nMm white propaganda really on the exit village oh you want to hear this one girl was funnier is funny\nWell so far like every one of them I just hope they stay healthy is the Democrats are who may run for office that goes to the\nEnd I Hope they fight it out and any one of them I like I just hope that we don't get any star or good thinker coming out of nowhere because she everyone that's talking about it do you look at Booker\nYou look at five and I mean how about Elizabeth Warren she fake your heritage for years and years that you can't prove anything she said their mother told her she had high cheekbones therefore she's got\nIndian blood you know what I have more in the blood in me than she does and I have not\nCome on you got to admit Trump as far as interview subjects go is is the best out\nOf it was funny okay just sell briefly the key to a successful marriage will ever believe this one\nIt was like Popeye the sailor his book was house of males or a memoir of life uh and and you know he's talking about\nYou learn from your experiences ... ... lives in trouble again so anyway this this other story just as Robert this is the land I'm likely\nDisturbing story could but yet but we'll see how you interpret it land so I'm black a guy an African American his name is Corrie Louis He's babysitting too white kids a woman sees him with the white kids\nShe thinks it looks ring she calls the police\nCalled nine one one on this guy then the police to verify that the guy really was the babysitter they called the kids' parents the mother took the call and she was starting to get this call she said yeah the guys the guys are babysitter now you immediately think well that's just the woman's being racist she said black guy to white kids and she says this is suspicious\nGonna call nine one one button ... has a different point of view was a great point\nWell I think there's definitely a leather deliberate living in New York you are but I think on the other side there are six of them because if it with an African American woman driving the car\nThey raise it could be the babysitter that'd be the nanny problem yeah yeah going and you went to I used to eat all the time women who are are babysitters they're walking down the street I've never seen anybody call the cops on them yeah but if it were the guy could be different well this is this is Corey Lewis\nAnd two kids and the vaccine that do not look like this lady herself she's on my plate now call the police\nYeah he he did this on Facebook or he was actually taping what happened is lady drove by asked him a question like what are you doing is everything okay and he said yeah and apparently she turned around and then followed him and went back to the house and then called the ... so she was on his case the whole time and this is the mom Dana mango\nThere's an African American male driving my two white can that he was stopped and pulled over by the time and not exactly what I'm saying\nWell well the woman the woman who pulled up and she said is everything All right there you said yeah why wouldn't it be and she said things look weird and then she followed him home when they fall where where\nThe kids you know screaming crying trying to get out of the car we\nLack man with two white kids things look we're that was raised and sex yet I think we conclude\nSo they're ... well I think you make a fair point but clearly it was a baby sitting while black was the the advance I mean that's just unbelievable so Joe Bartlett joins us with the news or\nJoe I don't know if you heard we played that interview with ... which I thought
