Would say this I suppose we you know I'll I'll tell you I Am actually a ... I have a serious point to make here uh-huh I go to a stop laughing at me you know here's this theory that one either young attractive woman stuck out there in New Jersey [laughter]\n\nThat\nAdult enough\nI'm sure that dating pool there oh there's no grey now by rose to the guys you got to meet her age are probably married now and want to have an affair with her\nSo and the dates are probably bad I mean one morning I but it's a New Jersey okay or these companies in the mix here well he does that but [laughter] so\nShe's just she's bonding with the student that teacher student bond is very deep you're just thinking oh holy deeper he just thinks this kid is kinda cute and he is more interesting and more fun\nThan a lot of those New Jersey guys that the meat at some bar somewhere there probably married or have a girlfriend\nAnd she meets the young attractive guy in off she goes I can understand it from the teacher's perspective [laughter]\nDo you need to go to Kay well there you don't pay with that I Know not okay with it all the ask because parents however\nMaybe I should go out to New Jersey and a gun Perry teacher meetings because that might do pretty well [laughter] it's called the teacher convention in Denver and landing city oh we are yeah forget Alice ... said Michael real out there\nAre we going to post this one's picture up to on the Web or it's just oh come on now what are your ...\nShe's cute I I'm not commenting on anything that any more [laughter] I just bought a\nNew Jersey this hotdog shop in Danville got in trouble because it's called ...\n[laughter] grab\nYour is here on the highways were T shirts ... here\nAnd there's an arrow pointing down but the arrows pointing out the fine print of the website and oh by the end it says grab your wings with an arrow pointing south [laughter]\nActually praised her in his a press statement yesterday Congress you know a strong voice for human rights in the world stage\nOr on what kind of front again ABC News correspondent the state department I you know I haven't heard anything negative about her at all but you know there's this this story did drift out yesterday that there was some question about her use of a private planes as that is that a big issue or is that it's just a a noise\nI think it's a little bit of noise ... I think you know it was a ... office of government ethics filing report very standard for any um government officials to have to reveal some of their finances any gifts that they've received\nAnd she had gotten these flights but she has listed all them she done everything sort of by the book\nFile all the proper paperwork bull is more interesting to me in those reports with the amount of credit card debt the the mortgages that she has\nThe fact that she's actually kind of strapped for cash which can give you an idea of why someone would want to leave government service after about a decade of it to make some more money\nYou know selling books or speaking on the on the speaker circuit or she also has to younger kids I think they're both in their teens are so she's got to make some money put them through college and everything like that\nAnd I kind of kept her sort of give us some insight into her relationship with Trump because you know Trump has had some\nRather complex relationships with other people around him and they have not turned out so well but she's going out in a classy way and he really seems to respect or how does she handle this guy that most people have no idea how to handle\nIt you know it's a great question and I think more than any other cabinet official she has done it so that she has managed to separate herself from him on certain issues right at the United nations she talks and very tough on Russia in a way that the president\nIs reluctant to do to put it a nicely she's also\nGotten out of her way to speak up for human rights something that the president is also pretty quiet on in general but there's never been that gap if you remember the former secretary of state Rex Tillerson\nWhenever he would say anything it seemed like Trump would contradict him on North Korea on her were off on climate change and that's why Trump at the end of the day fired him just because there was this very public Gulf between the two of them that needed a very admitted made it very apparent to\nTo you know foreign dignitaries around the world who would meet with Tillerson that he didn't speak for the president Nikki Haley though I think because as you said she has that charm she's she's a politician\nAnd at the end of day I think the president knew that she didn't need and she didn't need\nThis job but she was so effective for him because she was that strong voice because uh you know she she was a woman in a cabinet where they were very few women\nUm and and she could then you know be given that leeway to a gym thing she wanted I think it also helps or frankly that she was in New York and Washington DC ... that sort of caught up in all the chaos of the the day to day down here at the White House\nAll right who replaces Nikki Haley or she's going to sustain a job in up a couple of months then who do you think Trump picks\nBook classic Trump fashion and he said last night that he has a shortlist the five people that he will not tell us who the five people are except for one person I think that's important the leading candidate I Would say at this point is Dina Powell\nNow works in New York at Goldman Sachs she spent about a year in the Trump Administration has the deputy national security advisor so she's got the you know the relationships\nAre with some of the Trump family if bunker and Jared in particular um she's also close with Nikki Haley interestingly she uh Nikki Haley posted a photo of the two of them over the weekend at South Carolina\nYour husband's done a boat and sort of you know reading the tea leaves over Twitter feed yesterday it seemed like that was a tacit endorsement of how as her successor and and the president has said Nikki Haley will be involved\nIn that process the only thing that's going in and out two things I should say liberal one does she want the job you know she left after a year a mainly because she was sort of burned out by a chaotic the White House and then the second question is you know does the law or\nA nationalist Steve Bannon wing of the White House\nMy challenge this call they\nThey're jumping around there's all the way we got we got to go look at the replay [laughter] okay that's okay go jumping again so the replay was right it was by an eyelash she was out at first and the season that was the call and we think W E ally for the for the radio a call and does so now\nIt's Boston that gets used in which truly are the two best teams in the American leagues rest that could be a hell of a seven game series I think the law for the Yankees the season was the pitching\nI guess you listen to while you're up for it and I said the starting pitching was going to be a question mark and that's really kind of\nDid them in hit it on the head Michel ... now that the ... was weak and you know without you support everything he said he's a he's a great baseball analyst more I was I felt really are [laughter]\nOr the pitch and putt added to right
