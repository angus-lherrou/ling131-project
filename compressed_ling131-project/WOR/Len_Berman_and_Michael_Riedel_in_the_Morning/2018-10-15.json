Native American heritage and her family tree take that you cooks on the right\nAll right so she really is polka hot at all but a few hundred low and the weekend oh this is pretty funny how much what super strong evidence that do you do notice\nThe Stanford professor found that the vast majority of warrants heritage is European but that an ancestor born in the late Seventeen hundreds was partially Native American\nSo All right so she's really ... what's the problem is that what percentage does have you may even have some Native American so I don't think that counts as a percentage at all no\nIt does it of course it does it so I think it's kinda funny\nWell listen I'm all for her running because Trump will clean water we had been there is no way she's going to be able to be President Trump

seem to know anything and you're trying to destroy a life of a man who has been extraordinary if\nThey did make if he didn't make that mocking speech they lost but at that point everybody was very gentle with her and then only started today there's nothing to do it yeah that's right you can't prove it and then the tide turned yep so you're okay with that that he mocked her it's easy or a model

I Believe they were the objects be allowed to touch her stomach to see if they can feel the baby moving in there\n[laughter] I think the picture would be just about every paper around the world\nThat baby sick this all these appearances down there hey listen ah have the betting parlors started boy girl names all that kind of stuff which I'm never going to do\nKnow you know this has just broken in the past couple of hours but you know the the ... the ...\nThe ... will take money on just about anything so I'm sticking with the one I always stick with I get a good long shot on ... so we'll see what happens\nTo you hey Thomas the sense that I'm Megan in Harry might up stage William and Kate that mean they're kind of a more attractive couple of with a little more life to them than a William and Kate\nYeah you know they're going to get the freedom to do whatever they want to do which is which is great so they can get you know you know an arm and a leg of the out of the gilded golden cage that ah really William and Kate cannot do oh so they got to follow the political and they got to do everything right\nAnd ah and Meghan and Harry can you know let their hair down down the road a so you know they're in a much more enviable position and I remember when uh when George and in Charlotte were born knocking Harry down DOMA\nThe tree as far as the lineage to the throne and he was he probably the happiest guy in the u._k.\n[laughter] because you\nKnow he wants to get away from the ages look that's great you know to jump in front of a line that that that's that would be you know very good for him\nSo the news broke a couple of hours ago Megan Marco is expecting in the spring now that the tabloids immediately go with the huge front page headlines all over a London\nThey will do the evening standard will be hitting the the the street ... as we speak of so that'll be oh I'm sure that is the front page but it's interesting it was broken by Kensington Palace here in London\nAnd uh area and and uh Megan just arrived in Sydney so they're on the other side of the world and in fact our crew along and the trip was briefed as like a ten minute briefing saying exactly what you would expect that uh Harry and Meghan are\nOver the moon and looking forward to the birth of their of their first born et cetera et cetera\nBy the way it's just one of the thought you were talking about the president's interview on sixty minutes last night when he stopped a Leslie stall\nI'm president\nWell you know they remind me of what you mentioned SNL\nChevy Chase and you're not ... remember that that's I think that's where he got it from Chevy Chase the president and you're a die I thought he handled himself well in the interview well ... ...\n... what I found interesting yes no matter what came up the climate change he said well yeah it could be a ... I don't know well it could change I mean he's got like he's got every answer on both sides and he'd just slumps through them I mean the thing about Dr forward I mean this is this got me a little bit\nAnd I made that speech we would not have one that I was just saying she didn't seem to know anything and you're trying to destroy a life of a man who has been extraordinary\nSo she's saying what he's saying since if he didn't mock Dr Ford yes they wouldn't have one which means the end justifies the means no\nHe had to do something and he did it quite brilliantly to underline the ambivalence the ... in her testimony she couldn't remember where she couldn't remember when upstairs downstairs all he did was repeat\nHer inability to be specific about Wendy alleged incident between her and cabinet happened\nNo one was really tough with her knowing what I thought you know did to say hey wait a minute wait a second he had the courage to do exactly\nAnd rebel Republicans they were so scared they got that idiot woman who did a terrible are out\nBy the way you can do you can't you can't deny your guy the Supreme Court and that kind of an allegation\nI understand what you're saying but you do understand that psychiatrists will tell you the people who have undergone traumas do have blanks in their memory especially with us from so many years ago so that is entirely possible well no I didn't ... minutes\nThere's no end of his ... so that by the way I to quote from we won so get over it I think you're making a\nLot of the Milwaukee are brought\nUp this evidence thing too and I and I just have to say that the [noise]\nThere may not be you know ... was there evidence on all The Cosby things\nI mean what are they related clearly there wasn't enough evidence and well but will deliver the you know there was a lot of here say and he said and she said and they believed\nHer story and the others who came forward but when you're talking about evidence where's the evidence I'm not sure that evidence exists on most of the ... you're just going to convict him because the allegation is made I didn't say that but just don't dismiss it out of hand either by saying well where's the evidence\nThat that doesn't work either justice cabin on its over it is over the Republicans won the Dems last ah ha ha\nHa you're you're really busy or [laughter] whatever [laughter] I spent a fourth grader\nI mean really a man and then\nThere are some intelligent commentary on the radio medical discourse oh what a ...\nMan [laughter] perfect\nI'm getting your go today they're letting it can be when the ... boys who just beat you up so I don't know the right ... you're right Bartlett\nHey if you need any more evidence that the mainstream media is completely prejudice against Donald Trump did you see the correction NBC had to issue you had a Trump tweeted something NBC comes out and they said that Trump was praising conservative\nA Confederate General Robert elite is incredible it turns out it was it Robert he was praising he was praising Ulysses S grant who fought for the north and won the war for Abraham Lincoln and this is how the mainstream media just wants to make Trump seem that he's a racist because he liked to civil war general\nNotice a big difference between Robert de Leon Ulysses Grant\nNBC's not getting any Trump interviews you know ABC got a millennia CBS Scott the president NBC nothing\nWell there's still an axe to grind with NBC over The Apprentice and Jeff Zucker who's now over CNN there's still a little bit of that going on but uh again and you're making it seem like the mistake on NBC's part was intentional of course it was\nWell I think they certainly don't jump to the moon I did but you're saying they intentionally went out to ... when they knew all along that he really meant grant but he said Italy\nWell what it is it they they want it to be right yeah that's what they want us to because they want to be able to jump on him for being a racist so it says Ulysses Grant but they're so clouded in their judgment there so blinded by their hatred for this man that they the property lead when it's Ulysses S grant\nLet's see if we can pick up some of this I don't want to play the whole thing but it also gave\nYou [noise] have general [noise] who is incredible he drank a little bit too much\nRobert ... you know I'm talk it out on a random and that was a big drinker so really it was a great general there you go to Robert Robert he was a great general just as always\nThe tactical robbery when he was a great general he was you know so what is going to be said they said hello\nAnd what you would hope that everyone and see\nAnd said that he was calling Robert elite incredible you called him a great general right there yeah but he called Ulysses Grant incredible ... yeah but there's no just doing them no history is going to dispute the fact that Robert Blake Robert he leaves a great generally watch we watch for the wrong side to side was in the wrong but he was a great general\nBut she's right I mean come on I don't use right what what\nDo you what you got to deal with you got to deal with it and he's the head of North Korea we were at each other's throats Trump has toned down he's going to be with you can't you don't meet with your friends you make peace with your enemies or to make peace with your friend you make peace with your enemies just say I love the guy and you know murdering bastard\nWhat are you talking about you love the guy come August just buttery Emma ... them up for the summit\nWhen he can get a deal from him to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula that's the goal that the larger picture and there's less there's oh he's a bad guy you shouldn't be dealing with bad guys give me a break you know what else a Trump said me a break\nOn President and you know not\nAll right when we come back what's going on with the missing journalist and assembled is Trump going to get tough with the Saudis if

I don't know what's there if they have been\nChilling report though that uh he may have recorded and broadcast his abduction torture and murder if he wasn't a murder on his ah apple watch to his wife well a ...\nA Turkish newspaper is claiming that that audio exists and the Turkish officials have that audio recording of the alleged killing of ... shocking now would not be interesting\nMhm be interesting to see what Trump does too because Trump is pretty close to the Saudi Arabian family there and Jared likes the likes the prince\nThe prince who allegedly may have ordered the hit job on this guy but Trump is coming out a little tougher than he was initially like he's come out and said it's if indeed ... was killed by the Saudis that uh they have to be a price to pay for that\nWell here's what Trump said on sixty minutes last night about\nFor nobody knows yet but we'll probably be able to find out it's being investigated being looked at very very strongly that we wouldn't be very upset and angry if that were the case as of this moment they deny it had been denied the mentally\nSo he has said that he's not going to pull the arms deal no so what can he do exactly\nYou know I don't think much is going to happen in Saudi Arabia is a ... it's not a democracy okay\nThe princes probably a bad due buddy is our ally in a very strategic place in the world in the middle east and he you know Trump will just do well by motor you scold your wag your finger at them tell them to behave but you're not going to cancel hundred billion dollars in arms sales because the Chinese will just step and sell the arms of Saudi Arabia why should we give up that business\nYeah it's just unreal politics the way the works\nAll right with that let's go to Ian panel he isn't it simple you know we've been speculating about all of the stories that have come up in the last twenty four hours what's the latest from your standpoint in\nYeah good morning Lynn Good to be with you I mean this is a genuine mystery is it that much to mistreat I'm standing at the moment just about ten Fifteen Years from ... this\nSaturday correspondents he was American resident ... for the Washington Post was the last say we're outside\nThe Saturday ... this morning that\nLast point to what you said I look at the camera the buildings going in that we've seen those shots but then he was never seen again his fiance wasted outside\nShe had to move all but she didn't hear anything from the Saudis say look he left out in the back door and yet they haven't proved to provided any evidence to prove that the Turkish authorities here are saying that they have evidence that he was held that he was in ... and that he was killed explain exactly what\nThe Turkish newspaper claims they have audio off the watch that the that has the killing on it that's that's what the Turkish newspapers saying the Turkish authorities have that audio you\nYeah what we're hearing is that that was a deliberate route to construct people's sense of how they were actually listening in\nOn another country's culture which seems to be much more credible I mean experts have said it was on the watch somehow is transmitted to uh the uh the only fund that the girl friends had outside\nThat doesn't sound entirely beliefs but what is much more believable is that they were actually listening in uh what was going on in the culture there will ever find out but there clearly absolutely showing it put enough pressure on the Saudis\nThe Saudi king to pick up the phone last night's speech the president implements this chilling investigation and we're expecting to see Turkish investigation going that read it in the last couple of hours we also sort of local cleaning crew get this a cleaning crew going into the

there now unbelievable up next ABC political line was Steve Roberts will try to make sense of the president on sixty minutes not to mention the Saudi crisis is all coming up after Joe Bartlett at eight o'clock\nYou want to do for meals are rated number one seven ten W O R voice of New York and\nOr Steve his poll numbers are up is he going to be able to withstand that a blue wave that seems to be headed his way\nWell the whole syrups slightly for him but they they're headed in the right direction a\nABC Washington Post poll out this weekend we we asked this generic question you're likely to vote democratic or Republican for the house in the fall\nLast time we asked in August the Democrats that are fourteen point lead us down to eleven that's not a big switch but it's had it in the right direction for Republicans the real problem here for Republicans as a female go Len say they're going to vote Democrat or they're going to vote Republican by two points\nWomen say they're going to vote democratic by twenty two points\nAnd you look at independent women and they say they favor Democrats sixty two to twenty nine that's more than two to one\nAnd and the real reason I think there are many reasons for this but at the core is that the\nEconomic issue is working better with men and women they are looking at the economy there looking at unemployment they're looking at inflation and looking at the stock market and they they kind of ignore some of the president's personal problems ... and and and focus on the economy whereas we see this women voters are more likely\nTo be worried about his impulsiveness more likely to say that he's not a very good role model for my kids and so I'm as there is this enormous gender gap least we have the gender gap in this country for a long time but this is the biggest as ever seen guys\nThey said we know a lot of the polls were predicting a Hillary Clinton when two years ago had the pollsters and you study this stuff have they kind of corrected their models to be a little more accurate this time around\nOr they've tried it's hard because people don't have landlines anymore and then people have landlines you could tell where they live and you could get a much clearer picture a but I'm a they're using more computer based model is a computer question um but the key uh one of the keys here is to measure intensity\nOr how likely are people to vote you can't just say who do you favor you've got a factor in intensity\nUm and that's one of the things that I'm a Trump or used to when the last time and in key states his people will more energized there were more motivated of what people fail to see was a\nHow tepid support was for Hillary Clinton a lot of people who told pollsters they were for her didn't bother to vote if you look at the intensity question this year\nA women say they're about Seventy percent of women tell us it's important to vote and only sixty two percent of men say that's important and so the intensity advantage which Trump past two years ago seems to be swinging toward the Democrats\nAnd particularly among women voters who seem to be more highly energized\nWe're almost the Roberts the ABC News photo enlist in Washington joins us every week this time Steve is this some of Saudi miss\nThere should be able to do more thing before I just I really I I was a severe pain with facts and

old he's the Republican gubernatorial candidate a I don't think he stands much of a chance to knock out Cuomo but he's out and about trying to get some name recognition I think this morning\nWhile he was talking about that the of attack that went on between the right and the left outside the metropolitan Republican club on the Upper East side\nAnd uh he's uh basically blaming it as you'd expect since she's a Republican he's blaming it on the left he was on uh let's see where we see this one she on Fox yes he was on Fox and friends\nIt was a an outrageous attack a it threatened staff and the people in that building and certainly we have a staff there about what what is most critical is we have to tone down the rhetoric on all sides of the violence is not it's not something that we should should accept\nIt turns out he was an office in that building well it is the metropolitan Republican club of New York so and he is the Republican gubernatorial candidate so he probably does have a desk\nOr something now he appeared on Fox and friends with NYPD widow Diane Puget teeny and they're they're speaking to her husband's killer Herman bell Orion a release a after his jail sentence and uh and they were speaking out against that\nHerman bail tortured her husband and another New York city police torture them in Nineteen Seventy will absolutely amazing bag and then kill them and and then the governor a part time it's a slap in the face of law enforcement\nIt's a slap in the face to victims and their families and it's a slap in the face of the judicial system and and he's made a mockery of of of democracy\nSo they're obviously Fox friends giving the platforms are Republican who's running against Cuomo like he's drawing Cuomo think he's drawing close when the polls I don't think so I don't have we seen up whole meal quantum debate um see I think that's\nYeah that's just what a formal arrogance that slow quest you gotta you gotta debate ... what do you what are you afraid of Cuomo has made it a guy because he's an arrogant\nArrogant how's it going to say something I Can't say on there I really don't like well I I guess it really ... you called them a thug he's a thug you know\nSo what's going on now what's the reaction to the president's interview with sixty minutes Kellyanne Conway was out and about this\nMorning to tell ya well as usual Kelly and said it was just a terrible performance by the president cited act no Kellyanne Conway you can they be as she is Sarah Sanders said like the ...\nPilot fantastic I call this entire advertised by President Trump Donald Trump fault it's part of why he got elected I mean you can try this week and say that well in his faith energy this week and it reminded again read and three thousand six hundred and forty two white ... people want to have\nHer because she went out and said well she's referring to Hillary Clinton's interviewing which Hillary Clinton was asked do you think should Bill Clinton have resigned after the Monica Lewinsky news broke and of course Hillary has absolutely not it was consensual affair ha ha that's not going to fly in the hash tag ... era Hillary Kellyanne shocker says the president is transparent\nAnd if it was an excellent ... because he got killed ... people on there just as a session that forms the way he will critical trained at ... at the polls brave body fat in the south lawn at rallies last four or five rallies without\nMuch chance parents accountable president\nSaturday that recently actually in modern times the\nGreatest of all time is it going very well

put it out there and people didn't have to tell their stories are named their predators but just to stand in solidarity we can get a real good glimpse of number but I I never expected obviously by the time I woke up seven hours later that fifty three thousand people or whatever for the time\nThat was remarkable credit was absolutely remarkable incredible that response to Harvey Weinstein one year ago or what was the me too uh uh example hardly once he was the first person yeah me too where it can be brought up by the New York title that's I think I was a year ago she wrote in response to Harvey wants to be\nBut I think we've come a long way obviously I think as I went in and we're not only speaking out using our voices but also standing in solidarity with each other which I think is when our feet are focusing on but\nWe still have a long way to go\nOkay now in response to you know the president's saying it's a tough time for young men oh she was asked about that on good morning America\nI don't know why they're concerned it is in fact that boys could also be hurt and arrested and sexually assaulted and of course concerned for boys but I'm not concerned for them in a way that
