younger kids like him too he's really hit yeah I mean he told me he loved his movie the preacher's wife since he was a kid and he he owns the rights to it himself loud and he's the driving creative force behind the Broadway version of the preacher\nI I did ask her if if her husband has apologized since they've been in the White House she did answer that question I asked her if she loved her husband\nShe did answer that question um and I asked her you know have you been hurt by all of this and she answered that\nSo to her credit you know they they said no ground rules for this and you guys know how these interviews go you you've done them before when you have a big interview people sometimes want to bring agendas they they they want us at ground rules there were no ground rules and and and no questions were were off the table um and so we asked\nWell what do you think the most newsworthy a thing is going to come out of the nights\nYou know one thing that that we haven't released yet is the real story behind the jacket the jacket she wore down to the border she is she's never shared this story and and we we got it we got the full story a and it's not exactly what was put out\nA in the press by her office and we got to the bottom of what was going there and I think a lot of people are gonna be going to be surprised\nTo hear of his jacket that said I don't care do you uh when right when she was\nShootout at the border she ward on the plane ride down and then she wore as she as she left as well she didn't wear when she was with the children would have been separated from their parents but she wore around that trip and it of course through so much attention uh for some overshadowing the work she was doing down there at the border to try to figure out what's going on\nJobs interview with millennia Trump was on at ten o'clock tonight on ABC time do you get the sense you spent some time with her you talked about her marriage to Donald Trump is this a loving relationship\nYou know I'm not going to pass any judgment or give you guys my opinion on that one way or the other it's just not it's not what I Do but I Will tell you this I've been working on this interview for two years and my pitch to her was I don't think America\nKnows who you are I'm not sure if America knows what's in your heart and I want to give you the opportunity to speak and I I think people will get a better sense of what's in her heart and who she is and how she feels about her husband\nA time I met her once briefly to cocktail parties seem like a pleasant lady uh obviously she was overshadowed by Donald Trump who is at the same a cocktail party and seemed a little shy and reserved or what was your general impression of her because she was alone one on one with you\nYou know she is you have to remember she's been in the public eye since the late nineties she\nYou know the type of person she is she is very stoic she is guarded she is reserved I mean that that's just who she is\nBut you know she can also be a funny she she she she she can also have a good time um you know she she was very pleasant throughout the interview even when we were asking very tough questions she was never once rude she never once lost her cool [noise]\nUm and and you know I think I think that translates to to the interview that we did and what people will see\nSee tonight but I think for most people in America it's fair to say\nShe is a mystery I don't think it was lost on anyone when she was essentially turning some of history's great is landmarks into her her personal runway or they're in Egypt including the things I I don't think the army there was lost on so many because she is an enigma to so many people\n... you know when she first got to the White House there were reports that she she hated it that she hated being in the spotlight she didn't want to be in Washington do you get the sense she's becoming more comfortable in the role as first lady\nYou don't want to let's say a good question and we asked a lot about her life and the White House in about that she claims those are all rumors that she is happy and Washington she made a point to say it over and over again\nThat said she did reveal that losing her privacy has been one of the toughest parts or she did reveal that it's difficult to to to go to\nDisrupt our relationship with Saudi Arabia over a journalist\nSo we're working with turkey and we're working with Saudi Arabia what happened is a terrible thing assuming that happened I mean maybe we'll be pleasantly surprised but somehow I

why did you invite Kanye West to the White House yeah why did he know well we\nIt sounded like a good idea and it may have been a good idea although who knows I'm telling you sat down in the oval office went on a ten minute uninterrupted ramp sitting right across from the president and uh\nIt was well well some say bizarre\nTrump is on his hero's journey right now and he might not have

New Jersey good morning Joe\nHey good morning guys you know I think I'm looking at this logically it's like the reason why when you know let's say and ... the White House\nIt's like those people visit and they don't address any real issues state they didn't speak out about anything for the black community and and helping all black people things like that they went there and it's all at that celebrity ES hop not stuff but with ... trucks\nKeep all the results people here that shows I\nWatch all politics for a long time and I worked in the black community that I see the devastation that when you look at the the black community who overwhelmingly votes lady plus percent every election you got to say or the Democrats still for these people so ... ... on the scene speaking saying well he is\nHe is saying things that are true that the less does not want\nThe black community here he is right thanks for yourself they'll be a group thinker don't just think you have the automatically vote Democrat and look at the results low unemployment jobs\nReal things that real everyday people can look at it we\n... oh we hear you Joe Joe here's a little bit of cognac yesterday\nWhen we make everything in China and not in America there were cheating on our country and we're putting people in for a legal thing she factory out that the president yeah\nBeyonce had no position on China Len\nYeah China the jail being ... that's the that's the connection there hey where and when we come back we're going to take a peek at the TV morning shows we got some brand new millennium quotes from her big interview tonight and your next chance to win a thousand bucks after the news it's nine o'clock\nBaron was born through lamp out on the way Hillary Clinton Lewinsky came out I don't I don't love to know what the real true really I just ask her I Want to see Tom said the word Stormy Daniels in front of her and see what that react I like I'd like to hear the phrase the question like what was the last time you a\nConsummate had your marriage ... when he went on to that of course the ... what are you can tell they're curious about that oh you are lying down now I'm not sure if they know horizontal hokey poke no really no I'm not I mean really\nI don't know oh ... oh wow that's a\nPersonal thing that I don't think anyone I Can't worry is what they want us to ship is Doug\nLike come on All right\nI'll take your word for it so uh [laughter]\nI ... I Believe a lot of talking about the media speculation about these affairs and and other things involving Trump\nMedia already creating yeah I mean it's not always passing course [noise]\nI um I Know what he's wracking like he's gone through and not true\nWell apparently Tom you almost said do you love your husband and that's a that's a loaded what it once you get to say do this I hate is orange guts\nWhat what are you going to say his God I mean it was kind of a new love your husband or I guess apparently yes you mentioned you you still have a good marriage to love your husband\nThe revenue gas factly and they have not only was correct\nSee new loves him yeah so it was kind of got a lot of love of the White House these days Leno\nThere's the devil's triangle [laughter] and I found this [laughter] I Hope so [laughter] anyway or are you familiar with\nIn silk\nA yes there are those the funny black lady violated and they like Trump they loved Trump and they're ... they're on Fox and friends that you were loaded the Don lemon last night\nWell Don lemon was on denouncing cars now Don Lemon is no longer a reporter he's\nAn advocate and he advocates getting rid of Trump but he was on
