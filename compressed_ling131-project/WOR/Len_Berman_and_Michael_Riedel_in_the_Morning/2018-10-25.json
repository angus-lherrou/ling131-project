currently forty three W. or how many are all just reached that you're now you're still with\nThe ... of the dinosaur brave Robert Deniro the latest target those mail bomb President Trump blaming the

good Melvin be the next GM the latest on that as well as the gas giants and the twenty eighth seem World Series is on the sports don't six to nine tonight right here on seven ten W will walk and today\nLive from New York City government and Michael ... in the morning on seven ten W O R well all these\nBombs being sent a we thought it would be\nGreat to speak with the outstanding ABC News crime and terrorism analyst Brad Garrett who really has the stuff together and and he he's hinting that he thinks this isn't going to be a hard case to break so we'll get his expertise\nIn just a few moments I'm sure the story about the CIA director Gina Haspel yes yes she heard the audio of the killing of a of a ... a wild animal will reportedly you know obviously we don't know for sure\nBut according to report that was published\nAccording to the New York post ... uh the president's sent Haspel\nThe turkey to investigate the killing a but apparently um she's heard the audio someone must be just frightened\nOh my God it well I remember that shilling detail ah I think it was in the new ones in the New York times report that the guy who directed the operation he told the Fifteen hits ... members of the hit squad were chopping them up you said a put on earphones and listen to music while you're writing its members screams\nAnd there was a story yesterday the crown prince actually was public has made a speech and called the whole you know\nHe well he showed up at his uh his as Davos in the desert some it there and he got a standing ovation from people but I'm sure they're all if they didn't stand up maybe jumped up too\nBut he talked about his outrage over what happened and they're going to get to the bottom of this ... telling me he had no clue whatsoever that he directed this thing I I haven't really\nDid and I really think that the king of Saudi Arabia has got to push NBS aside and stole some other cousin in that job\nAll right let's check in with Brad Garrett he is the ABC News crime and terrorism animals we welcome you back to the show bread my son the notes that you're thinking the secret service may may have a pretty good leader\nWell we'll see the thing of it is that people who make these type of of threats\nBut I have a track record they have threatened to other people before maybe not with bombs\nBut this is an angry guy I'm going to say guy is typically they are that has lashed out through letters through email through showing it put somebody's office et cetera to the point being he may be in their database of of folks they sort of keep track of\nThat and they'll have his fingerprints on file they may have his DNA on file a ... there's a lot to work with those bombs as far as potential forensic evidence and so she'll see\n... brat so as they studied these bombs what are they what specifically are they going to be looking for\nWell first of all you want to you want to see if they're actually operational or are they something that was sort of put together the look like a bomb to scare people but it's not really a bomb that could go off\nMiss going to be one side of this you're going to look at how sophisticated or not the bomb is in my sense is it's not sophisticated um because it tells you something\nThat about the bomb maker or is this something he learned on the Internet for example um and so you take that information and it gives you a lot of potential leads as to who this might be\nWell a Brad ... if those on the writer correct and this is all just concocted by the left to try to make the president look bad then maybe this is just some kind of shot the operation and there is no track record of this guy\nMaybe that's that is true but if it's in fact he has any sort of criminal record if they can come up with fingerprints they may still be able to find him [noise]\nUm you know one of the keys is going to the if in fact he did use the postal service is that he had to put it in the mail stream someplace he also had to go or ... or send somebody to\nA a courier like fed ex UPS et cetera so there may be a trail of him at those locations so a lot of potential surveillance cameras to to review and see if they get lucky\nBread we keep saying he though but could this possibly be some sort of gang or a group of people I'm thinking of like the the weatherman in the sixties who blew up a house in Greenwich Village\nSure it it could be I'm just kind of going or what I see of unsophisticated bomb every envelope is exactly the same you get to misspellings of like uh the Mr Brennan's last name is misspelled up things that\nSort of the lend itself to a you know one guy that angry that's a targeted a group\nOf phone are you there I'm here oh good okay so that's what I think's going on but now he's gone 'cause we're having a little gremlin ... you know I think it's the I think it's the people\nOn the left are screwing with our phones well he ruled out they sent all the bombs and now they messed up with our phones is well he's ruled on anyone who won the spelling bee well is brand new ... spelled uh\nThis person who sent a also a misspelled shoals as in the ... what I wanted to ask him and if we get them back or maybe we'll just try to get a message to him I'm a I'm just curious well I I don't know you know I keep on keep going back and forth to\nThey are not too concerned about this story but once again what it shows land is that the times will take any scrap of anti Trump information and blow it out of proportion in their newspaper\nOh yeah\nWell how how would you not even fighting back now because I'm thinking of the next the portions of the hours segment I what I'm thinking about is how disingenuous it is it of him to call for oh he's calling for civility and unity a\nWell he is that's what he should be doing in the way you do this or possible terrorists and he has no culpability\nWe cannot do is let our disagreements about matters of policy terrorists are part as a confess right can't do that\nWe must accept\nSeveral lecture you read that teleprompter Donald ... let me tell you he is the guy who said it's OK to body slam a reporter it's OK during the campaign to go beat up the protestors because I'll pay your bills\nAnd this is the guy who was advocated violence and beating people up all the way of life and now he wants to ... by the way he didn't even mention CNN they didn't mention Obama they will mention the Clintons mentioned anybody yesterday and and do you think it might have been nice of him to call either Obama and Clinton and voice concern\nCan't use that phone because it was hacked by the Chinese and the Russians are that's true you gotta wait till he's back in the oval office used to secure line\nNo one should carelessly compare\nPolitical opponents to historical villain got a good point there is done often\nYou see how nice somebody ... can I just like have you ever seen [laughter]\nBehaving very well [laughter] I Know we can keep it that\nWay [laughter] Hi all the twisted and every which way to support or you can um behaving so nice well yeah they said bombs to CNN and I was thinking it would show a little modicum ability for once well he\nIs doing what he is ... it's very presidential what he's saying that that we should not be attacking each other from the right or the left and it is very true and that many people in this country who despised him have a liking him to Nazis and Hitler and that is\nOver the top oh this is over the top but some ... as I said earlier which are Michael from Long Island totally agreed with fake news is going to write stuff about him than combat it with facts that's all you don't have to combat it with bodies slamming congressmen and beating up protests lead to have you protest it would give the truth don't lie have facts that\nYou have you ever in all of the president sees that you have lived through have you ever seen a media so hell bent on destroying a president as the media is hell bent on destroying this president have you ever well I'll not even the Nixon\nCounter that by saying and you can't if you want to disagree with your\nYour already wrong I Know you're going to say OK what am I going to say that they they did it to Obama now\nSo I'm going to say I'm going to say have you to ever seen a president who has told us many lives and untrue does as this president\nOh I got ... ... why do you answer my question\nHave you ever seen a politician was allied more or toll more\nLions Bill Clinton he was one of the biggest ally or to ever be in the old off he sold more lives in this oh well we didn't there was no media out there to keep track of his life because they supported him oh boy he'll twist on anything I'm Serious yeah All right he lied about the big things sex in the oval office there Lynn\n... [laughter] yeah [laughter] oh I might not have sexual or you can keep your thoughts are the big alive keep your doctor yeah hey I'm ... yeah that one\nAnd the red line against Hillary you and the red light why we got married we were on\nTour Obama three um but you would think after CNN receives bombs he would be a you put out an olive branch the media wouldn't you\nKnow the media also has a responsibility to set a civil town as just stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stores have to do\nYou have to do it okay\nUh well if we get back oh we got we got the we have to talk about a couple of huge New Jersey stories a mother is speaking out after her child dies from a virus contracted in that\nNew Jersey rehab a claim seven young lives just an awful story oh there was a great debate last night oh another one and then does in yoga and we'll check that one out here and has a thousand dollars coming up at nine o five and a mark someone's coming up a tent alright here on seven ten W.
