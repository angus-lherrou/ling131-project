these tax strategies that Trump's father is set up\nTo uh put some money aside for his kids that's that's where the New York times says and then they go on and on and on and they could well couldn't

dollars\nGave him roughly a four hundred and thirty million dollars bailed them out on many many occasions including the time he went down to his casino in Atlantic City and just through three and a half million dollars on the table took the chips never use them and walked out so that was an illegal three and a half million dollar loan on top of that\nThe the times ... I Know you don't want to read it because you don't want to believe that\nThe shell companies you set up it was fraud there's no question there was tax fraud that if you think that's OK and his whole life was built on this one million dollar lie and tax fraud is okay because quote all the rich people do it then fine I assume that's going to be your point of view simple entire life was built on a fraud\nAnd bill question for you and if this is as much fraud as you claim how can the IRS never looked at it they are and it was the Irish did not aggressively pursue it which means the implication that they knew about it but they didn't do it they didn't look at the whole story I skimmed it well I was like you and he had phony assesses\nUndervaluing properties and listen if you tell the IRS okay this is worth ... says that when I go out and check it out on a new lease the IRS is the biggest hound out now than I Am so the point\nThat the IRS really does not go after these undervalued things and these these ... money is handed down they they kind of take a look at it a wink and that's the bad and I'm well it's true and\nThen all the fraud companies do shell companies us up including in some guy's house in Westchester and the funneled the money illegally to his kids Michael\nAnd their lack of lay me if you had to read it and you and you went north lend the reason\nRich people do this is because we have a crazy tax system that wants to grab all their money and redistribute it so far we if we had a normal tax system you would have to have all these scheme that everybody indulges it and I are attacking the tax system in your system is a mess and now you're saying frauds okay\nI'm not safe for all your way to the IRS didn't pursue it did not pursue it that's according to the New York times well\nThey didn't pursue it because of this undervalued access or who the trumps had in his pocket I mean he recess stuff with a fraction of the value and then pass the profits along to the kids I'm telling you it was outright tax fraud and if you don't believe you don't want to believe but listen to Charles Schwab over here on okay All right\nJust telling you go ahead and do you guys are on the wrong side of history because that's all you do is defending defend defend this guy what he did last night was despicable and what he didn't this tire career with this million dollar loan was a total lie and a sham have a nice day\nLens giving the graduation speech at Smith fish here All right when we come back to something big is going down to two Eighteen this afternoon you got to be prepared and we will tell you why what's your next chance at a thousand dollars is coming up at seven ... seven ten W.

I Know you love astronomy I Do I I Do I'm an amateur astronomer by well and so what's the final word is Pluto applying it or not I mean could you know they have decided that Pluto is now a planet well and that's the ninth planet\nIt yeah well yeah if they had 'em up bar skater so it was on it then and now it's a plant that was applied with a gun fun\nNow said no kids missed out on it because I think it became a non planet when they're like kindergarten unless that is sad I put it which was nice to have\nYeah well it was after all buys little self will know apparently well here's the thing that's just what does all the way out there yeah even while you're out there like me even further out there on the left his is two oh one five Gigi three eighty seven nickname\nGoblin oh\nIt's two and a half times further away from the sun than Pluto ... you know what a year orbit is\nOh it was it takes ... not a year you know how long it ... a year on gobble and you know how many years and it's on your ... ten Fifteen three million forty thousand ... orbit around the sun forty thousand but it's an\nActual planet well they think it is yeah and it's part of our solar system our solar system does it in our so what's your asking me a lot of questions that are still lives there and let it ring yeah Carl Sagan Berman over here is the elite okay wait a second the\nObject was discovered by the scientists while searching for a dwarf planets and plan of acts in what they're calling the largest survey of the distant solar system that was our solar system\nBut now that worked in ... it's not going to work why what's so we weren't going to get into the white guy around in the shoe box too far away who just don't have enough room for it they're not going to work it ain't gonna make the ...\nBut you know there are a lot more planets out there than we suspect and we're going to keep finding more and more and more but my my curiosity is how do you have a birthday\nThey're never going to be all the time I'd be really ever get older right you know the same long if\nYou live Seventy eighty earth years you're the same age you're zero I mean can you imagine what winters like on that planet ... well it's nonstop\nStroke what if there's any water there than there might be life there\nCouldn't be any question how many questions ... stick to the ... let's talk about up in the air back on earth\nOh yeah I flight from Phoenix to Boston was diverted to Kansas City overnight because of an unruly passengers so the plane American Airlines flight ... the next round six thirty some guy got on the plane he appeared to be ... because he was stumbling when he got up there and then he was leaning up against the place where you are the overhead compartment and some passengers said what are you gonna do simple ups\nAnd the guy actually tried to do some pull up well here's the overhead compartment there's one of the passengers\nAnd he was leaning against a week for the bags overhead and passenger came by supporting and use blood and the guy actually grab onto it started to pull off on the plane the front of very what I mean\nThere's a genius what do you call that ... they made the overhead baggage group I don't think I didn't have a chance to get to the gym so it's just a little work out for the long flight anyway I think they'd they'd never heard of the plane because he was unruly throughout the whole ...\nAnywhere around or if you say Boston Phoenix it was from Phoenix to Boston but it was diverted to Kansas City because uh the guy missed his a gym session leading edge in getting diverted ... worthy is the worst Islam boss can cause some jerk his bombed out of his mind on the plane\nTo amazing that they don't catch these people notice open the window and throw them out\nThe flight attendants when I asked him about three or four times to sit down to refuse to sit down [laughter] and then he really got verbally abusive with her circling names of profanity they must\nHave a rest of the sky right here's a door jump that is what I Would say if my bottom line they arrest the guy oh they always yeah that we had when they go they don't they don't mess around my wearing\nDiversion was were on a flight to London one of those overnight flights and some passenger had anxiety well who doesn't have anxiety on the plane so they landed us a Newfoundland\nHuh in the fog in Newfoundland\nThen they have to take all the bags and find her bags and\nHer traveling companion young young you leave it you'll find it later holidays and that so we're stuck in Newfoundland for a couple of hours and there was a doctor on our flight suggests ... and the letter lay out in first class really\nVodka tonic next you'll be fine and who doesn't have a little anxiety on a plane and I never want to be a flight attendant that sounds like when stressful job that does give her really well that's how you survive on that one just shows little bottles anyway I was my worst plane diversion story well coming up next\nWe've started doing this we'll see if it works today is we're calling it the morning show round up including well we do have that dynamic duo of flaking Coons to senator God it's all coming up it's nine o'clock\nYour smoking is a zoo Fox they rated number one seven\nThey're the ones who came up with a scheme to have a a weeklong FBI investigation delay and they were both on NBC this morning a here is Senator Chris Coons from Delaware\nThat would concern me am I Hope the FBI spent allowed to follow up all the reasonable leads from the credible allegation what he's\nTalking about is the F apparently been interviewing doctor for it so that's what she's already spoken saying he's already been interviewed by the United States Senate we'll let them and talk Michael\nThat were before the committee last week and I know that puts them under a lot of pressure but they've got the resources to do it I'm Jeff and I came to an important agreement that it would be a one week investigation uh and then leave it to the professionals at the FBI to decide exactly who they ought to interview and when they ought to deliver a final report to the ...\nAll right now is Senator Jeff flake obviously the retiring soon from Arizona He was also asked by savannah Guthrie on the today show or was he worried the FBI is not speaking to a doctor forward\nWell we have to stay for the doctor for it and then we have a hours of testimony so\nFrankly uh when we talked about an FBI investigation it was a follow up leaves to corroborate her account so I I don't I'm not troubled by that as much as if we came back and found out that the FBI only followed a couple of leaves or whatever I interviewed just a couple of people\n... it's okay you okay with that just interviewing a couple of people yeah a new problem with anything\nThey saw this is what's hippy ... they're going to the same questions that the Senate ass Len that is what they're doing and they're going to come up and say well we found out the same stuff that you kind of said he said she said the only one way or the other do you like to see the transcript for mark judge suppose the third man I'm sure we're going to see it all because somebody's gonna leak so don't you worry about\nThat later they gave you them I'm just curious that's all we're going to find out
