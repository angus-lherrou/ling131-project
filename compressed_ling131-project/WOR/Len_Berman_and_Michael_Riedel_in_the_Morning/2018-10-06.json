apart anything like that the same thing somebody that died violently or was murdered\nIf I Can't get to that funeral before that spirit crosses over\nI Can't give the any law enforcement agencies any information\nBought if that person that was murdered comes in your dream and it was a relative or a friend asked him what the heck happened and you'd be surprised how ... how much information you can get from them and unfortunately they still don't know the lottery numbers\nNo I don't know or or if they do they're not passing them on\nExactly rent\nFor a lot of people who were brand new to the show marry him and I want to get to know you a little bit better you've had this gift since you were\nA little girl correct a well were you\nGrandma realized I was a little over two when I could see and talk to earth spirits the problem is most babies and children can which she didn't realize\nThat when I was four she started taking me to funerals so that I could talk to the relative that died and\nItalian ...\nEverybody's related somehow and so you know I was Graham a special granddaughter they could come in and talk to the dead the only thing and I was never scary to me I mean the person was just standing there and yeah I could see his body and the gas it\nBut he was he was talking to me and I you know there was no question but would ask the question\nOr the relative would ask the question what they want her to know and I did not have to repeat it because the ghost heard it but they would just give me the answer and then I Would tell whoever asked the question the thing that scared me George and all of this was\nI'm definitely old enough but that back in the day they had way ... these\nYoung did they did hire people who cried and everything else\nOn carried on they did everything but wrong the floor that scared that it'd be ... to me it wasn't the dead person as the live person 'cause I never understood I thought they were sick I didn't know what was wrong\nWith that [laughter] did you perfect your skills as you progress or did the did you always have um\n[noise] no I think than the older I got the easier of course it was I think the more you do anything the easier it is and then in ... even though I've done this\nFor so long I still learn stuff all the time and by so it it improves every time I I really believe that it does it takes me about three seconds now to open\nA white light make a big enough for somebody to walk through\nI can keep it open fairly long if I'm doing a place like a hospital or an airport or restaurant where there are ten Fifteen twenty goes waiting to cross over\nThe county morgue um gosh there was all kinds in there and I just have to learn how to keep it open long enough\nAnd it was it was a learning thing you had to learn how to do this and it was trial and error because I really couldn't ask anybody about it and as crazy as this sounds our youngest daughter ... can do this\nAnd but she doesn't do it my way because she does not want to see the people in our eyes she just wants to hear them so everybody does it differently I think everybody has the ability it's how you develop it and how you use it\nEvery time I've talked to you you've been upbeat about everything you do have you ever been scared to death with something that has happened\n[noise] I ... this past year has been unusual and\nUm I was afraid of one thing oh maybe twenty five thirty years ago that happened a ghost actually flipped and a red handled acts in front of my face\nAnd and I wouldn't go to houses if I thought a ghost can kill me I Am certainly not stupid but I remember I was in the garage and that acts hit the concrete floor and slid into\nA fiberglass garage door he had no idea how loud that was when that hit and it was the three steps into the house from the attach garage and I remember sitting on the top sitting down and going\nMaryann what are you doing here [noise]\nAnd then it dawned on me knock it off because all I'm going to do is give them more energy\nI Can't walk into a house and be afraid because that's what they don't eat they don't sleep they need human energy I'm not going to feed them\nAnd I ... and the bottom line is your dead nominal live I've got a step over you bud and you know I Can't grab throw you into the light it still free will but you're gonna leave this health one way or the other and now that I'm older you know when I was\nFourteen Twenty one twenty five telling a fifty five five Seventy five year old man does say look at van Gogh sure girlie not so much anymore now can I tell them to do something they usually listen but I'm usually older and then all of\nHave you ever okay have you ever come across from a real good\nWell I think I can feign him maybe three times or one that we're so evil that they had come from the black\nYeah and I would buy ever run across that situation now I really try to protect the family the best that I can and I actually get a hold of a religious person somebody that has more training in that field and me\nThese people have resorted to character assassination with this guy and I can't believe that we had to analyze the writings in his high school and college your book\nAnd I can't believe this is the other thing here he was forced to defend himself in front of the nation against an accusation that had no cooperation\n... President Trump\nA talked about it when he's on the campaign really kind of mocked the accuser Christine Blasey Ford a little bit uh but basically what he said is she can't remember anything the only thing she remembers as she had one beer and that she was sexually molested by Brett Kavanaugh\nBut there's nobody else who can confirmed that and she never really brought that up after it happened even for a long time after it happened in\nFairness I I Will say that you know I I've read um at least one column where there was a young woman ... political columnist actually who talked about being sexually violated when she was a teenager\nAnd uh she didn't say anything about it because she said well it's my fault I I I let it happen and she really didn't say anything about it but I got to think\nIf it did happen you know more about the circumstances if it was that traumatic\nAlright so we'll we'll see how you speaking of all of that are in the next half hour I'm going to try and have a conversation\nWith 'em or an outspoken critic of the president and somebody's strongly opposed the cabin on nomination I Hope it remains civil\nUm this strategy of harassing people in elevators or in restaurants is\nIt simply out of control a you know I mean we've we've gotta get the Democrats under control they're just they're just not civil and it's probably only going to get a little more intense over the weekend because now of course\nAs you heard the news the cabinet nomination has advanced to the Senate for a final vote or we think today and joining us now it's Mike from O'Hare is let's see what he's been up to actually\nUh nobody's been up to the guys on television you are a TV star my friend although you've you've been on TV before but you popped up again\n[noise] [noise] yeah I'm going to I'm not going to have time for you with the radio anymore\n[laughter] it'd be ... by British so\n[noise] yeah so what do they have it right tribute essay why is\nThere officers in our own for World Trade with it so they come in here it is so when they were doing a tribute they went over to fire house if you'd some guys came in here to too many of you is to put together the trip you [laughter]\nYeah so it was it was actually it was a very good tribute to David right I mean they talked about the fans and the fans remembering\n'em these memorable moments of rights career with a you know I've got a lot of them but um ... because you know you kind of went out with a whimper because he didn't you know you kind of lost it and you've been on the engine reserved ... list for so long forgotten what he meant to the Mets but um it was a nice tribute\nWhat's it's probably good that they just took a little ship it or what I did not the whole thing is I was ... when he first came back they went to the world series way without posted a year and it came back first Phillies and he hit a homerun and it was almost like one and it was made for TV moment\nBut I remember I was in the car I had to go pick shell of a trade show car listening to this\nShow I complained to her that I miss it because I had a pet her up in the car [laughter] so I'm kinda the way it goes back to that point of view in there they just put the mention about the ... home run against silly\nYes and then of course you know might get o'hara's with Iran o'hara's you got to have a beer so you've got your little beer in the picture cheers David ride which I thought was a it was a it was a nice close to the peace\nShut your voice ... says we attack so that he says yeah even though they sold it to the next customer that came in\nAnd let me ask you how many takes to do on this\nOne cake I mean cakes joined it with you\nKnow this is radio you know they don't do that [laughter] you know this is radio

... are you watching football by any chance\nI have it on I'm not really sure if they're not really that interested it added on\nYeah okay well there's not much that there's not much to see in terms of our local team before I let you go though you know um [noise] this Cavanaugh I'm\nDebate has been going on all week and it's got hot and heavy and you know obviously there's two polarized sides was there any conversation that caught at o'hara's on this subject this week\nYou know I don't even want to I'm so sick of it is garbage well the one thing that will be no man left in the workforce pretty shouldn't\nYou knew you'd say that [laughter]\nAnd oh and the right mind is going to run for public office or any of this stuff to show evolved on something stupid in our lives\nWell I'm sure most men of voting group the woman from time to time you know and [laughter] I don't say salt and I mean you know I you know I Am kind of wandered from here you know that sort of stuff I'm right I mean wasn't then that happened back in ... in the day is oh I I you know you you try and go as far as you can\nYeah slap and shake it shake it\nReally really really anyway I I don't know I I I just I I felt it was awful that the way he was treated and especially since you couldn't even back up the allegation that by looking\nAt forty years ago\nYeah I I don't want to go through that again anyway it's a pleasure talking to you Mike have a good weekend and uh I'll see on the TV the next time aren't\nYet share but by\nAnd coming up and just a moment Alice Stockton row senior will be joining us She's

thought that was that's good right well the realtors probably going to pay they need it now they're not hanging oh wow oh you pay them as your twelve percent ten percent commission for them to do all the work for you\nSo I asked Jared Grasso CEO of and Jay ... how is it that they're exam\nWe went to the legislature and simply said to them that you know it real estate license is providing level of service that a a we provide more served the non aligned transactional system\nAnd we made the case that because we are going screening or during a two were checking the property that we're in showing that the uh qualifications of the person who is renting the property are legit\nOkay so the fact is that on line rental services provided everything that he's talking about accepted the fact that they can't physically go check on the property so I asked them what services have to deal with the fact that uh taxes attacks and shutting attacks be across the board\nThank you very much in sixty five

of course has to change all the games are on TV yes if you're watching on TV [noise] [noise]\nThe segment of the population that supports them that um is working and you know paying taxes and um they just feel put upon I think that you know the the the government takes so much money and um you know they don't see anything for it or do they work and everybody else gets their money I mean ... ...\nOh I Oh yes and and so the question is why do you why does someone in that position a working American who you know is not wealthy why don't they just look below the surface and see what his policies are\nSo you're you're you're you're you're you're going after him as an individual as a\nPresident and with a lot of power\nBut you know all all of these guys have some skeletons in their background and you know I don't want to bring up ...\nI'm not talking about skeletons or Clinton I mean everybody has skeletons if you look deep enough in my closet I guess you could find a skeleton although they'd be funny skeletons 'cause I grew up in a comedy\nClub [laughter] I'm a ... it's different to have a skeleton versus um doing things legislating policies that are going to hurt people taking people's Social Security that\nThey paid in for their entire lives cutting Medicare when people are most vulnerable separating babies from there from their mothers I mean these are just you know human rights issues that have nothing to do with what side of the aisle you're on\nThat's what I'm Talking about I mean you could be a right winger I don't care even I mean you know when I studied acting but still ... you know she was Marlon Brando was acting teacher and I had the great good fortune of\nSpending some quality time with her early in my life and she used to do something very very wise and acting class she she would say you know\nA lot of you are going to play parts of characters you don't like who's philosophies you don't agree with how are you going to play those parts and what she would have us do and we've lost the grade or to the debating\nSomehow it's not in school anymore hardly at all she would have us go on one side and let's say argue\nFor example pro pro you know pro choice and then she would ... and the next minute how this go on the other side and argue pro life and the logic behind it was to understand what the other person is thinking and feeling and I thought that was the most\nClever wise thing uh that I had to do early in my life\nAnd look and I agree with you and it's the absolutely great strategy the problem is I don't think people have any sort of understanding of where the other side is or numerous just total rejection of you know I'm ...\nBut I think that that ... you're right hunter I Can't disagree with you that\nThe media of the climate of the media where in even the media is a very right wing media or it's a left wing media there isn't a ton of centrist stuff out there and a centrist way of thinking has been rejected um and I think part of the problem is is that if you do think in a centrist\nWay it's much more intelligent I said this for years since I'm In my twenties which is a long time ago I\nSaw this happening I saw that there was a strategy out there by the powers that be whoever they were that wanted to dumb down the population and\nYou'd dumb down the population by a streamlining education and also by discouraging this kind of conversation that understands what the other side is thinking critical thinking has been eliminated\nAnd so if you look at um particularly certain\nRight wing you know outpost there is no critical thinking there's just screaming and yelling and\nRan on you know you got to compare the other side and show it on screaming and yelling and threatening oh but it's simply\nAnd constantly negative and I'm really I mean it's the this was one of the reasons I don't really like Trump to tell you the truth I mean I've been you know he wants to light\nYou mean by by early lead wasn't thinking person would light but what he does want are\nBut what why I support them I think is because I think it's dangerous for the opposition party here to try and destroy him just with the betrayal and his daily onslaught of negativity toward him rather than argue political points\nBut the thing is when you argue you're right but in in a perfect world you were a hundred percent right when you argue those points they are dismissed we as I said we're living in a climate where logic is tossed out the window and\nAnd the stakes are very high now look Joe we all breathe the same air we all during the same\nWater since he's been in office he has roll back regulations or to the EPA and and uh things that protect our water and our air\nI mean this is you know how soon as it going to be before Manhattan looks like what it looked like in the fifties and sixties where you can't brief why do this to save a few bucks this is poisoning people what's going to hurt them\nFar as I look at it\nI Want to put your ... once you put your strong drought on for me I mean have you looked at the charge of the United states\nSure okay where we know how long we've been talking about this since we know each other almost and what I've been saying that we're heading up toward another revolution where heading toward the Pluto return Pluto has a\nA cycle of two hundred and forty nine years and we're almost at that point of two hundred and forty nine years of the American revolution and Seventeen Seventy six it will be roughly twenty twenty four twenty twenty five ... getting awfully close so if you um you know kind of\nMeasure where we're at now as to where we were then we're roughly it around Seventeen Seventy things are heating up\nAnd that's that's the general climate but I'll tell you something else that's really interesting there are very close ties between friend Trump's chart Trump's father and ...\nLike that and I fell in love with astrology and\nThere are also enormous ties between Mary ... his mother and Milan ya so Milan is like a sexy version with the same chart\nKinda unbelievable\nSo you know flat mayor is his Russian daddy bankrolling I'm now just like his father you know this week we saw with what hit the news or in terms of how much ...\nTax free money was pouring into the Trump kids I mean this is what we're talking about it's the kind of privilege\nThat uh you know it has absolutely no regard and I'm going to say for nearly everyone listening to this program and the blood sweat and tears that they have put in to Social Security and you know what they've planned for\nThis could all go in you know a couple of strokes the pen and that's who I Am being very vocal about I don't care what side of the aisle you're on you're entitled to what you paid for you know that Reagan borrowed I forget what the exact number is\nFrom Social Security saying he was going to pay it back well it's more than thirty some odd years and it's never been\nPaid I'm with you on this I'm with you on this for many of whom are on the way should I be counting on it I'm counting on just like a lot of time\nWe've worked their whole lives I mean this is not right and this is what I Am vocal about okay he is not you know carrying through with his promise to the little guy he manipulated the little guy and he doesn't care I Am open to being shown otherwise\nA show that I I have to do I love you and I oh I Love you mean they made too much sense no no no no no I'm running out of time here um you'd be well happy birthday a dumb much talk against

even eighties to leverage the power of Korea Team to stay fit strong and healthy but you say\nKorea Tina's going mainstream you know I share the story with you before my mom who's in her late seventies now she's taking creating she works out a couple of days a week three days a week she does the free weights because she's got osteoporosis she wants to maintain her muscle mass and she wants to make her bones stronger and as you pointed out creating helps to do that\nAnd then the other three days during the week she'll go and she'll swim now she's not trying to get bigger stronger or anything like that but even at her age Korea teen has benefits\nOh yeah and what blows me away about that story 'cause you told me before\nIs that her medical doctor recommended routine for and that just goes to show how much more mainstream this is it's called ... strong and it supports the muscles to support your power your strengths your speed if you're an athlete you're certainly going to love it\nBut even if you're not an athlete you notice the difference let's go to another study one more review study this out of the journal current aging science December of two thousand Thirteen I thought this was very cool\nCause the researchers looked at the body of research out there on creating and seniors without exercise they want to see what happens when seniors take Korea teen and they don't\nThought them to invite radio you're about to receive responsible life changing information on health and nutrition you'll hear from him by professionals who are leaders in targeted and anti

it's just right there and uh it's in the um Westfield Brendan mall so that's right off route sixty it's it's right on route sixty\nA where Ruth foreign route Seventy five route sixty it's right there\nStore beautiful mall beautiful [noise]\nAnd I I tell you if you ever go to Tampa there's this old historic\nPart of Tampa that's really loaded with fun I mean loaded with fun it's called E. bore city why be a war\nAnd that's where the Cuban settled and they were ... you know that's where the cigar industry was in Florida I mean also down in Key West of course Key West and ... city in Tampa and if you go there\nAt has the architecture\nOf um Bourbon Street and in a New Orleans it has the New Orleans architecture but there's definitely a Key West vibe and I walked into a pub and I sat down I start talking to these two young ladies I Would just laughing away\nEvery other guy and they looked like Ernest Hemingway and I have to tell you probably everybody's name was captain Tony I mean if you go down to Tampa to check out the worst city really nice\nNow let's get down to work\n[noise] everything's on special so I like to talk about my favorites\nAnd one of my favorites is beats paychecks I don't think you could do much better as a supplement for your heart\nA supplemental longevity as beats a checks and I'm going to tell you why\nBe red meat is well known for improving circulation\nAnd factors over forty academic institutions telling there and see a level athletes their football players and our hockey players and baseball players to have a glass of beaches\nBefore a game because it improves their physical performance and it's totally legitimate and it's totally safe\nAs ... you know when you go into a well some of these stores and you buy the bodybuilding products\nThat are loaded with gimmicky ingredients literally gimmicky ingredients that don't have research that really don't have a validation and I don't think you should be using those products [noise] there's a lot of products for sports nutrition and body building you get them into change you know who does change our\n[noise] and they're really gimmicky and the you know to have all these fancy chemical names and there's no ... we don't even off the air like cancer causing or they hurt your kidneys we we have no idea you shouldn't use them you should only use things with real validation that they're safe and that they work\nAnd also what dosage do you give I mean all those companies are guessing at the dosages they have no idea how can you have an idea of a dosage if there's no human clinical trials\nSo it has plenty of human clinical trials on beach and I added ... more and see tart cherry too with the skin of the tart cherry so it's not a sugar products\nAnd by the way it's written beets sugar beach there's a type of beat that you're familiar with when you go into a a a diner and you get that little paper package of sugar\nAnd you put it in your coffee or tea that's actually from sugar beach and the problem with sugar beaches hey they loaded with sugar and beat sprayed like crazy they sprayed with all kinds of sprays all kinds of chemicals as like a little chemical factory\n[noise] so the red meat is not the same it's not sugar that's not where they get their sugar from and it's not we get we get the stuff that's non GMO it's not sprayed that's not sprayed but here's the thing is why invites a cut above\nWe check our ingredients for sprays that some are really huge\nBenefit I mean that's that's really something that other companies are not doing the FDA the food and Drug Administration does not require food companies nor vitamin companies to check their products for sprays\nWe do that voluntarily has what has to be checked they have to check for bacteria like ... salmonella and they have to check for heavy metals are like five heavy metals mercury lead arsenic [noise]\nWe checked for all the heavy metals\nTitanium dioxide\n... aluminum yeah and of course still really scary ones like cadmium and arsenic and the lead and mercury of course we check for that\nBut we also checked for mold and yes of course we check for bacteria but we also check for impurities from sprays from pesticides and from fungicides and round up\nAnd herbicides that's an herb aside\nSo we check for all these things\nWe make sure it's a really clean product it's not just good enough for us that we get a paper from our supplier that they never spread their product we actually do the extra footwork and we check that cost us more money\nEvery batch we checked for sprays all these companies out there you think they're checking for spray there's very few companies doing that very few companies doing that\n[noise] so if you buy our tart cherry are beat say checks I should say ... college and all those things have been checked for hormones and sprays and mold and all these different noxious chemical things and things that you just don't want in your body\nThat that's a real advantage of dealing with in ... that we go the extra we actually checked for eight hundred different things that do not belong in your supplements and if they're in there we reject the batch well she was doing a very few people are doing that\n\n[noise] so when you take our beach ... it's really clean we don't have the sugar problem because it's not the sugar beet red meat and here's the thing the red meat has trimester glycine to protect your heart and your brain\nThat has these reddish pigments\nThe time you're forty five you're making a thirty percent less college and now it's definitely showing and just go to college in mixed skin ... so it doesn't ... you know like like a natural facelift\nAnd it makes the skin so the fiber blasts that create your skin kind of go into a sleep mode in your forties because there's not enough college in for them to work with\nI when you take college unit wakes them up and I thought to knit together skin again out a better place quicker ... rate more efficiently more effectively and your wrinkles literally are filled in literally are replaced\nDecreases caused by some damage or smoking literally are replaced and you could see\nOver time\nStarting within about eight weeks wrinkles disappearing on your forehead and by your eyes and by your mouth and your ... your neck and your ... on your arms and hands\nAnd it just coloration you call them liver spots technically they're called ... caused by pollution or smoking they disappear show the disc coloration ... can disrepair all those ... things and the sun damage disappears and our college in those that safely\nDavid even shown that it improves ... by about Fifteen twenty percent 'cause it's pushed back when your skin is getting then because of a lack of college in the fat impulse through on your skin gets like that orange wind parents of so you like\nWhen you take the college in Ukraine skin again and you're pushing effect back in it and and the ... to go away I\nWasn't in the first month or two you sell your light is already improved ten Fifteen Percent\nBut it's great for your bones college in as a platform for your bones it's the basis the calcium attached to that would at college and you're not making better bone University of Florida Gainesville\nUniversity of Illinois College of medicine in Chicago Case Western reserve the best medical school\nIn in uh in Ohio they all said you want to build bone you have to have college that's\nIt's very important to understand the ratio between college and in ... it was almost equal the bone is thirty five percent ... I'm thirty six percent college and it's almost a perfect ratio because that's what the calcium attached to college in is the framework the foundation of your bone\n'cause he really have to protect and build your ball and you do in college in but at the same time your skin is improving\nAt the same time you hear is getting sicker because as you grow older and you're making less college and there's less college in content in each trend of hair and ... it gets ten to twenty percent thinner\nBy taking the college and you filled heron you'll see it it's acting younger again as you get older to head gets kind of thin and and and fly away and it just it has no body you take the college and you see the body return you're going to be on your nails they're going to grow like crazy and they're not going to break\nAll of these things have been promoted at college and that helps stabilize phone so you don't lose bone that helped rebuild bone when do you lose most of your bone well for guys it's usually when they're treated for prostate cancer and for gals is the first five years you have to mental pause because that's the ratio to have the\nMost ... after that so it's really important to college in a ... point but they've also shown that our college in helps with joint pain\nAnd in fact the University of Rochester recently did a study using our colleges and they found out it blocks inflammation in your joint literally blocks to things that dissolving disintegrate your cartilage in your joints\nAnd that literally helps\nRebuild joined tissue M. I. T. three studies over many years in the same group of people they've done functional MRI's these powerful imaging tools of the joint and they're finding at a um the joint literally has stabilized oncology and and that it actually rebuilds a little bit now that's a very important point\nWhen you do drugs like Advil and leave\nAnd and and celebrate each day don't stop you from losing joins tissue yes they reduce pain and ... but they don't do anything about the health of the joint itself\nThe college and gets into the joint stops the inflammation stops the damage slightly repairs the joint\nAnd prevents any further erosion of joined tissue\nDish powerful evidence that college in ... that's been studied all over the place like um Penn State university did this wonderful study on almost two hundred and athletes\nAnd when they gave them to college and\nThey gave it twice a day ... day ah the athletes literally couldn't run better that we're getting back to running even switching directions running come on I mean people would arthritic knees are afraid to switch direction afraid to twisted and destroyed or anterior ... ligament\nOr ripped him and his ...\nBy the way college in makes thirty percent of your body by the time you're sixty let me do the math\nUh you've lost about fifty three percent of your college in production\nSo when you take college and it creates the lining of urine test and the valves and your heart the lining up your blood vessels the filters and your kidneys the barrier at the base your spine to keep chemicals out of your brain and bacteria out of your brain is called the blood brain barrier to the barrier in the back of your I called the retinal blood barrier\nThe um all your spine your total ... college in almost\nLike the disks are college in with a little fiber the bones despite all vertebrae are literally almost all college and and the faster joins to hold your spine together to college in\nYour ligaments some tendons are mostly college and so if you're playing golf one of those twisty games like golf or tennis racket ball basketball you have to have college in\nAll the ... what happens is you grow older you attend and stiffen because you don't have college and under like Ninety percent college him\nAnd they rip and then you were in trouble the college and never she used a tendon and it's safer to play tennis it's safer to run a safe in play platform tennis in the winter or basketball or whatever you sport is let's say for the twist and turn when you bowling or playing golf\nSo to college and

probiotics and cold and flu infections\n... pre petty immune system in two different ways and one way probably ought to reduce inflammation that would be involved with your lungs or your liver or your brain\nBy educating the immune system to avoid allergens and to avoid things that are innocuous she knock you wish means not not dangerous that's what a knock you wish means not dangerous\n\nSo when you take a probiotic it's training the immune system relax you shouldn't be allergic to tomato Shaw she shouldn't be allergic to peanuts you know you shouldn't be allergic to dogs and cats and immune system gets retrain to ignore allergies that's cool that's fantastic\nBut on the other hand ... system to attack viruses and bacteria parasites in cancer cells\n[noise] there's two distinct parts of the immune system one part is to controlling management part the adaptive immune system that's where your antibodies already immune oak lobby launched that attacked the flow or cold viruses\n... prepare ... to attack a flu or cold virus much faster\nThan as a second group of cells and is educated part of the immune system called T cells T cells are really important this killer T cells that you could train to recognize the cancer and killed a particular cancer or to kill a particular virus or bacteria\nAnd then there's the controlling she sells like the gamma delta T cells in the helper T cells and so T cells guide the immune system like a smart bomb like a patriot missile to kill a virus\nOr parasite or bacterium\n[noise] but they also turn off the immune system wants to jobs done because you don't want persist and inflammation you want information and the particular site when you have an infection\nShelf you have a lung infection cold and ammonia you want the immune system to be active in the lungs that's called inflammation but wants to pneumonia is gone you don't want the immune system attack in the lungs instead of bacteria it's the T cells that shut it down\nThe probiotic bacteria educate the T cells to do the right thing of controlling the immune system to attack the cancer cell to attack a virus or bacteria and then stop when it's all done\n[noise] and then there's a third sell data EMT that early responders to first responders\nThey called natural killer cells natural killer cells are the first cells to identify a flu virus a cold virus\nBacterial pneumonia or with cancer so and it's been shown even in very elderly people you know an elderly people the immune system becomes compromised it breaks down\nAnd it's not any longer effective it's fighting off cancer efficiently and effectively I mean why do you think cancer is a disease of older people a broken down immune system\n\nThey've shown even an elderly people I have four studies showing this when you give them the strains of bacteria that are in our ... it brings their immune system back into fighting shape within the first two and three weeks\nSo that's why I said start taking a probiotic now flu season a couple of weeks away\nYou know last year the flow broke out faster in California than it did in New York you'd think it was the other way around because it's colder up here so it doesn't matter where you are if the food's coming in from Hong Kong that's where people land\n\nFrom their plane so you want to get your immune system hung humming\nYou want to get the immune system elderly people die from flu because their immune system is not effective anymore it's not efficient [noise] so they wind up with viral pneumonia and it ends dumb or they wind up with the flu going into their brain and ...\nThe ... will help your flu immunized patient work better for your immunized patient for shingles\nHerpes lobster or your ... ... immunization against viral mum a bacterial pneumonia you know the new mold box to the uh the uh uh uh the polysaccharides the pneumococcal polysaccharides vaccine\nIt'll help all those vaccines work better against pneumonia shingles and the fool\nThe ... cause they bring the immune system back into activity the drug companies now that are making them more advanced forms of fighting cancer\nThe checkpoint inhibitors ... two different doctors one Nobel Prizes last week because they may checkpoint inhibitors to fight cancer it's a whole new way of fighting cancer as provoking the immune system to fight the cancer\nThey're finding all these drug companies I spending hundreds of millions of dollars in these advanced cancer technologies they work better with what probiotics but it's not just any strain of probiotic here's the three ... have been shown to have the best impact on your immune system to fight officer\nAnd a fight off bacterial infections even like urine or tract infections factional yeast infections\nIntestinal infections and that's important I'll ... up we'll talk about in such long sections in the sec [noise] um [noise] the ... that help the immune system\nRe emerge and become more solid and much more useful\nMuch more advantageous and fighting with bacteria and the flu and cold and cancer\nAre locked up ... lactobacillus planetarium and the best one is by fetal bacterium and demolish subspecies locked us that's the best one for bringing back the immune system to fight cancer that we know of at this point\nAnd to fight viruses they've shown that when you give a kid in daycare or you're given adult or you get a medical doctor or nurse or elderly people the correct stranger probiotics it cuts down on the number of people who get the flu\nFewer people get colds or flu and not only that but if they do get sick they get healthy quicker\nThey get healthy like two days faster and the symptoms never get out of hand the symptoms never get dangerous it keeps the symptoms way down so if you're taking a probiotic can you do get a cold or flu\nThat's going to be a much milder weaker infection and you're going to get over a lot quicker that's what the researchers shows plus you're less likely to get\nA flu or cold infection but it takes about two or three weeks to build up to that she'll start the probiotic now because colds and flu around the corner\n\nAnd by the way antibiotics they're necessary they save lives if you have an ammonia you certainly want an antibiotic if you have an infection and your skin and you certainly want an antibiotic\nThe problem is the most powerful antibiotics also kill off our good bacteria and what happens the last man standing is ... she ...\nThis is the one people commonly pickup in hospitals that gives them severe diarrhea seed this kills about Nineteen thousand Americans each year why has it causes ... and a drill holes in their intestines and they'd die\nAbout Nineteen thousand Americans die each year in hospitals 'cause they picked up a seat different section in the hospital because the antibiotics don't kill it so when they're treating your pneumonia or your bone infection with antibiotics that social besides killing the infection it's killing off your good bacteria\nThat leaves behind an impossible to eradicate bacterium called C ... facility clustering into facility and clustered in ... in hospital patients commonly causes severe diarrhea and discomfort in gastric pain I mean that's bad enough and they've shown through a number of studies\nI we tested the technology at the Cornell Cornell sit there for ... for advanced technology biotechnology are you back when all clearly has the best technology for bio availability and absorption out of all the co Q. ten on the planet born on\n[noise] so here's this study we need to talk about and sadly I haven't heard about it moves at all it hasn't been on CNN or CBS or NBC or ABC or Fox runny nose\nBut you'll hear it here [noise] they did a study on almost five hundred elderly people in Europe and they gave them you pick one wall for five years now I just started to study these people were in their mid seventies up to the aging Ninety\nYou bet quote on clearly kept these people alive it was preventing heart attacks they reduced the number of people who died because of their heart by fifty three percent and he's really elderly people that's one of heart attacks occur\nShow here's what happened to have gone back there now this is twelve years after the study after the intervention dish still\nA hundred and eighty one people left I mean these people are in the nineties the youngest one now is like eighty something years old\nAnd she didn't last one the great American Medical journal\n[noise] taking a you'll back when all was still keeping these people live there was still a forty percent lower cardiovascular mortality rate in other words they took cubic when all years ago for five years and then they stopped and still many years later they're not having heart attacks\nOr strokes or heart failure or or with me is\nMean this is really something to talk about\nTwelve years after the study ended it still preventing heart attacks and strokes have shown giving older people you back when what keeps them out of hospital improved health related quality of life there more vigorous they're more active and more physically with\nThey've shown through blood tests and hearts scans that the hardest younger ... restless a clearly in less danger\nSo what about people who've had a heart attack now he has had a body works people's parents something are most likely candidates to have that same thing or cover again so in other words somebody who's had a an asthma attack is clearly to pressure most likely to have all an

financial quarterback coming alive with Kay little ... grew yams but we're going to open up the phone lines for those of you have a question for cable now eight hundred three two one zero seven ten don't be bashful ah but Caleb\nHow did you how do you answer people say you're too young to teach them about finance\nAnd I'm really excited to hear your answers book that I Know there's a couple of things I think because of the journey that I that I went on I I took two years to learn and didn't make money in those two years\nI uh really know what I'm Talking about as as long as I can say that and so I I think one of the things is when when usually the guards are up first couple of minutes but there's a reason I wrote a book there's a reason I have a podcast or the reason I'm doing all this stuff is so that like\nThat we can share share knowledge and so people are pretty like once they understand that like I Know my stuff and\nThey trust me I'm it's usually it's usually not a problem at all and then the other thing that I'll say it look it around as most people in our business is going to be around then you need that involves\nUm and and I there is a good chance that I I my I Will live longer than most people in our business because most people in our business are over the age fifty and um and so those are the two things it hasn't been much of an issue I think because of the approach that taken but it it could very well\nI could very well encounter those in the future for sure\n[noise] yeah I mean I tell people I Believe Alexander Hamilton was Twenty one and Seventeen Seventy six many of the founding fathers okay the the people we base our lives upon\nOur constitution our declaration of independence I believe Thomas Jefferson was thirty three when he wrote that for many founding fathers were younger than forty in Seventeen Seventy six in fact a dozen of them were thirty five or younger\nAnd so all we all have the same amount of time you know people always say to me you know ... ... how did you how did you do what you're doing why didn't screw around in my twenties I applied myself so the\nYou know not no judgment that people you know want to have fun you know whatever their twenties but uh you know I got married when I was Twenty one twenty two bumpers house when I was like twenty Twenty one\nSo it's we all the same amount of time and people\nDon't realize that decade from twenty to thirty is one of the most impactful buckets of your life why you could work like two AM and get up at six and you really don't write you really don't feel it I mean I I amassed so much knowledge Marquis de Lafayette was a team James Monroe was Eighteen\nIn Seventeen Seventy six Arab or was twenty\nNathan Hale was Twenty one\nBrings helmet was twenty two governor Morris twenty four Betsy Ross was twenty four James Madison was twenty\n... twenty five uh there's there's much John Paul Jones was twenty eight John J. was thirty Benjamin Rush was thirty he's an unsung hero of um [noise] you know the early colonial era Robert living sim was twenty nine\nAtoms was thirty one Elbert Jerry was thirty one Thomas Jefferson thirty three ... um you know there's more to but you know people don't realize that you can accomplish a lot when you're young right\nHand and we can chop we could probably have a cold conversation on that in some some other time about how the education system I think is really make much grow up later you know I think I saw them in a ... thirty now now the twenty which is quite sad\nMm and that's the thing you know people so everyone does it you know you know not everybody does it there is a counter culture brewing\nAnd you know\nMany people are decrying you know what's going on I'm tired of the the world is going to hell are you know or you know this person does this and the Obama does that and\nAnd my answer is change the children changed the world\nOr reason why we educate our kids are at home I mean these kids know so much more than I did\nAnd I was blessed with the great dad and mom who taught me a lot at home but uh so I so I mean I was probably I was in public school and I just saw how much time I wasted right\nAnd you know nothing against public educators or we have a ton of good ah listeners who are teachers as well my wife is public school teacher but it it just you know\nIt it's a it's a function of time now I Do okay the and as you mentioned pillar number one\nA fish and sea mhm\nAnd we're going to talk to pillar to win three but first we're going to go to the phone lines and we have Ken go ahead Ken your own with Josh Dylan ski and Kayla Williams\nShow just wondering what you think about if you have a non ... life insurance policy\nAnd you're over funded should appoint a ripe before it does not
