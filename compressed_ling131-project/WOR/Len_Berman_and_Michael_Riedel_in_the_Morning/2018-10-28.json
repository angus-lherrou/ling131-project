{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "And number two they never do go back to the education 'cause they've blown up the money they had\nSo what do good students do I talk to them all the time number one\nThey realized in the twenty first century that they can take a laptop anywhere in this world right now it doesn't matter because as long as they have an Internet connection and their laptop\nThey can trade all over the world in fact we had a student named B or and he's in San Diego and a lot of times are students feel it's too hard they can't do it well not only has ... done this and his left his job which is exactly what everybody wants to do right we want to quit a job you don't love to do something we do love\nHe's become a excellent trader and he's also now started funding his wife's real estate business\nSo the two of them are doing something together\nSpending more time together spending more time on vacations in family but the important thing here Ryan is it they're loving what they're doing and there's so many people out there and if you're one of those people hopefully you can see how you can benefit from just learning a skill that can give you the freedom that desire\nYeah absolutely and it's it's kind of interesting is we're as we're sitting here talking about the lifestyle of a traitor I'd just literally receive a text message from a dear friend of mine and it just popped up on my phone and he was actually somebody who got me started in trading he was one of the first people who said this is how you open an account these are the steps that you go through\nIt very very first conversations these just become a lifelong dear friend of mine and he's a huge ski bum he lives up in Salt lake he ... he travels around it as a great time\nHe just texted me with a picture of snow ski saying hey can you use these this season or should I take him to the ... because if I go up to Salt Lake ... bum a pair of skis from him rather than a hall in mind around\nBut it it's just there's just so much freedom that can come with it and it and it really ends up just pulling down to a couple of basic steps a couple of basic as you were saying changes or actions that need to be taking because I think it's very critical it's very important it's it's very powerful once we do understand\nThat that that poor is just the state of mind right that passing over opportunities repeatedly and it's something that can be really easily changed just by stepping out of our comfort zone right just by stepping out of our comfort zone and doing something different we talk a lot about\nKind of cliche statements on the show here but it's because they're so true and they're so useful and it goes back to if we've always done if we always do what we've done will always get what we got and if we're completely satisfied with where we are then then great let's continue to do what made us so happy in the first place\nBut if we want a little bit more for trying to cook it created a little more income if we're trying to create a little more freedom if we have a specific goal\nThat we're trying to accomplish that we haven't been able to get to we have to make the necessary changes and that's one of the life lessons that my grandfather shared with me my whole life growing up he would hold up his five fingers and I would have to ... them the first one is no your business the second one is be converted\nAnd that converted one as a youngster I honestly didn't understand what it meant and as I got involved with trading and I really started to go kind of soul searching down is is this something that's gonna work for me am I going to be able to do this\nThat converted when I started to realize was make the necessary changes the necessary metamorphosis do what's necessary\nAnd and and in the beginning and that was the one I always kind of didn't put as much emphasis on when I was like ten eleven twelve even Eighteen Nineteen twenty you know but then as I really started into my my grown up years I started realizing\nHow be converted that pointer finger of the five to me became the most valuable because if we don't make the necessary changes we're never going to accomplish that kind of outlier goal\nThat were after that one of the things we can do to help a few people get started with this as we've still got a few tickets we can give away let's change some lives right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area\nThat they classes where you see exactly where it takes to really take control of the finances really

Ga Wall Street dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nNow Larry one of the things that I always like to say and I said earlier on the show is doesn't matter if you have two dollars or two million dollars it's all about getting that money working for you and really getting it to generate that income so you can live the lifestyle you can reach the financial freedom goal that you're after\nBut what are some of the things are what are some of the other kind of examples I Know you have your bags and bags loads of these of these examples of our students that you've talked to that we're in one place there now and another well the first thing we always understand here is that with\nTrading it's simply a transfer money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing\nAnd what's really sad is people will get themselves stuck think about just time right now people can sit in front of a television for hours versus going out there and learning a skill that can help them and every year and you were coming up to the holiday season again we started seeing all these Jim commercials again right\n'cause here comes resolution time and one of the things I hear are students say over and over again is beside wishing having had more time was\nThis was the year I Want to get out of debt and I want to turn my finances around and what's amazing is how many students\nCome in through the classes that we're doing right now and simply imagine what their life would be like if they can learn a skill to help them generate more money\nAnd that's the key it's about doing something taking action and getting out there to change your current situation again if you're a coach shovel and something that you are really interested in learning how to do there is no limitations here in fact one of my students June\nShe actually came to my class and she said all she wanted to do is play golf in Costa Rica and so she started realizing that by learning how to trade gave her the time to do that I said it's great just sent me a postcard and she did and she said she was trading 'cause that's a whole nother piece of it\nPeople go on vacation Ryan right and they decorate the vacation they're making money to pay for it and so I asked you or your training before after golf she goes\nBefore of course and I love that of course\nYeah we're talking with a group of students just a little while ago that did a big trip through Europe and I remember him saying\nYou know where we were trading out in Europe and we made as much money out on our trip is we actually spent on the trip so it's kinda fun to come back from a trip with a with a with a flat balance or even being up after having a great after having a great time\nAnd that's the thing is it doesn't matter where you are you just have to have an Internet connection doesn't matter where you are and it doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter what your background is it's all about just proactively identifying good opportunities and that's really what we introduced you to insure you exactly what it takes how to do that\nInside of the half the class and we are pretty much at the end of the show but before we end where you say we do another giveaway\nYeah let's give at least ten more people the opportunity to get some tickets here\nOh right right now we've got a happy class coming up in your area and a half day classes ... exactly what it takes\nTo really reached that financial freedom generating more income in the markets like I always say if you're why is big enough you will find out how how is out at the half the class you know just a second you're going to have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these have to classes to get your bones writing if you're driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluding with your passages are professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like it had senior retirement strategy\nHow to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional insider kitten makes it so you get started right now ... we need you to call now and reserve those seats\nThe number is eight eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up being\nColors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ...

office at Thirteen any for Broadway Broadway and thirtieth street or car office Monday through friday office number\nIs two one two choices to win two choices and that because to into New York city and choices means we truly believe that you most likely have choices to make not just the one option that the surgeon or the one option that the chemo doctors given most likely many different choices and we try to be fair and honest\nAnd open and candid each person who has\nCancer or suspect that cancer is is the work that we do here at their too many for Broadway\nDon't talk about a gentleman who was Seventy five years old he's married with one daughter who stick around them up the coast in Rome was her tumors of the hearing nerves that\nCome off the brainstem a little nerve comes off the brainstem is a little nerve that comes off the brainstem and goes into the ear responsible for hearing and\nBalance well again sad to say you went to one of the super poop or big hospitals twenty five years ago for an acoustic ... our mind you that twenty five years ago we had already brought stereo tactic brain radio surgery to New York the first one where they were laughing and\nDemeaning me that they had competition with Dr Lederman for brain where do surgery they caught on this man\nThey cut on his brain they cut on this nerve they left it with facial paralysis that left his arm\nAnd like a week and they left to death and that's how he's been for twenty five years he had a stroke during surgery because of that surgery has been incapacitated and down weak on his left side of the body headache come to us based on our numbers his success rate would have been higher Ninety seven percent\nAnd most likely would have stable or better hearing and the likelihood of a stroke is about zero and the likelihood of damage to their face is about zero so it would have been dramatically different if his surgeon twenty five years ago told this gentleman\nThat he could have radio surgery Dr Lederman there's already been in existence since Nineteen sixty nine\nData available so the difference between non invasive treatment which would have left him with his face intact there's less of a body intact that would have avoided the stroke would have given them stereo hearing would have taken away his\nHearing and left to death like that surgery busy meant\nSo here we have two cases to people to human beings might be you or your neighbors severely severely impaired one man left impotent incontinent with Rick current prostate cancer after robotic surgery won a person who had an acoustic aroma they opened up his had at one\nOf the biggest hospitals left to death with facial paralysis and left side of the weakness and the stroke which never improved all huge differences had those patients only been told you might wish to go see Dr Lederman about\nRadio surgery rather than surgery only if the surgeon told the patient their options the surging could've honestly said I Do surgery but you might want to see Dr Lederman he has the most experienced doctor with radio surgery pinpoint non invasive treatment around you can see him and get a second opinion and then decide\nBut neither one of these patients was given an option and both of these patients have suffered\nTerribly from surgery that went\nAwry and that usually goes right and that's why we're here today talking

children chicken with her\nSon and daughter for a uterine cancers diagnosed in two thousand Fifteen\nCheddar uterus or move that's called a total abdominal hysterectomy at one of the big hospitals in New York City and she's gonna chemotherapy ever since and she has about a set of cancer and the doctors in two years she's had radical surgery two years of chemo they've given her no reports\nNo cat scans no PET scans no record low pathology and she came to my office wondering what she has\nWell I told her the most likely what she has if she's getting two years of chemo as you've got cancer out of control and they're planning\nJust to give her a came of probably for the rest of her life and we're getting our records who called up big hospital and get a new scans were staging are up and seeing what she has and where it is and what the treatment options are she's getting came out she was losing weight she's suffering\nShe doesn't like it and she finally learned\nThat there's another way and the other way is to be educated and to get the reports understand where the cancer is and what the options are just because she has cancer shed the have surgery question mark number one number two because she had cancer she needs lifelong chemo usually if someone's getting a lifelong came up means it's came out that doesn't work\nAnd then if Kim was not work and\nWhy are they giving lifelong came about what we know that chemo even want to work sooner you only go for a few months so you're getting chemo for more than that something suspicious and I know that came up people love to give a lifelong came oh it's great for the camera people it was great for a big hospital there's a little bit of gospel it's great for the\nPharmaceutical industry it's great for everybody but this patient and were doctors and we're here for the patient and we're here to educate the patient and find out where the cancer is an offer the patient all the\nOptions not just lifelong chemo and keep people in the dark and don't explain anything to anybody and give more chemo and more chemo and more chemo courage in two years of chemo and never being told what you have and where it\nIs or giving any records that's what's happened to this woman and finally she listened actually a listener like you told her you better go see a\nDoctor Lederman and find out what's going on a listener and we know the listeners save lives in fact our website is listeners save lives dot\nCom because after listening to the show you learn things and are educated and can provide information to your loved ones and friends and even people down the street that barely know like those people those listeners who told this woman this time to end two\nYears of useless ... useless chemo and come and see a fresh second opinion it was the listener it wasn't her doctor told her ... is ... not work and know that doctors\nShould have told her about the um the chemo was not working you better go see Dr leader when so he can explain what you have to wear your hair\nOther than what the true options are that sort of doctors should have said her doctors should have said call Dr Lederman his phone numbers to win two choices is up there to the fore Broadway it takes most insurance is Medicare Medicaid this is the work that he does and you can get better most likely with\nTo help me out because this woman has a solitary plausible site Tom up and she needs your help I can tell you there's plenty of doctors who send their patients to us there's plenty of our\nPatients who are doctors like the doctor I told her just a few minutes ago prominent surgeon who came to us for treatment of his coma and so yes we have information and yes we see your patience and many doctors are listening to this show\nMany doctors call and tell me that they themselves get most of their cancer treatment information out of\nOur show every day on the radio why because it's interesting why it's true stories why it tells you what happens to the patient why it tells you what happens when patients go to other places and get chemo or surgery that can be so\nToxic often in comparison to our invisible beams focus being non invasive treatment where we have a team of experts to treat each patient my name is Dr Lederman\nAnd I want to talk about a woman who was Seventy two years old born in New York has a right breast cancer ... cancer she's Seventy two she's married with one child she called a mass in the breast\nFour years ago and she had a biopsy three years ago showed a masked behind\nThat ... it was a lot of people are carcinoma she works at one of the biggest hospitals in the area and the surgeon wanted to do a mastectomy and the patient refused and then she went to another surgeon another big hospital and that sort of didn't want to ... to me too and now the cancers growing\nShe never had treatment remember it's been four plus years and the cancer is growing the skins involve\nThe nipples distorted depressed as distorted the skin is turning red she'll never smoke\nShe's a hundred and twelve pounds five foot two ... a couple of years ago showing masked behind the right nipple now it's converge she's come to us for treatment and we're offering treatment to save her breast that's what she wants and it's sad that the surgeon\nNever offered her breast conserving therapy\nMany women most to him and I see do not want to lose their breast did not want to go through radical surgery when I came to New York Ninety seven percent of women with breast cancer we're getting mastectomies whereas in my practice at Harvard Medical school where I trained Ninety percent of women were keeping their breast why would it be at Harvard\nIn my practice Ninety percent of women were keeping their breast who had breast cancer whereas in those big hospitals Ninety seven percent\nOf the women were getting mastectomies why is that why the difference the women were different but sometimes it seems like the surgeon so the big hospitals want to maximize the surgery whereas here Dr later when we want to minimize the surgery or avoid surgery treat the\nPatient keep the patient's body as best as possible attack and is such a huge difference twice so many women with breast cancer come here to Thirteen before Broadway and there's more than two hundred thousand women each year in America with breast cancer\nSo so important for women to examine their breasts and get mammograms have ... give us a call\n... doesn't mean you have to have missed activate give us a call or two one two choices who went to two four six forty two thirty seven and you'll get an advocate and you'll learn about all the options not just removing the breast which is a sad option for most women\nAnd it seems like that's what the surgeon slumped recommend most commonly obviously a lot of research in the same as if in my experience so often women are pushed to have more extensive surgery then they could avoid so give us a call two one two choices to one to two four six forty two thirty seven\nAnd a very good news that a patient with a very good analysis of the man is fifty nine years old born in New York City's murder for kids as to heart\nFailure and cholesterol blood pressure and the beginning of this year he sort of big nose bleeds and it was seen that too big hospitals in New York City but the burden zero when the anti biopsies and he was found to have a cancer inside his nose\nAnd the cancer was confirmed with cat scans and em arise and PET scans and he was recommended to remove all of his nose\nIs a fifty nine year old man married with kids and they went to two big hospitals and they wanted to remove this cancer by removing his whole knows all this is a cancer that went for the rights of those inside\nThe left side of those all the way up to the brain\nAll the way up to the brain probably the basis go is recommended that removal of the nose sinus he refused did\nHe went to another surgeon who only wanted to ... them well their cancer was involving the whole nose up to the brain surgeon want to do too much surgery removing the old knows or then too little surgery removing only to stop them and he refused\nThat as well get a blockage he couldn't breathe through the nose he was bleeding he came to me the massive distortion of the nose you can imagine was like a huge mass inside the nose is growing and growing growing distorting the nose unable to breathe\nLeading and that's how he came to me I examined him I talked to about all the options went to multiple doctors in multiple hospitals no one ever talked to him about non invasive treatment to save his nose and save his life\nWell here we did in here I did and I spoke to him and examined him\nAnd he trusted us and we treated him\nAnd we just got a new scan and\nThe cancer is gone he has his nose\nHe has his life we've got a new skin cancer is gone he's breathing through the nose the bleeding has stopped and I kind of knew this was going to happen because after some of the treatments went by you said Dr I could breathe again the bleeding is stopping again the masses gone the pain is gone so I\nHad a very good idea this cancer was going away\nAlmost melting with our treatment\nAnd now we have do scans showing the cancers\nGone he turned to me the doctor leader but am I going to be your new poster child

D D GM has more\nAnd also I feel like it's helped me and my life to have more influence and do good for others and and both of us actually came to that agreement that we felt by by being married that we could do more for others and and that's proved to be the case\nSo I felt like you know just to give you an example that's just a way of taking it even higher\nI Love that mark that's such a practical answer really gives you some specific stats that uh you know we all can tank especially now in to our next question from I'm Dorothy in Boston and she writes what are some practices I can adopt\nTo stay happy common I'm stressed each day I find that sometimes it feels like a roller coaster and I just want to stay in a war a free state of joy\nYeah that's good and Dorothy I say I've discovered this really does take discipline you know I found to get off\nThe rollercoaster this rollercoaster that you're talking about I think is something that we all have to deal with at some point and um\nI found that the roller coaster actually comes from focusing on the world you know thinking like a worldly woman or man in a world of lack in competition and comparisons and pride striving for self worth looking to others for validation and so forth\nAnd that keeps us on a rollercoaster with you know some days we have highs and some days we have loews\nAgain I feel first of all the desire to discover and express our spiritual self who we really are as God's Children find our connection or one this with God\nIs what will really steady us and bring that deep joy and satisfaction that we want to feel especially if we want to contribute more to the good of the world a piece of the world you know and help others\nI Know for me early on in my spiritual growth in study in the in the scriptures and so forth I I was definitely on a roller coaster and\nUh I I discovered it and and uh what I what I discovered was that I Would study the Bible I Would pray and\nI Would get to feeling really good and really hot and\nThen once I started feeling really good I sort of left my studies and my prayer behind you know I kinda is like almost like and I didn't need God so much because things were going so well but inevitably I'd always start heading back down\nThe roller coaster and I ... I went back to my books and my prayer and I get back up and things will be going good and\nAnd then I'd drop it again and I found myself going up and down that way and finally I saw you know mark why don't you just stay with it you know even in the good times even when you're feeling really inspired day with your studies stay with your prayer\nKeep got in your life\nAnd by doing that I found that I've been able to maintain are very steady life and happiness and satisfaction\nAnd also if you'd like to know I mean there's some things I Do specifically each day to keep myself inspired I I pray the Lord's Prayer every day for one thing and I don't I don't just say the words but I really think about it uh it's amazing how I can continue to be inspired by that\nEvery day I go over some other things that you know like a Mary Baker eddy wrote a scientific statement of being in it just a really wonderful\nThat just gets your thought on the right track of you know that we're spiritual and not material that were gods expression his image it reminds us of that\nUm and and key to it for me has been the Bible lesson a weekly Bible less than that the Christian Science church puts out it's just phenomenal\nIt's a citations from the Bible and then passages from science and health with key to the scriptures that throw light on a spiritual meaning of the Bible verses\nUm and it's on a particular subject and can be the subject of about God or about\nA life different subjects and you study that all week and it helps me pray it gives me ideas to take into my day with whatever I'm doing\nAnd that has been a phenomenal as far as as it costs to practice and I'll I'll just say one other thing you could read Jesus sermon on the mound again in chapters five to seven in the book of Matthew in the Bible [laughter] that are really help\nAnd that'll also give you a lifetime of things to do to stay satisfied to stay happy ... and then I'll just share if just one quick experience that I had them in high school\nOf how much this actually works in my high school what we did on the weekends was always went to parties or we're just parties every weekend and all my friends were like they would drink and and take drugs at a party so they could have fun [laughter]\nAnd I didn't do that because I I had already decided even in middle school that you know I could find a high I could find enjoyment just through lending God's goodness and love be expressed through me\nAnd so I asked myself one time but how can I prepared to go to these parties because they weren't always that much fun for me\nAnd I thought well you know they prepare by drinking and taking drugs and stuff well it came to me as I prayed God told me you know read science and health again which helps explain the scriptures\nAnd so I decided to do that so every time before I went to a party I Would just take the book\nAnd it ran them open it and just read until I felt a shift in thought and it would usually only just be a couple of pages but it I realized how it was changing my side just in just in that little bit of time of reading it always reminded me who I was that I was God's child\nAnd that I was his expression now the first chapter genesis tells us were made an image and liked to serve God\nSo if God is love which the Bible says than I Am an expression of law so I found it always shifted my thought from thinking I Wonder who's going to be at the party you know what am I going to be able to do what am I going to be able to get\nAs I read science and health I remembered wait a minute I'm an expression of love I'm going to go to the party to give I'm going to go to share I'm going to go to help and support people that's why I'm going to go and I did that and I had so much fun I mean it made my life so happy in fact\nKids would come up to me in high school and there were like wow would ever drug you're you're taking the could you share it with me you know [laughter] but that's how they they saw they say wow you're just always so up and so happy and and that was I mean that's a real real experience but arrogant just brain got into my life\nI Love that now this next question has NO NAME but it doesn't have a location and Washington D. C. and it really goes in a different direction and the questionnaire rights\nI think the question is selfish I spend more time asking how can I really make a difference I wouldn't be happy if all my own needs are met and others around me were suffering\nI think this really gets to the heart of the matter actually I think the question looked at a certain way can sound selfish how can I experience a satisfying life you know those down\nVery selfish but the dichotomy here is that we end up experiencing satisfaction by doing just what you were talking about giving to others serving others lifting up uh they're seeing others around as\nWho need help and helping them that is our satisfaction and [laughter] you know and what what did\nJesus do I mean he washed his disciples feet\nYou know and he said that example for us in the world's way of thinking they should have washed his feet since he was a master and he said who is wherever of you will be the cheapest she'll be servant of all\nAnd so that's why we don't follow with the world teaches we have to have spiritual teaching if we want to be satisfied it might be interesting to think about the fact that Jesus had to make a decision\nHimself about what kind of life he was going to live he was tempted to use his knowledge and power and have great worldly game for himself\nYou know he he could have been quite a leader with riches and all the things in the world in the Bible it tells you know the the devil tempted him and took him up on a high mountain and showed him all the bridges and glory and said you know just\nWorship me and I'll give you all this stuff and of course he chose not to do that he said it's written in the Bible to worship the lord your God and he only you shall serve which is what he did he he chose that\nAnd he knew that that was the only thing he can be satisfied with you\nAnd have a house that we know of or a wife or children or he didn't take vacations um you didn't have a yacht you know he went around doing good\nFreeing people from the destruction of sin disease and poverty and even death and he ultimately laid down his life or others you know in one of the most gruesome ways the crucifixion\nToday's show is provided for entertainment and general information purposes opinions expressed are those are the presenter Ollie we make no promises are guarantees of investment performance online training academy is not a broker dealer certified financial planner or registered investment advisor enjoy the show [noise]\nTo the show is your first time\nNames right side of that has always been my great friends to restructure the officer down the street is who everyone\nWants to be like and that is because he is the brains of the operation out here that's for sure\nBut I got Larry out here and Larry first question for you is how you doing doing great Ryan how you doing I'm doing wonderful excited to be out here with you all doing the show this week we have a lot of fun\nDoing this show and talking to you our financial family out there across the airwaves and one of the things we always focus the vast majority of our time and I would say every time we get on the air and every time we can get you know in front of a group of people is really talking about income and talking about how to\nHow to generate more income inside of the financial markets and one of the things we always stress and I and I know we'll spend a lot of time on it here today is how to really get that consistent growth that consistent income in the markets\nWhether the markets are going up and whether the market's going down and whether the market's going sideways and and that's really the the key is because there's three directions and and as individuals were very comfortable with the buying hold kinda bullish mentality of you know we we invest into this we invest into that and we hold it for a long time and hopefully when we hit retirement it's just worth uh it's just worth a heck of a whole lot more\nNow what are the things I Want to get some of your feedback on it's always a a fun show starter is really the consistency side of things because really if we're going to have consistent growth in the market we can't be directional Lee dependent than what I mean by that is we can't\nOnly profit if the market goes in one direction I don't I don't know about you but one of my favorite things\nWhen I teach at half day classier it on a train economy one of my favorite things is to really work with the class and get them to viewed down markets as opportunities not just bad things you know so many times the down markets are viewed as oh that's so bad 'cause people are losing money and all that is true if we're just in that bullish biased as markets are going down\nWith the right knowledge and what the right skills those can be viewed as as great opportunities to make money I mean if you go back through some of the major\nCrashes that we've experienced and you can you can find the source of the world the pulses of the world and you can find the the word billionaire next to their name at the end of a lot of these crashes and so it's always interesting how how how maybe millions are made on the way up the billions are made on the way down\nAnd it really just boils back to consistency we want to make money we want to make money on the way up and we want to make money on the way down but what are some of the things you guys are working on what the students right now or some of the some of the new tools you and your instructor team are are are laying out there right now or to help people become more consistent than less direction dependent instead of the markets\nWill this last week it's been beautiful I mean everything we've been talking about on the show together I'm Talking about this for weeks now waiting for the opportunity to see the markets correct and come back down and as a result what happens starting off at the end of last week into this week as we got everybody's wish that\nThe market started coming down it comes down three times faster than it goes up and a lot of our students were taught that once that market goes down you could actually make money shorting the market it's called shorting where you're actually selling in the market\nAs opposed to most who by the markets so a lot of our students shift from that fear of oh my God the market's going down I don't know what to do I'm gonna lose money to well I can actually learn how to make money if the markets go down it's simply doing what the banks do\nBig banks are always out there to make money by the markets go up down sideways and what a lot of our students seeing we tell them is do you see how this would benefit you by learning how to trade in more than just one direction\nAnd when you look at even the difference between let's even just say a mutual fund versus a hedge fund and the mutual fund is generally just investing into a long position and they called a mutual fund 'cause it's this joint effort between us and the financial institution but it only makes money as the markets are going up but it doesn't mean that strategy is never useful and that that product is never useful that's not what I'm trying to get out here\nBut as it's going down those phones are generally losing money and we're paying fees to be involved there to be invested into that fund you look at the hedge funds type strategy and and that word hedge is pretty critical because\nHedge is meaning that there is a position that profit on the way up and there's also protection or even a position to could profit on the way down and so when you start looking at things as far as the market's going there's multiple directions in the market the up down into sideways\nIt's critical to make sure that we have strategies kind of liked that hedged mentality that can make money if the markets are going up down or sideways and you're one of the things I talked about in one of my classes a long time ago was or wasn't managing if you went to work then they said hey you know what\nWe really like you you're a great candidate we think he'd be a great fit for the company\nBut you can expect to be laid off one third of the time one third of the time we're not going to pay a\nYou know and that's really what happens if we're only trading any bullish direction anytime the markets are going sideways our retirement account or income account is laid off\nAnytime the markets are going down a retirement account or income account is is laid off not to not to even bring up the fact that maybe it's it's deteriorating a little bit especially as the markets are going down\nBut what are the things that we can do is always okay with you Larry when things that we can do is we have a big stack of tickets right here we are just kicking the show off we've got a bunch of tickets we can give away and we can help a few people out there get started becoming more consistent in the market by by doing a quick little give away for these passes that are too are half the class is what do you say let's do it\nAll right well right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area\nThey have their classes while you'll see exactly what it takes to be more consistent in the market making money generate more income as the market's going up down or sideways now the happy classes about three hours long and if you would have set a passes to these half day classes\nThat is going to be your investment just a little bit of time spent three hours of your time any financial education scenario rather than maybe on social media or watching TV sounds like a good investment\nTo me one just a second you're gonna have a chance to win instead of these passes or one of the half day classes to get your bones ready and if you are driving now is a good time to pull over included with your passes is going to be a professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nLessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional inside of it makes it so you can get started right now\n... we need you to call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com and see if you can score\nSome passes there there is we stay on kind of this consistency track of this this consistency conversation I should say\nYou know you talked a little bit of a a little bit about shorting and that is a great opportunity make to make money as the market going down what are some of the other ways that people can diverse into different directions you know we hear diversification as far as I Do have a little commodities have little stocks have little bones but how 'bout diversification as far as\nDifferent directional vehicles go well you can always sit here and say we know that when the markets go down there's usually people pulling out of the markets\nAre the Martin he's going somewhere either could go into gold it can go into bonds the cool thing that our students learn here is it doesn't matter your background your age what you've done before we teach them how to read a chart so it's a stock short bond chart gold shark\nThey're able to start learning how to trade in the beauty of learning what shorting is\nIs that again a lot of people have been told their whole lives when the markets go down it's a bad thing will last February Goldman Sachs may two hundred million dollars in one day by simply Shorty in the market now that day imagine that we did a little piece of I'm not going to be greedy you know but if you start to learn how to treat like the banks do then it's amazing\nThat all of a sudden you can start learning a skill that can make your money and not have to sit there and think about a second job or to get into a bit later\nBut one of the ways I look at this and I get this analogy all the time when people are simply trading one direction or they're waiting for the market to always go up it's like a car imagine that you were told you can get in a car tomorrow and you can drive somewhere but you can't put the car and reverse\nYou're going to go in a lot of circles eventually going to get there but you could waste a lot of time energy and money getting to the same place if you simply had all the tools to get you there faster so a lot of what I'm seeing our students learning for the first time is it they're becoming\nDirection ... they don't care if it goes up down or sideways as long as the markets are moving they can learn how to make money and what a lot of them are seeing right now is they could create more freedom for themselves because they're able to make money no matter where the markets go\nYeah absolutely and I love I Love the analogy of the car and there's so many so many other analogy that we could pull into this but in in I always say in real life you know outside of the are investing life\nIn our normal everyday life we there's no way we buy a car that didn't go in reverse right but so many times we find ourselves in investments that only have one direction or one avenue where they can profit\nYou know it's it's the same thing you go back to our you know go back to high school education and where was your stock picking class where it was how to balance a checkbook class right the law to check it out right I just dated myself victory over there but it is it true though I mean we we really didn't have that stuff and so we're left to\nTo rely on the quote unquote professionals truly guide us through this process where unfortunately they make a commission off of these transactions and I say unfortunately kinda tongue in cheek there because that's okay with me that they make a commission that's that's\nWhat they do for a living your real estate brokers make a commission when they sell real estate so stockbrokers should naturally make a commission when they sell stocks\nBut when we buy a home it is up to it was up to the individual to make sure that they are buying the right home for them in the right market place in the right area that the right payment the right everything it's up to the person to do it\nThe broker just completes the transaction and unfortunately it's up to the person to also make sure that they're making the appropriate decision when it comes to their investing but when it really boils down to about Ninety nine percent of the world\nThey can trade all over the world in fact we had a student named B or and he's in San Diego and a lot of times are students feel it's too hard they can't do it well not only is beyond done this and has left his job which is exactly what everybody wants to do right we want to quit a job and I love to do something we do love\nHe's become a excellent trader and he's also now started funding his wife's real estate business\nSo the two of them are doing something together\nSpending more time together spending more time on vacations and family but the important thing here Ryan is it they're loving what they're doing and there's so many people out there and if you're one of those people hopefully you can see how you can benefit from just learning a skill that can give you the freedom that you desire\nYeah absolutely and it's it's kind of interesting is we're as we're sitting here talking about the lifestyle of a traitor I'd just literally received a text message from a dear friend of mine and it just popped up on my phone and he was actually somebody who got me started in trading he was one of the first people who said this is how you open an account these are the steps that you go through\nIt very very first conversations these just become a lifelong dear friend of mine and he's a huge ski bum he lives up in Salt lake you just easy travels around it as a great time\nHe just texted me with a picture of snow skis saying hey can you use these this season or should I take him to the ... because if I go up to Salt Lake I use these ... from and rather than a hall in mind around but it it's just there's just so much freedom that can come with it and it and it really ends up just pulling down to a couple of basic steps a couple of basic as you were saying\nChanges or actions that need to be taking because I think it's very critical it's very important it's it's very powerful once we do understand\nThat that that poor is just the state of mind right that passing over opportunities repeatedly and it's something that can be really easily changed just by stepping out of our comfort zone right just by stepping out of our comfort zone and doing something different we talk a lot about\nKind of cliche statements on the show here but it's because they're so true and they're so useful and it goes back to if we've always done if we always do what we've done will always get what we got and if we are completely satisfied with where we are then then great let's continue to do what made us so happy and the first place\nBut if we want a little bit more for trying to create a little more income if we're trying to create a little more freedoms we have a specific goal\nThat we're trying to accomplish that we haven't been able to get to we have to make the necessary changes and that's one of the life lessons that my grandfather share with me my whole life growing up he would hold up his five fingers I Would have to name all of them the first one is no your business the second one is be converted\nAnd that converted one as a youngster I honestly didn't understand what it meant and as I got involved with trading and I really started to go kind of soul searching down is is this something that's gonna work for me am I going to be able to do this\nThat converted when I started to realize was make the necessary changes the necessary metamorphosis do what's necessary\nAnd and and in the beginning and that was the one I was kind of didn't put as much emphasis on when I was like ten eleven twelve even Eighteen Nineteen twenty you know but then as I really started into my my grown up years I started realizing\nHow be converted that pointer finger of the five to ... became the most valuable because if we don't make the necessary changes we're never going to accomplish that kind of outlier goal\nThat were after that one of the things we can do to help a few people get started with this as we still got a few tickets we can give away let's change some lives right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area\nThey have to constantly see exactly what it takes to really take control of the finance has really taken truly a retirement account generate more income inside of the market's really lived that life that drafter and just a second you can have a chance to win a set of passes one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a good time to pulled over\nIncluded with your passes it's going to be our professional insiders kid now this professional insider kit makes it so you can get started right now ... century twenty when you get a call now and reserve those\nSeats the number is eight eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry\nBut that but it is up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com and see if you can score surpasses they're\nNow they're one of the things that I always like to say and I said earlier on the show is doesn't matter if you have two dollars or two million dollars it's all about getting that money working for you and really getting it to generate that income so you can live the lifestyle you can reach the financial freedom goal that you're after\nBut what are some of the things are what are some other kind of examples I Know you have your bags and bags loads of these these examples for our students that you've talked to that we're in one place there now and another well the first thing we always understand here\nIs that with trading it's simply a transfer money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing\nAnd what's really sad as people will get themselves stuck think about just time right now people can sit in front of a television for hours versus going out there and learning a skill that can help them and every year and they were coming up to the holiday season again we can start seeing all these Jim commercials again right\nCause here comes resolution time and one of those things I hear a students say over and over again is beside wishing having had more time was\nThis was the year I Want to get out of debt and I want to turn my finances around and what's amazing is how many students\nCome in through the classes that we're doing right now and simply imagine what their life would be like if they can learn a skill to help them generate more money\nAnd that's the key it's about doing something taking action and changed your current situation again if your coach shovel and something that you are really interested in learning how to do there is no limitations here in fact one of my students June\nShe actually came to my class and she said all she wanted to do is play golf in Costa Rica and so she started realizing that by learning how to trade gave her the time to do that I said it's great just sent me a postcard and she did and she said she was trading 'cause that's a whole nother piece of it\nPeople go on vacation Ryan right and they decorate the vacation they're making money to pay for it and so I asked you or your training before after golf she goes oh\nBefore of course it a little bit of course\nYeah we're talking with a group of students just a little while ago but the big trip through Europe and I remember him saying\nYou know where we were trading out in Europe and we made as much money out on our trip as we actually spent on the trip and so it's kinda fun to come back from a trip with a with a with a flat balance or even being up after having a great uh after having a great time\nAnd that's the thing is it doesn't matter where you are you just have to have an Internet connection it doesn't matter where you are and it doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter what your background is it's all about just proactive we identify good opportunities and that's really what we introduced you to show you exactly what it takes how to do that inside of the half the class and we are pretty much at the end of the show but before we end we say we do know the giveaway\nYeah let's give at least ten more people the opportunity to get some tickets here\nOh right right now we've got a happy class coming up in your area and a half the

I was just the uh excited and eager to see what was happening and\nI Walk into the locker room in the Bible or just shredded just torn up Britain's ages all over the floor you could barely even see the carpet because all you saw was just shredded ages I Will say where\nI was devastated because once again I failed at trying to find the purpose on that team and trying to find when I got a place to be there\nOn that USC football team and so I was crushed in it was very disheartening and you can imagine that it's a discouragement station and and the doubt\n... and it was it was really tough and we go through the rest of the week and we play in the rose bowl and there's an incredible experience from football perspective but\nFrom a a ... to stay in a purpose perspective I completely sales and just a few days after Rose Bowl game one of my teammates or kick her name's Mario he tragically passed away in the middle of the night Twenty one years old and\nI was crushed because here he was one of my closest friends on the team and just dealing with death at that young women age was just very challenging and we go to a funeral a few days later and on top of his casket\nWas they carried her down the center Iowa's the Bible at placing his locker and it was just a an incredible moment of a divine comfort for me so I got to the streets you know and just kind of acknowledging what I'd done and it was just so awful for me to to move through that time and and moved to the creation\nIt was incredible and then years later I ended up taking a job with coach Carroll at the Seattle Seahawks a thousand miles up the coast and um I moved to Seattle and I didn't know anyone and I'm starting to meet people and I run into a former teammate of mine\nJust random set of circumstances there then I come across in a small little town outside Seattle and he starts telling me that his last it totally turn around and the last few years and it started with the Bible that were placed in the locker\nWithin the last week round the team together and I'm I'm floored because I hadn't thought about these bibles and years and he starts telling me that he saw\nMario or kicker sitting in his locker thumbing through the Bible one morning saying what is this\nAnd Taylor this guy was he met a man who had reconnected with years later starts telling me that he turned around and screamed out tomorrow ... have you never seen a Bible for system I\nDidn't think much of it and for some reason you turn around and decided to sit down next Mario and eat critic grown up in the church Taylor this guy that reach next to this and\nDecided to just take Marta through the Bible and Mario never gone through a Bible for and\nIt was just an incredible encounter yeah that that got had reached out and touch Mario's lush there and just his final days on her and Taylor said for the rest of the week every spare moment Mario and he was reading the Bible we couldn't get enough and he was learning about God started a relationship with God\nAnd then just days later passes away and goes to head and it's an incredible story of got to stay for in his purpose for all of us whether we can see the results are not in the moment it\nJust didn't know and to trust the gun is working that he is doing amazing things in our lives um to really impact people around us the love of the people around us\nAnd now

influence on the discourse and one of his\nVery dear and great friends is David Gibson who's calling in from Rome Dave thanks for being with us here in the arena\nThat they are just so sad is that name but you know as a as a song feet up in marijuana is now legal\nYeah in New York anyway it ...\nIt ... it and then we don't have an ... let's say at least we got\nA ... it's a natural liberal that you are listening game you're honoring room with religion new services uh I thought you went and got honest work at Fordham University if you can consider the academia honest work\nI did I did but that was a year ago how long did you think I could\nLaugh they fired you already you\nKnow they said look they look at it yet all over here and look for on the Senate on ... wonderful event and they said look at a job where jazz with the university you go go with golf myself so I'm over here for the last few days and it's it's an amazing is that good ever think\nIt here in the Vatican the church to be more open responsible of assaulted and and and as flexible than it is a backyard in North America\nDo you get the sense David that day the churches burning down sort of like you get the sense of that here in the United states\nIf they're not as a very interesting contrast ... cents obviously as a wheel urgency crisis but you know\nIt's also the awareness and they ... they they are pushing it to get on the Senate to address the clergy abuse crisis which it will in its final docket so to them but they also have so many other issues kids from all around the world who also want to raise up some really important to\nOther issues as well you know the church can walk and chew yell at the same time so they certainly not a ... ... is the addressing it is but they also have to continue the same time to be able to continue the other nations\nNow a days but if you can stand by for one second I Want to bring into the conversation someone who's a very well known to you another guy who's gone out and got honest work leaving the world of journalism for the whole some work working for the church grant ... grant welcome to in the arena welcome back\nHey everybody jak brand where are you calling in from\nI'm calling from Chicago Illinois it's a small Midwestern city on a lake\nIs it ... where is that what state is that in the state of Illinois oh you're may turn out to the Illinois okay [laughter] grant you know who's with us is David Gibson your good friend he's on both the tones yeah a grant that now the\n... yeah what was that the Vatican has the east and granted there is that in West or wherever ... all I Do not\nListen a grant that they was just saying how optimistic things are in Rome and especially as a result of the youth Senate or you're a boss according to play stupid she's in Rome do you get a sense that things coming out from the Senate or very optimistic forward thinking for the life of the church\nI I think so we we actually um one of the delegates as a local Chicago and woman\nAs a public relations guy I'm Glad you said you are optimistic about it if you did in that I Would say you're really mad at your job\nWell I mean in this case actually mean I think you know that one of probably covered this already so forgive me if I'm covering ground that the ... well trod but I think one of the most important things about meetings like this and that\nIs to bring the global church together into actual contact with one another so that a\nBishops and church leaders and delegates from all over the globe can see what it what the the what the struggles with the challenges with the hopes of their co religion is our who may live on a completely different continent\nAnd so I think that's one of the things that's coming out of the Senate if to see what the churches like everywhere and for its leaders to encounter that difference and learn from it\nOr do you guys have a sense so we were having an earlier conversation with another colleague who's known will you Matthew Schmitz and one of the things that we were speaking about is a situation in the way for the church and and uh you know I had said\nThat there seems to be a convergence that the right and left seem to want to burn things down a bit right now bill Tucker in ... so you know when you get these Protestants and they\nLove revolutions uh he basically said well revolutions are good or do you think that we're in the midst of a revolution and is that a good thing\nTo have this um [laughter] uh I mean I I I think I think\nI think we are in the midst of a revolution in terms of our understanding\nOf how the church is structured so you know what what we've seen in the wake of this most recent wave of scandals is a very strong call including from bishops for much more a significant lay involvement some bishops who have you been called for lay oversight when it comes to\nA accusations against bishops about that with something that was not on the table and two thousand two uh and so this is a moment of I think well we awakening of the essential role that lay people play in the governance of\nOf our church Dave [noise]\nYeah I I I think that's true that Pope Francis has a great line she just repeated a uh yesterday that to um hey how's the culture that this is not an era of change\nA change of air and it will the church has gone through so many it is a paradigm shifts they call from the church comes a time to the ... church allow it will be saying I'll fundamental ... fall and I think\n... like ... to the violence sounding alert because it is it's an evolution more than a level she happening quite quickly and it has to if the church is to the land is viable\nAll four of these younger generations especially\nYou know we were talking a little bit about how our religious discourse parallels our political discourse bill or want to share some of your thoughts on that and let's get some of the reaction these guys I'm if I was going to say jokers but I don't want to say that on the radio when you get these guys on the phone and get to hear what they have to think about\nIt it certainly uncomfortable period in a in a news discourse that we don't live in there is a tone to the discourse that we don't like but sometimes I was I said earlier I think that is it is necessary\nThat we undergo these periods because it helps us sort out our priorities it helps us understand better who we are and what we want an end and listening to the conversation with David and and with with grand I ... I was curious because\nUh my favorite guests does not religious uh my favorite guess Scott Hamilton because I had\nTo have handled sit on the\nOh man he but he was he thought he was very well spoken and I was a huge fan of his for years so it was great\nBut what questions do you have for the ladies\nI don't I don't know I mean do you write these this is the power right do my left is the power behind the show the head of the people who made it happen and maybe come come forward every week\nAnd I guess are kind of you know my my question is what is it that that you're gonna miss about the show you know ... it's\nDirected ... because you're the executive producer so what\nDo I I think as as I as I said before I'm and myth that you ... the unique opportunity at the ... the the shell a show like this\nUh it is offering people and that's I think what I'm going to miss the most is that there really isn't anything else that's comparable to this\nWhere you have journalists with a monsignor and you'll have ... and a rabbi coming in and you have guests of different faiths and you have people talking about issues that everyone is talking about don't you don't really have that anywhere else that's that's what I'll miss and almost\n... you don't get off the hook [laughter]\nWell I'll tell you but I won't miss is establishing the skies tall I\nFound my time on but I\nI Will I Will very much miss 'em all the people that media place that people that I've come to know and be friends with over my time on the show I'm rubber rafts\nUm has been an incredible incredible help to us over the years off you don't get to escape have in there\nAnd everyone at heart meteor that has helped us so much everyone in t._v.

A. X. ... H detail New York\nI joined because I wanted to contribute to something bigger than myself\nOn my first patrol my adrenaline was pumping\nI knew it would be tough but I was ready for the challenge\nAlways on high alert\nAfter awhile takes a toll\nWas counting the days when I came home to my family\nBut then I realized things were different\nI had trouble focusing and relating to things the way I used to\nIn a buddy notice something wasn't right he said he'd been there [noise]\nThat their resources out there for veterans\nI found resources that help and connected with other veterans who had similar experience\nOnce I started making connection things began to turn around\nThere must be bumps in the road now we're nowhere to turn\nWind resources and support at make the connection dot net make the connection\nYou on TALK station rated number one seven ten W O R voice of New York and\nOkay I remember the original thesis almost exactly came true but then you revised it a bit with the uh run up we had a so high in the summer\nYes I Love it be the answer to that is I every single day pore over charts and the data and I am constantly revisiting yesterday stasis about where I think things are gone I I never end and comfortable just\nSitting on my rent on your morals [laughter] ever rest of my laurels and I am constantly constantly revisiting yesterday's a\nSeries about where things are going\nFrom one ... this time meaning if if we were at you know there was some suggestion right if you think about\nYou know where things there was almost this topping formation or\nI don't know and in the beginning of September and then it rolled down a little bit then rocketed up a bit when does that ... shift to be a bullet ... single a signal to embarrass or it's just\nYeah I understand that just a great question [noise] ah\nTops are very bottoms are difficult enough to nail down toss or even ... because it typically is is is I discussed earlier tops or not a singular point affair we tend to override protracted period of time Steve various components various indices\nA peek out along the way and it's rare that on one day you get all of the components among the major indices take out on the same day so\nI I get tripped up I get tracked uh if I see the transport speak out and a lot in a while back on for example on August ... thirty yet um\nWe could look back and you say all the NASDAQ top but following that high everything started rolling over\nSo given the broad context of his thirty five which taco I might be that get okay maybe that was about magic take and what happened you know the market held up and then we saw another high on September the ...\nAnd at that point we saw a trap sports without the as the at the New York cause it all go to new ... not\nSo it's a it's a very challenging undertaking I don't want to suggest this is easy it's not and talks are a lot more difficult to nail down in the bottom\nSo Josh ... so you're a ... anger and I and I think all ... all technicians would agree with me on that stadium\nMm So you're pretty bullish\nAnd you don't think this is like the four year cycle low you think that that's coming out a little bit\nYou know I I Do not um we're just two and a half years from the February sixteen bottom I think the four year cycle bottom probably comes in June of twenty twenty or so no I don't think we've seen a major\nBoyer cycle pig there are several reasons for that one reason or the advance decline line which is a technical indicator that that many technicians yours was one tracks the number of the gases declines on each trading day\nMaintains a running start nation of that data than plots it generally speaking the advanced decline line tends to pick out several months ahead of the broad market\nAs a general statement ah we didn't see that this time they advance decline line picked out pretty close to where the broad market talk out so there wasn't that is a large divergence between the pocket or indices and they've asked to climb on\nThat's one reason or another reason Joshua I studied the patterns in on the unemployment data\nAnd unemployment is just reached to it at all time a fifty year low and I found that bull market picks of the four year cycle garden variety tended they proceeded by a pivotal turning the unemployment data by about six to nine months\nSo what am I saying I'm saying we would need to see unemployment hit a bottom and then start ratcheting up and then from that low set your stop watch in about\nSix to nine months later on average that's where you get the peak in the pocket of averages in the stock market so ... that has not yet occurred so I don't think we've reached a four year cycle top\nSo if we see six to nine months from now unemployment start going up would that be a concern deal\nWell with that and that tells me that uh okay that set your stop watch six to nine months later we should probably see a major picking the stock market averages\nMm okay\nSo potentially six to nine months from now could be that peak I mean there are other things would have to fall in that\nBut one that we need to ... well we have not seen confirmation that unemployment is is reached its best level or on the ladder to get came out in the last night that was at a fifty year low so we need to see that China and we have not seen evidence of that yeah\nSure wonderful uh folks were withstand the Harley or for another segment we need you to call this eight hundred three two one zero seven ten if you have a question for stand one
