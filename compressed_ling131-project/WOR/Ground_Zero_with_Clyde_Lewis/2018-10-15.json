{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "From a certain way or education or background\nThere simply people that are ... and they're passionate about learning something new again I mentioned this earlier the number one mistake that most people make with their money if they think they can do this on their own and then go to the education later well that's the wrong thing to do one creates bad habits\nAnd number two they never do go back to do the education 'cause they blown up the money that they had\nSo what do good students do I talk to them all the time number one\nThey realized in the twenty first century that they could take a laptop anywhere in this world right now it doesn't matter because as long as they have an Internet connection and their laptop\nThey can trade all over the world in fact we had a student named ... in San Diego and a lot of times are students feel it's too hard they can't do it well not only has ... done this and his left his job which is exactly what everybody wants to do right we want to quit a job you don't love to do something we do love\nHe's become a excellent trader and he's also now started funding his wife's real estate business\nSo the two of them are doing something together\nSpending more time together spending more time on vacations in family but the important thing here Ryan is it they're loving what they're doing and there's so many people out there and if you're one of those people hopefully you can see how you can benefit from just learning a skill that can give you the freedom that you desire\nYeah absolutely and it's it's kind of interesting as we're as we're sitting here talking about the lifestyle of a traitor I'd just literally received a text message from a dear dear friend of mine\nAnd it just popped up on my phone and he was actually somebody who got me started in trading he was one of the first people who said this is how you open an account these are the steps that you go through it very very first conversations these just become a lifelong dear friend of mine and and he is a huge ski bum he lives up in Salt lake you just ... travels around it as a great time\nHe just texted me with a picture of snow skis saying hey can you use these this season or should I take him to the ... because if I go up to Salt Lake users bum a pair of skis from him rather than a hall in mind around\nBut it it's just there's just so much freedom that can come with it and it and it really ends up just pulling down to a couple of basic steps a couple of basic as you were saying changes or actions that need to be taking because I think it's very critical it's very important it's it's very powerful once we do understand\nThat that the poor is just a state of mind right that passing over opportunities repeatedly and it's something that can be really easily changed just by stepping out of our comfort zone right just by stepping out of our comfort zone and doing something different we talk a lot about\nKind of cliche statements on the show here but it's because they're so true and there are so useful and and it goes back to if we've always done if we always do what we've done will always get what we got and if we are completely satisfied with where we are then then great let's continue to do what made us so happy and the first place\nBut if we want a little bit more for trying to create a little more income if we're trying to create a little more freedoms we have a specific goal\nThat we're trying to accomplish that we haven't been able to get to we have to make the necessary changes and that's one of the life lessons that my grandfather shared with me my whole life growing up he would hold up his five fingers and I would have to name all of them\nThe first one is no your business the second one is be converted and that converted one as a youngster I honestly didn't understand what it meant and as I got involved with trading and I really started to go kind of soul searching down this is this something that's gonna work for me am I going to be able to do this\nThat converted when I started to realize was make the necessary changes the necessary metamorphosis do what's necessary and and and in the beginning and that was the one I always kind of didn't put as much emphasis on when I was like ten eleven twelve even Eighteen Nineteen twenty you know but then as I really started into my my grown up years I started realizing\nHow be converted that pointer finger of the five to me became the most valuable because if we don't make the necessary changes we're never going to accomplish that kind of outlier goal that were after that one of the things we can do\nTo help a few people get started with this was we still got a few tickets we can give away let's change some lives right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area\nThat the cost of ... ... exactly where it takes to really take control of the finances really take control your retirement account generate more income inside of the market's really lived that life the drafter and just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes one of these half day classes to get your bones writing if you were driving now is a good time to pulled over\nIncluding with your passes is going to be our professional insiders kit now this professional insider kitten

Ga Wall Street dot com and see if you can score surpasses there\nNow Larry one of the things that I always like to say and I said earlier on the show is doesn't matter if you have two dollars or two million dollars it's all about getting that money working for you and really getting it to generate that income so you can live the lifestyle you can reach the financial freedom goals that you're after\nBut what are some of the things are what are some of the other kind of examples I Know you have your bags and bags low the view of these examples for our students that you've talked to that we're in one place that are now in another well\nThe first thing we always understand here is that with trading it's simply a transfer money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing\nAnd what's really sad as people will get themselves stuck to think about just time right now people can sit in front of a television for hours versus going out there and learning a skill that can help them and every year and you were coming up to the holiday season again we're gonna start seeing all these Jim commercials again right\nCause here comes resolution time and one of those things I hear a students say over and over again is beside wishing having had more time was\nThis is the year I Want to get out of debt and I want to turn my finances around and what's amazing is how many students\nCome in through the classes that we're doing right now\nAnd simply imagine what their life would be like if they can learn a skill to help them generate more money and that's the key it's about doing something taking action and getting out there to change your current situation\nAgain if you're a coach shovel and something that you are really interested in learning how to do there is no limitations here in fact one of my students June\nShe actually came to my class and she said all she wanted to do is play golf in Costa Rica and so she started realizing that by learning how to trade gave her the time to do that I said it's great just send me a postcard and she did and she said she was trading 'cause that's a whole nother piece of it\nPeople go on vacation Ryan right and they decorate the vacation they're making money to pay for it and so I asked June trading before after golf she goes\nBefore of course and I love that of course\nYeah we're talking with a group of students just a little while ago that did a big trip through Europe and I remember him saying\nYou know where we were trading out in Europe and we made as much money out on our trip was we actually spent on the trip and so it's kinda fun to come back from a trip with a with a with a flat balance or even being up after having a great after having a great time\nAnd that's the thing is it doesn't matter where you are you just have to have an Internet connection it doesn't matter where you are and it doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter what your background is it's all about just proactively identifying good opportunities\nAnd that's really what we introduce you to show you exactly what it takes how to do that inside of the half the class and we are pretty much at the end of the show but before we end what are you saying we do know that give away\nYour let's give at least ten more people the opportunity to get some tickets here\nAll right right now we've got a happy class coming up in your area and a half the class is ... ... exactly what it takes\nTo really reached that financial freedom generating more income in the markets like I always say if you're why is big enough you will find out how how is out at the half the class now just a second you're going to have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these have to classes to get your bones reading if you're driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluding with your passages are professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nLessons on topics like Hansen your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional insider kit makes it so you get started right now ... century twenty when he did a call now and reserve those seats\nThe number is eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up being\nColors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ...

PET scan positive she had a cat scans five\nYears before she had nothing on their skin five years before so that's worrisome that's worrisome point number one if you have a nod do under along today that you didn't have five years ago that's worrisome\nOne number two if it's PET scan positive that means is picking up radioactive sugar that's worrisome that makes it more likely to be cancer and this is the woman who had a noon or do I just told you it wasn't there before it's new Nadia one CAT scan\nOr doctors in Center for a PET scan PET scans of southern checks the radioactive sugar and the cancer of course likes cats like seed at everybody think sometimes you know I'm not going to stop eating sugar starve the cancer\nWell that's not how it works cancer eat whatever it was so each year flesh and blood doesn't need to have sugar anything can age or a fat your skin anything stopping the sugar doesn't do anything that's just a scam and please don't get caught up in a scam\nThis is a Seventy one year old woman she has two children she works in real estate in multiple uh abnormalities in the long\nShow new scanned five years ago and now another scan showing that to point seven centimeter mass in the right lunch at a PET scan that was positive and nothing else there was no other cancers science I reviewed all the scan submerged has a cough\nOr doctors want to do a do surgery on her to cut out this is a duo or long surgeon told her it's Ninety nine percent of cancer and well she went to the doctor and he told her to London embers of cancer and then she never\nBack from the doctor so she said well if he doesn't want to save me I don't want to see him and how did\nShe get this well she's an ex smoker so she's Seventy one she quit smoking when she was sixty one which range shoots probably smoked for forty forty five years she has a cough shows no bleeding she's losing weight or way was one twenty eight two years ago now it's one twenty\nOne she's high feed the CAT scan

which is also smoking often the smoking related disease\nI examined her and well you can listen to the lungs lungs are perfectly fine that Dr cannot hear or two and a half centimeter masses along so that's why he's listening to lungs is not enough chest X ray is not enough and so this woman came to me\nAnd her surgeon who was pushing her to have surgery he came and said you got to have surgery got out of this law Joe out you got to lose part of your lung\nYou got to be in the hospital you gotta of anesthesia you've got to be at the hospital ago chest to show it'd be laid up you'll be in pain [laughter] well that's what she was told until a radio listener like you came to her and said hey I just heard that Dr Lederman treats lung cancer with no coddling no bleeding though hospital stay\nWith high success rate so that's right\nWe have high success rates treating lung cancers\nBurst of America First to New York for us to the western hemisphere this was the work we do when we were first than America\nDoing radio surgery for a long and other cancers a lot of doctors and hospitals and facilities were angry yeah well they should be angry because surgeons if a patient who hears about radio surgery non invasive treatment\nVersus opening up the chest to the hospital stay and pain and suffering and she already has shortness of breath because she has a fuzzy meant COPD if the remote part of her long her Britain is going to be less good why because you need your long to brave\nThat's what the law is it's a breathing factory and oxygen factory they cut out part of your factory for breathing your ... going to be less good so she came to me and I saw her and well she decided that treatment\nI should say though she was just treated three months ago\nThat a few treatments pinpoint treatment how does radios for the work well make 'em all around the body with computerized everything in the body and then we send in thousands of beams to attack the cancer invisible beam she lays on the table\nThose are the ... thing and then get up and goes home or to work or the Macy's or Bryant Park or does what she wants to take the subway home or a bus home or

pancreas cancer spreads liver so stage four it was diagnosed two years ago had diarrhea abdominal pain and they went to his doctor the doctor how the leash a little liver one of the hospitals or Ireland and he had a biopsy deliver\nIt was found to have cancer and then they started systemic therapy and he had more than a year and a half\nOf systemic therapy for this neural endocrine cancer this therapy is supposed to be exactly specific for neural endocrine cancer and he had followed scans the scan showed the cancer was progressive the cancer was growing the cancer is getting bigger and bigger and bigger\nAnd he had blood clots had complications from the disease or the tree Mendoza blood\nThinners he lost weight he was one Seventy eighty went down to one fifty five lost more than twenty pounds he's five foot nine\nHe's an ex smoker examined him\nAnd his normal physical exam so just shows you the physical exam doesn't mean you can have cancer and the rapidly\nGrowing mass in the liver and in the pancreas and he was on chemo and\nAnd it didn't work\nAnd his doctor said well we'll just keep on giving you this is what's supposed to work well\nIt's supposed to work but it's not working and it costs a lot of money and someone's paying for probably you and me and the patient and others and it's not working so why would you keep on giving a treatment that's not working why would anyone do that why why why\nWhy well what did I Do\nYou offer them all the options sure you can say on chemo if you want it hasn't been working as women working for a year and a half\nA this is beyond surgery you can have standard radiation or you know focus ... with us where we send to beams just to the cancer area in the pancreas and deliver and lots of people ask me Dr Lederman can you treat the cancer where it travels stage for cancer and the answer is yes\nAnd the ... she went back to his chemo dog said well Dr Lederman offered me all the options the chemo doctor said well you have to have more chemo\nWell the president says it's not working well the doctor said you got a more chemo what's not working so why would you stay with a treat but it's not working why would any logical person say with a tree when when the cancer is growing it just doesn't make any sense\nAnd so the patient came here he came here as family came we met with everybody\nAnd then he decided to have the treatment by the way I'm going away I'm going to Europe for three months so furry up and finished so we finished up the treatment actually part of the many never finishes left and this week he came back from his three month\nHoliday got a new scan\nAnd the new scan shows his cancer and the Packers a PET scan so it's so fancy dance that does the cancer in the pancreas is gone\nCancer and delivers in remission everything's intermission there's no no cancer and this is the beauty of our work this is what we do every day\nAt searches for Broadway Broadway and thirty is treated in the heart of New York city planners came all doctors told me that came on the rest of his life it wasn't working he couldn't take the complications you didn't want it\nAnd he came here in the non invasive treatments and he's doing well and he's happy for his pancreas cancer\nIs neural endocrine features who has stage for Mets to the liver this is what we do every day that another man with pancreas cancer so Seventy four year old man\nIs a merit is five children and he has a history of prostate cancer mission from ten years ago and now has abdominal pain and belching was hit by a doctor is found to have a pancreas cancer at one of the biggest hospitals in Long Island\nAnd he had a CAT scan and by ups in New York City and then they transferred to one of those super poop or places and he had six cycles of chemotherapy for this pancreas cancer it was wrapped around the artery nerve involving lymph nodes\nIt's six cycles of chemotherapy nearly a half a year he lost sixty pounds he went from two hundred and ten pounds to a hundred and fifty five pounds Andy as abdominal\nPain and he's on narcotics and these these ex smoker\nAnd I examined him in his abdomen was okay but his gun narcotics on chemo and the cancers growing wrapped around the blood vessels wrapped around the blood vessels at one of those super duper hospitals would tell him he has to have chemo and\nHe leaves she comes here it comes to see me comes to pay for a Broadway why\nThey keep on telling an avid treatment doesn't work is any logical person to have a treatment doesn't work that makes them sick\nAnd that they have to pay ten thousand a month no logical person would do that and these are the logical person why would you do something that's totally illogical doesn't make sense\nAnd that's what we do here at Thirteen for Broadway we talk about all the options so we talked about all the options and he chose our achievement members Seventy four years old was his pancreas cancer wrapped around the blood vessels nerves and harder as\nWe treated him with invisible beams of radio surgery\nAnd it's now two years later he's cancer free\nIs cancer free two years later you stop the chemo doesn't work he's had only our treatment a few treatments and visceral beams now he's doing well I mean do side effects because there's no treatment and the cancer is in remission", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde
