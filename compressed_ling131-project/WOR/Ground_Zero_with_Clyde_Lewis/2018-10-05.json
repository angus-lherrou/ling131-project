does a doctor from one of the biggest hospitals in Philadelphia and I couldn't tell you that some people say oh I'm all the way from Jersey City or wherever or Long Island oh we are patients around the world with ... flew in from China at a ... for Mobile Alabama\nFor Israel from India and this patient came in she came in with her\nChildren she's fifty seven she's an anesthesiologist I mean she puts people to sleep just three children she came in with her children her daughter for progress of cancer in the in test tubes and she's been emailing me for about a year she has cancer to grow\nIn the primaries side and she's been getting chemotherapy which are chemicals that go on living and she's putting him into therapy she was fine until two years ago and two years ago shut abdominal pain and she said by surgeons gastroenterologist an adventure was found to have a lot in the store\nAnd she had a CAT scan colonoscopy\nInches of a cancer on what's called the hip ... front of the right side of the\nAbdomen and there was a Ninety percent of collusion with cancer traveled to the liver and to the skin\nSo she came to her doctors with a blockage with a lot of the stool with stage four cancer and she's been on chemo for a year and three quarters so or doctors at the super duper place in Philadelphia too and she's been on for a year and three quarters and\nHer cancer marker the C.\nE. A. originally it was six hundred without before\nAnd now it's going up and the cancers growing in the primaries side she just had a new CD skin cancers growing in the primaries side and in the abdomen and she has liver metastases and she's planning immunotherapy and she has a\nDomino pain and she has partial obstruction she never had a PET scan so the best test she never has\nSo subtly doctors it's super duper places in New York but a lot of chemo doctors just don't like to get the best test to visualize the cancer I guess to think and that doesn't matter or they think they're going to get chemo for the rest of life for the patient this is a\nPretty young looking healthy looking woman even though she has stage for cancer which is another point not to look like you're crippled up and\nPain have cancer if you saw her walk the streets as good shape and\nShe was physically in good shape and well she's had this cat scans and the CAT scan shows that the mass of the colon is increasing liver metastases ... in the abdominal cavity it so she said\nTo breast surgery is for other conditions she said two C sections deliver babies she was born in Trinidad examines her her exam is pretty normal\nTo suppress it that it was pretty normal family even though she has cancer and the colon cancer a liver and that shows you another teaching point the limitations of physical exam that so it's not so possible to feel everything from the outside\nOf what's going on inside so we spoke about all the options for her and we spoke about the fact that the chemo does not work and she got to have him in a therapist she could try that she's been on a variety\nOf medicines for a year and three quarters are just not working the cancers grow and back and we have plenty of data for treating the cancer in the cold and and she was shocked you been getting chemotherapy\nAdvice for nearly two years and no one has ever told her about radio surgery no one ever told her she can come to Dr Lederman and\nHave a highly successful treatment to the cancer in the colon itself\nShe was shocked and I gave her booklets and shoulder examples of us treating cancers and the correct on coal law area with success and we most commonly have success will be talking about another patient who had a big cancer and the transfers Colin ... all news radio surgery\nWith success so for her\nShe was relieved she ... she does not want anyone operating on her it was just something that people do a lot about medicine often want the least conventional opening surgery and chemotherapy treatments she's had chemo for a year and a three quarters is just not\nWorking any longer so are we able to treat the mass\nAnd the colon addicts lecture yes we have experience probably the most of the America we were first in America with radio surgery experienced treating cancer and the liver yes we've heard the thousands of patients with cancer in the liver this is what we do\nEvery day here at radio surgery so for this woman she came up from Philadelphia to the doctor and I was just working one of the biggest hospitals and she learned a lot even though she's a doctor even though she's been around during those should have been seen cancer doctors for two years now she learned a lot\nBy coming to Thirteen eighty four Broadway about the treatment of colon cancer and she's not condemn the only having
