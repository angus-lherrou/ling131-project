R. dot com\nWhere you are you ... a peep here in New York\nNew York's most most of the Fox they rated number\nSkin cancer and successfully did so in fact he had biopsies of his skin after our treatment showing the cancer was gone and his doctors at that other super place were amazed that we're able to treat his skin cancer without\nLosing his toes so often the surgeons who are proposing the surgery haven't really had an experience with invades non invasive\nSurgery pinpoint invisible games so they're talking about what they do but often they don't know what they do know and that's always a problem in life it's a problem in medicine is a problem when it comes to you and your loved ones and you talked to a doctor who's trying to explain something that he or she doesn't really know\nFor example in in Madison Ninety nine percent of doctors do not have any formal training in radiation you'd everyone else's opinion almost everyone not sever everybody medicines\nOver a hundred percent or zero percent but only about one percent of doctors have experience in former experience and radiation training and even less have experience in radio surgery can point treatment of\nPrecise treatment focusing cancer treatment on the cancer like on this man's here and that's where he started talking about how to treat his cancer on the gear or anywhere in the body\nWithout removing that part of the body lots of people do not want part of their body\nRemoved by the way I forgot to introduce myself my name is Dr go Lederman I'm a radiation oncologist\nAnd I know there's lots of people on the radio and the life you talk to and you get opinions from but you don't really know what\nIs their education what is the basis for their opinion everyone can have an opinion and everyone's entitled to independent that's what democracy is all about that one man or one woman is entitled to their vote everyone's vote is equal but when people give me a medical advice and that's your life\nSometimes just like to know who exactly is talking well I'll tell you who I Am ... later when a board certified cancer doctor I went to school I grew up in Waterloo, Iowa I was born in Iowa was raised there it was educated there it went to University in Iowa I went to medical school I Am the real doctor physician\nI'm licensed in New York after my em the degree I then went on and trained and internal medicine three years at the University of Chicago and Michael Reese board certified three more years\nThan it went on the train at Harvard Medical school in ... in medical oncology three more years at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute board certified and that another three years totally nine years after medical school the first thirty five years of my life\nFor education turning radiation\nHarvard Medical school Joint Center for radiation oncology was a group of five Harvard hospitals all merged for their radiation program and was on the staff and this is the work I Do and then I came to New York I've been in New York treating patients with cancer for Thirty years license in New York and the\nPracticing at Thirteen any for Broadway Broadway and thirtieth street where we see patients with new and recurrent cancers primary most out of the cancers located most anywhere in the body the often see\nPatients like the man with a year and his doctor his ear surgeon never told him about radio surgery I can promise you that his ear surgeon never said well I can cut off a quarter of your ear or you can see Dr Lederman knee can treat you\nNon invasive leading you keep your ear how many surgeons tell their patients that I can tell you a couple but not very many because they'd be afraid all their patients would leave them if they gave him really all the options which is exactly the opposite as what\nWe do here at thirtieth before Broadway if you come in with the era cancer prostate or breast or long we talk about all the options I'm not afraid I'm not afraid about talking about radical surgery or chemo lower standard radiation I'm not afraid about it I don't think you're going to go running off that if you go running off to\nSomething else well God Bless you should have the choice after being educated that's what I Believe a doctors should do is to educate the patient yes that men can go and have his ear removed if you want but maybe he doesn't want that and that's why I called up to try to save this here\nTried to avoid radical surgery tried to avoid most surgery tried to avoid the deformity and then trying to have some doctor patch up the ear how do you think a patch up the ear looks like compared to what God gave you know I bet it is not\nVery good at my experience it's not very good and you could see examples you can come to our office at their kid who for Broadway you can see the art of radio certainly can see a picture of a man who lost his whole year we went to another big hospitals Newark area and we will show you our work\nCompared to that and you'll see a world of difference you can call her office day or night to get information we have pictures of ears and noses and ice treated with radio surgery can see what our work looks like after our treatment and I suspect there'll be favorably impressed\nBy them sector Lederman we'll be right back\nInvisible radio ... cancer and new Enron comic primary and met a static small or large

and talk about the man who is forty six so pretty young man and he's a said go it just stopped smoking a year ago yet back pain and shoulder pain he had lots of symptoms it was seen by a chiropractor\nAnd well he got worse and worse and worse and worse a chiropractor is not a medical doctor it's not an M the so a lot of people are confused I say that to set the record straight medical doctors are not\nChiropractors most commonly an chiropractors are not\nMedical doctors anyway the mantle of back pain he started losing weight loss sixty pounds\nHe went from one eighty five to one twenty five it was created by a chiropractor for back pain and weight loss and right up are quieter pain and the his food is getting stuck when he swallowed\nWhich is always a worrisome sign if he came to me and he had back\nPay and he was losing sixty pounds in his food was getting caught in the south I guess I Would not be doing back manipulation that'd be getting test to diagnose why he was losing weight and why the\nFood was stuck in this is off I guess well it took a year one year to finally get out of the hands of the chiropractor and to get medical care and he had in the ... that means and though means\nIn size and scope he meets looking and so he had and ... which is looking down into the esophagus in mass where the esophagus yourself against is the food too so if you think about food going in your mouth\nAnd your throat and then going down the esophagus stomach the esophagus has had to go to a connection from your throat down to your stomach but a mess in the she\nEat junction stands for gastro the stomach and they eat the gas prices are for Joe junction there is a massive his biopsy positive ads are no carcinoma\nHad a CAT scan chess C. T. scan and he was found\nThe liver and lung metastases so probably in that year that he was seeing the chiropractor\nMost probably that cancer was traveling to the long and the liver\nThat's why it's so important if you have symptoms to see your doctor or come in here You're welcome here and there should be for Broadway above suspected cancer he was scheduled to get a CAT scan the day after you saw me some problems with his tools peas and taking\nPercocet is something that caught excuse doctors are covering a Percocet morphine for the pain\nBut he's had no treatment or like salmon there'll be some very slender man\nYou can imagine being a six foot man is a hundred and twenty six pounds\nIs a software geo cancer the G junction has no cars no much planning to get chemotherapy and he came to me why because she didn't really want that came I went to the chemo doctors that's the only thing they offered him but no one offered him treatment to get\nThat esophagus opened up and that's what he wants he wants to be able to eat and I can tell you of all the treatments out there ours is probably the most ...\nWhile for the patient at ten thousand dollars they didn't want to have treatment and queue but then he came back\nTo New York and he gets went to a now\nFor the hospital and he had another biopsy\nNow that forest hospital could have got the documents from the second house put on saying that it was ... cancer but they wanted to do their own ... hospitals do that well most common they do it I Believe to do procedures because they could have looked at the ... that they could have looked at the slides it doesn't have to subject 'cause man to another\nAnesthesia procedure in costs and hospital stays they didn't have to do it but maybe it's great for the hospital was not\nGreat for the patient and the patient was upset about that and then anyway\nThey started chemotherapy they started combination chemotherapy which are chemicals that go throughout the body and it caused a terrible reaction this man they became delirious and the last twenty pounds and then the chemo was stopped and he came to me with this mess\nIn the head and with double vision and losing weight remember he's an ex smoker and I found that actually that he had a cancer of the navy so ferrets I went to two big hospitals\nIn New York plus the primary doctor plus when colleges plus Cuba and the cancer just kept on growing never had proper treatment the proper treatment is focused beam radiation is Adam ... amassed\nGrowing from his nose up into his brain to this fine when he got to us that had\nThey years you've been traveling around a year with cancer growing and terrible cancer and he came with his daughter and I showed him and they showed his daughter and he insisted that they have treatment with no chemotherapy with focused beam radiation only\nBecause all the other places either miss a diagnosis or they wanted to give chemo or they wanted to take his money here he was treated\nAnd recruited him for this massive growing from the neck into the nose into the basis go up to the spine a mass\nOf cancer and we treated him and I should tell you one more thing we treated him two years ago he came to me two years ago and why are we talking about them now boy came for follow up we checked his entire body had a physical exam as a PET scan and\nHe is cancer free had been to all those hospitals have traveled from New York to Cuba multiple hospitals underwent multiple biopsies had some chemo which caused them to be delirious insect can never cook anymore you focus the radiation only for nasal Ferris a cancer ... from the nose to the ...\nThe base of scope up to the spine\nAnd this now completely cancer free free of cancer two years later and we know with most to head and neck cancers Kansas and throw it in ... mouth voice box area two years most patients who are two years out\nNever have a recurrent so it's very likely we never say never hundred percent and medicine but most likely this man is going to do very well and he's already done well he's gained weight he said no side effects no symptoms he's fully intact he's working these carrying on all of his normal activities\nAfter our treatment of invisible beams of radio surgery only prison nasal Ferris cancer going from his nose to his basis go and spine\nWhile they were talking about the gentleman who is sixty four years old he's born in Panama and he's a black man and I said because he has prostate cancer and they said that because one in six black when we'll get prostate cancer and one of the twenty three would die of\nProstate cancer so I said that to warn every man of any color any race of any religion that you can get cancer and you can die of cancer many tens of thousands of men die of prostate cancer every year with is a sixty four year old man he had came with a PSA five point five\nGleason six cancer of the CAT scan there was a question and the spine we worked him up he actually got checked out because he went to his insurance company for approval and the other high PSA couldn't get his insurance that's another reason to get treated\nGet multiple positive chorus positive when a biopsy is out of the process that usually there's twelve samples of the of the prostate taken multiple corps showed Gleason six PSA five point\nFive to punch in our computer you'll see that with a Gleason six PSA five point five you'll see that our success rate is Ninety five\nPercent to be cancer free if you look at the surgical results for PSA for to ten at the biggest hospitals in New York their success rates Seventy six percent our success rate for the same categories Eighteen percent better\nWe're talking about almost two hundred thousand men the euro prostate cancer talking about thirty five thousand more meant to be cancer free if they all came to us rather they all went to surgery or open ... robotic surgery doing about thirty five thousand more men cancer free\nRemember most men to go through surgery and up and put it into the continent was sexual problems urinary problem with us most of our men keep their sex life\nWith us none of them and keep their urine or life in our patients avoid the radical surgery so what's the news on this gentleman well he came to us with this prostate cancer\nAnd he is now cancer free so it's great news for him he's fully intact has sex life works as your entire life works and he is in remission with out patient therapy avoiding radical surgery avoiding robotic surgery\nWith a good quality of life this is the work we do that we're talking about Seventy one year old woman from insurance or just had a\nPhone call was saying I'd so hard to get to midtown Manhattan from Connecticut even though it was a direct train line and this woman came from Manchuria\nCame from in Syria she is married with one daughter and\nShe has a mass in the kidney and she had blood in the year and shit abdominal pain she went to one of the big hospitals they wanted to remove for kidney through other remover kidney with no biopsy had no proof of\nCancer and that's what's commonly done you might say while that seems so strange but in the urinary field if there's a big mess it looks like cancer the standard of care is cutting out the kidney yes\nThey can make mistakes and sometimes the next day they have to go see the patient say whoops have good news for you Mrs Jones there's no cancer and your kidney well Mrs Jones should be thinking about the doctor you cut out my kitty I don't have my kidney either and that's the price to pay well this woman went to the hospital they wanted to cut out her kidney\nShe either the named mia shit abdominal pain and\nShe came to me she's a slight woman she went from a hundred pounds up to eighty five pounds the last two years and she probably lost that way because that was a massive\nCancer that was growing in her abdomen\nAnd I met with her and I talk about all the options as you know I'm not afraid about talking to all the\nOptions surgery chemo radiation biopsies no biopsies radical and the woman was surprised that we talked about doing a biopsy and said well we can do a biopsy and prove to you that it is a cancer not even before any treatment and she and her husband liked\nThat idea that we'd be doing a biopsy first and we did a biopsy it's painless he done and put it a little NATO suck out some cells and sure enough it was a kidney cancer and it was a massive\nKidney cancer this woman who slide she's only eighty five pounds but the kidney cancer was\nMass and she chose to be treated with our non invasive treatments she did not\nWant to have this master motion not want to lose or kidney we've seen so many terrible issues when kidneys are removed this woman did not want\nOr kidney removed and recruited her all non invasive early she came in had her treatment and dinner business do hospital stay and honestly should know cutting the bleeding pinpoint treatment how do we do it will it make us\nBarry tactic frame it's custom made for each patient with an computerized for\nThis patient and for every patient her body or cancer and then send in from thousands of NGOs invisible beams to attack the cancer pain Leslie all in ten minutes this is the work we do the suicide rate is ... about this is the appeal compared to surgery where she would have lost her kidney and probably been in the hospital we can probably\nCONMEBOL asked for months she was a\nDay in the fragile woman with us she just turned around and got up turned around and went to Macy's went shopping went home went to lunch she did what she wanted and that's one of the huge differences between our work and that the\nOthers and furthermore we talked about all the options her surgeon who wanted to remove the cancer for this woman for men sharia\nThey never told her about all the options they never told me he didn't have radios ... with Dr Lederman without cutting no bleeding they never told her there was no option compared to removing her kidney and we see that so frequently people told after move their bladder their ... their breast or along and they're never told\nAll the options that's another reason why so many people come here to Thirteen eighty four Broadway\nCrowd when thirtieth street in New York City to hear about all the options and
