and even though she had standard treatment in the past does not work and she had surgery didn't work she came to us with this smell a large bleeding motorists mass and got treated in only\nFive treatments with radio surgery and the cancer went away\nThat's what we did for her the cancer went away now unfortunately she has met a study cancer stage orange she has other spots and we're in now courting the other spots which are the worst spot and the worst spots that she could see and now it's all gone which is great for her and her family came her husband came\nGo just to thank our staff for the great\nWork on his wife or this was so difficult to adore with the size of the smell and the growth was relentless this all\nNow in remission where we aim to be so good news for her thank God we treat many women with breast cancer\nSome of them when we treat with early breast cancer find a lump or find them abnormal mammogram we find the cancer and create remember when I came to New York Thirty years ago Ninety seven percent of the women at the big hospitals were getting mastectomy worse in my practice Ninety percent of the women were keeping\nTheir breast all the women weren't different though I think it was different was the mentality and wide Ninety seven percent of women were having mastectomies at the big hospitals\nWhere Ninety percent of women with us and my practice or keeping Nebraska well that was a reflection of training and day to day that's been around for a long time to show that there is no need for most women not all women but for most women not to lose the breast so so the reason why so\nMany women come to us at radio surgery New York for\nBreast cancer treatment that we're talking about a gentleman also had treatment elsewhere unfortunately is eighty three years old is a big business man he had prostate cancer treatment in Connecticut ... a radical prostatectomy and then he had hormone therapy and his PSA never got to zero\nIn fact I went up to a hundred and sixteen and the cancer came back and the other case have spoken about a woman and thirty four year old woman has cancer came back right in the neck or they opened up her head of the big hospital world this man had a radical prostatectomy and the cancer came back right in the same spot in a big mess like a big rock right there\nIn the prostate that are the press that area obstructing this year and he was unable to urinate the master was left the mass of cancer was so massive that he was on a boat to urine and he was having to put a catheter and him so\nIt had other radiation in the past he and his doctors decided that you should come to Radio City New York from Connecticut even though it's a substantial distance for any three year old man he came he had his five treatments and now\nHis urine is a oh okay goodbye catheters goodbye mess he is happy about the treatment and he's planning a round the world trip right now which tells you how happy is about the results and then he'll be back to get further\nFollow up with us he does have several elder areas of cancer and he wants to those areas to be treated but again we sort of a tough area like the woman with breast cancer which are the big mass in her in this men with prostate cancer we treated the big mess it's gone is your nation is back to normal finally after so difficult\nTimes having to put a catheter and himself\nBeing obstructed from that recurrent cancer after radical prostatectomy we with radio certainly were able to clean\nUp that mess clean up that mess and get him urinating\nOn his own and another sir erosion surgeon another one son and his patient with a Gleason seven cancer as history of congestive heart failure pacemaker is a blood thinners he's sixty three years old with lots of medical problems he's married he has two children and he came in\nReferred by this big ... just demand for treatment of a Gleason seven cancer well why would someone come to us for Gleason seven cancer well number one this fan as hard failure pacemaker and\nDoesn't want to have surgery number two you know as our data is our data the surgeons are data with us for Gleason seven cancer prostate cancer successor it's Ninety percent with open surgery robotic surgery Seventy six percent that's\nEighteen percent better which means Gleason Sabbath our data is nine to\n... percent surgeries sixty percent that's fifty percent better go do something better as a big difference and why does so many men come to us for prostate cancer treatment well imagine or fifty percent better than open surgery fifty percent better than a robotic surgery\nAnd for most valuable to avoid the problems with the incompetence of the urine of incontinence and impotence that's the work that we do\nHere at Radio City New York so there's many reasons for this man to come with us ah one is is Gleason\nSeven cancer he wants to be the Ninety percent category not the sixty percent category\nSo is this what we do this is what we do every day here at Radio City New York the Kennedy for Broadway Broadway thirtieth street where we take most insurance is Medicare Medicaid there's a big\nArticle big advertiser in one of the big hospitals advertising that says that they helped him keep his body intact well in fact they're talking about they went to several hospitals\nWho wanted to remove the whole long ago the four different hospitals that the evidence lung removed and he went to their house but they did a smaller surgery to remove a small part of the law\nAnd then they said they wanted to keep his body hall well number one they didn't keep his body hold it because they also remote part of the long and then number two they said uh\nThey cured him well we wouldn't tell anyone there cured at any point in time because it's not fair I mean if you tell someone they're carrying the next day the cancer comes back that's not a cure so just because they did a smaller surgery and still surgeries still remote part of the line with red is surging New York with race surgery actually we do\nNot remove any part of the body there's no anesthesia know cutting and so I think this hospital is over emphasizing what they have done they said they carried him but how do they know that actually when I was a a resident\nIn radiation I reported on a patient whose cancer came back twenty eight years after surgery so just because it's been a couple of years with no cancer doesn't mean he's cured cured means that it never comes back so they're older saying what they did their overstating what their procedure was\nThey did remove part of the law and they did not leave them all they did not necessarily care him but he could have had not invasive treatment and really kept his body whole\nHad to come to radio surgery New York which is the work that we do to keep the body truly hole\nAnd to speak words accurately at radio surgery Newark where we treat patients with new and returned cancers
