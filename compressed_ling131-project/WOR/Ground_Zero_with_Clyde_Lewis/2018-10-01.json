{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "That's the by product but what is the real role of trading in the development of civilization think about all the production of the goods and services where would be be Ryan when you went to the supermarket look at the plethora of goods and services that are available to you that you trade for\nSomebody produced those goods and services not knowing you they produce them somewhere in the world and the supermarket vendor made them available to you so I like in my classes I like to share with our students the trading is more than just making money\nTrading is really the cornerstone and foundation of the development of civilization we need traders we need producers of goods and services we need consumers of goods and services somewhere in the middle of that transaction is the trader so trading is more than just making money\nI I don't want to get to philosophical here but I think it's an important point to make and talking about Hollywood they would never take the time to build a movie around that name but in fact\nTrading is a very very important part of our life\nWhere would you be if you couldn't trade your skills with your employer right where where would you be if you didn't have the flexibility and availability of the capital markets to participate buying selling riding options\nWould your capital you choose to come to the market and\nProvide for your family this is a skill and boy you hit it right on the head when you talked about skilled development earlier\nThis is not about knowing what to do it's about knowing what to do and then executing your strategy in a sustainable way but trading is part and parcel to the development of civilization where would we be Ryan and we had all had to go back to barter what do you think your life would be like\nYou know it's an interesting point you bring up I Love how you take that back to work you know because we do we trade we're constantly trading betrayed time for money and then we trade money for those goods and services right we trade money for that loaf of bread\nBut initially it all starts with us going out and doing something to generate that capital trading time trading now trading skills\nSo that we can generate the money just to go train it to somebody else now one of the things that one of my mentors told me a long time ago as he always said I always want you to use this phrase and I've used that thousands and thousands maybe millions of times hard earned investments dollar and that was afraid he told me to use every time I'm Talking about my money and Everytime I pondering should I make this decision should I make this investment\nAnd he said at the end of your analysis you should always you should always end with\nThis trade is or is not worthy of my hard earned investments dollar\nAnd he would always take me back and and have me kind of paint a picture of the hardest day I had at work and he said that dollar are you willing to put that dollar into that trade and it just goes back to that trading time for money now trading money for those goods and services or those or those investment opportunities and how do we know\nIs this investment worthy of our harder and investment dollar cars and you know we go back in time we are we go back across the nation we go back across the globe and we ask you know I've asked thousands of people this millions of people really when we started when we do all of our online workshop\nAnd say how much time as the average person put in to being educated how much time that we invested into ourselves so that we can have the confidence to say yes this is worthy of my heart or an investment dollars and unfortunately the answer that echoes across ... echoes across workshops\nIs near zero which is one of the reasons why we don't have the confidence of what we're doing it's one of the reasons why we don't generally have the returns\nThat we want as well but I Would love to tilt the scale right now I'd love to tell the scale and get that zero number climbing as high as we possibly can by getting as many people educated so at the end of the day they can look at their investments and say yes or no this is or is not\nWorthy of my heart or an investment dog but one of the things we have to do to get that process started John we gotta give away these tickets

one of the most sophisticated tests to evaluate\nThe hat and a pet CAT scan would have been done for this woman\nFor months and months\nThe other media Italy and the answer to the same day and in fact we found the tumor in her head in the cerebellum the poster part of the had the back part of the head that's responsible for balance and we found cancer especially she was talking about cancer pain in her sake rum\nAnd in fact the pet scan showed an extensive mass into sake Roman pelvis adjacent to issues which had not been treated even though this [noise]\nWoman that has been seeing doctors for now a year and a half in Canada and Mexico and in Europe and she heard about us from a friend of hers a friend\nHers lives in Ontario came to us with [noise]\nSarcoma cancer comas a cancer of the connective tissue had a ... of the pelvis [noise]\nIn Canada She had standard came on standard radiation and standard surgery I should tell you the first call was to Columbus or cancers the connective tissue is like a the muscles and bones and ligaments\nAll that treatment failed the cancer came back and she came to me after being told from the largest from the most prestigious cancer centers in the world\nThat she should go home and die while this woman the second woman came to us\nAsked if we can help I talked about all the options like salmon or we staged or up and we implemented pinpoint treatment because we know\nThe freezer comas the usual kind of treatment surgery and came on radiation just doesn't work very well so commonly fails to work\nAnd yet we were able to treat this woman and make the cancer go away now two years later she just came to be a few weeks ago for a checkup and she comes from our checkups here she is PET scans here the same day\nWhereas back home in her country it would take months and months if at all to get a scan attacked in her country they sent her home to die whereas we've been able to treat her get her in remission and the second woman I'm Talking about is living a healthy life\nIn remission doing everything she wants to know side effects even though we had to [laughter]\nWhen she asked us to treat her we had to go in with non invasive treatment pinpoint treatment invisible beams to attack the cancer\nAnd the same area where she had the surgery and chemo and radiation before so we went into a highly charged part of her body were able to do it get her in remission and not hurt her and in fact she's had no side effects and then she's remission so it's easy to see why this woman\nExplained to her friend why she should come to Thirteen it for Broadway for cancer treatment now to talk about the first woman with this lung cancer traveled to the bones went to Mexico and Australia and Canada without relief so what did you decide to do I saw her\nYesterday she decided to\nGo home to\nCanada for the weekend and she wants to come back Monday morning first thing to implement treatment\nAnd that's what we're doing\nWe're fulfilling her wishes why because number one we have the technical ability we have the intellectual ability we have a team of experts that are able to focus and and treat her cancer and she has cancer\nIn the pelvis in the bones and eating through the bones it's so easy to understand why she has a terrible pain and suffering terrible\nAnd so often we see patients with cancer who are left in pain and suffering without proper treatment medications or therapies and were able to focus and hit the cancer most likely shrink the cancer and get this woman out of pain\nSo it's easy to understand why she chose our treatment\nAnd for the second side because the cancer lung cancers wrapping around the airways interfering with the oxygen getting into her lungs it's easy to understand why she wants us to treat her cancer in her lungs\nBoth areas that were ignored by our doctors and three separate countries on two continents\nAnd yet she's getting treatment immediately here at Thirteen

ones they've been the person down the street who is suffering this is what we do every day on the radio I got an email from a man who said well maybe your statistics are wrong and I want to explain to him how exactly are statistics are for example prostate cancer\nSo if someone a man has Gleason seven cancer Gleason seven is how the cancer appears under the microscope\nMan as Gleason seven cancer or they have a PSA from ten to twenty\nAnd you go to a usual hospital have radical surgery or robotic surgery or standard radiation the success rates about sixty percent\nIf that patient comes to us [noise] the success rate is Ninety percent okay and he's talking about how do we calculate the difference between sixty and Ninety well simple let's just say hospital act super duper poop or a hospital acts\nTreats a hundred men and sixty of them are cancer free and forty of 'em have recurrent cancer okay that's a sixty percent success rate\nIf we treat the same hundred men with Gleason seven or PSA tend to twenty hours success rate is Ninety percent\nSo nine out of the hundred men or cancer free so the other place has sixty percent we have Ninety percent so lined the men out of a hundred versus sixty minutes out of a hundred while that's fifty percent better why because sixty\nMan there if you add fifty percent to that\nSixty man that'd be another thirty man and I'd be Ninety man and that's how we get our statistics that we are fifty percent better than the other guys\nAnd when does that come into play why see so many men who go and have treatment elsewhere with markedly less success and you're talking about disease with two hundred thousand many years let's say two hundred thousand men a year have prostate cancer\nAnd their results as to say altogether if our results or Ninety percent of all the results are sixty percent\nYou're talking about tens of thousands more men every year would be cancer free if they came to us versus going to have radical surgery robotic surgery here I Am a tea or other other methods of treatment so that's how we get the data sixty out of a hundred\nMen there\nAt the most prestigious centers versus Ninety out of a hundred men here now and say well\nIf you go to Atlantic City and your gamble hundred dollars in one casino says you have a sixty percent chance of winning and other casino has a Ninety percent chance of winning where would you rather gamble your money\nAnd your life is obviously more important than your money right we believe so and that's why we fight for your life\nThat's why we have information to send to
