hindsight\nYou know ... ... after\nThe reason I Want to sell it is because you wouldn't buy it again\n\nIt's also for the same reasons you wouldn't buy it again you wouldn't keep it by the way you can apply that decision making tool to almost anything if you got a boat sitting in the yard that you never use and you look over then go you're not never buy another boat then so that one\n'cause you

if this is a true story this woman lives here with us in New York City and she's been\nTold they're going to cut out her lung delivering oxygen if she makes it through this procedure and you would think that the surge in the surgeon went to medical school I assume it went to medical school to make people better I went to medical school because I wanted to help people\nWouldn't he have done the same thing\nWith an e and if you wanted to make her better why didn't he tell her the dom why don't you go see Dr Lederman hunter Lederman has a new method of treating lung cancers without cutting bleeding surgery operating blood transfusion chest tubes hospitals you just walk into Dr Lieberman's office\nHe mapped out the treatment after explains what he does and if you agree\nThat need maps without an as a team of experts he was first in America do body radio surgery obviously first in New York to do body radio surgery he has the longest experience doing buddy radio surgery in America has been at it for decades and with Dr Lederman you don't have to cut out\nYour along you don't have to cut out half of your along you don't have to walk around with oxygen enough to be in the hospital why don't you go to Dr Lederman now that would be the logical thing than a surgeon should want to tell his or her patient right\nDoctors should wants to tell the patient all the options all the\nChoices that so we when we see patients with cancer are suspected cancer had Thirteen eighty four Broadway where we work where we treat patients where we see patients with\nNew or suspected cancers about afraid about talking of surgery I'm not afraid about talking about chemo or no treatment or radio surgery or radiation I'm not afraid because I Know that we have the longest experience I Know the great appeal and I know how it is to be sick and to be facing a surgery\nThat you don't really want and the surgery that may not even make it better in fact the surgery might take your life away\nOr might change your life so you never the same quality of life and imagine if that surgeon told his patients hey you don't need to have lung surgery you can see Dr leader but and then most likely have better results than most likely not need surgery and most likely keep your breathing and most likely\nKeep on going like you're going except the minus the cancer probably all of us\nAnd explained everything he's already at cardiac ... dance you've got all the damage you can imagine from Smokey had Colorado to end our direct amazed that did the wrong road around his carotid arteries cardiac stands yeah COPD lung cancer and he came to me for treatment we talked about\nAll the treatment so what's the difference between the woman I talked about earlier today and this man well there's one difference this family already treated I didn't tell you that but we already treated his lung cancer with radio surgery five treatments pinpoint treatments how do we do it all patient lays on the table there is no claustrophobia there's no ... no bleeding\nNo pain come in and get a treatment in ten minutes later you turn around and go out and got a nice dinner or somewhere or go to work or go to a Macy's or go celebrate life for a walk in the park but that's what radio surgeries about you come in and get a treatment and turn around\nAnd do what you want your not locked in the hospital with diabetes and cutting and bleeding chemo and\nTubes and that's what we do and this man we treated him which was the last year and he came in here the new scan and he's in remission no new cancer the cancer retreated has gone he is in remission with\nNo side effects no bleeding though cutting the suppression of immune system though I v.'s no test tubes no hospitals is in remission\nAfter a few ten minute treatments with invisible beams that attack is cancer radio surgery the treatment\nFirst in America here with Dr leader but this is the work we do every day

her pictures in uniform shoes handsome\nBeautiful woman she could run I don't know she was the fastest runner in the army and she served at the highest levels\nBut yet recently she developed a liver cancer [noise] she was worked up to them or I'm a blood test shut the mirage she had liver cancer and she saw service it's again it's all surgeons and they wanted to cut out half of her liver and she declined\nIn fact she had no knowledge of what she was going to do she just did not want to have surgery\nShe did not want to have surgery and for six months she went wandering around wondering what to do about this liver cancer and finally a listener like you told her about our work and she came here and we worked or up shipping that any new\nTesting a six month so we re staged or found the cancer found out that it's growing in six months now sort of one or deal with all ever there were two nachos little liberal because of the group\nI asked her about her intentions and we spoke about all the options like we always do and she chose to have radios surgery and I should tell you one more thing we saw her and treated her three years ago and she came in this week she was just here complete remission\nAnswers gone she is fine she came with pictures of her new military uniforms from the U.S service incredible feeling fine happy safe comfortable confident\nThank you for your trust in us and thank you for excellent response and we wish you well and hope she lives to be a hundred and twenty or good excellent health\nAnd human centered daughter last year she said her daughter to

left ear and the dermatologist in the surge just want to cut out part of his ear and put it in a patch do what's called ... chess most surgery he does not want someone cut out part of his ear he doesn't want surgery and slicing dicing\nI should tell you by the way he knows what Moses he's already had he had it on his hand and he had it on the right bridge of his nose\nSo he's had Moses on his nose and mo was on his hand and he doesn't want\nIt any more he doesn't like how they keep on slicing and slicing put patches in doesn't like the results especially when there's non invasive treatments for skin cancer like the work we do recruited\nThousands of patients with cancers including many many many with skin cancer over decades claim a solid base also anywhere in the body and not just say anywhere I could say had any where some of the anywhere it's would embarrass you probably that that's who I work we do a mini skin cancers of course in sun expose areas around the face\nThe eyes that knows the IRS mouth at one point we had\nMany many people about seven patients getting treated for cancer the nose all the same time because it is a popular well tolerated treatment here\nAt

cheek cut out of the patch put it that would never look the same and he came to me is actually was treated last year he came to be for follow up\nHe's doing great he's at or mission his cheek is fine that cancer is gone and that's the way we like it that's all we most commonly see with high success rates for skin cancers most anywhere in the body\nAnd I can tell you most anywhere\nTo add an email from someone who had my closest one ... which is a kind of answers infiltrating through the skin and they've had extensive chemo and other treatments nothing\nWork and they asked is our dream of work and the answer is most commonly yes so we treat a variety of skin cancers even matter static cancers to the skin\nMany people will tell you the skin is the biggest Oregon and some cancers spread to the skin breast cancers commonly spread to the skin many women sadly believe that removing the breast\nWill make it so that the cancer never comes back there\nBut in fact the most common site for breast cancer to recover is the skin where the breast once was so just because you choose to have a mastectomy doesn't protect you from are currents of the cancer another big teaching point if you want the best breast cancer treatment you might\nWant to come in here before you get to the surgeons well some information in a book that immunity to send to if you wish just car office\nThe two one
