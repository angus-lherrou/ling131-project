{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "But I'm not doing this for forty years so this was not okay\nRight I agree I'm I'm believe me I'm doing everything I can to get him to stop him I was forty two pounds I'm a I'm I'm you know try and everything I'm Talking to all the doctors trying to get it to stop but wow they're caught a disease called Syria and you know something\nThat I never heard of it I was ... I kept the pain is unbelievable how much are you still over white then as associated with obesity\nWell it's not but you only [laughter] so they had I had him in high school and then I didn't have him for Nineteen years and the only thing that happened after Nineteen years where they gain weight known that when I started again so I'm I'm trying not to open that that might be\nYou know the question what do you why now so I weigh about two sixty now okay and you lost forty pounds she said for what\nYou have about forty three pound them and I'm Still going um let me know still doing going strong women that\nOkay okay good news is good for you well done thank you yeah I mean when that kind of pain no you can learn to do a lot of different things that we found out there um so I you know 'cause I I'm I'm not only mildly curious about this um\nIn terms of bless your heart the pain you've got but the uh the truth is is that the financial troubles are going to continue as long as you continue having a ten thousand dollar bill every three months right\nExactly and I assume you've got health insurance I Do so when you have a kidney stone event what is your out of pocket cost\nBetween two and six thousand dollars\nPer yeah okay and what is your household income\nOr about sixty sixty sixty five I think\nYou know and so if you budget twelve thousand a year for medical on out out of that it does make it hard to get some traction\nRight well especially with our credit card debt that we're that we've we we paid off twenty five thousand we thought about thirty laps so we're we're making headway but you know the the hospital bills are going up at the same time\nYou know why I Would just give you permission to look let's win this medical battle and not expect huge headway until you do yeah\nBecause you take sixty thousand miles twelve thousand you don't and then by the way you want to eat out of that too I'm a you're not going to make mega mega headway on this debt until you solve this medical problem but usually if you can stay even not going to hold or and or make some progress while you\nSolve this bigger issue then as soon as that's gone um\nYou know you're going to be a new man in so many ways\nRight\nSo I mean I I just cannot see this being something that you go oh twice a year I have a kidney stone for the next forty years out of I just ... that just is not a that's not a tenable scenario to me so I I think something is figure it out here along the way\nIn the process I I just can't um maybe there are people that do that I don't know I've never heard of that but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist I'm not a medical professional by any stretch\nSo um but let's say that it takes two years to solve this and you know that's twenty four thousand dollars out of pocket that ... coming up you know well that's just going to be\nThat is what you're fighting you know you just got this thing you're fighting in and it's going to slow down your progress it's not going to keep you from making progress but it's going to slow it down and just give yourself permission to do that and let's let let let's win the battle that you're fighting and that's the the battle for your health\nTo get your health back oh bless you sir wow ouch\nOh broke is with us in Tampa, Florida Hi Brooke how are you\nGoing to have cable either but I said I already know the answer to that [laughter] [laughter]\nBut I was actually calling I was wondering I'm only you mentioned you know where\nA lot of school and I had a crush it even more so on that Tony ... aspect that it was like I'm twenty four oh put out a little bit of student loans that aren't bad habit I tried one out and getting like\nA lot more and grants I'd probably won't even have a look at them again until ... am I won't be adding any idea what\nI'm trying to work as much as I Know yeah but you have any advice for time magazine like trying to both Tony how and trying to get like something a little bit off the show and I want to try that they have a a learning that only what you have\nA little longer on school side you know\nWell the first thing you do is your budget obviously your time for your classes\nAnd a new budget your time for your study around your classes and in the new budget work I'm a social comes after that I'm most people if they throw a brick through their television they found about thirty hours a week\nAnd um that's pretty amazing right there\nI mean people ask me how I read so many books a year I just don't watch a lot of TV anymore\nAnd I'm not mad about television I don't think that doubles and there although we probably is having a pretty good time there but um it's not like it's something like that it's not like a spiritual thing it's just a matter of what do I want to spend my time on that gives me my best life\nI'll spend my time on grandbabies children wife\nMe work reading\nThese or do you know a long time before us but my time she'll just being intentional with your time you'll be amazed how much time I mean you know how many ... you'd be amazed how many people spend two hours a day on Facebook\nAnd they talk about a colossal freaking waste of time there's one so um if you just stayed off social media completely or virtually ... almost completely and he turned off your television you can make a pretty good living with that time\nThe second thing I Would do other than that is other than getting away from time oysters and budgeting my time is your best\nIncome production things at your age wall in school when you need to control your time are typically some kind of self employed or straight commission slash self employed idea\nAt twenty four years old you can make more money ... and babysitting\nYou make Fifteen twenty bucks an hour doing that\nYou can make more money cleaning people's houses you can make twenty five or thirty dollars an hour doing math and neither one of these things require extremes levels of skill\nI mean yes you obviously know something about children and it would be good if you had CPR at the Y. you've taken the clash and got certified and so All right but and\nYou know those those sorts of things but you can make really good money and control your time or book the times that you're willing to do those things around her classroom time\nDoing that so do away with the time oysters intentionally budget your time and look for self employed and or straight commission ideas where when you work you get paid very well and you control when you work\nAnd work a lot\nI was selling real
