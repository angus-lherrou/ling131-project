patients right now with skin cancers talked about one man who had a skin cancer the nose and then we found the prostate cancer knowing for the FBI agent was a skin cancer on the right hand and we've been\nTreating him in most on the left hand who created the right hand and he's had his few treatments and always back to work actually win\nEvery day to work you came in for treatment it every day went to work then we have a dentist an oral surgeon facial surgeon who specialty was\nCutting off people's noses and replacing it with a blob of tissue for other people who had knows cancers but when he had those cancer he came here and when he had knows cancer\nHe does not allow anyone to cut off his nose and when he had no as cancer he did allow anyone like cut off his nose and so on a blob of tissue from his leg or has bought stocks or some other place no he came here because he wanted the invisible beams of radio surgery Dr Lieberman's\nTreatment to hit the cancer to leave his nose intact and make the cancer go away and\nThat's the work that we do every day here at radio surgery in New York and\nSo for this man this is a doctor who\nFor other people it cuts off their noses sticks out like a lab for him he came running here and that's what happens to so many people they just do not want the usual treatment as a doctor who knew what the usual treatment as the participant in the usual treatment of\nRemoving people's noses put on came to him well guess what he came to\nRadio surgery in New York and you can to I can tell you there's so many doctors come here and so many doctors send their patients here because they know there's a different level of care personal level where you can have a doctor's triple board certified working for you Harvard trained this is what happens\nAt Thirteen before Broadway works up most insurance is Medicare Medicaid\nAnd she didn't want to go home to die she wanted to come to Thirteen any for Broadway and she came to their today for\nBroadway and we analyzed her and we staged or a she came six months ago and ever since then she's been getting better and we were one or two treatments so weak cancers getting better those two big marshmallow size masses of cancer in the chest and the armor gone away\nAnd well she was sent to us in bad shape because of the extensive cancer and we're hurting her and she's getting better and the cancers going away and this is a very sensitive cancer most cancers by the way are very sensitive to radio surgery so this is technology that the super duper big place doesn't have\nToo many people call me and said oh Dr Lederman everyone must be doing what you're doing well very ones doing what I'm doing why are all their patients here with me at Thirteen any for Broadway why do they come to me why did they send their patient\nHome to die if they do what I Do the fact is they don't they don't have the experience of the technique that don't have the leadership that on the team they don't have the stamina to do what I Do and what we do our team are excellent\nTeam of doctors and physicists and do some atrocious and tax nurses and staff but we do every day to fight for\nYou and fight for those with cancer and fight for your neighbor down the street who was suffering please you're listening to this program you're learning a lot please listeners save lives listeners save lives by informing other people about options so please\nGive your neighbors and friends and loved ones and that little person down the street is suffering a book or a business card or helpful hand called Dr Lederman two one two choices\nTo one to two four six forty two thirty seven everyone needs help especially in moments of desperation this woman got help because of you because of\nA listener like you who helped\nHer when she thought she had to go home and die now she's not die and she's doing well cancers go in a way it's been six months and the cancers on the run after radio surgery even though it's stage for cancer this is the work that we do as there should be for Broadway Broadway and thirty eight street\nAnyone talking about a man is fifty six years old he came to me is from Jamaica Jamaicans have the highest\nProstate cancer rates in the world of the high cancer rates is fifty six he has a positive family\nHistory actually I'm quitting his brother for prostate cancer and this fan as a high PSA is ... seven and yet an\nMRI done it was worked up elsewhere did a lot of a biopsy well he has got a family histories black with no one in six black when we'll have prostate cancer one and twenty three black when will die of prostate cancer the death rate is two hundred and forty percent higher\nThan other groups so we make an emphasis to educate that's why we're here today and every day on the radio to\nEducate and he got a biopsy yeah the Gleason seven cancer higher than normal his brother as cancer is black is from Jamaica the Caribbean as lots of cancer blacks have lots of cancer double the rights\nAnd as soon as negative so it was a good day for him just because you have a high PSA doesn't mean that has to be cancer there was no cancer the biopsy of course we'll continue to follow him\nThey gave them copies of the pathology and copies of the blood test has copies of everything that's what I Believe it was for patients to be empowered we like to empower the patience to empower you by educating you that's why we're here on the\nRadio every day that's why our staffers at two one two choices to into two four six forty two thirty seven to take your calls and to make appointments for you know talking about sixty five\nYear old man who's married with one child\nHe works for the mentally handicapped people as urologist\nSaw many years this PSA rose to seven point for for hit a biopsy done any of the Gleason seven cancer and well shopped around his urologist believes in our work is Caesar patients and he knows for Gleason seven cancer we have a fifty percent higher\nSuccess rate than with open surgery a robotic surgery or standard radiation and that's why he sends his most important patients to us and he sent this man\nTo us that I should tell you one more thing he sent this man to us a year ago and today a year later he's in remission doing well no radical surgery know robotic surgery PSA is zero it was ten when he came to us it's all the way down to zero normal\nBelow normal even doing well with his sex life working in the journal life work in\nAnti is happy and content with his treatment which is this time successful at well tolerated good results for him with his cross to answer\nThat we're talking about a gentleman who sixty years old he was born in Iran and the other rights side of the crews to Rome another acoustic Rome ahead decreased hearing in the left ear so one ear was rotten and he had an ... the hearing nerve of the right here so it's a this is really tough for him\nThe right ear has a brain tumor an ear tumor the left ear as rotten he said ringing in the years he's had trouble with balance he was diagnosed and the surgeon wanted to cut on the year but if they cut on the air they leave I'm\nDeaf and then he'd be deaf in both ears it'd be data deaf in the ... girl my ear and death and the ... near so he came to us at search any foreign Broadway because he knows of our non invasive treatment and we treated him one more thing I should tell you we treated him years ago and he came to me this week and he checked in this week and\nHe is in remission the brain tumors controlled that caused enormous\nFine Andy here's here's with the tumor gone in the same era that we treated if he had surgery most likely he'd be deaf\nIn that if he had surgery most likely to have damaged the facial nerve with us his face is fine he said no complications that treatments in ten minutes you came in late on the table we send the visible beams to attack his brain tumors acoustic Roma had no side effects\nAnd the tumor continues to shrink and he is fine and grateful because he's hearing from the era that we created he relied on us to be truthful and honest\nTo treat card to be every minute of the day\nAnd we offered treatment to him to try to protect his hearing nerve try to protect them from the tumor and we've succeeded and keeping his hearing keeping is balanced keeping his face and getting rid of the tumor so that's a great results for him and for that reason he is very happy like they so happy he certainly\nRonnie set his brother who has a prostate cancer Gleason seven to us also a couple of years ago and the brother is also cancer free in remission for\nPolice in seven and he knows what our results were Ninety percent success if he had surgery for robotic surgery or open surgery or standard radiation the success rates all the sixty percent so lots of reasons to stay out of the hospital and help treatment with us at Thirteen any for Broadway were wakes up most
