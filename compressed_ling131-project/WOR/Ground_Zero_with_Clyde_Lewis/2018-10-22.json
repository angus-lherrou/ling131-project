{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "The architect of our core strategy that\nReally what trading is is just to transfer money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing\nI think that's an important concept to remember because it's not like the money just grows on trees and all of a sudden it shows up in our count right what happens is there's a buyer and seller\nAnd there's a transaction that occurs and there's a winner and there's a loser and a lot of times we we forget about that side of the market but the markets are really just a conduit and this is one of the ways I explain it to my classes as\nThe markets or a conduit that just hooks us all together that's really all the marketplaces it's a meet up\nWe all go there to hang out and what do we do that well we buy and sell stocks and people who want to sell stocks\nShow up with their stocks and people who want to buy stocks go there to buy stocks it's just like a farmer's market but at the stock market or commodities market\nBut it's just buyers and sellers and money transfers like a farmer's market when I buy tomatoes money transfers transfers from my account into somebody else's account and it's the same thing in the financial markets and a lot of times we don't realize that\nAs we're losing somebody else who made the right decision is actually out there making\nYeah and they're also living their lives most of us right now with jobs are stressed out we're worried about losing our job especially for the correction comes again\nMost people are just one paycheck away from poverty and so a lot of our students are figuring this out how do I go from being emotional to becoming strategic\nAnd the way they do that is to get the proper education learning how a three hour session can completely change your alive and you know Ryan you know I've talked about this over and over again\nHolidays are coming up it's that time of year again\nEveryone's going to make their resolutions yeah right well that's kind of silly because the resolution is basically your intention to do something and the two biggest ones we hear what I'm going to lose weight this year ... out of ... out of out of debt and made our money but the difference here right now is don't just make it a resolution make it a promise to yourself\nThat you're going to figure out a way to get more financially secure\nYeah I remember my grandpa used to say this and I remember hearing it somewhere else too but I'm just gonna give him credit for it but he used to always say a that a goal without a plan and executed will plan is this is a dream you know go without a plan is a dream and and that's one of the things that we spend a lot of time on an online training academy is that step by step plan that\nStep by step process on how to accomplish the goal because any and we are we're going to come up to the holidays here pretty quick and all of a sudden everybody's going to plan out their New Year's resolutions I don't remember all the statistics we went through it back in January on the show but it ends up being something like within four weeks\nEighty percent of the people have completely given up and I'm not even thought about their New Year's resolution and part of that is there wasn't an executed will plan\nThey didn't know exactly what to do tomorrow ...\nCould plan right now is the gyms knowing they're going to start running their commercials in there and you know\n... and they're here to make a killing thirty bucks a month but at the gym membership skyrocket but at the same time that you're putting our our best foot forward and giving us an opportunity to reach that financial goal is critical out there as well and and we have to do\nWhat we have to do what it takes to accomplish the goal we want to lose a little weight we got to spend a little more time on the treadmill\nAnd we want to make a little more money

Lederman leading cancer and prostate cancer not in the spring he first New York with Frank native brain radio surgery first in America\nAnd in the western hemisphere finding radio surgery you can also call Dr Lieberman at you when you're killing for a free informative and DVD paid doctor Lederman we're back\nTo about a man who was sixty eight years old is it accounts and he runs the counting business he's married with one child he's been working with the counting business all his life he was diagnosed with colon cancer ten years ago he had surgery at one of the big hospitals in neighboring state had surgery and\nAdds a therapy than two years ago\nHis backside started having terrible pain and he was found metastases to the say Crum had added all ... of the sacred with a tale bone\nAnd he went to one of the big hospitals in the neighboring state\nAnd how they gave him radiation is how most places give radiation which is large areas large number of treatments large areas and they included as bladder even though it was the tale about the sacred ... the cancer and that\nAnd number one the treatment doesn't work the cats who grew back and number two the standard radiation hurt his bladder so he lost control of his bladder and he's angry about that he's angry that they didn't do pinpoint treatment like us he's angry that he wasn't told that they lose control the bladder\nAnd he's angry at his wedding his pants and the treatments at work and the pain is terrible and then he came here and we offered them treatment even though he had treatment in the same area so big teaching point people asked that all the time Dr Lederman\nCan you treat me if I have already been treated and the answer is most likely yes we need to see each person but most likely yes and we were able to treat the mass and the sacred we were able to treat it with no side effects he was so leery about getting treatment because of this big super duper place they treated them\nWith lots of treatment weeks and weeks of treatments that doesn't work and caused him harm\nWhereas with us it was just a few treatments that were pinpoint to the cancer and his pain in his cancer went away what a difference and you can just see from this case exactly why we brought body radio surgery to America because\nLarge fields large numbers of treatments weeks and weeks just didn't help him cause harm to him and he's angry about the results of elsewhere is happy about our results and that's why we're talking about today is\nTo give me an example of our work versus one of the super duper big hospitals and lots of people falsely believe that all the treatments that same it is not the same\nThere's huge differences between our work and the work of others that's why we brought body radio surgery to America that's why\nOur name as radio serving in New York so you can understand the difference that's why we're on the radio every day\nTo explain the difference to educate she'll get caught up in the weeks and weeks of useless treatment that was toxic to him like that treatment at that big hospital was to him\nTrading his tail bought and most of us never think about our sacred you don't think about the sacred and we don't think about the Sacramento something bad happens to train him hit a cancer traveled the sacred yet standard treatment\nThat just didn't work and caused him harm exactly the opposite of ours ours work with no harm that's the difference that's why we're here Dr lead over the search for Broadway Broadway at thirtieth street in the heart of New York city [laughter]\nI was thinking about a woman who Seventy nine years old she was fine until five years ago ... just found the cervix cancer stage four she had back pain she had cancer and those in the neck in the pelvis in the abdomen and she started chemotherapy\nInches on chemotherapy for four years plus immunotherapy I Know I mean the therapy so popular\nShe was on a meal therapy it didn't work for years of came out of work she was in the hospital for toxicity shed platelet counts ... two hundred thousand or political was two thousand down by Ninety nine percent of the cats are kept traveling shit cancer the powers lymph nodes well she finally\nCame to\nUs after four years of chemotherapy she told me yesterday she came in the office yesterday she told me that she was spending\nA million dollars a year her bill was a million dollars a year and just say oh yeah I was insurance but who's paying insurance you and me are paying the insurance that's why the rates are so high\nSo I don't think that no one pays someone pays including you and me and everyone else and finally she came to us and we treated her for that mess in the pelvis for the massive lymph nodes and finally she is out of pain and suffering finally after four years of chemo for years or even a therapy\nThat doesn't work she came here with good results this is the work that we do every day so when people say oh Kay mode in a work it's time to go home to die or a hospice or something\nTo hold onto your horses there's other choices you don't have to have for years that came to know it doesn't work it became a doesn't work in a short period of time\nMost likely would never work and most people for most people not talking about everybody but for most people came only works temporarily at fast and there's lots of side effects for many people the exact opposite of our work I work is directed at the cancer\nWithout chemicals throughout the body so there's lots of lots of reasons to come to thirty days before Broadway Broadway at thirtieth street lots of reasons and I were talking about uh sixty five year old woman she's married with two kids had a stroke and high blood pressure diabetes\nShutting dialysis and she had a stroke because at one of the big hospitals and while she was at the hospital with the stroke they've had the breast cancer\nThat is a biopsy they've found breast cancer the cancer was very regular throughout the brass yet probable lymph nodes in her armpit for weight went up twenty pounds from one mind either was Seventy she's five foot one\nEye exam ... a centimeter mess in the upper portion of the breast that's the size of my fist huge mess with a three set of bitter mass the armpit they put a port in her chest while they're ready to give her chemotherapy even though she had a stroke\nTwo weeks before just high blood pressure and kidney failure and this mass\nAnd they were going to give her chemotherapy what we know came only works temporarily she came to us and why don't you come to us because she wants our treatment and she understands with our treatment of beneficial effects most likely or durable with chemotherapy the beneficial effects are likely if they happened temporary", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "year": "2018", "city": "New York", "day": "22"}
