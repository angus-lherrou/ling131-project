{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WOR", "content": "She's younger she didn't want to want to work a desk job anymore she had recently gone through a divorce and what she decided to do is she wanted to pursue trading currencies and she realized that being in Europe was the center of the currency universe\nShe moved herself to Barcelona, Spain and she knew that she was young enough it had time to do whatever she wanted to do\nA lot of our older students are really starting to reassess what's going on in their lives right now and they realize they got to keep up with the cost of living right things keep getting more and more expensive every year but imagine that you go in the markets for a couple of hours a day\nCommit to maybe one hour a day to practice\nTo get the skilled down and then you could start generating money that you can pass on to future generations your kids grandkids anybody you want to help in the future\nYeah I think the key to this too is it's not about creating a fulltime job it's about creating that full time life\nYou know we talk a lot about financial freedom nuts\nThat's really what it boils down to is being able to move to Spain if you want to move to Spain you know for for a while I I spent my my winters in the Caribbean and\nI was living in Boston at the time and and I had somebody actually come up to me and say why do you go [laughter] I chuckle Everytime I think about it and he said why do you why do you leave Boston and go to\nA Puerto Rico in the wintertime and I looked at him and said have you ever spent a winter here in Boston and he was like well yeah and I'm like that's why when it gets really pretty for you and cold here in the wintertime and I'm running from it\nAnd that sort of the things that that the markets allow you to do is it doesn't matter where you it doesn't matter where you go as long as you have an Internet connection we've joked about it a few times Larry where back when I used to do that I when I used to go back and forth as I Would be down in Puerto Rico and I'd have that big a TNT air card hanging out of the side of my laptop\nThat it was almost the same size as my laptop\nAnd even my satellite radio down there like it only worked for like ... it only worked for eight AM to like noon 'cause that's when the satellite was over me and so it was it was hilarious but where we are from a technology standpoint is is is light years beyond where we were you know twelve years ago Fifteen Years ago when when I was just getting started in this\nAnd it's kind of a fun it's been a fun evolution to see but for everybody who is just getting started right now it's like it's like you have no idea how good you have it I feel like when I talked to a new traders I'm like my grandfather and I'm like oh when I went to school I had to walk up pill both ways and the snow\nYou know we had dial up Internet to now it's just in the palm of your hand but we have so much access to our money that really going in and just getting a little bit of skill and getting a little bit of a little bit of knowledge\nCan really go a long way we don't have to call up a broker and say hey you know what about this what about that it's just right at the ... hand\nIdentify the price and we want to pay set the order and then wait for priced really come down to you\nIt it ends up being that kind of classic negotiating tactic\nYou say you know and my grandfather taught me this when I was like five years old I remember going with him and he was buying my grandma new car and he said watch this he says I'm going to tell them the price I'm going to pay and ... and as soon as he says no we're going to get up and walk away\nAnd that's really how you approach the markets you say you know what I Want to buy this these these shares a stock but I Want to buy this price and if I can for this price that's okay there's lots of other stocks that I can go buy it a great price and you have to have that mentality and that is the mentality of the professional one of the things that can help you operate like a professional though is confidence\nConfidence can come from education confidence can come from buildings skill a great place to start that is it the half day class we've got a few tickets left before the show is over and we're going to give some away as long as Larry says okay I think it's okay

Ga Wall Street dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nWere some of the other kind of examples you can share with our audience out there as far as times where where people have come in and they've they've got the ball rolling they've taken that initial first step and how it's gotten him to that point a financial freedom splits\nConsistency Ryan most people come in and they make that commitment it's really pretty simple you know you have to be willing to commit ... coach double beat a point in your life and you're really wanted to make a change if you're somebody who's just kind of going from one thing to the next to the next year really never going to achieve what you want to do it's all about stepping back\nAsking yourself a simple question how's that life working for you if you're not happy right now than you have to get yourself out of your comfort zone start thinking there are better ways to do things but more importantly learn from people who already doing what you want to do I've heard my whole life\nYou know growing up at school that copying someone was bad well that's completely false you want to copy somebody who's doing what you want to do and who are successful so you need to be able to have mentors you need to be able to have coaches you need to be able to be somebody who really is willing to make a change\nBecause people don't change in fact on Stein once said the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome this is how most people live their lives they'd rather just\nContinue to be miserable not do anything different when there's a whole opportunity right in front of them to go out there and as you said giving up a couple of hours of your life where you can be watching TV or doing something else it's more important to invest in yourself to invest in some TV show out there\nYou know I remember seeing a as you were saying copying somebody being that the way you learn it it really is I I remember being in a in a class um you know ten Fifteen Years ago and I remember the instructor actually saying\nYou know if you want to be wealthy do what wealthy people do if you if you see somebody who is in the situation that you want to be in and if you follow them around all day long and you do the exact same things that they do eventually you will be in that same spot\nA and he brought up the the the the inverse side of that too and he said\nIf you follow somebody around who is making terrible kind of financial decision somebody who maybe there's a homeless person who's kind of lost everything and you do exactly what they do you know this is the same thing if you're copying that process you're going to end up in that situation and it's the same thing in the financial markets and it's one of the reasons why we teach\nOur students how they could identify what the financial institutions during one of the professionals doing what are the best people in the world\nDoing inside of these financial markets how can you identify that\nSo that you can go in and just simply do what they do so that you can get what they got now one of the ways there where we start this off one of the best way to do this has come out to a half day class invest three hours of your time she can see exactly what it takes to do that before we can do that I've only got what ten tickets left here we're at the end of the show is what that means\nAnd so one of the things is Larry can we give away these final time passed and let's\nGet some people educated changed their lives\nAll right well right now we've got to have to a class coming up in your area an acting classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes to really live life on your own terms to be able to generate the income that you need to be able to do the things that you want to do\nNow in a second you're going to have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you were driving now is a great time to pull over include with your passes who's going to be our professional insiders kit\nNow this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nLessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency and much much more\nThe professional insider kit makes it so you can get started right now\n... when you get a call now and reserve those seats the number is eight eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ...

us history\nShe saw surgeon even though they said well we're going to give me a little bit of chemotherapy and then when the cancer ... smaller or going to have the surgeon cut away your cancer\nThat's what they told her\nAnd she had one cycle of chemotherapy and then she came to me for a second opinion so again\nShe had a cancer of the ... dog she was jaundiced or yellow shed a little ... to stand by past the obstruction the jaundiced went away but she still have the cancer the cancer was in the ... and that they'll lymph node the lymph node was seen by CAT scan that Mariah that super duper big\nPlace so she came to me having\nOne psycho came well being told all the ... going to help you and then when that came out help share with the surge and come back and he's going to cut out your cancer that's what she was told him that she would she believed and then she came to ...\nBe and that's when that's when she started to understand what was going on with her first of all point number one while she was angry at the first hospital about telling her of the difficult diagnosis in fact the way that she is being treated they might well be right\nBecause she went to the second super duper hospital to get chemotherapy and surgery well number one they've already told or because of her age they're cutting the dose of the chemotherapy and she came to me this woman came to me a second time we've got a PET scan of her body\nTo hospitals no one got a PET scan knowing actually knew where the cancer had traveled\nThere were on the gas and they were only a guess and it was bad news and there were only guessing that they're going to give her chemotherapy and I told her the most likely the chemotherapy is not going to help that much which I truly believe it I'll tell you that of the fly in a minute and I told her also the surgeon who's had always going to see her after\nThe chemo and cut out the cancer they're never going to see that started again these are not going to cut out anything or if he tries he opens her up and just going to be a a scam surgery because he can't remove\nThe cancer where it is well where is that cancer what we got\nThe pet scan the little hospital didn't get the pet scan they could have\nThe big hospital super duper famous should I got the pet scan they didn't they just started chemotherapy and are given their came on chemo came up so we within an hour arranged for cancer marker test\nAnd a PET scan and she got the pet scan and the same day as a PET scan she came to me and we review the results and one of the pet scan\nShow with a PET scan showed not only had to travel to one lymph nodes not only did it go to to lymph nodes near the cancer near the clouds skins tumor by the bile duct tumor by the liver this is a tumor\nOr they'll Arab deliver and the gall bladder and the pancreas Israel ... carcinoma Z but also there was a mass in the neck in the super ... areas so there was the spread of the cancer caught in the bloodstream already\nAnd spread to the left neck area\nAnd I explained that to the patient and\nHer son in law I gave my pictures I gave the reports on like all the other places when they come here\nPatients have scans are reports the pictures and they can see exactly what they have they can go home and study what they have which I think is a fair way to do it and I think we all are fair way to do it as the top people the truth and the second the hospitals that are we going to give it came out to the giving came up for a while then they're going to cut out to cancer you'd be okay\nThat's ever going to happen in a million years and then they told her well she was only going to have six cycles and Serbia sooner while each cycle chemotherapy is three weeks three weeks times six is Eighteen weeks which means\nIt's almost four and a half five months and then four or five months to cancer well maybe it will respond to chemo and maybe it won't but you understand in a minute why it probably won't\nAnd the surgeon can never cut out the\nCancer and the multiple limb flow to the abdomen and the\nLymph nodes by the pay or to the ... and the ... carcinoma clap skins to more than the lymph nodes and then that could just won't help her to even attempt to have surgery because the cancer cells are already in the bloodstream and then the woman the patient and her son in law asked her well\nI don't understand Dr Lederman I don't feel anything when they give me chemotherapy everyone else gets chemo get sick and ... and does it feel fine and I don't feel anything\nAnd I said well it's entirely possible they produce the dose of chemotherapy so much\nDoes it does you're getting is in consequential you said ha ha\nYou're right Dr later when they told me they are going to give me a small dose because they're afraid of giving me a normal dose I said well there you go they've already told you in fact that\nThey're giving you a small dog similarly give such a small dose chemotherapy which is not very likely that help anyway is even less likely to help because when he gave a treatment that's not likely that help and then they reduced the dose there's less small or chance as a small small small chance even less than before that they will even\nWork and the woman said well why didn't they tell me that I said well they told you they're reducing the dose that isn't just make you understand however that when they reduced the dose they reduce your chances of success I said to her at radio surgery in New York we don't reduce the dos like that\nIf you're eighty four forty four twenty four you'll get a real dose of real treatment because our\nGoal is to successfully eradicate the cancers that we can attack if you want us to this up to the patient here the patient is the\nPresident of the United states of his or her body and if we go after to attack a cancer with invisible beams noninvasive beam snow caught any no bleeding\nThough anesthesia just you're laying on the table how does radio certainly work\nWhen it ... the body would computerize the body we find the cancer than from thousands of angles we sending\nBeams to attack the cancer all pain Leslie all non invasive Lee in minutes\nI said we go after the kids are in your file ducks in your lymph nodes we go after the cancer to eradicate the cancer we don't like to play games\nNow the big super duper hospital whether they're charging as if they're giving her real chemotherapy either she's paying the bill and the average bill nowadays is about ten thousand dollars per month\nFor chemotherapy so she's paying a big bill\nBut when they reduced the does the likelihood is very small it's going to really help her\nAnd it even if they gave her a full dose it doesn't help very much because she already has stage for cancer and these cancers even if it works for a little bit at the beginning future the cancers mutate and change and evolve so that the\nResponse or the effectiveness of chemotherapy falls even more with time even if they gave her the full dose and they're not intending to give her the full though since she turned to me and said well Dr Lederman how do I know what those are giving me why I said well number one you can go asked the doctor how much you reduce those or number two you could bring your papers here\nAnd number three were already calling that big super duper appropriate place to get the documents to see how much they're reducing those and why didn't they ever get a\nPET scan to see exactly where the cancer is so she and her\nSon in law are so happy they have come to see Dr Lederman at Thirteen Eddie for broad right not because it's me but because\nFinally they have some understanding of what's going on in her body and what the different hospitals are doing the first hospital she went to the emergency room where the doctor had no real experience with cancer other he recognized that she has a serious and grave cancer he told her that\nShe then went to a super duper big hospital and they're giving her chemotherapy and that's the standard of care in America even if they're likely to working is miniscule\nAnd you can then asked me well Dr Lederman why is chemotherapy the standard of care for cancers so many cancers if it doesn't work very much well\nThat's a political decision so medical decision but if you saw the likelihood of response for stage for ... to him or you will see the likelihood of a good adorable response is miniscule and the chemotherapy doctor knows that and so that chemotherapy doctor of the big hospitals reducing the those\nBecause they've already more or less I Believe written or off\nFor many successful outcome\nFor us when she comes here to there today for Broadway were able to attack the cancer in the cloud skin cancer with a common bile ducts meet in the lymph nodes that Perry Oric and in the super ... killer area\nThe super clinic there is a limb thought above the ... and then she asked me a question she said well Dr Lederman what's the difference between a biopsy and the pet scan and I said well it's a very good question\nA PET scan or a CAT scan or ... is a picture of the body it's showing the pictures is showing us masses showing activities showing abnormalities but a biopsy\nIs actually sticking a needle into some area whether it's into that lymph node in her neck or the lymph node in her abdomen\nI said if you want we can stick a biopsy needle into that ... vote and proved to you exactly what you have if you have a doubt but your PET scans letting up in the cloud skins tumor where you have a proof of putting cancerous it's letting up at the ... where you also know that it was positive bike cats get a number I it's\nBloody up at another ... and now the Supreme Court ... area so the ants\nBut nothing was done there was nothing done about the suspicious findings\nWow and now she\nComes in with a distorted breast as a retraction of the ... and these are both um an aside so what are the ominous signs are here well number one years ago the radiologist said she needs to get a biopsy number two she has a massive she\nCan feel number three she has a distortion of the breast number four\nShe has a nipple that's inverted on that same side but she has a very very very extensive cancer she said she's had lumps in the breast for a long time or what is a hundred and thirty seven pounds or ... feet I saw her eye exam winter\nAnd in the right breast there's market distortions depressed as a pen centimeter mass and my fist as a big fest her breast size is the mass of the breast size is ten centimeters my fists sizes eight centimeters so it's bigger than a big man's fist and when I examined her yes indeed should\nThe store so the ... distortion of the breast and flows probable under the right arm pits\nLeft side with the left side was fine the left them flows refine their lungs are fine grabbed him was fine and she'll she comes to us with a\nTen centimeter mass mass that's really been known about for years and sad to say ignored that can tell you that cancers in general do not go away by themselves a shirt and get hit by a car or you know follow the Empire State building but in general cancers\nKeep on growing\nAnd in this case ignoring this mass\nWhen it was there and growing and distorting the press to the radio just for saying hey there's something wrong here ignoring all that did that help this woman I met with her and the first thing\nShe says Dr leader but I Want you to save my breast I Need to save my for us I don't want to lose weight breast and maybe that's the reason she didn't get medical attention maybe because she was so\nFearful of losing her breast so we staged or up immediately we staged upper whole body from head to toe because we know that cancer is a breast can travel any where they want and cancers to wanna travel that's for cancers too and we stayed up immediately and gave her the answers immediately\nThat in fact this cancer had gone to lymph nodes had been in the breast and also went down to the pac ... so there's lots of local extend\nThe good news for this woman if there's good news is that the cancer is not traveled the on the local area\nWe talked about all the options I talked about chemotherapy and they made a therapy and hormone therapy and surgery and radiation\nAnd this woman wants our treatment only she does not want any chemotherapy she doesn't want any surgery she does not want any loss of the breast she wants our out patient therapy only that when you get a book which is called her office at two and two choices\nYou'll see a breast mass almost the size of hers that we treated and after treatment gone away with our pin point treatment\nBut talked about all the options the first time she came through with her husband at the second time she came through with or Eighteen year old son and I said well these are all the options and you can go home and have a family conference with all your loved ones and decide within about two or three hours she called me back and said Dr Lederman\nWe want your treatment\nAnd what happens in general and the people say that while we talk about it\nWe call their insurance so we called her insurance who got approval for her and she will be back immediately to commence therapy because she understands this cancers growing harming her already spread to lymph nodes and they can spread elsewhere we talked about all the options\nAnd she chose to have\nNon invasive invisible beams for treatment only of her breast cancer she wants to keep the breast\nShe wants no surgery no chemo\nThis is what she wants after the informed consent process or patients understand everything about their cancer all the questions are
