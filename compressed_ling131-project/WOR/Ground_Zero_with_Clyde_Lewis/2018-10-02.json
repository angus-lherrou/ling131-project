what can the cancer right in the middle of his face\nAbout two years ago here the cancer in the middle of the face he went to a super duper big hospital they found this way most cancer and they cut on him and they cut like a big circle on those right side of the face and the entire right side of his face is to form\nHis mouth is deformed his eyes to form the faces deformed\nAnd why is he coming to me if you had that big surgery well the cancer returned\nRight where the surgeon caught in the middle of his right face and it was by up seed and it's the same cancers claim is cancer and he went back to the same doctors and they were ready to cut\nOn him they were going to cut off the rest of his face others right side they've already deformed do the deformity is incredible and the sad it difficult for the patient came to me and he heard about our ability to treat cancers without\nCutting out bleeding without that surgery without anesthesia invisible beams and I saw him\nAnd I try to practice what I preach and I said well we need to stage you up we need to see if the cancer came back anywhere else now is a little bit like at my home state of Iowa where they have railroad tracks liberal tracks and they have a crossing and then all of a number of them but number one two three one two three is to tell you\nHow many cracks there are in case that one train goes away and you start going across the track\nAnd all of a sudden you get hit by a second train while the number of trucks is to warn you and just like the number of tracks to warn you in my home state of Iowa when you have one cancer coming back\nIs there a second cancer and so like I always say we like to get the staging up to see where the cancer is we stayed up this ... remember he saw the surgeon set a super duper big place are ready to cut off his face even more than they did a couple of years ago we staged them up and\nWell we found that the cancers already traveled to a lymph node under his chin so now is this cancer like a rock hard piece of cancer in the middle of the surgical field but\nNow he has cancer has traveled to the limb but also that big the forming surgery number one didn't help him cancers fact number two the form to him\nAnd he'll never be the same he'll never be oh God made him\nAnd number three the cancerous traveled to Olympics loud so thank God he came\nTo us we were able to stage 'em up before it was going to have a second to forming surgery we found the cancer the first cancer we found the second cancer and he wishes to have us treat him for this claim as cancer it's right in the middle of the surgical field this is the work we do\nOur success rate is very high on like chemo which only in general works temporarily our treatment generally works with a high degree of success permanently\nFor the rest of his life and that's what he wants and that sort of course we're going to work for to try to eradicate this cancer right in the middle of his right to face\nRight in the middle where he had this to forming surgery and this is the work we do this is why so many people with\nNew or recurrent cancers come to us every day at Thirteen before Broadway where we accept most insurances Medicare and Medicaid I Want to talk about a gentleman who Seventy years old he's married he has a son and he was fine until about three years ago you had blood in\nThe
