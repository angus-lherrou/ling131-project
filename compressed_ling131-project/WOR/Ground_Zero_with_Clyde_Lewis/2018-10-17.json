W\nRated number one in June W O R voice of New York and\nFifty one degrees there twelve o'clock in the morning I'm Steve guys men the numbers are out for tonight's big mega millions drawing those numbers are sixty nine\nAnd the doctor understood that she was talking to me a board certified cancer doctors are not the patience and she had to watch your words and when she had to watch your words all of a sudden the patient understood that she talked to me differently than she talked\nTo the patient and that's what the patient wanted to know the patient wanted to do if the chemo doctor was telling the truth or not the truth is exaggerating at that point she understood that the chemo doctor was exaggerating the benefits saying it was permanent\nWhen in fact the benefits of chemo or nearly never permanent for matter static stage for cancer or stage four uterine cancer then after a while doesn't even work whereas with radio surgery what is radio certainly by the way we just heard is totally the opposite of chemo chemo generally or\nPoisons or chemicals that go the body from head to toe and your nose and your toes and everything else get the same dose of chemo in general that the cancer gets and that's why there's toxicity because of the most going everywhere radio surgery is just the opposite and that's why we\nWere the first to perform sorry tactic radio surgery in America in the western hemisphere and\nOf course in New York because I understood very well decades ago that came all isn't so good for so many patients and many people don't want it many people are fearful but many people don't benefit from it many people are fed toxicity from chemo I'm all for ... for\nHelp so there's certain patients where I recommend chemo don't get me wrong sometimes I recommend chemo for a short period of time not at all is came home which is very different people\nDon't understand just like having one chocolate maybe tasty but having fifty piece of chocolate is terrible and the same is true with came on certain cases I may recommended temporarily but\nMost likely I Would never recommend it for the rest of your life\nInsurance may be great for the chemo doctor may be great for the hospital and it may be great for the pharmaceutical industry that may be great for the companies that make it so it produced said but at the end of the day the real question is what\nIs good for my patient what is good for my patient and it's getting chemotherapy good for the rest of her life and all of a sudden she understood at\nThe exaggerations that were being made about chemo for not true\nThat it wasn't a permit it\nMost likely for stage four at the beach or cancer for most cancers lung cancer a pancreas cancer or liver cancer so many cancers are comas kidney cancers melanoma fours with radio surgery when we\nTarget cancer most likely that cancer will never grow again for the rest of the life of the\nPatient which is such a huge difference but I'm such a leader Middlebury back\nWith Dr Lederman ... best prostate cancer treatment is custom tailored for you\nEach mainly prostate cancer is unique unfit for ... based upon PF queen ... that's like Dr lead I'm In constant pain early prostate cancer treatment most logical feed the data yourself not every man should get the treatment\nThat can lead or no cost impact I Can't think treatment it's all our patient aren't goals are your back please I'll avoid him radical surgery maintaining your thoughts will end urinary function on your life most insurance\n... and I've worked with for Twenty years he knows our work and he likes her work and he likes our quality of life and so he sent this Broadway actor to us for treatment\nAnd we talked about all the options of course you talked about surgery and radical surgery and robotic surgery and proton\nBeam and he saw our data actually you can call her office\nAnd get a book with yourself if you'd call our office at the two one two choices to two to four six four to three seven go see the comparison day there was this man\nSaw the comparison data his surgeon send them to us ... when he saw the day that he was persuaded that he should have our treatment and we started treating him and it was going very well everything was going very well then one day last year he came into our office and he says hide\nAnd then these collapsed in my arms to two hundred and twenty pound man collapsed in my arms and a cardiac arrest and well\nAs you know or or a boutique cancer treatment center and everyone pretty much does everyone else and so we resuscitated immediately and nine one one came and he had\nA complete recovery it was really very dramatic and whenever\nI see him we talk about this collapse and his wife was right by them and she was speechless as you can imagine when her main stay in our man and her husband and a lover\nCollapsed in my arms and were ... and he is now suddenly back to normal\nAfter that cardiac arrest but\nHe had his radiation treatment that is PSA is zero he is in complete remission that cancer is gone the cardiac arrest as ancient history as happy as healthy as fully activities doing everything\nThat he ever did this so I'm sure he'll always remember us not only for the successful true and it was prostate cancer which ... says now's zero he had remembered queens and six\nPSA a prostate cancer within months as ... as ... and he'll remember most likely for that cardiac arrest the might not remember all the\nTalk of other put his wife Shirley well and that's the kind of work that we do here at radio surgery New York you know talking about a woman who was eighty years old she's married with five children just fine until two thousand twelve of them\nAre mulch chest X ray she had a CAT scan shit a biopsy Paul on Long Island and then she was transferred and she had chemo and\nRadiation for lung cancer and it worked for a while and then the cancer came back and she had more and more came ... years of chemo and the cancer kept growing the way it was a hundred and forty pounds\nShe gained twenty pound shit pelvic fracture she was just a week from the chemo and shit hip pain\nFrom that and well she came to us\nFor treatment and she had this lung cancer which was very current after chemo the chemo wasn't working that came out was toxic she had a PET scan which showed a large mass with an SUV SUVs educational point\nWhich shows how much radioactive sugars picked up by like cancer of the pet scan showed a three by three centimeter mass or more than an inch about an inch and a quarter of an inch and a quarter and so she came to us she came to us because she her that she didn't need to\nHave chemo for the rest of her life and we talked about a little bit earlier in the show that people don't necessarily need chemo for the rest of their life a visceral when that came on the cancer was progressing in wasn't tolerated and so for so many reasons so many reasons\nWe were treating her for her cancer with five treatments outpatient therapy all pinpoint all non invasive well tolerated treatment and plus you came to us last year and she's now\nIn permission she's doing well a year later and that's the work that we do here at ... New York so it's another example of a lung cancer work ... work chemo wasn't tolerated and radio surgery work five shots ten\nMinutes each call out patient no coddling no bleeding they'll cost a phobia of this is the work that we do here at radio surgery new\nYork at thirty for Broadway or accept most insurance is Medicare\nMedicaid and they were talking about a gentleman with prostate cancer is forty nine so younger than average the average man with prostate\nCancer America's about sixty seven so he's Twenty years younger he's a black man I can tell you that there is more prostate cancer the black community one in six black men will get\nProstate cancer and one and twenty three will die of prostate cancer well he is a black man forty nine with prostate cancer two children and he had a PSA that went up to five point seven six and a Gleason seven cancer and he came for treatment became for human because he did not want surgery he\nKnows that with surgery for Gleason seven cancers success rate is sixty percent with us it's Ninety percent he knows with us most likely he'll keep his sex life and his urinary life and that's indeed what happened\nHe came to us more than two years ago he is now cancer free his PSA is zero his sex life works is urinary life works and\nHe is very happy so some other successful story of cancer\nTreatment is ran by young men with prostate cancer Gleason seven ... seven is how the cancer looks up to the microscope his PSA which is a blood test prosthetic specific antigen has descended to zero he's working full time no side effects sex life\nWorks urinary life works and he's happy and he's satisfied that we're talking about a man who Seventy three years old\nWho was Indian born he is divorce with two kids and he had a PSA of nine point nine five and seven and he went to another hospital he didn't come to us he went to another hospital and he had the treatment that which doesn't work and the cancer just kept on spreading and spreading and that's such a difference\nAnd why do I tell you the story well number one it's true story and number two it's sort of point\nTo understand that all treatment is not the same there's differences in treatment even places that say they do the same work as a way to look on page two of our prostate Portland and you'll see that the results are different our results are superior why well it's it's like an artist and a paint\nBrush or a sculptor each doctor does different work and if you compare our work to other big hospitals in New York City you'll see better results that's better results compared us versus robotic surgery us versus open surgery versus standard\nRadiation us versus even season radiation you'll see the difference that's why I urge people have a cancer to give us a call or two and two choices and see the different just man has now come to us because the cancers traveled\nAs soon as ... because his first treatment wasn't successful so it's very important to get the best\nPossible treatment first and that's why so many people come to Thirteen any for Broadway Broadway and thirty eight street in Manhattan where take a short break we'll be
