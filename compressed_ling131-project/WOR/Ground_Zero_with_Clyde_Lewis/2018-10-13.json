are back this up Dr Lederman we're talking about cancer living better than being smarter and understanding more and helping yourself and your neighbors and your loved ones they've been the person down the street who is suffering\nThis is what we do every day on the radio I got an email from a man who said well maybe your statistics are wrong and I want to explain to him how exactly are statistics are for example\nProstate cancer so if someone a man has Gleason seven cancer Gleason seven is how the cancer appears under the microscope romantic Gleason seven cancer or they have a PSA from ten to twenty\nAnd you go to a usual hospital radical surgery or robotic surgery or standard radiation\nThe success rates about sixty percent\nIf that patient comes to us the success rate is Ninety percent okay and he's talking about how do we calculate the difference between sixty and Ninety well simple\nLet's just say hospital act super duper poop or a hospital acts treats a hundred men and sixty of them are cancer free and forty of 'em have recurrent cancer okay that's a sixty percent success rate\nIf we treat the same hundred men with Gleason seven or PSA tend to twenty hours success rate is Ninety percent so Ninety out of the hundred men or cancer free so the other place has sixty percent\nWe have Ninety percent so lined the men out of a hundred versus sixty minutes out of a hundred while that's fifty percent better\nWhy because sixty men there if you add fifty percent to that\nSixty man that'd be another thirty man and it'd be Ninety man and that's how we get our statistics that we are fifty percent better than the other guys and when does that come into play well I see so many men who go and have treatment elsewhere\nWith markedly less success and you're talking about disease with two hundred thousand men a year or so to say two hundred thousand men a year have prostate cancer\nAnd their results as to say altogether if our results or Ninety percent of all the results are sixty percent you're talking about\nTens of thousands more men every year would be cancer free if they came to us versus going to have radical surgery robotic surgery here I Am a tea or other other methods of treatment so that's how we get the data sixty out of a hundred\nMen there\nAt the most prestigious centers versus Ninety out of a hundred men here and I often say well if you go to Atlantic City and your gamble hundred dollars in one casino says you have a sixty percent chance of winning\nAnd other casino has Ninety percent chance of winning where would you rather gamble your money and your life is obviously more important than your money right we believe so and that's why we fight for your life\nThat's why we have the information to send to that's why we have for prostate cancer booklets and DVDs fertile\nBody cancers cancers along and breast skin and pancreas liver\nAnd bladder and other organs books and DVDs and also for brain tumors and brain cancers we have specific information You're welcome to car office at two and two choices You're welcome to come in and pick up extra booklets lots of people pick up extra book this information\nTo give to their friends to have their friends learn about\nOptions and that can tell you radio listeners save lives even our website as listeners save lives dot com listeners save lives dot com and why is our website
