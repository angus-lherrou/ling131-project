I don't understand how somebody couldn't stop you know we don't know all the mechanical issues there's just so many questions to answer the NTSB is going to brief again later today and uh I've got some indication that they're going to have additional new information\nBut these investigations by the NTSB\nCan go on for some time we're probably not going to get\nProbable cause or what actually happened today or anytime soon\nWe're on the ABC News senior transportation correspondent David curly David have there been concerns about these limos I mean I live here in New York City and they just seem to get bigger and bigger they take up the whole block and they don't look like you can maneuver them too easily\n... to ... care and basically these are chops I mean there is\nThe car companies are really make these stretch lows it's somebody buys a vehicle whether it's an issue the ear\nOr a big Cadillac or whatever and and cuts in half extends the chassis builds this vehicle there is no federal agency that oversees the and this is when we've had these incidents let's ask what we've seen over the past three or four or five years or there's always this discussion about it but it's basically\nI mean they have to meet the in the rules but as far as how far can you stretch it what can you do what kids should do there really aren't\nA there is no federal agency that oversees\nYou know there's got to be a real difficult story to cover because you've got four young sisters their husbands and they you know that I was celebrating the birthday they did the right thing they went to the winery wanted to go uh to Cooperstown they hired driver so that they didn't have to be on the roads are it it's got to be a shock to the people have done area\nIt is completely and you're absolutely right they did they thought they were doing everything they were supposed to do um designated driver\nIt's it's it is shocking for these folks here and I as I mentioned that everybody in the small community probably knew somebody who just lost their lives minutes on a Saturday afternoon you know and once again we'll have these questions about depending on what you what do\nYou know was it something with a vehicle while we talk again about whether they should be regulations for these or some kind of restrictions on what you can and cannot do by the way this was not a new vehicle this was a two thousand one Ford Excursion wow that it had been extended wow\nOkay ABC News senior transportation correspondent David curly even covering that horrific limo acts and thanks a lot David\nThere were one of the ants says you just can't wrap your head around it of course not ...\nWe're glad you're spending your evening with our ... morning show for a brand new my mom and my career in the morning tomorrow from six to seven wor\nEight flags you're spending your evening with our ... morning show catch just for a brand new one burning and Michael ... in the morning tomorrow from six to fend on seven then a couple of you or\nA very good Monday morning show\nAnd I are wrapping up here mark Simone does on debt coming up after the news at ten o'clock with his special guests ally and I'll you know why don't you throw\nPlant I Do I Do my idol tonight my limited Lionel him in a hobby farms seeing the same kind of energy\nA ... a harvest last thing when you talk to him I don't know I feel I feel tired like there's so much energy voted when he speaks\nTotally totally and he's so much energy on stage to uh he when he was an hairspray\nWe were just talking to ... who's played towards some trilogy begins performances tomorrow night at the Helen haste theatre on Broadway\nAnd I was telling Joe during the break here when when Harvey show he keeps in attendance chart backstage because Harvey's from the old school where you do a performance is a week\nAnd you do not miss you don't call in sick you don't say you gotta take your cat to the vet you don't say I'm not feeling too well the job on Broadway is to give a hundred percent eight performances ...\nTold me a lot to expect from somebody these days that that's what police show come on eight days a week a performance is warming says okay Arun if you're in a show with Harvey he keeps the attendance truck back there in a few minutes he puts an a a big red a next year name for apps and\nWe've heard that millennials might not have the same work and I mean I don't know if it's true or not but it said if it's true in the office had millennials might be a little I think he is the bad happening in Broadway as well with that generation of abs\nEarly this is why Harvey keeps the attendance record because he saw it happening some of the kids when he was in hairspray they just don't have that same\nKind of work ethic and it does really bother veterans the older guard people like Harvey a diner rig in fact when she was in my fair lady she was upset that kids would call in and just not come to the performs as these old actors feel that it is\n... ... you're so lucky to have a job in the theater the competition is so intense that I was going to break into it that you\nDamn well better show up for that job and the audience is there to see the show at its absolute best because they've paid two three four hundred dollars and the show was at its best when everyone who was cast in it originally shows up for work not the under studies\nBut that cast that the director hand picked to make that show worth two hundred three hundred dollars\nRight like when I paid two hundred dollars to go see Ben Platt [laughter] and they were having had anyone right now and I felt terrible 'cause my daughter hate her own money to go see the show from her you know gift money and we get their\n... bomber oh she was devastated and to tell you the truth the guy did a good job but it wasn't the same no it wasn't the same you know you we were going to see him\nYeah you don't have a friend um he's a was a Broadway dancer years ago he's long retired now but he was in the original company of West Side Story\nOf great Broadway musical directed in court and when I Know Michael ... thanks directing choreographed by Jerome Robbins there was a revival a few years ago west side story and all the kids were they were missing performances they were calling in sick\nSo I called my friend I said would you ever have called in sick to the original west that's where he said are you kidding me\nIf your legs were run over by a bus you would have crawled into that theater and perform or Jerome Robbins would have fired you on the spot for not coming up that's the kind of ethics absolutely so a very quickly here before we wrap it up by you heard about this artwork that self destruct\nIn either this is Brian yeah All

everybody at the gallery including I Would imagine the person who just make one point for a million dollars for it\nYeah well obviously they would have gone to the bank ski too but he he doesn't want

[noise]\nThis is a really wanting to today's Len Burman and Michael read all in the morning get them live tomorrow from six built it on seven ten W all our\nNew York's most of these talks they rated number one seven ten W O R voice of New York and\nDone well Mel urgently\nLet me give me an example of this man Samantha Seventy four years old he was born\nIn Hungary is a religious man he was born at the time when most of the religious people there were being rounded up and massacred well he made it out as a baby he was born in Nineteen forty two in the midst of World War two and he made it to this country with his parents as a miracle he's on the way to the concentration camps to\nBe killed like many many many many many of the religious people from hungry\nBut he made it out alive as a two year old baby three year old baby and he made it here\nAnd he came this week I saw him with a there must have been a dozen of his of his family members are all older to him and his stories like this she's married he has nine children he has diabetes and he was getting a scan\nFor abdominal pain there was never pancreas cancer and he went to one of the super super big hospitals with those abdominal pain and there's a weakness is lost weight it went from a hundred and Seventy eight pounds to a hundred and fifty pounds\nWho's seen by one of those super duper doctors are one of the super super most famous hospitals has abdominal pain is part appetite and it's been going on for months he never smoked\nHe has some shortness of breath on exertion he wakes up twice in Nineteen year and they had a CAT scan that that big place it showed a four and a half centimeter mass the pancreas and multiple things in the liver and his children and I think we're trying to be nice to him and said oh\nThere are only says in fact the report showed that ... cancer and well\nI examined him to his brother had lung cancers father had prostate cancer says plenty of cancer of the family I examined him get a market deformity is back what you know whatever it showed him but he had a mass in the back side right below the scalp you on the right side\nHis abdomen examined you could feel that Massey had some ethics gastric fullness and tenderness otherwise ... exam was negative so at\nThe end of the exam I was talking to him I said\nThat's the what I suggest I said this well this was about two o'clock this afternoon this week and I said why don't we see them get a PET scan and a biopsy would get everything done we can get everything down to two hours and they said well he's scheduled to XYZ hospital and the most super duper\nFamous hospitals for an ... could be in the morning they're still going to date him\nAnd take him into the ... sweet and then they're going to stick a scope down his\nThroat into this stop making with an ultrasound down and try to do a biopsy at the pancreas and then he probably stay a day or two of the hospital and\nThe family said well what do I think and they said well number one they've been working on your dad for a couple of months now and nothing's been done just a CAT scan which we could have done that ten minutes number one number to buy up so you don't have to put someone to sleep and do a big procedure maybe it's good\nFor the hospital to put someone to sleep and go to the ... Swedish probably as five or ten thousand dollars and then he has to wake up from the anesthesia\nStays a couple of places in the hospital whereas with us we can get a PET scan now\nI arranged it we've got a PET scan immediately a PET scan is the most sophisticated testing\nFor had the legs can look at where the cancers the body and to make a range for a biopsy a little needle to go into the liver mass and if you put the little needle in the liver mass you know number one what kind of cancer it is and the her to you know the stage ... cancer spread to the liver fair but concerns assessed what we put a needle in that mass in the\nLiver than you know not only what kind of cancer it is but also the stage stage for cancer and then two hours we could do more for your dad than two months that that other super duper place and probably for one tenth of the price and without the anesthesia without the hospitals die without taking office\nClosed ... we'll to the ... sweet and this is\nHow we do things here in radio surgery New York they tried to clean the air get things done to minimize the cars to minimize the inconvenience to minimize the anesthesia and cutting and bleeding in the hospital stay\nAnd that's indeed what happened to this man it was interesting not only did he agreed to have the pet scan and the needle biopsy immediately that afternoon but then his wife said\nMy doctor wanted me to do an ultrasound can you Dr Lederman can you do an ultrasound of my liberal while my husband's going to end the pet scans and I called up in that range that too and that never would have happened these things were going on in their health care and their life for two months elsewhere one of the super duper big hospitals they couldn't get a range here in two hours the wife got her test\nArrange which was normal by the way the man got his test arranged the pet scan another biopsy and we found the cancer we found where it was exactly in the pancreas and then the liver and little lymph nodes all been two hours and what a difference it makes where you go to get your care so some people\nSay I like to see a thousand doctors walking around in the lobby well if you like to go to see a thousand doctors walking around the lobby and us starch cold and the stethoscope around their neck you can go some place else because those doctors most likely or not\nThere for you if you want to come to a place that say boutique cancer treatment center at the heart of New York city like for this gentleman two\nHours he got his scan he got his biopsy we know this stage we know what he has we know where he has it whereas the other place was just a month of confusion and here we talked about all the treatment options\nFor pancreas cancer and yes we do treat cancer and the pancreas with high success rate with approximately Ninety percent success right where we attack the cancer and furthermore we're able to treat cancer to deliver elsewhere with pinpoint precision that's why we brought stereo tactic body radio surgery to America when every highest\nMind Nora and Libya my chore it's bleeding it's painful their discomfort so it's a big mess on the lake it'd be a it's a squeamish cancer and she has other medical condition she has diabetes and well\nShe saw gone to college just got a call just wanted to do radical surgery on her what should be removing the lay be a part of the tissues\nOf the job the tail you that's a Kevin seeing what that's like it is it the forming operation and she refused that and she refused chemo she came here for a fresh second opinion and we talked about all the options that I talk\nTo people about all the options unfortunate where she went elsewhere they talk to her only about surgery and only about chemo and she wants father treatment why should tell you one more thing she came to me last year and we treated her last year for this fall where cancer should a short course of treatment\nAnd she has cancer free she came to me this week or a physical exam is intact PET scan is intact normal there's no evidence of cancer future only with our focus to treatment here at Thirteen eighty four Broadway Broadway and thirtieth street in New York City and is now doing very well\nWhat about the sixty five year old woman she is saying go and she came with her sister and she has a history of breast cancer she was treated about three years ago she had a ... right breast cancer and she had lumpectomy only and I can tell you that lumpectomy only is not\nAdequate treatment for breast cancer I spoke to her and I spoke to her sister and they said their doctor did not recommend any other treatment after lumpectomy well back to me is which is just removing the lump\nOf cancer by surgery is not adequate therapy\nAnd sure enough her cancer came rip roaring back\nJust found the have cancer now or the left\nBrass which was the opposite breast that was up for centimeter about a\nTwo inch cancer and the opposite\nBreast and then ... showing a mess right breast which was written abreast of the biopsy their show cancer as well that was the ... they found a mass at our chest now she's relating all this information to me she didn't come with any of the documents and then we called him and God that documents in fact she had a biopsy the chest to and that showed up\nDifferent cancer which they didn't even tell her about called ... which is a cancer of the climate ... so she comes out with three separate cancers cancer in the right breast where she never got adequate therapy a cancer the opposite breast with a large cancer\nAnd then this ... three separate answers she came for treatment\nShe's a retired art teacher and we went through all the documents explained what she had and explain to all the choices that all the choices that are available to her whether she wants to save the brass to not save the breast or have surgery whatever this is what we do every day and I can tell you that for so many women\nMany women prefer to come here\nTo thirty for Broadway because Ninety percent of women we treated for breast cancer keep their brass at the big hospitals where I came here in New York Ninety seven percent women were losing their brass at the big hospitals the women weren't different the only difference was the mentality of the doctor or the desire of the doctor to explain\nAll the options innovative treatment we try to provide the best possible care for each woman and most commonly that would mean taking care of the woman's desires and I personally believe that saving the brass treated their breast cancer while not to form in the body is a great option but not everyone chooses that\nWe listen to each patient each patient as the president of the United states of his or her body each patient gets to decide what each patient as entitled to hear about all the options whether it's surgery chemo radiation no treatment whatever each patient's titled and we see so often\nThe surgeon so I talk about surgery that came up guys talk openly about chemo and what's the patience to do house a patient able to get all the information\nWill probably the best ways to make an appointment cause it to one two choices to one to two four six forty two thirty seven and make an appointment to one to two four six forty two thirty seven make an appointment\nThe easy way to remember that is two and two choices to and to means New York city Manhattan and choices means most likely you have choices so call us at the two and two choices you want a book with\nDVD have separate booklets about brain cancers body cancers prostate cancers other little booklet about why get a second opinion so You're welcome to do that just give us a call at two\nOne two choices and we do take most insurance is Medicare Medicaid if you wish to make an appointment for the book a DVD there's no charge will take your address your name address\nZIP Code and send out a package to make an appointment you can call the same number we accept\nMost insurance is Medicare Medicaid wants to get man it was Seventy four years old he came with his wife and his nurse she has high blood pressure prostate in terrible\nPain as a matter of steady cancer was diagnosed two years ago yeah the cancer in his liver it was a paddle side of the cancer he went to one of the biggest hospitals in a neighboring state at a biopsy it standard radiation yet standard chemotherapy at cancer growing in the ... he's\nTried chemotherapy didn't work you try to immunotherapy doesn't work that cancer is getting bigger and bigger bigger added escape by giving them narcotics he's now on three very powerful different kinds of narcotics but the pain is\nTerrible it's unrelenting antique came here and we talked about all the options I examined the huge mass on his back side of the shoulder blade it just eating through the bones he was set up the other hospital to rehab I imagine they see as\nIntractable pain is cancers growing and they said for rehabilitation no\nThey should have something to the doctor Lederman treatise cancer to get his cancer under control first how can you go through rehabilitation when you have a cancer growing causing unrelenting pain in your shoulder eating through your bone on narcotics with all the side effects\nOf narcotics just doesn't to me makes sense maybe it's great for the hospital that owns the rehab center so they get lots of income ... what about the man's cancer what about this pain and just giving them more and more narcotics is not\nA good answer were able to attack the cancer non invasive leave with pinpoint invisible beams non invasive beams called radio surgery a few treatments each human is very intense and very precise were able to hit the cancer and that's the work that we do here at radio surgery in New York\nSo treatment strategies different if he came to me a month ago or six months ago I would've treated the cancer aggressively or at least offered to treat the cancer aggressively to try to get them out of suffering out of pain and tried to get that bone heal up make the cancer go away and get the bone healed up rather than leave him in pain for\nMonths and months they gave him more chemo didn't work they gave him more even know therapy doesn't work it doesn't work for most people costs a lot of money and everyone thinks it's sexy but it doesn't work for most people and then they put them in rehab for three weeks that\nDoesn't help him he was left with pain that cancer growing these worse off now and finally came just a few days ago to investigate treatment options why because is devoted nursing friend has been telling them for months\nTo come in to see Dr Lederman that his treatments is not going well and it's a badge occasional point for anyone if you know someone\nWho's got cancer their pain is getting worse and the cancers growing it's time to\nChange the treatment more and more treatment of the same just doesn't help it's just useless and for this man more and more chemo and more middle therapy is useless cancers growing narcotics really doesn't help the pain\nThat caused more symptoms and caused the hazy and fuzzy and not think well so we're a lot of side effects from all those are caught ... whereas we were able to map out his treatment and commence treatment immediately so as we can relieve the pain and suffering or breast cancer and that's the work that we do here at radio surging in New York\nHad Thirteen for Broadway where we see patients with new and recurrent cancer\nWhat about uh Seventy six year old woman she's got three children she has a history of ovarian cancer in the past year COPD should a smoker and last year she had small cell lung cancer she had a biopsy they biopsy to her lungs\nAnd collapsed their luck well that happens says what happens\nWhen you have invasive things done two so she had a needle biopsy she had video surgery on her show she had me just ask the which is making the cut in the throne looking down the center of the chest and the showed small cell cancer met a static she was diagnosed when she started wheezing showed a cautious Charles surprised she went to the hospital\nAll those things were done to her and then she started chemo radiation standard chemo standard radiation and she went into heart failure shut a heart attack\nAnd then she had blood clots and for two\nOr three months it took her two or three months to CONMEBOL less from the side effects of the chemo the heart failure heart attack the clause and by then the cancer which is growing\nMore and more and she did not want to have more standard cable and sander\nRadiation she did not want that has caused so much complications here's in the hospital seven times for complications and then she decided to come here to thirty for Broadway and I saw her we talked about all the options she chose to non invasive pinpoint\nRadio surgery to treat her small so cancer ... belongs in the lungs and then the media style lymph nodes and we've treated her with just five treatments and she came this week I should tell you that we treated or last year she came this week for follow up\nAnd her ... she got a new PET scan and she's in remission when the chemo couldn't help or the center of radiation couldn't help her cause lots of side effects with us we were able to go five pinpoint treatments for cancer all non invasive with", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "city": "New York", "day": "09"}
