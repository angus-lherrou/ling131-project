W O are\nShe never had a mammogram can you imagine an all those people and her family had breast cancer and this woman who never ever ever had a mammogram while so finally she got this big lump and she gets her lump remove the cancer is already traveled to to lymph nodes\nAnd then she started to talk about other treatment and she investigates chemotherapy and she decides well with chemotherapy there's only three percent advantage people that get chemotherapy only three percent of them are better off than if they got no chemotherapy and she decides not to take chemotherapy but they didn't tell\nHer her surgeons that are came all doctors never told her about the most important treatment I remember the cancer started the inner part of the breast and already it's traveled to the armpit which means there's cancer cells all the way between the rest of the armpit\nOn treated almost for a year now and she comes to me to wonder what to do well I mean my gosh\nShe's setting up to stage three cancer and the breast\nLymph nodes she had that surgery almost a year ago and no additional therapy which means those cells are sitting there growing multiplying and remember cancer doesn't just sit there and it's not just sitting there like on a holiday no\nCancer cells have an idea they want to grow and grow and grow the ultimate goals obviously to kill the patient that want to grow and take over the body\nSo she's sitting there thinking that she may be smart not getting treatment but in fact\nShe's allowing the cancer to get a head start and she came to me for a second opinion almost a year after the diagnosis with no treatment and we got her stage up again and we got her a PET scan and luckily the spread of the cancer beyond the armpit that she's in dire need I Believe\nOf additional or what's called the ads event treatment that's the word meaning additional treatment after the lump of cancer is remote\nShe's not had adequate therapy and most likely the cancer a cover up right back and I showed her a patient picture that I saw and took earlier today exactly like the woman who had stage three breast cancer she had just a lump remote she never came\nFor additional therapy and now the cancers growing through the breast like hamburger\nEating through the skin of mass in the breast size of a fast surgery lumpectomy for most invasive cancers is not adequate therapy and that's the work we do every day to explain to her and you add to her husband and two others what the options are to try\nSurvive and be cured the goal of cancer treatment\nAnd how simple and how well at work and that they were recommending it to anybody they know\nAnd it was this the first time you saw people getting cancer treatment in your life you\nKnow I had a very dear friend that died of cancer and I usually go there is treatment and it was horrendous horrendous somewhere else\nSo you have other experiences before you came to her to do for Broadway\nYes yes and so um then my niece um unfortunately got breast cancer and um she was being treated what you'd call one of these super duper hospital and I'm was going in a different direction I said no no no you can't do that you have to go see a doctor we\nMust talk about her for a minute so good in the I Know who you are actually recognize your voice and your nieces are pretty young woman she's about fifty\nRight right right and they were going to remove her breasts road\nUm there were different options and that was one of the options\nYou live with that's what she told me they were going to remove her bra shows\nAnd I said oh God Forbid I said you know you got to the doctor away at them and even if it's just for a second opinion you have to go\nAnd um and so she did and and she's just you know thank me over and over and her husband he so precious he says you know I Can't thank you enough you know that you you were a forceful and\nThis is a woman who had breast cancer who was being recommended them chemotherapy animals stuck to me when she came to me she decided she'd want to know chemotherapy ... million only radio surgery right\nRight right and this has been about and\nI I like yes and I came up with a very good um you know I think sometimes people I I Know when I listen to your program I didn't get it all back than before I understood what I understood you know once once they came with my friend\nAnd I think a lot of people just don't get it they hear surgery surgery but they don't get the difference so I say it's tragic radical surgery\nAnd magic radio search\nFor the insurance songs I Know you've done a song before\nBecause of because of you and your girl before so I Know your voice\nI often say it's visible beams of radio surgery so people get the sense that it is invisible beams his way on the table and invisible beams attack the cancer without the calming or the bleeding or the chemo over the usual therapies\nWhy but I think the difference you know when you're saying surgery they go to the super duper hospitals are radical project surgery right\nWhere they run the brush to their armor the would go to the ... the proceeds to\nHorror stories horse or and you know what the wonderful part is the bench only if they will come due unfortunately they didn't come you'd start with but if they will come\n... even after all those things you'll have a wonderful track record of helping\nThem and doing very well and and okay\nSo I I call because I say people hear a doctor on the radio and it sounds too wonderful you know they think how could see it sounds too good\nAnd and a lot of people say it sounds too good you know there's something that she but this is not she this is wonderful wonderful nothing\nAnd and listen carefully all the time when Dr William and explains\nIs no cutting no meeting you don't have any hospital stay\nYou don't have any chemo you don't have all these things and and now the chance of infection and all the things you can get you know from surgery I unfortunately had to have um an appendectomy I'm back in April and I can't tell you all the problems that I had not hidden just off\nHaving surgery so you know if people will just come to you and here you know what you have to say and really pay attention when you are giving that data\nO on your ... in the Ninety her for nobody has that kind of data so I'm again I'm just saying that people don't go for a tragic\nSurgery go for magic radio surgery with just totally\nBy like your your word somebody you're from the prostate cancer is doing well yeah the ... years ago right this is what three or four years\nOh I think it's probably more like five or six\nAnd your nieces about two years so or two for two and their family road\nAbsolutely and and I can't say enough and and as you said I talked to the people that were in your office\nAnd you talk to everybody went up and down the everywhere I'm Talking about everybody everyone loves to talk to you and I do love to talk to them even more\nWe had a wonderful time and they sent us this ...
