documents to understand what you have to offer you all the proper\nTesting and all the options\nNot just selling what someone does but offering you all the options respecting you as a human being respecting it was a patient not pushing it like where you go with how to do something in your head the certain that comes in they have to cut up in your head well no that's one option\nYou can choose it if you want but you may want another option and unfortunately most commonly surgeons and the chemo guys are not\nTelling you all the options how do I know that well I see patients every day I Know what's going on\nAnd I want to talk to you about sixty two year old gentleman he's a gentleman who's single comes in with his brother and he has a mask on his face on his left face just to the side of his nose\nAnd it was by obscene to his base so cell cancer and the dermatologist sent the patient for Mose MOH asserted Moses like salami slice it whether they sliced sliced sliced sliced sliced and try to fill in the hall with a patch it often takes skin from another area and patch it in ... surgery and cutting and bleeding patching\nAnd then getting a second side and patch and then the first site and there's lots of people with skin cancer who just don't want to have cutting cutting cutting and salami slicing and patching and then have a big patch in the middle of their face like this man does not want a\nPatch of some other part of his body and the middle of his face where the skin is different colors different than nature's different kids want to have to go out and meet people with a patch in his face they can have a patch if you want you can go out of the most I Know the dermatologist loved to do surgery and Moses and salami and slicing and slicing and slicing\nBut lots of people want a different approach and what's the different approach well the different approaches noninvasive not mechanically removing part of your body and toss it into a bucket in the face of the pathology\nTo use invisible beams to treat the cancer make the cancer go away but keep your body where it is and that's right where I think one which is in your body and so he came to us with this mess on the left face and we treated him I saw him I offered them all the options and it was amazing I saw him every day every day I see\nPatients every day and just to see in just a few treatments that were very few treatments each treatment taken five seven minutes the cancer going away and he came for the last treatment yesterday and the cancer was go on this big mass\nIn his face was gone

doctors who went to one of the super pooper hospitals and they wanted to give ... only and the patient asked me to call the doctor and see why they're doing that\nAnd I spoke with a doctor and unfortunately the doctor did not know where the cancer originated\nEvery cancer and every location has a different nature in a different biology and this man had a cancer the sumo Rockville area and the doctor wanted to give ... came up with no focused radiation\nWhile the patient is smart the patient came here for fresh second opinion and the doctor was avoiding the most effective mode tower the for education treatment of a signal rectal cancer he was avoiding it to give us Kamal on maybe thought if he gives ... that it's good for him or good for somebody but\nIt's not the best treatment for the patient how do you know that well there's randomized studies to see what's the best chance to avoid recurrence of the cancer locally in the best chance of survival and the best chance for this man is to combine the two and I told him that I have no problem that Dr giving them came up it's not the best treatment by itself\nAnd the doctor got all bent out of shape and you didn't know where the cancer started in in\nA little bit not so good in front of the patient and the patient said look I've never gotten along with that doctors doctor was not nice with him\nAnd the patient asked for a
