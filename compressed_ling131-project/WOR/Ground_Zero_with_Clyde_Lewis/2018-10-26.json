that out you'll be disappointed\n[noise] this is a really wanting to today's Len Burman and Michael read all in the morning shift them live tomorrow from six built in on seven ten wor\n[noise] New York says do Fox they rated number one seven ten W O R voice of New York and high\nForty two degrees it too well the clock it morning I'm Steve ... says a reporter packages at Time Warner center earlier in the evening\nThat often there's the maximum treatment I've seen so commonly women have cancer of one breast they walk into a big hospital\nAnd asserted ends up moving both breasts\nThey removed the cancers breast and that healthy breasts and number one if that women have come to us we would never even talk about removing the healthy brass and I can tell you one more thing while the big hospitals were removing brass for treatment in Ninety seven percent of women [noise]\nHow our facility in my practice Ninety percent of the women keep their breast sort of lots of reasons why so many women come one is that we're open minded one is regarding principles to do what a woman wants\nBut first to inform the woman of all the options we talk about surgery and we talk about came only talk about hormones we talk about [noise]\nRadiation and radio surgery but it's up to each person the woman for example with breast cancer to decide does she want to have surgery or not the shoe want came or not to shoot what or months or not\nThe shoe want radiation or not we don't push people to do things against their wishes and that's most likely why she came here [noise]\nToast likely came here because she understands that we have a large experience of putting women with breast cancer for forty years or the thirty five years with radiation we see so many women with early breast cancer sometimes when we come to us with a little ... little ... like that of a pin breast cancer\nAnd sometimes women come to us with breast cancer that has traveled and sometimes women come to us with breast cancer like this woman with a mass of local cancer just being through the breast and later on today we're talking about other examples of women that I've treated like this\nWho is a breast is healed who's cancers gone away masses even up to ten centimeters loving centimeters who's mask goes away with treatment here at Thirteen eighty four Broadway\nAnd this is the work we do this woman sixty five years old with this huge mass hole in the breast about voter is fun getting bleeding losing massive cancer\nHas had no tests when she walked into my office yesterday it was the first day she had seen a physician about her cancer\nAnd we offered to stage are up and get a biopsy a biopsy can be easily done with a tiny little needle into this mess it's painless and easy [noise] we do blood tests including cancer markers markers for breast cancer\nSo she can evaluate how she is doing she can evaluate our physicians are doing\nAnd she we've asked to get a pet CAT scan to stage up her whole body to see if this cancers traveled because when cancers grow to such a large proportion they have time to\nLeave their primaries site like in this case to leave the breast and travel elsewhere whether that might have been to the lymph nodes lungs or liver elsewhere\nSo she should know that and it allows for better treatment decisions for her\nAnd her physicians to help guide her I always believe that the physician doesn't decide anything the physician makes recommendations to the patient\nAnd the family and then the patient mainly the patient the patient is the president of United States of his or her body\nThen decides it should not be the physician deciding it should be the patient who is informed and so she's decided to go ahead with a little biopsy she's decided to go with a PET scan and we did the blood test already\nAnd then she'll come back the next few days and have an answer and that's the work that we do it'll keep you informed about what happens is woman with this huge fun getting bleeding mail order as\nRight breast cancer that has never been evaluated until she walked into our doors at Thirteen eighty four Broadway\nAnd speaking about women with cancer I Want to talk about a woman who has had a long journey\nComing not only from Canada where she resides but then to Mexico and Austria and Europe and now here to third today for Broadway what drives or what motivates or were let me tell you about this woman [noise]\nShe's sixty years old she's married with kids she comes with her husband from Ontario says about an hour and a half west of Toronto\nAnd there's many many hospitals in Canada and Canada's homo nationalized healthcare so you'd think that everything would be so fantastic there [noise]\nBut she found a lump in the breast and chest pain and well she went to the hospital with his chest pain in her doctors do an\nX ray and they said it was a normal ex rather center at home and they told her to come back in a year in the air and she came back in the year and she said everything is worse\nAnd everything was worse much worse and she had more and more pain and suffering and what do they do another chest X rays chest X ray is the most I Would say it's one of the most antiquated past it's been around for decades and decades there's much more\nSophisticated test to evaluate a person with\nChest pain if you're going to take them seriously and that's what we do here at thirty for Broadway [laughter]\nThe cancer was eventually diagnosed when she had a CAT scan it took a almost a year and a quarter to get a CAT scan in that country and Canada [noise]\nTwelve people say oh well nationalized medicine so fantastic here's an example where she can get a test she couldn't get a test she eventually took them more than a year to get a CAT scan\nAnd when she had a CAT scan showing what was felt to be a lung cancer [noise] it took six months for her to see a doctor a cancer doctor in Canada to see a specialist treating lung cancer\nAnd so what did she do she went to Mexico Tijuana where she paid tens of thousands of dollars\nTo get concoction ...\nHate therapy some chemotherapy\nAnd some very low dose of radiation to the spine then she came back to Canada and by then that delay period had lapsed her doctors saw her\nGave her some more chemotherapy by then it seemed like the chemo wasn't working very well the cancer was widespread and then she traveled to Austria where she spent tens of thousands more tens of thousands of dollars far from home\nShe got hypothermia immunotherapy chemotherapy\n[laughter] then returned home and for the last five months has been receiving vitamin drips and add them as an ozone layer trail\nNone of which has worked her last skin in Canada was three months ago her last PET scan while she only had one PET scan\nAnd comes to us that was terrible pain and our sacred honor pelvis or tell bone she's losing a tremendous amount of weight to the last six months she's lost fifty pounds she's gone from two hundred and four pounds down [noise]\nTwo hundred and fifty two pounds just terrible pain she's suffering terribly her cancer markers cancer markers or markers we talk about them ... doctors in Canada to the markers and what did they find well her cancer marker\nSix months ago was two thousand normal cancer markers three three point zero\nHer cancer mark was twenty three hundred a month and a half ago\nBut the main thing is it doesn't cure anybody with prostate cancer doesn't cure by itself [noise]\nAnd so eventually he saw your oh just urologist who knows me into the ... the second biopsy and the second by up to this is a decade later showed five areas of aggressive cancer\nHis PSA still elevated the scans show no spread of the cancer and so this is a kind of patient that we could offer a second treatment this first treatment was not adequate we could offer a second treatment and attempt to hear him\nI'm like the first treatment which did not hear him unlike the hormonal therapy which we know doesn't cure men with prostate cancer by itself\nWe have a chance to try to cure this man this is why this urologist you're all just as a\nSurgeon who specializes in the urinary system send them to me because he knew of innovative treatment or pinpoint treatment or radio surgery experience this is the work we do having treated thousands of men the
