W ... [noise]\n\nWhere you are or were you ... ... New York\nNew York and this is talk station you'll see rated number one seven ten W O R voice of New York and\nWith breast cancer come here for a treatment for a second opinions because they know they're not going to lose their breast here most probably they're going to get a fair chance or in the here with all the options are and then they\nCan decide you can decide your friends could decide your neighbors can decide and by the way so many listeners save lives by giving this information coming every day on the radio is like\nGoing to medical school and there's lots of things to learn and you can learn so much and I have so many people come and tell me Dr Lederman I listen to you every day on the radio and I said and to lead to you well\nWhy'd you said that he will most likely to get a fresh second opinion with a surgeon told her she had to have removed for the longer the breast of the kidney or the armor the like of course the chemo doctors said just because they have to have\nChemo for the rest of her life people come here for a fresh second opinion this is the work that we do\nEvery day Monday through friday all week every day here at thirty days before Broadway sort of jump in\nSeeing patients so weak and I take notes that I come here and I want to talk about a man whose Seventy years old he is a ... a church man he had tumor and the left's long and this is the man he was walking down the sidewalk\nIt's incredible story really was walking down the sidewalk he fell down the sidewalk just ended and broke off and he hit\nIs ribs on the ground and he went to the emergency room they found one centimeter mess in the long and they had a CAT scan showed at one point to southern made a mess and they had a PET scan that was positive he's an ex smoker\nAnd because he fell on the sidewalk there was a broken broken sidewalk the sidewalk and that he fell down hurt his body got an X. ray tolerable lung bass and well at that hospital they walk down the cut off his lawn while he didn't want to have his lung cut out\nThat he heard about our work you heard about an hour non invasive work for lung cancers and there's about a quarter million Americans with lung cancers every year when he gets surgery because many end up going to the emergency room or go to the doctor and all of a sudden the lung doctor comes I said well you have to remove your long or part of your along this fan\nHe knew he was prepared like you you're prepared because you listen to the show and he said OK and he brought all those documents and they brought all those documents to me and I saw him and he had this mass into law on\nAnd it was one point two centimeters at a PET scan those positive\nIt picked up radioactive sugar and legs salmon him and I listen to his lungs I could tell you that he had a normal lung exam so tells you something that\nYou cover Dr listen to your lungs but that doesn't mean there's no lung cancer there so it's another teaching point not teaching point number one is you don't have to have long surgery Deb treatment and number two just because you listen to the lungs doesn't mean there's other lung cancer there and number three he chose our treatment\nAnd by the way he chose our treatment last year and why am I talking about him today we're talking about him today because he came for follow up this week and I saw him yesterday and he has a new skin and the cancers gone\nJust gone with in\nThe years the cancers gone he had five treatments ten minute treatments she lays down at a table saw opened there's nothing claustrophobic does know cutting and there's no bleeding though so I missed the show\nHe lays on the table we find the cancer we send in thousands of beams to attack the cancer from thousands of angles just to attack that tumor it's about a half an inch so small and we should that cancer\nAnd now it comes back in the fall up scans show the mass is gone\nSkins distorted ... got a massive their armpit that's three centimeters and finally she decided to come here for treatment I staged or a Bush said she's lost control of her story we got a PET scan we staged her up and\nLuckily she is finally decided to have\nReal treatment that most likely it's going to make this cancer go\nAway disappear or go and we're mission and this is the work we do we see plenty of people with cancer she plenty of women with early breast cancer where you can't even feel it or see the breast cancer and then there's other breast cancers that have been ignored or concocted\nHad cancer just keeps on growing and spreading\nAnd for this one fine\nDay after five years has come here for treatment and most\nProbably will be able to shrink this cancer and get the cancer under control finally after five years this is the work that we do every day here at Thirteen Eddie for Broadway Broadway at thirtieth street talking about other man I saw ... years ago he came in the past\nTwo sixty two years old he's single without children came with his friends and his\nPSA had gone from one point four to two point six and he was seen by euro adjust and he had a biopsy in the past ... negative but then the PSA suddenly jumped to five point nine member went from one point four to two point six now five point\nNine and it's a Gleason seven cancer so you can't be seen by doctors at one of the again one of the big super duper hospitals so they wanted to do surgery on him\nWell he understood that was surgery for a Gleason seven cancer that their success rate is sixty percent our success rates Ninety percent so number one is a fifty percent better\nChance with us for prostate cancer police and stuff and then at that big super poop replace\nHim or one number two if he has surgery\nNinety seven percent chance to sex life will be deep six eighty percent chance she'll be paying in his pants if he has surgery\nHe doesn't want to have surgery they were pushing them for surgery and the surgeons can push all they want but when the patient is formed it's a lot harder to bamboozled the patient so why are we on the radio so you don't get bamboozled and your friends don't get bamboozled and your neighbors don't get\nBamboozled leaving that person down the street with your help won't get bamboozled either so for this man is that a rising PSA from one to two\nTo six so went up actually by six fold within a short period of time as the Gleason seven cancer Gleason is how the cancer look so it's a more aggressive cancer because of a PSA velocity how fast the ... going up\nAnd the ... and he's chosen our treatment and most likely he will be cancer\nFree Ninety percent he'll be cancer free and avoid radical surgery and avoid surgery and removal and hospitals all with our out patient therapy this is the work we do every day here\nAt Thirteen eighty four Broadway and speaking about prostate cancer what talk about a man who from Barbados sixty one years old when I turn it in ten years ago ten years ago he came to me we saw him we talked about all the options ten years ago and\nSince that time his PSA has gone down to\nZero is in remission\nDoing well ten years after our treatment so happy anniversary and ... anniversary his cancer free doing well and he came in and we just got testing on him we check them out\nThere is no cancers PSA is low Ciro point zero and he is doing very well that went to one another man who came in he is from New York City with a Gleason seven says as a third Gleason seven in a row is fifty seven years old he's divorced three children has high blood pressure back disease\nHad back surgery came to me in a wheelchair with prostate cancer his\nAppearance of the cancer simply ... of the microscope the blood test was five point\nTo pay was scheduled for surgery at one of the biggest hospitals New York city even though he had back disease and back surgery and back\nProblems it was in a wheelchair there were still gonna cut out of his prostate\nAnd we know that for Gleason seven cancer their success rate is sixty present our successor it's Ninety percent this man has knocked tore wakes up twice tonight to year and late he stopped always medicines I examined him his prostate was in large he came to us because our success rates ... percent\nTheir success rate with radical robotic surgery is sixty percent and with us most likely he'll keep his sex life for the journey of your life with radical surgery robotic surgery most likely he'll loses sex life ... life and by the way we have a new prostate two part DVD which were happy to give to you or sent to you\nYou can cause just car office day or night to get\nThat at two one two choices\nTo into two four six forty two thirty seven this is a man who was scheduled for surgery at one of the big hospitals and he's smart he wasn't ashamed to cancel his surgery when he heard the success rate was fifty percent\nBetter here with Dr Lederman at thirty eighty four Broadway and they didn't have to have that radical robotic surgery didn't have to have his prostate removed he didn't have to be in the hospital enough to have the anesthesia or the\n... or the leakage of urine or impotence or and confidence or no and that's why he chose our treatment here at their activity for Broadway Broadway on thirtieth street in the heart of New York city where we treat so many men\nAnd women with cancer or a dedicated independent cancer treatment center we don't have to support to the drug companies you don't get kickbacks from the pharmaceutical companies who don't have to report to the head of the hospital how many surgeries are doing or the how many surgeons for\nSupporting no because we have\nOnly one boss in our boss is you you're the boss searching for Broadway Broadway

take a short break my name's Tucker Lederman\nBe afraid to leave your cancer treatment when it's not working don't be afraid to leave your cancer treatment when it's not tolerated some people are afraid to leave the big boys even when they're cancer grows no reason to be afraid\nPlenty of people with cancer are pleasantly surprised to learn about all the cancer options with Dr Lederman we're not afraid to discuss all cancer treatment options unlike so many others\nLeaving failed cancer treatment is a wise decision\nThat they're Lederman first in America with body radio surgery when all the hospitals and doctors thought standard treatment was okay non invasive out patient invisible beams to hit your cancer in minutes for new or a current cancers most anywhere in the body to learn more called two one two choices two one two choices\nDr Lederman thirty days before Broadway at thirty eight we accept most insurance is\nMedicare Medicaid called Dr Lederman two and two choices two
