with you as always my great friends to restructure the structure down the street is everyone\nWants to be like and that is because he is the brains of the operation out here that's for sure\nBut I got Larry out here and Larry first question for you is how that you're doing doing great Ryan how're you doing I'm doing wonderful excited to be out here with you all doing the show this week we have a lot of fun are doing this show and talking to you our financial family out there across the airwaves and one of the things we always focus\nThe vast majority of our time on I Would say every time we can get on the air and every time we can get you know in front of a group of people is really talking about income and talking about how to how to generate more income inside of the financial markets and one of the things we always stress and I and I know we'll spend a lot of time on it here today is how to really get that consistent growth that consistent income in the markets\nWhether the markets are going up and whether the market's going down whether the market's going sideways and and that's really the the key is because there's three directions and and as individuals were very comfortable with the buying hold\nKinda bullish mentality of you know we we invest into this we invest into that and we hold it for a long time and and hopefully when we hit retirement it's just worth uh it's just worth a heck of a whole lot more\nNow what are the things I Want to get some of your feedback on it's always a fun show starter is really the consistency side of things because really if we're going to have consistent growth in the market we can't be direction to lead dependent than what I mean by that is we can't\nOnly profit if the market goes in one direction I don't I don't know about you but one of my favorite things\nWhen I teach a half day classier it on a treaty academy one of my favorite things it's really work with the class and get them to viewed down markets as opportunities not just bad things you know so many times the down markets are viewed as well that's so bad 'cause people are losing money and well that is true if we're just in that bullish biased as markets are going down\nWith the right knowledge and what the right skills those can be viewed as as great opportunities to make money I mean if you go back through some of the major crashes that we've experienced and you can you can find the ... of the world the pulses of the world and you can find the the word billionaire next to their name\nThe end of a lot of these crashes and so it's always interesting how how how maybe millions are made on the way up the billions are made on the way down\nAnd it really just boils back to consistency we want to make money we want to make money on the way up and we want to make money on the way down but what are some of the things you guys are working on what the students right now or some of the some of the new tools you and your instructor team are are are laying out there right now or to help people become more consistent than less directional independent instead of the markets\nWell this last week it's been beautiful I mean everything we've been talking about on the show together I'm Talking about this for weeks now waiting for the opportunity to see the markets correct and come back down and as a result what happens starting off at the end of last week into this week as we got everybody's wish that\nThe market started coming down it comes down three times faster than it goes up and a lot of our students were taught that once that market goes down you could actually\nMake money shorting the market it's called shorting where you're actually selling in the market\nAs opposed to most who by the markets so a lot of our students shift from that fear of oh my God the market's going down I don't know what to do I'm gonna lose money to well I can actually learn how to make money if the markets go down it's simply doing what the banks do\nBig banks are always out there to make money with the markets go up down sideways and what a lot of our students seeing we tell them is do you see how this would benefit you by learning how to trade in more than just one direction\nAnd when you look at even the difference between let's even just a a mutual fund versus a hedge fund and the mutual fund is generally just investing into a long position and they called a mutual fund 'cause it's this joint effort between us and the financial institution but it only makes money as the markets are going up but it doesn't mean that strategy is never useful and that that product has never useful that's not what I'm trying to get out here\nBut as it's going down those phones are generally losing money and we're paying fees to be involved or to be invested into that fund you look at the hedge funds type strategy and and that word hedge is pretty critical because\nHedge is meaning that there is a position that propped on the way up and there's also protection or even a position to make a profit on the way down and so when you start looking at things as far as the market's going there's multiple directions in the market the up down into sideways\nIt's critical to make sure that we have strategies kind of like that hedged mentality that can make money if the markets are going up down or sideways and you're one of the things they talked about in one of my classes a long time ago was or wasn't managing if you went to work then they said hey you know what\nWe really like you you're a great candidate we think you'd be a great fit for the company\nBut you can expect to be laid off one third of the time one third of the time we're not going to pay a\nYou know and that's really what happens if we're only trading any bullish direction anytime the markets are going sideways our retirement account or income account is laid off\nAnytime the market's going down a retirement account or income account is is laid off not to not to even bring up the fact that maybe it's it's deteriorating a little bit especially as the markets are going down\nBut what are the things that we can do is always okay with you Larry when things that we can do is we have a big stack of tickets right here we're just kicking the show off we've got a bunch of tickets we can give away and we can help a few people out there get started becoming more consistent in the market by by doing a quick little give away for these passes that our to our ... classes what do you say let's do it\nAll right well right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area\nThat have their classes while you'll see exactly what it takes to be more consistent in the market making money generate more income as the market's going up down or sideways now they have to classes about three hours long and if you would have set up passes to these half day classes\nThat is going to be your investment just a little bit of time spent three hours of your time any financial education scenario rather than maybe on social media or watching TV sounds like a good investment\nTo me one just a second you can have a chance to win a set of these passes or one of the happy classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a good time to pull over\nIncluded with your passes it's going to be a professional insiders kid now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhanced in your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital

is eight eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nThere is we stay on kind of this consistency track because of this this consistency conversation I should say\nYou know you talked a little bit of a a little bit about shorting and that is a great opportunity to make to make money as the markets are going down what are some of the other ways that people can diverse into different directions you know we hear diversification as far as I Do have a little commodities have little stocks have little bones but how 'bout diversification as far as different directional vehicles go well you can\nAlways sit here and say we know that when the markets go down there's usually people pulling out of the markets Marty money's going somewhere either could go into gold\nIt can go into bonds the cool thing that our students learn here as it doesn't matter your background your age what you've done before we teach them how to read a chart so it's a stock short bond chart gold shark they're able to start learning how to trade in the beauty of learning what shorting is\nIs that again a lot of people have been told their whole lives when the markets go down it's a bad thing will last February\nGoldman Sachs made two hundred million dollars in one day by simply shortening the market now that day imagined that we did a little piece of it I'm not going to be greedy you know but if you start to learn how to treat like the banks do then it's amazing\nThat all of a sudden you can start learning a skill that can make your money and not have to sit there and think about a second job or to get into a little bit later\nBut one of the ways I look at this and I get this analogy all the time when people are just simply trading one direction or they're waiting for the market to always go up it's like a car imagine that you were told you can get in a car tomorrow and you can drive somewhere but you can't put the car and reverse\nYou're going to go on a lot of circles eventually going to get there but you know it's a lot of time energy and money getting to the same place if you simply had all the tools to get you there faster so a lot of what I'm seeing our students learning the first time is it they're becoming\nDirection ally ... they don't care if it goes up down or sideways as long as the markets are moving they can learn how to make money and what a lot of them are seeing right now is they could create more freedom for themselves because they're able to make money no matter where the market\nTo go yeah absolutely and I love I Love the analogy of the car and there's so many so many other analogy that we could pull into this that in in I always say in real life you know outside of the are investing life in our normal everyday life we\nThere's no way we buy a car that didn't go in reverse right but so many times we find ourselves in investments that only have one direction or one avenue where they can profit\nYou know it's it's the same thing you go back to our you know go back to high school education and where was your stock picking class where it was how to balance a checkbook class right they'll check after I said I just dated myself victory over there but it is it is true though I mean we we really didn't have", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "city": "New York", "day": "14"}
