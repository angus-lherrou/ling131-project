to them all the time number one\nThey've realized in the twenty first century that they can take a laptop anywhere in this world right now it doesn't matter because as long as they have an Internet connection and their laptop\nThey can trade all over the world in fact we had a student named B or and he's in San Diego in a lot of times are students feel it's too hard they can't do it well not only has ... done this and has left his job which is exactly what everybody wants to do right we want to quit a job you don't love to do something we do love\nHe's become a excellent trader and he's also now started funding as whites real estate business\nSo the two of them are doing something together\nSpending more time together spending more time on vacations and family but the important thing here Ryan is it they're loving what they're doing and there's so many people out there and if you're one of those people hopefully you can see how you can benefit from just learning a skill that can give me the freedom that you desire\nYeah absolutely and it's it's kind of interesting as we're as we're sitting here talking about the lifestyle of a traitor I'd just literally received a text message from a dear friend of mine\nAnd it just popped up on my phone and he was actually somebody who got me started in trading he was one of the first people who said this is how you open an account these are the steps you go through it very very first conversation these just become a lifelong dear friend of mine and he's a huge ski bum he lives up in Salt lake he ... he travels around it as a great time\nHe just texted me with a picture of snow skis saying hey can you use these this season or should I take him to the ... because if I go to Salt Lake ... bum a pair of skis from him rather than a hall in mine around\nBut it it's just there's just so much freedom that can come with it and it and it really ends up just pulling down to a couple of basic steps a couple of basic as you were saying changes or actions that need to be taking because I think it's very critical it's very important it's it's very powerful once we do understand\nThat that the poor is just a state of mind right that passing over opportunities repeatedly and it's something that can be really easily changed just by stepping out of our comfort zone right just by stepping out of our comfort zone and doing something different we talk a lot about\nKind of cliche statements on the show here but it's because they're so true and there are so useful and it goes back to if we've always done if we always do what we've done will always get what we got and if we are completely satisfied with where we are then then great let's continue to do what made us so happy in the first place\nBut if we want a little bit more for trying to cook it created a little more income if we're trying to create a little more freedom if we have a specific goal\nThat we're trying to accomplish that we haven't been able to get to\nWe have to make the necessary changes and that's one of the life lessons that my grandfather shared with me my whole life growing up he would hold up his five fingers and I would have to name all of them the first one is no your business the second one is be converted\nAnd that converted one as a youngster I honestly didn't understand what it meant and as I got involved with trading and I really started to go kind of soul searching down is is this something that's gonna work for me am I going to be able to do this\nThat converted when I started to realize was make the necessary changes the necessary metamorphosis do what's necessary and and and in the beginning and that was the one I always kind of didn't put as much emphasis on when I was like ten eleven twelve even Eighteen Nineteen twenty you know but then as I really started into my my grown up years I started realizing\nHow be converted that pointer finger of the five to me became the most valuable because if we don't make the necessary changes\nNever going to accomplish that kind of outlier goal that were after that one\nOf the things we can do to help a few people get started with this is we still got a few tickets we can give away let's change some lives right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area\nThey have to cost ... ... exactly what it takes to really take control of the finances

we talk about all the options we don't hide options were not afraid of you go into surgery or chemo but\nMost people when they hear about the options would rather have a non invasive outpatient

killing ... for a free informative booklet and DVD paid doctor Lederman we're back\nWhere back and I want to tell you about Seventy one year old woman the woman who came in\nShe's Seventy one she has two children she worked in the real estate industry shut an abnormality and the lung over years shed ... until about five years ago than she was said by a pulmonary doctor and shut a new scan\nWhich showed a to point seven that's about a one inch to point seven centimeter mess in the right long should a PET scan that was positive ships or other abnormalities\nShe was offered to work up than well she saw the surgeon so the surgeons wanted to do biopsies they wanted to open up her lungs and take out that part of the long she went to a three ... surgeon he told her it's not a nine percent cancer [noise]\nAnd then ten days later she didn't hear from the doctors has your back to the primary doctor she's an ex smoker she quit smoking ten years ago and most likely it's a smoking causes cancer [noise] she's lost some weight to two years ago she was a hundred and twenty eight she's not a hundred and Twenty one pounds five feet\nShe had a CAT scan that showed COPD and emphysema bronchitis and corner artery disease probably all from smoking so it's a good reason to stop smoking [noise]\nShe had no prior treatment I examined her her lungs are clear it just shows you the limitations of listening to the lungs listening to lungs is not enough\nThere's that has to be better staging and for this woman she was here eager to be treated she already has emphysema which means your lungs are impaired or breathing is impaired just COPD\nShe wanted our treatment she came for our treatment and she was treated earlier this year and we treated her non invasive Lee with radio surgery she did not want someone opening up her chest\nShe did not want her chest open she didn't want her lung removed that want to be shorter breath for someone cutting out her long\nShe understood that she needs her long to breed and she's right and she already has damage to her lungs from COPD and emphysema so they cut out wherever long does it will be less lung to breed and she didn't want to be in the hospital and she didn't want her chest open up and chess tubes and visa visa\nShe wanted our treatment and she knows is actually a new study shown\nRecently discussed by Dr are real Lederman Shona Ninety percent success rate with radio surgery Seventy seven percent success rate with open surgery so why would anyone want open surgery with less success with more complications with cutting bleeding chest tubes pain\nIn the hospital whereas with us just a few treatments ten minutes each you walk in and make a mold around your body within computerized what's in your body we find the cancer and from thousands of angles we send invisible beams of radio surgery to attack the cancer and that's what this woman wanted that's what we did\nAnd then she came to this week I think I told her return it earlier in the year\nAnd now she is in complete remission there's no evidence of cancer she's happy we're happy no side effects this is the work we do this is why we brought stereo tactic body radio surgery to America\nSo that people would have options with all the hospitals and all the doctors and all the facilities sought standard treatment was okay one doctor stood up to all of them and of course it's not easy to set up to the surgeons who gets so angry 'cause we're taking away their case and the cable doctor so angry\nAnd other radiation doctors often were so angry\nWell that doesn't really matter because we're here for the patient we fight for the patient we offer treatment options for and to the patient\nThat's why I went to medical school to offer better treatment for my patients and you can come to if you want to come to search for Broadway whether you have a lump in the breast or\nDifficulty urinating or high PSA or cancer to getting chemo or surgery or radiation\nAnd it's not working or not tolerated or thought wanted\nJust give us a call to win two choices two and two choices You're welcome to do so anytime cause or whatever the man who came to me\nAnd he's from Jamaica which is a hotbed of cancer all of the Caribbean is a hotbed of cancer is fifty eight years old married with three kids and he had prostate cancer and well he had prostate cancer with a PSA of Seventy says the blood test [laughter] excuse me went to one of the ...\nIt caused bottles [noise] the biopsies and the surgeons wanted to do robotic surgery remember there's a little bit of conflict because\nIt's the surgeons who do biopsies to diagnose the cancer or the same ones who do the cutting so they they do the biopsy then they come back and say oh Mr acts you've got this cancer I think the best treatment is cutting robotic surgery ... radical surgery\nSo I don't say hey you got this cancer was Hugo speak to the doctor leader mounted can learn about all the options then come back here if you want they don't say that\nAnd most patients are never told all the options well this man was pretty smart and he knew that was surgery most likely is quality of life would be impaired to say the least\nAnd with this cancer he had a high chance of being cancer free get a Gleason six PSA seven with us Ninety five percent success rate and one more thing I should tell you\nHe came to me five years ago and he is in complete remission is PSA zero as sex life works is urinary life works is happy came here he's happy did not have\nRadical surgery and this is what we do every day every day this is what we do\nI Want to hear about a woman who sixty seven years old she had both breasts removed for cancer and we see so many women who get both breast removed\nMany women fall asleep believe that's the best possible treatment welts treatment for certain diseases but not for every disease and most women do not need both breast removed\nSo she had both breasts or moving the cancer came right back where the breast were and now she has met us out of the cancer and terrible involvement of the skin involvement of the skin over the area that breast on the right side the left side of the even behind the backside\nAnd she has pain and suffering and she's come here because of surgery doesn't help that came out to help and now she wants a better treatment this is what we do every day at their kitty for Broadway and there was a man from Philadelphia came sixty sixty six year old man he was murdered\nFive children it came with his wife and his daughter is from Philadelphia the he drove up from Philadelphia for treatment why well a year ago you had Rockville bleeding and yet colonoscopy the calling us could be showed the rectal cancer\nAnd the first thing that happened was that he had surgery but like so many hospitals around New York it took", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "city": "New York", "day": "29"}
