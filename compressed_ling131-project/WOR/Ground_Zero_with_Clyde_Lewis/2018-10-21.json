[noise]\nWelcome to the show if you're a first time listening or we are fleas very pleased to meet you my name is rank and joining me today I I always like I almost always say joining me as always but every now and then later he gets hold out each class somewhere and we have shown\nThat comes in with us but that is not today once again what are we back to back to back weeks where we've been able to have Larry Larry Larry in Studio on the radio with us I got Larry Jacobson here Larry how are you doing doing great Ryan how're you doing this way I'm doing awesome and for our listeners out there Larry is the top instructor it online trading academy and the director of instructor development\nSo it's easy to see why usually referred to him as the brains of the operation out here\nBut one of the things that I Love about the show Larry and I get really amped up for this we chat about it a lot will be getting ready for the show and\nThe show is a ton of fun to do and and how can it not be a ton of fun when we're just talking about ways where we can really generate more income inside of the financial markets and we usually start to show off very similar way it it's all about consistency cars at that point never changes right that point never changes all about consistent income it's not about\nMaking money once right it's about making money over a period of time and having that consistent stream of income that you can count on\nFriday you can count on not something that well hopefully this works out raise that that that step by step process that can generate more income in our lives whenever we're focusing on the consistency side of things\nWe also have to take into consideration well we weren't consistent income we need to have a consistent strategy the market goes up down in the market also could go sideways right an unchanged market lately we've been having a lot of that down market we've been having a lot of those\nFour hundred point downs on the on the U.S and people haven't or foreign point down on the Dow and even the other day you know what other foreign points back up and so it's almost like a a a a reminder of of springtime back in February we had the big drops in the big rallies were stuck in this area of volatility again is which is one of the things they call a traders market\nAnd it's a traders market because it kind of those by and hold situations can be a little bit painful and so having that consistent approach of being able to get in and get out as the market is kind of rocking back and forth\nIs something that can be very simple but also very lucrative and so what are some of the things you guys are doing right now Larry with your instructor team really help people kind of harnessed this volatility and generate that consistent income inside the market's great question right you know at first and foremost I just want to say it's so great\nTo have some people listening and a lotta times are students are constantly focused on how do they get their financial futures back we just mentioned you know you've had this volatility in the markets and most people who don't know what they're doing a freaking out right now because they see the market goes down then it goes back up it goes down and they're waiting for a sign\nWell the sign has been it's already passed because right now you have so many opportunities in the market to learn how to make trade to the markets go up and go down\nAnd most people have learned their whole lives only make money when the markets go up when it goes down it's a bad thing well we're here to tell you right now it's an excellent thing when the markets go down because markets have a tendency to fall three times faster than they go up\nAnd if you look at two thousand of the year two thousand and the wall street made the most money during this time and markets we're correcting than they were when the markets or even rallying and this is called shortening the market it's completely legal and a lot of people have come to the academy have\nRealized that if you want to know what it's like and you're wondering how to get your lead to a place where you can quit your job or spend more time with your family then you want to start learning how to trade that's really where it begins Ryan\nAbsolutely and what if somebody came to you a ... and they said hey you know what to over the last three months you've made this much money at work\nHow would you like to make that much money in one week right because that's really what's happened over the last little bit of the markets have gone down we have erased three months worth of growth in the markets in one week's time well imagine if you could get to the point where you looked at it down market like Larry was saying it as an opportunity to generate income\nLiterally taking that opportunity and being able to make money as the markets are going down now in one week ... the thing I Would like to point out to everybody is the difference between ten and twenty is the same whether you're counting up to twenty or whether you're counting down to ten\nRight if you're going twenty down to ten it's the same as ten up to twenty right so when you're making money on the way down that is one of the reason why we talk about how it's like getting a raise as the markets are going down as long as you understand how to generate that income and you have that skill to generate that income\nIt's like getting a raise in this case if you take that kind of apples to apples comparison it's like making as much in a week\nAs it was and making it in three months so imagine you're your employer coming to you and saying hey how would you like to make as much as you made in the last three months in one week\nWhat would your answer be you know I Would imagine that everybody's answer would be yes\nYou know and then it would be well what do I have to do to be able to generate that income well what do I have to do to be able to make as much money in a in a week as they did in the last three months we just need to have one more skill you just need to have the skill of being able to time a bearish market and it's just like timing abortion market it's just the other direction it's very simple\nProcess and it's something that like I say we're talking about earlier is can be very very very lucrative and a lot of times a week and come back on to this because we want to do a little a little give away to help people get started but a lot of people look at it as and there's more risk in the thing is is there's not more risk and in some cases there's actually less risk\nAnd embarrassed market than in a ... market but one of the things that we can do to help people get started Larry's we've got a big stack of tickets here for our show today we say we give away some passes to one of these have take classes definitely especially if there's somebody out there that now believes they hit a point in their lives when they realized they deserve more we gotta we gotta help I'm Ryan absolutely right now we've got to have to a class in your area\nThe happy classes where you'll see exactly what it takes to really generate that income whether the markets are going up down or whether the markets are going sideways and just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these half day classes so get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a good time to\nPull over included with your passes going to be our professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from

to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up\nBeing colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nBut Larry that's one of the things I think people kind of miss on in a down market as it is we think oh it must be more risky and in some cases it's actually you can prove it out to be far less risky in a down market with how margin in different things work but at the same time\nAnything that we don't understand we're usually afraid of it isn't it just mainly fear that holds people back from accomplishing their goals so absolutely you know and in fact\nI'll share a story last year with my students Jim the other day it was funny we were talking about this whole concept the fear of leaving a job\nAnd the worst thing that ever happens to any of us especially if you're listening is it all of a sudden you start working for someone else and then your net worth is tied up and to what other people defined it to be let me explain what I'm Talking about Ryan so yeah I remember the old story of the frog and the frog can jump as high as it possibly wants to\nBut if you want a frog in a box and you put a lid on top of that box and all of a sudden the frog tries a couple of times to jump\nBut it's the lead even when you take the little way the frog still will not jump higher than it could be for and that's kind of most of us out there and we start getting into these routes we're relying on a paycheck for somebody else we start to believe we can't make any more money and what's great what Jim has realized and a lot of other students\nAnd we've been doing this for over Twenty years right now is that feeling of when you first start making more money than you do at work because then all of a sudden you're just frog again you can jump very very high and all of a sudden that kept\nThat you've been believing your whole life has gone away and that's the sad part right now 'cause most people out there are stressed out that they have to stand a job they have no other outcome or vehicle when reality you can go ahead and you can short the markets\nGreat analogy like when I use is each week and I like using it as well I've said this over and over again when you're learning how to short the market meaning you're able to trade when the market goes down\nVery legal coach ... and the great part about it is I think of yourself in a car right now and you know you want to go somewhere but if the car only one and drive and never went in reverse", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "year": "2018", "city": "New York", "day": "21"}
