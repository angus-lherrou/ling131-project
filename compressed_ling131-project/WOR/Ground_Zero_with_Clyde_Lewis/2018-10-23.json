had surgery or moving part of his lung and chemotherapy and radiation and also radio surgery talked about\nAll the options and the pluses and minuses of each one why\nSo that this man would have all the choices and so every person not only this physician but everyone\nIn every job whether a person's a custodian are unemployed or the president of the other companies CEO\nWe talk about all the options because that's what I think a position to do is to be an advocate for the patient the patient is our boss the surgeon is not our boss suppressing the hospital's not er Abbas the head of the pharmaceutical industry is not our boss our boss is only one person that is\nYou know the patient and this man heard all the options we got a scan immediately came in he got his scanned the same day PET scan that's one more thing often hospitals care like no one's life is at stake but in fact every patient has a life at\nStake and I arranged a PET scan the meat I saw this man in the afternoon we

Seventeen to eighty eight\nAnd finally he had a biopsy show Gleason fate cancer Gleason defined how aggressive the cancer would be made a scale from two to ten so eight is a very aggressive cancer and a PSA eighty eight is a very aggressive cancer than this man had a massive pubic bone and and the spine\nUnfortunately no would intervene early and it's a big lesson he lost weight\nDown to a hundred

old man is a husky man he's a he lays track for the MTA so he's big tall and strong Andy's fifty years old he's married he has one child and three years ago yet abdominal pain he was unable to eat to find any comfort and it was just a terrible distress and they're seen by doctors\nEventually got an ultrasound of his abdomen and then an MRI which showed a mess and it was one of the big hospitals I've often talked about it before you get an ultrasound number I go to emergency room and then you end up being admitted to the hospital next to you know a certain that comes in and says oh you have a mouse\nAnd your abdomen you have to go to cut out and the patient felt like push to get surgery and they've got this big surgery because of this cancer was wrapped around the fear of being a cave of the main blood vessel takes all the blood from the legs and the lower part of the body back to the heart of the cancer was inseparable from it so they had to cut up\nPart of the fear of in a cave and the cancer and they did major surgery and he got in\nFact that he had complications from that surgery and then he found out\nNumber one that he had a sarcoma ally of miles or ... miles the comb is a cancer of the connective tissue\nAny part of the body most of the part of the body can develop into cancer and connective tissue fatty tissues muscle tissue bone tissue can also become cancerous and that's what he developed was a ... mile sarcoma or coma the abdomen growing through the ...\nAnd the doctors at all that surgery and cutting and had the complications infections and then after\nThe surgery listen to this after the surgery they tell them well anyway the cancer already traveled to the law well why did they do that surgery when the cancer already traveled stage forward to the lung when he for example\nCould have had radio surgery could have had pinpoint treatment to that mess with no cutting no bleeding with a success rate that is a very high without cutting off part of his in fear of being the cave a main blood vessel abdomen without the super infection\nThey never told him and you can guess why surgeons don't tell the patients riding go see a doctor Lederman and have invisible beams of radio surgery for cancer because probably the doctors afraid the patient will leave and come here to Thirteen Eddie for Broadway and then the patient so you had that\nSurgery was angry because they had the big surgery and they told him I needed the surgery was so important at this big hospital to do with his big surgery to took months to convalescent those fifty year old strapping muscular man and then he was told by the same people well stage for anyway you're going to die anyway and he was so angry at them\nSo angry at him he transferred his care and he went for a for profit hospital in Atlanta Georgia and his wife would fly down to Atlanta and ... they called him and tell them come back next month risque and he was spending all this money on airplanes and expenses and in two years of going back and forth\nThey never treated him never helped them all I can say is at least they didn't do unnecessary surgery on him but nothing happened and meanwhile he's growing up mass under his left arm here is getting bigger and starts out the size of pie and then the grape and then a\nPlum and now the size of an egg\nAnd they buy up see that they've found met a static sarcoma to his laugh the armpit and they proposed radical surgery themselves at which point the man got upset properly sub because they're already been through surgery the lead and he came to me just came yesterday\nFor a consultation about his are called ... and we discussed all these issues and I examined him and I got his record so we've reviewed it all and we talk and I often talk to my patients about everything of their case so they can put all their case it perspective and put\nAll his case in perspective we talked about the diagnosis we talked about the options that he could have had for his abdomen\nThat the surgeon never gave him to a certain symbols never give their patience with it and talked about the meaning of the metastases to the long stage for cancer and this amassed outlets painful growing through the ribs under the armpit on the left side and this is exactly the work we can do\nWith a high success rate of about Ninety percent with no cutting no bleeding though ... this is what we do patients lay on the table we computerized or body we find the cancer and then from thousands of angles sending beams to attack the cancer\nThis is what we do every day at ... in New York innovative technology see don't have to be caught on you can of course have surgery and I talk about surgery chemo and no treatment with every patient but many many people who come to us do not want to have\nFurther radical surgery especially if they can have excellent results with innovative treatment like radio surgery know cutting no bleeding invisible beams this is the work that we do\nEvery day we have a book with this and we have DVD fast like this man has to come in person make an appointment calls at two and two choices to one to two four six\nForty two thirty seven

she had flank pain\nAnd she had flank paying getting worse and worse and worse and then she went again\nShe went to a big hospital went to the emergency room they did a scam and they've found this mass near or on the kidney they called and the surge and the surgeon says oh you have to have surgery now and told her that she had to have the surgery and she felt compelled to have the surgery and he told her she has to lose or kidney\nThis is all done one of the biggest hospitals in New York City that has a CAT scan they did not do a PET scan they did not give her any of the documents that tower or anything she's been losing weight you she's gone down by ten Fifteen pounds just five foot seven high exam enter\nThe doctor removed the kidney and he told her motive for kidney cancer now she has no records she came to me almost at the end of the day a few minutes left because of the doctor recall of the hospital we got the records and we found out that she didn't have kidney cancer at all he removed the\nKidney but it was a kidney for a cancer called sarcoma another connective tissue cancer that was not of the kidney she did not\nI Believe need the kidney removed shed other options she told her that they left cancer in our body they center to other doctors for more treatment\nMost likely meaning stage for cancer so again another case where a person who walks in a hospital ghost emergency room gets a test and then the certain pops up ... just to cut out the kidney and she gets her kidney cut out being told she had kidney cancer which he didn't have\nAnd is now getting sent to other doctors for ... where we know that came up for Columbus doesn't work very well and she was told by a radio listener like you to come here thirty for Broadway Broadway and thirtieth street in

States of his or her body and you'll see signs in every room that says that we believe it I Believe that the patient is across the United states of his or her body and it's up to us the doctor to serve the patients and we try to serve the patient with truth\nAnd honesty and candor\nAnd that's why I went to medical school to be able to help people and that's exactly what we do here at Thirteen
