Don Lemon out there in Salt on the media and it's all because of the president of the United states every moment they get they turn this into a way to bash inland I don't know you're just blind when you watch these things that you agree with\nI haven't seen anyone compared to September eleventh or Oklahoma City bombing so I haven't so maybe they have I haven't so but in terms of the hysteria that has been attached\nTo this well I I Will say and I have ever feel in danger\n... well yeah my son works at CNN and he was freaked out and didn't want to go to work the other day yeah I got so I've by us most as I did feel unsettled was like when they had anthrax of NBC that day and that's where I was real stuff I Know well but we didn't know that now that would well now they're saying that Joe we didn't know that two days ago we didn't know until ...\nOthers say well most of them and another couching it well many of these couldn't explode okay maybe they couldn't but we didn't know that when these verse were coming out and number two the idea that the president ... zero responsibility for any of his rhetoric or anything he is done on his side that's just unfair\nWhy should he accept responsibility for his rhetoric Glen when the media is read Latin list in its attack on him and he fights back he's got nothing to do with it ever came up with the idea to send these pipe bombs whether they're fake bombs are real bond you cannot blame the president for that you simply can't lend\nI think your flights leaving for for my God I was just like\nI said well I Will repeat myself to do as well he's the one who said it's just fine and dandy for congressman Weiner dog and a\nAnd and that brought a bomb you know but you can excuse the president of language and actually\nBeat up the protesters I'll pay for and listen\nIf I can say Maxine Waters gets out there in that you came up to the United states she's got him to do\nHe's the president of United States and he if he wants to fight fake news\nDoing with facts which he seems incapable of doing he is doing it to them and they didn't want to destroy him now I I don't listen I don't agree that it's at that that is all the mainstream media it's all of that\nI Do say that he has to ... except some culpability for him to totally deny deny deny call for unity and then slam the media again is this typical of this guy and I think it's wrong what to say that one more time on you know\n[laughter] I Will though I Will hey let's go let's get another\nVoice maybe of reason and here Rob on ocean side New York morning Rob\nShow up you know what honestly you know it's just like to comment on Syria he's already killed ...
