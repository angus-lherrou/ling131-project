than we are pleased to meet you my name is Ryan and joining me as always I say as always the last week he was out of time I think Larry ... and I was in Connecticut\nThat's a long ways from Texas I I was on the right country\nBut not in the region but Larry's back with us today do you guys are with us last week we had John O'Donnell he's the chief knowledge officer and we call him the rain maker here it online trading me filling in for Larry's big shoes\nHere on the income generating show now one of the things that we love to talk about here is we love to talk about making more money hence the name right we're all about income here it's all about driving more income now it always ends up being\nIncome for retirement or income for today right we can use the income for for really whatever we want but it's all about having more income so that we can do the things we want to do rather than do the things we have to do no inside of our financial markets one of the things that we stress a lot we spent a lot of time on this show\nIs how to make consistent income and that's that's one of the things I Love having Larry out here out here talking about he sheds a lot of light on that subject as far as how we can make consistent income in the market and it really starts with a consistent approach and all we mean by consistent approach is the markets go up down in sideways so we've got to have\nA strategy we've got to have an approach that can make money up down or sideways right now we've got that bullish biased where some of the greatest consumers of all time but Larry what are some of the things you and your instructor team are really having a student's focus on right now to generate money and to be able to identify those down opportunities and those sideways opportunities\nWell it really comes out of the things that's about awareness and basically emotion right now\nSo the awareness is a lot of people want to make more money they think that making money\nIs simply working another job which is something we don't want to do where more importantly most millionaires you and I said this over and over again have five different income streams\nWhere you can imagine a millionaire and I want to go out there were five different jobs they learn how to generate income passive income more active income they just want to pay check coming over and over again and so a lot of what our students learn is how to go from being very emotional\nTo being very strategic and the way you do that as by following people who are already doing what you want to do\nAnd will cost referring to the big banks and so a lot of what we teach our students is\nHow the banks make money and most of the ways to make money is not just by going long where most people learn a trade that way but also by going what we call shorting the market\nAnd that simply means when the markets go down it's not necessarily a negative thing it's an opportunity and so with being self aware is understanding that there's more ways than what you might have been taught to trade\nAnd as a result you now simply learn which most people don't understand that their way to trade money in the markets is really simple it's a transfer money for people who don't know what they're doing to people who don't know what they're doing\nYou know when you're talking about shorting I Love that you brought that up because you know we have that Bush by us where we already know how to make money when the market goes up we buy low and so high but the interesting thing is\nHow you make money as the market's going down the shorting concept you were talking about what what a lot of time gets disconnected from that as it is still buy low in so high it's just in a different order is so high and then buy low\nAnd so that's one of my favorite things about the half day class and and whenever I get a chance to actually teach one I really spend a lot of time really tried to shift our mindset and then the mindset that the average investor has out there which is totally normal is down markets are bad\nRight and we we we even hear it on the news and bad news they say oh it's such a terrible day on Wall street the markets went down the Dow went down four hundred points well on days like that like back in February you know Goldman Sachs had the two hundred million dollar day on a down day just like that\nRight so one of the things I Love that I was just getting started off onto with with my point is I Love being a part of these happy classes and being able to really introduce people to how to make money as the markets go down\nSo they don't have to fear the bear right you don't have to be afraid of a bearish market bears markets just like polish markets\nAre great opportunities to make money and even even sometimes greater opportunities to make money because at which ah which speed the market goes down\nIt's that whole fear and greed ... principal the up markets are driven by greed the down markets are driven by fear and you know I I remember asking a class once you know which which which motion was more powerful fear or greed\nAnd I had some you say I I I think it's greed and we chatted about it because most of the class thought it was fear and one of the points that I came to was if it was greed everybody would do everything in their power nothing nothing would ever standing anybody's way of making money but it ends up being fear 'cause the fear of the unknown to fear of trying something new\nConsistently stands in the way of people's people's ability to make more money and it gets back to your point of that is why most people go out and they just get another job rather than generating another stream of income like passively are actively via the markets because that's a safe zone they already have a job to get another job well it's not the most appealing thing\nIt's a little more safer for our psyche and so those are some of the things we help our students overcome a so I Love that you went down the shortest path there because that is a great way to make money as the markets are going down and one of the things that we could do to help get a few people get started\nReally being able to see the opportunity and embarrassed market is we've got a big stack of tickets here that we are going to give away today where you say we pull a couple of these out and we give them with some more listeners let's get some people educated\nAll right well right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area\nAnd at the half the class and really it online training academy ... we focus on generating income as the marks going up in the markets are going down but the half day classes where you really get to see exactly what it takes to be able to do that\nNow I have to class there about three hours long your investment is going to be three hours of your time to come in and raise that financial like you to help you get better returns in the market in just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes the one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you're driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluded with your passes is going to be our professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional insider kit makes it so you can get started\nRight now ... century twenty we need you to call now and reserved those seats\nThe number is eight eight nine three zero eight seven to three that said it eight nine three zero eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com and see if you can score some passes there Larry\nYou start to kind of continue down this path of making money in multiple directions we've got the job market we've got the down market you know what are some of the hurdles people have to overcome we touched on a few minutes ago as far as the bullish biased that we already have is being consumers\nMaybe maybe you could take that into it into a ... expand on that WIPP for our listeners and even even anything else that you work with or that you deal with when you're working with new students whether they have twenty years' experience or their brand new to the markets on how they really can structure things to make sure they're poised to profit is the markets are coming down\nGreat question right in the number one mistake that most people make when it comes to trading are investing is they try to do it on their own\nThey don't get themselves educated said no it's okay I'll do it on my own and eventually maybe I'll get around and some education\nThe problem is to very costly lesson why would you want to spend all that time energy and money when you can learn a system and what I Love about the term system Ryan it's saving yourself stress time energy and money\nAnd so we teach our students is to trade again like banks do back in February last year Goldman Sachs had a ridiculously large winning day was ... million dollars in one day simply by shorting the markets and so I Want to use this analogy hurt me use it before\nIt's like driving a car if anyone said to you well you can go anywhere you want to go in this world right now but the court can only go and drive you could never put it in reverse\nIt'd be pretty frustrating Dr number one you're educated enough to know that the car goes both directions well most people don't realize soda the markets you can trade when the markets are going up\nYou can trade when the market's going down and what most people have learned by coming to the academy ... becoming educated and not trying to do it on their own is that there's a simple step by step process to system\nRegardless of how old you are your background your education level if you're someone who's coach ... somebody's committed you can make money trading the markets like the banks do\nYeah and when you look at how we learn how to do anything it's really how we learn how to trading invest as well that doesn't change just because we're in the investing world and and the thing that the thing I always stress inside of my classes is that we focus on the skill and that was one of the things that my\nMy mentor is really pushed on me about Fifteen sixteen years ago was focused on the skill and the money will come the the the issue ends up being is it's a natural tendency for us to stare at the money right out of the gate and we want to make I got to me I Want to make a hundred dollars a day we got to be that starting right now right rather than building the skill if you have the skill you can generate the money but you have to have the skill first so many times", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "year": "2018", "city": "New York", "day": "07"}
