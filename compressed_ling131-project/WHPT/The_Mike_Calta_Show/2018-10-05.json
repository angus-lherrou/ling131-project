are they getting into like no lean comedy now\nI think we all did it for a\nFor his friends like ... because they don't get good probably they they don't get good comedy shows the only comedy club out in that area is more courteous and that's in downtown Sarasota so I think they just tried to bring a little of the radio station and the comedians to the people it wasn't a bad idea it's just not a very conducive played for comedy but I stayed for the whole thing I I\nI got there I got there before it started\nAnd I stayed till the whole thing was he was asking myself yeah and then uh and then we went out to a down home right now to do a drink at the quiet as far as the ...\nYeah well I mean and that yeah and I got all our intern current I Can't even defend the [laughter]\nI Can't even defend that I was embarrassed for myself ...\nGood and it was but I Would say Joe and I did the majority of the dream because we got around a shot and I think Joe and I collected lay dead at to two

I say and I was in the way I mean when they were talking about everything yeah my name came\nUp to a great it's great because uh there there were friends with them\nAnd most radio guys like hate each other we're all like each other and sure and I I heard that and then you know you start hearing things that you know about\nAnd then when they brought in a rousing up or does mentioned drag you know and I figured I might just from a guy who's been in that position of inviting people on the show I I ... I forget what it was you don't want to be like hey we want to come do I just to your show for three hours yeah\nWe are talking about is ever since I was a kid who doesn't love Star Wars ... why should I don't care what the next one's going to Baltimore camel he ruined that whole west are was more refreshed\nSo you know mark Hamel didn't want he didn't want\nPlay that part that way right like he disagreed with it but he did it because he's you know\nBoy didn't do very well I was being ... trying to be professional man it was horrendous and it ruins the whole movie and now at the end of that thing I don't even know what there is to look forward to\nWell did you like rogue one yes well then more of that\nThat is what I'm saying I ... they'll give you five movies I like to the viola\nSolar movie I doubt it was good\nAll right well so you'll you'll be back thank you so but I don't know I think you'll make it so you still don't\nMatter the marvel universe for I don't want to watch another marvel movie if they're really going to keep James gunfire from guardians of the galaxy I\nWas the dumbest thing ever\nI Know Galvin got suspended for way why can't they just suspend gun whenever we have our\nRight so it was they give them a Twitter punishment a cooling off period these are the ones that are we\nAlways talk about this and somebody pointed out I mean how racist as many years to be and how do you have the balls to go ahead and suspend somebody somebody said we were talking about this last night things that we did five years ago on the show that we can do now to them that are yeah we'd be in so much trouble we get we get a you know just a community would catch us off the radio\nYeah it's like they are you know it's like does he never saw James guns movies before his guardians like all of his movies are had very shocking material\nAnd he says that I was a different I was younger I was trying to control of trying to shock you know there's ... there's a long and it's out\nFor the bird has come along down the road with ... yeah that you know I\nThere's no reason to name any names but I'm just there's so many people that are also working for Disney that are worse things in writing some weird tweet yeah yeah so uh I you know I mean I get that that tweets were really good at hurting lots of different community\nFor spread it around around it might have been\nHaving famous they would've swarms house a couple of times when I uh yeah\nSo that was bad but uh but he's such a great guy and he's he's been on Douglas movies are a few times and uh and I love those as guardians movies\nWith these uh loved him from the first movie he came in he was like maybe you know like I go she's one of the best guys ... and I'm so glad to see that they are standing by a specially\nBut he's still he's he ... he just not do it and you know then they they could sue him but I don't think that what's good for\nYou say they'll take care of him as he'll go through his contract and then he Donny said but but a really practical underneath the poll now he if he steps I was on my I Will not be star lord any more of a match when everybody crops or perhaps they all action figures\nYeah he's you know he signed that letter that said strongly worded letter but ah well we'll see what happens next and then the other odd thing is that marvel has said well we might work with James Gunn on another project down the line like ... this is the project\nBy the way to go first\nTo part a written the script and they're like we're going to use the script oh that's so great to be\nYou know they're saying that wrote those tweets road that's great and I I don't know\nWhat's what's it to the people what's the difference between him being the writer of the director of both I either fire him or don't yeah yeah it's our uh stop trying to strategic Doug what are your favorite movies I Need to know guardians one guardian\nA at\nI'll throw a category ... ... what what's your favorite superhero um type movie\nOh probably get all the rules Reagan yeah that pulls free for outside ...
