something to do with food yeah okay Carrie yeah I'm a I'm Janine spicy or you watch the DMZ program I've seen it yes I Know I'm familiar I Do like it although it makes me feel old sometimes because I have to slow down other they are now TMZ stands for thirty mile zone right right yeah okay\nUh if you know a thirty mile zone if you watch the show you see is Harvey eleven there is a black dude with the Braves there is a bunch of girls there is a funny black dude\nWhere's the T shirts there is a little nerdy white guy a there's the Australian guy it was a bunch of different characters on show\nMike Walters used to be one of the guys who was constantly breaking news on that show he was a news editor for TMZ he has since left on than a hundred percent sure why we'll find out\nHe's got a brand new service now called the blast which has got huge financial backing out of France from what I understand and really think about it what else is there besides TMZ you know it used to be all in choir\nAnd then uh once things went online and they went all TMZ\nWell now you got the blast lets a welcome to show for the first time from the blast Mike walls as Mike how you doing I'm ... I'm\nGood how are you guys doing hey what did you do before TMZ\nBefore TMZ I went to UCSB in Santa Barbara and I was really bombed at in in college but ...\nBut like how did you know I I Will kind of connections you have like how did you know that you can get that info or is it a job than anybody at that time to do\nA good question to answer as a um my best friend from home who actually works for me now here at the blast dot com\nHis brother worked at Access Hollywood and when we graduated college he basically said hey you know my brother both you guys are just you know ... of space\nSo you want a job\nYou know in the industry I can get you your foot in the door and Hollywood I'll bring you up here and that's where it started I the the second answer is that my entire family besides me are cops and so I feel like it's a little bit in my bloodstream because investigating celebrity news as much as it sounds weird to say that\nIs similar to investigate in you know just gathering information and finding out what happened\nYeah people it's kind of similar I did that feel like I'm at the time I bought a little bit\nYeah I guess I'm a I'm a former you know I ... my own show for years now but I started out as a producer and I love doing that began and find that out some information and getting hot tip some work on that ah when we when they went on TV and we got to see what all you guys look like and when\nPeople will say oh how do you know that you know I'm Ben Affleck filed for divorce\nOn looking at it like to see that the actual divorce so a lot of times I don't know what the percentage of eighty percent of the time it comes from a legal documents filed in Los Angeles celebrities you know there's a little bigger percentage of you know of divorce you know arrest\nStuff like that was just the way it is so so a lot of times I'm reading right from the legal document but ... but to answer it clearly look I mean a a hundred percent we everything on our site is carefully lawyer and when I'm comfortable publishing a story about a celebrity and what's going on with them it's one of the reasons\nAgain we talked about it I'm doing it on my own is because I can make the decision right and ... stop if it goes up on the black dot com you know I looked at it and I know what it says and I believe\nAre based on the people I Know that this is true um and I just think that that that's something that maybe was it done in the celebrity news gossip world\nUh up until that point and I think that the national Enquirer and some of those\nMagazines actually had stories in them that were one hundred percent true it's just that mixed in with the fact that aliens landed on earth and you know [laughter] you know some of the states or whatever like you you can then start to figure out that maybe you don't know if they're if they're true or not at the time when I started doing this for a living we treat\nEntertainment news like CNN treat 'em you know global politics\nWhile we love it and it makes it makes the world goes on and made the current ... billionaires and now we keep checking in the blast dot com as Mike while there's new spot and you got the hotline that does anything we need to get a heads up on feel free to call\nYour that'd be honest I and and right back at you guys you guys have a good show and I don't tell you that anytime I'm this happens a lot I'm sure you get word on something and you've got to your co hosts and your producers jumping off it just gave me a call I'll jump on a straight answer you'll get that you get the vote first and you'll get the accurate stuff out of the ...\nNot very good talk then good luck with the blast dot com bubble you got to say about a a Michael I met a guy yeah valley or in college I owned his own business right\nAnd it's interesting because like you said\nYou could really do any kind of investigating if you're doing that you're doing celebrities or whatever but you can also go and be investigating\nBigger things or different things not necessary celebrities we want to find out uh you know something happened or there is now or whatever you you know you're just asking people questions and finding the right people uh yeah it it it to me it'd\nBe kind of a fun hobby to have I don't know very few people make a ton of money I got to be I Wonder how much does the um the guys even the guys on TV are actually making you know what I mean right maybe now Mike as he was amused Basque achieve you know what I mean but if you see harm eleven becoming a millionaire and you're like yeah I can do this\nAnd go to your own thing so yeah 'cause I Wonder like say\nYou were in that bar and you saw pose Malone and you saw Jimmy Fallon together\nAnd you add video and you're like a video of these guys totally drunk and say into into what are they paying for that yeah I Wonder if he wants to picture I mean you're just hanging out and I was probably has no news big news in Maine and I'm All right well good for him he clearly did not want to talk about the whole program [laughter] yeah\nOh yeah it was for information out of him but he\nSo that day he was on the air\nAnd I remember watching it and he and he was like a wild rather than oh I didn't know and so\nWalters has seen something that nobody else has seen him because he was able to tell him that there's a there's a comment Maine where he would be\nHere it'd be indicating that he was the fact in fact the one taping so God Knows what else the guy I Know I bet you'll find out soon I uh women having a brick hashtags in a it
