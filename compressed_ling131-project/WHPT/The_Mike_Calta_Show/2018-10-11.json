shepherd's pie or that I Would go to Maloney is Irish\nPub and washed ... sauce\nYeah that was a trick question nobody has I Would say like if it's your yeah way more than ... other than that I was a trigger crashed or whatever to honest one of the airlines over there was probably survey [laughter]\nAre you Italian it's the one thing that I Know about in this town is the food\nWe know I Know [laughter] we're probably Bobby I Love you baby she look good you're listening you lost a lot of weight no that's not true with like you know ...\nOr so we have some controversy with the death pool OJ now yeah the death of burn Troyer has been certified as a suicide\nSo what does that mean now\nThat means Herman gets more points you already had\nBurned dryer so what points she have it's all you had was burned\nOn April third or the forty nine year old actor so that would be fifty one points that she had originally was taken from is\nA North Hollywood home to the hospital for reported alcohol intoxication\nThree weeks later on April twenty first trial was pronounced dead the following day and our topsy was performed buddy a cause of death was deferred pending further investigation it was later determined Troy died from a alcohol intoxication\nThe manner of death was certified as a suicide according to the corners reform aside\nTo the point where he accidentally kill them\nNow listen okay and I also have already Franklin so because he had called earlier in that day or some of his friends called earlier that day reporting that he was suicidal\nAnd he had been trying to do this before yeah so and then also didn't we didn't die that this was also considered an overdose\nNo that's it's either or I Would imagine rights over those really more for drugs\nThis you know I almost died of alcohol when I was uh when I was Thirteen I was in the hospital I almost died of a\nWell I mean yeah technically he overdosed and that was the cause of suicide he killed himself by overdosing on I'll call\nIt in my stomach I Would have died and that way\nSo then he would've overdose ... very Sawyer he committed suicide by overdosing on alcohol\nFellow talking like she's Sherlock Holmes in other cases [laughter]\nSo that would be ... points\nFor all those fifty points for suicide plus the fifty one points that are from his age\nAnd they did give me an overdose overdose points I thought suicide with a hundred and now that I'm looking at the points right here so that would be one hundred and fifty one points and that's all it all for ... and that's what I have on the board\nLove oh can you explain how it works again [laughter] so when somebody dies ...\nOkay so when someone dies you take the difference of their age from one hundred so how old are you\nForty eight at my I just had a birthday forty eight Monday happy\nBirthday I thank you okay so if you were to pass away this year very likely then one of if one of us had you then we would get fifty two points and depending on how you die you can also accumulate more points depending on the cause of death\nRight W pass just from a heart attack that's nothing but if you pass\nWhy would you are bitterly Picard is there because they've already [laughter] she's she [laughter] she has eyes [laughter]\nIf you kill yourself if you overdose if like a two year old by animal yeah who very hacked you then you get more points on top of the aged\nCougar attached you out or if you are killed by a somebody's somebody a peck yeah like violent pack it for some reason Keith Richards killed you you know then it'd be more and more laid off that yeah\nSo I couldn't kill myself 'cause you have a case of [noise]\nUh no I don't I mean I'm not going to say I never thought about\nIt at any time but I never would do it right you know when you're young and you have all those hormones are raging you're depressed about girls and stuff like that but I'm too cool to do I have too much to live for yeah now I Would never do it as a kid\nLike I now my firm belief is and I never understand why Robin Williams could do it or anybody else is because I Would rather live miserably and have my life then put my kids are killing myself but I understand that people go through it sometimes they're irrational and they feel like\nTheir place would be better if they if they were dead it would be a better life for their kids I get it but I don't\nGo to Robin Williams also had brain problems so it's not like that so Sara Lee was doing it you know very well it was in South messing with\nThe kids are set for life it's not like his kids are gonna want for anything no such\nRelationship with his daughter his young daughter and I could never do it to my kids that were I Would live as a ... like I like the we've talked about ... a a transitioning from a man to a woman and uh\nI if I felt like I was a woman and I was living miserably I Would not do it I'd rather have a miserable life than put my kids through that try my same people shouldn't do it but just how I feel\nSo now you shouldn't do it and I hear they're huge dresses in mommy's closet [laughter] ...\nSo ... for the death toll Spanish in last place where the hero Carmen moves up with a hundred and Seventy five points but still F worthwhile or Tony Burton with two hundred and four points might tell to to hundred and sixty eight points and me leading was seven hundred and\nTwenty one form of course he is an angel ...
