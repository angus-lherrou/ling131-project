public affairs program courtesy of ... media group Tampa Bay you can't turn on the news or pick up the paper or even look on social media to see somebody's opinion or a news article about the opioid epidemic in this country\nAnd often times this opioid epidemic or diseases what I call it because it's almost like alcoholism it is a drug addiction ties in with chronic pain what exactly is chronic pain\nHow does the opioid epidemic tie in with chronic pain and what are the treatments in what treatments can be out there for people that suffer for chronic pain\nThat don't want to take the opioids those are all the bases were going to cover this morning with Dr Linda Porter Dr Porter is director of the office of pain policy at the national Institute of neurological disorders and stroke that's a division of the national Institute of health\nThese are the people nationwide that have really been watching this opioid epidemic in trying to come up with solutions doctor good morning a ball coming to the show first out of the box I got to ask you\nWhen we hear the word chronic pain\nIs there a true medical definition of chronic pain because everybody has their own different pain it could be ... it could be a back injury from a car wreck years ago or a neck injury or some kind of ... in the in the foot or something like that is there a true definition of chronic pain\n[noise] Ah yes there is and I think all of the conditions that you just mentioned would fit in within that\nDefinition so [noise] um the the medical community tends to define chronic pain along two lines um one is a timeframe and that on is defined somewhere between three and six months but I think more importantly chronic pain is defined by a I'm\nNot by by uh not improving a lack of improvement from an initial injury or perhaps\nThe outcome of the disease that should he'll but doesn't and so over time I'm a person should have recovered developed chronic pain that last beyond the time of normal healing and that chronic pain involves a lot of different\nAlterations to the nervous system that make it per se that\nLet's talk about the the patients trip to the doctor for instance somebody has a very bad car accident they were were rear ended they head injury to the lower lumbar\nAnd it didn't require any back surgery but they were in a great amount of pain and first groups yearn for opioids was given by the doctor now this patient comes back to the doctor three months later\nUh some of us have a very addictive personality and you're already going to have some patients in an accident that are addicted to maybe alcohol or another kind of narcotic or a type of drug and they may be more susceptible to that opioid epidemic disease and\nUh do you think that that's the patient's responsibility to come in and tell the doctor would say even before we have maybe a serious\nSurgery on her back or own are neither hey doc you know I have an addictive personality or in the in the past I have abused alcohol\nAnd uh I'm afraid that these opioids may make me addicted or on the other side is the patient afraid to tell the doctor that thinking jeez this ... this doctor is going to know I have an addiction problem any won't prescribed medication that I Need and I'm going to be in a lot of pain your thoughts on that\n... and so that's a really important issues so for the benefit of the patient it would be wonderful if they would tell their provider I've used drugs before for pain management you know whether they're addicted or not prior use will maybe put them a little bit of a higher\nRisk for addiction and the future [noise] um\nI also that the mental health of the person is really important and and will help\nHelp the doctor predict whether opioids are could be problematic for the person or not it's it's a little bit hard to predict that um but people are with ... with depression\nUm can be a little bit more at risk and it's a combination of these risk factors that the patient may not know are risk factors\nBut it would be important for them\nTo relay that information to their provider so that the provider can sort of you know put together a a formula whether he thinks they're at risk or not the big problem is prior opioid use\nAppropriately or not is a big stigma from many of these people and so they don't want to share that information when their provider um they may not want to just because of the stigma or they may not want to because they are concerned that\nThey need opioid and they won't be the sky the opioid I'm In an acute situation where it can be really helpful so it's kind of a multifaceted problem and awareness of\nYou know what the patient should be telling the doctor is crucially important and education on the doctor's side to be alerted to the risk factors for potential addiction and alerted to the risk factors for how to treat the chronic pain I'm\n... I think that's a big challenge for us nationwide to get that information out and get the proper training in place\nAlready Dr let's move on and talk about the initiative the age and I age excuse me he'll initiative and by the way the website you can get more information on is that in I. H. dot Gov slash you'll dash initiative\nAnd you can also check out the national institutes of health website to that is another great way to find out some awesome information All right let's talk about this initiative that you are currently doing you're talking about the research\nYou're doing it patient by patient which is really a really a hands on approach and really a long term approach because you've got to do all the follow up you've got to look at all the church you've got to you know have what kind of information you're getting from the doctor that's doing the treatment itself how are you finding these patients to be part of the research\nSo right now we have what we call as a a funding opportunity announcement out so we are reaching out\nTo the research community for them to send us applications I'm from their academic sites to show us that that they can actually implement\nThe research so we're we're actually not doing it in an age but we're funding um people from the outside and so we're in the process now of um of collecting\nThe applications for the projects what we expect is that a big academic center would have the capacity and the resources and the work force to do these studies\nAnd we will work closely with them to make sure that the appropriate data is collected the training of the providers are done appropriately and then as you say collect this massive\nUm database and then run that through different analyses so over the course of the next three years we'll have information on folks that come in um\n[noise] and and it's over for which we track them over time from their injury up to six months and then collecting information so so that's one of the big pieces for heel and we're hopeful that does\nPredict of factors that we find for the transition to chronic pain or for resilience to it will help to guide that are practices at the time of the acute pain event to prevent the chronic pain there are many other parts to heal and um you know I'm happy to go through the other components of that as well\nJust briefly if you don't mind shore on so the other thing that heals addressing as far as the pain management research side there is a piece to heal that's working on research to support that addiction management and that are\nOverdose treatment but for the pain management side we're building infrastructure\nTo help move on new discoveries whether they be drugs or devices to treat pain more quickly through what we call the pipeline of discovery\nThrough clinical testing in humans so we're we're putting together um partnerships with industry academia were belittling better screening tools for new drugs to see if they look like they might be on\nAppropriate as an adult jeeze at ... and that are animal models to test them and then a clinical trial network to actually\nLook through these compounds are devices as they move through that pipeline see if they're safe and humid and so that's one more piece appeal to try and get discoveries to the clinic\nAnother piece of heel is to set up the infrastructure to do clinical trials\nTo test um the effectiveness of new treatments for pain as they are developed and also to compare either treatments either one by one for specific pain conditions in certain people\nOr combinations of treatments what we call integrated care multi disciplinary care to see what's\nBest for an individual\nWho's most likely to respond to that treatment\nAnd how those treatments need to be tailored for the individual and everybody responds differently to treatment everybody's paying condition affects them a little bit differently so I I think\nThat's a really important piece um we're also moving forward to help 'em develop tools that will under ... that will help us understand and modulate\nChanges and the nervous system\nThat occurred during a chronic pain states so so chronic pain you may just feel it in a certain part of your body but changes occur in the nervous system that make that pain persistent even when something in your body looks like it healed so we need to really attack the\nThe brain puzzle of it too and and that's another piece of um he'll sort of getting it that understanding and using that information to better treat\nA the nervous system changes in kind of thing\nOr a doctor we've only got a couple of minutes left and we really don't have time to get into all the treatments but I Know some of the things that your group was looking at as an alternative to medication and we're not saying the medications bad were saying the addiction is bad and there's got to be better ways to do it in other ways to do it with non addictive medicine\nBut I Know your group is looked at acupuncture electronic stimulation nerve blockers which is a form of medication or also you know possibly some surgery that will treat the chronic pain and then less invasive things like psychotherapy relaxation therapies biofeedback behavioral modification\nThese are all the things that you have to take into consideration is a doctor when you're doing this he'll initiative in and trying to figure out the opioid epidemic in this country and and the chronic use of a pain medication\nMhm right and and all those different potential therapies that you mentioned um there there is\nActually a fair bit of evidence to show that they are effective you know in an individual basis for an individual pain condition and I think he'll will provide the infrastructure to test um\nCatch some of those what'd you don't yet have a good evidence space or we're not sure that they were also to test them then combinations um that would be more effective for certain individuals so that's a really really important\nPiece of the puzzle of how we can really move as a nation to improve paying care so I you know I think that's something that that's really important is something that we've been looking to do for a long time to expand our evidence base for complimentary therapies and now with he'll\nWe will have a much better infrastructure to do that more efficiently and more quickly\nAre Dr ... before we let you go here and we are running short on the clock uh opioid misuse addiction if you will and it's almost a disease to many people because it's almost like alcoholism were they just can't get through the day without taking a bill\nIt has gotten so bad to this country that now we're reading news reports that people are injuring their parents purposely to take them to the vets to get paying bills so they can actually take an animal's pain pills that is just one of the nightmarish stories that we hear in the News I'm sure you've heard worse\nAnd addressing why is so critically important to have dads involvement in the lives of their children and in the health of those mothers and that we can't stress enough their own health\nBecause they tend to really really neglect their own health\nAnd so I'm a lot of research definitely confirms affirms the I'm the father absence syndromes and what happens when dads are apps and in the household so just to name a few um\nThe other is four times greater risk of poverty when the desert accent is two times greater um likelihood that there will be infant mortality and babies dying before their first birthday or\nTheir two times more likely to suffer from obesity or when the fathers out of the household two times more likely to drop out of high school and then there's the seven times more likely to become pregnant as a team when the father's accent\nSo needless to say I could go on and on about uh about that but our twenty four seven debt which is funded by\nA children's war here locally uh really speaks to um the urgency and the importance of engaging those dads and a very meaningful way and making them primary partners in a optimal health and then the one that's\nThere is to my heart is to do a program and you know a little bit about the ... and so ah the dual program for us um been around\nHere in Hillsborough County says two thousand and that particular program um was a created by a very good friend of mine a DJ per se and so that program started as a result when we start looking at the data\nAnd looking at were the worst health outcomes and the the highest in from ... in east Tampa\nAnd then we start observing what was going on in some of the uh hospitals there were actually women giving birth alone and having nobody during birth and delivery and that just really you know reach\nOur hearts because then a mother myself I Can't even imagine given birth not having any body and your family no friends no association and then to leave the hospital without that kind of support\nSo the dual was um are women who give emotional support to women during birth and delivery but even pre NATO ally so they'll work with these mom's\nFour to six weeks before they give birth there with them during birth and delivery\nAnd them postpartum Lee about four to six weeks after they give birth and their whole premise is to promote that attachment and bonding but that mother and that baby to make sure that mother\nFeels very comfortable loving that baby and to the extent is possible I Do is really promote breastfeeding because there's all kinds of benefits were breastfeeding\nNot just during infancy but throughout life\nUm and so that's their main main focus of a Dula and for us in Hillsborough County\nWe have had a tremendous success with dual of participation and increasing that breastfeeding right I mean we've gone from a women breastfeeding ten percent all the way up to forty something percent\nAnd so we do know that I'm having those do let's not only increase at birth rate\nBut it also saves from um saves us fiscally a from a a financial standpoint our view because\nWomen tend to have far less C sections when they happen to us and women tend to have far less need of medications potato singing and like when they um you know how to\nDo so do a very important to the work that I'm you know we do with optimal health\nIt's so interesting because I think you know several years ago it maybe twenty Thirty years ago where the conversation about breastfeeding was taboo and you would never talk about that now is something that is\nDefinitely a more out in the open you see mothers feeling a much more comfortable with that so you you speak of the door program you're twenty four seven diet program or father program\nBut also can you highlight some of the other uh programs within reach up\nYes um another program that we have in this one our newest one to 'cause it's like we're not third year now is uh the nurse family partnership um program and this particular program focuses on first town moms\nSo in order to be part of this program you cannot have had any previous um burst and it really ... last longer too because you really target the family you want to work with them up to five years and so what you hope to happen is that you work with that family and that mom on\nMany things on you know financial literacy on a self sufficiency a on a educational or vocational aspirations and really planning pregnancies so you want them to be very deliberate and strategic about okay when is the best time\nTo happen next baby and that be a a very deliberate decision and family planning so really big I'm a big proponent of\nPlanning diverse than planning when you gonna do the next birth and delivery so that is the nurse family a partnership program um that we have\nAnd then we also have\nA programs uh to reduce stress and I'm I'm a really emphasizing focus importance of peer support networking\nSo that folks can get together and now only talk about the stress is and they are alive but really address and take a look at NATO health\nWhich is a very hard thing to do for many people to really get in a a an atmosphere in a space where they can talk about issues that they normally don't talk about but then most importantly connect them with the resources so that\nThey can get a says that you can get diagnosed it can get treated or if need be so the the stress component in addressing a stress and help is another a program that um you know that we do\nI'm so curious to know just some of the\nStories in which you've heard a participant start at one point and by the end of you know working with and through reach of\nThey have now made it to a point B or C um is there one or two in particular that stand out to you by way of one of your programs that you know it makes you really stick your checks out and say we did that\nThere's a few ah one that ah I Want to mention is um we also have the family resource center that I just didn't mention um\nAnd it's in ... city and so the family resources are really focuses in on a child development and it creates a safe environment by which family members can come\nIn and really be a in tune and educated about where their children should be\nA as forest developmental milestones and didn't really being aware of what may be red flags and what they need to tend to weather is eyesight weather is hearing what is communication skills and just have that that atmosphere well in these centers\nWe also do developmental screenings were in\nWe have a clinics a mobile clinics that come in and places like St Joe's soaps and other places come in and do screenings\nAnd then there's one particular screening um are are never forget um this was in about two thousand and two it was a staff member who bought her grandchild 'em to a screening with our encouraging\nA and oftentimes people are embarrassed\nWhen they have a child um [noise] uh who have special needs but this child was like two years old and not talking and so when it came to our attention that this was her a grandchild of hers and it wasn't talking we encouraged a screening\nI actually had one of my staff members of who still working with me today accompany her to the screening\nUm and it found out that the child had some serious artistic problems and some real serious emotional mental health problems at that early age and so they did the development of screening got the child into\nAll kinds of resources with developmental um screenings with mental health services ... provision\nI really want to see our goal of reach out going beyond where we are in now and that impact far\nGreater numbers of people and we do now and we're not shabby we serve not less than five thousand families a year\nBut it's so much need out there and such a great need I Would like to see that the triple a with a number of families that were able to reach and teach and uh help you know to have really productive healthy lives if you\nUm have stated you know the importance of what you do and a kind of spoke to you know the legacy that you hope to create\nBut if there is one thing that you could say you were most proud of 'em in your time here\nCould you identify that\n... thing and I'm a smell and big and people that know me going to say I knew she was going to figure out a way to put her grandson in it\nUh and and yes I've worked very hard most of my life uh to create resources and platforms for people who wouldn't necessarily have opportunities\nAh for certain things and I've always been concerned not just to work with the most marginalized which has been my emphasis\nBut the community as a whole\nAnd having a platform or venue by which the community it though as a whole cake convened an interface and work together in concert with improving health and so the resource center to me is that place and that\nUm Everytime I go there I'm so happy and so proud because it is such a place you actually see people from all walks of life regardless of race regardless the socio economic status that convened together\nTo uh have better outcomes for themselves and their children and so when my grandson Bryson started attending the a baby and make class and um and see him sitting in that class\nWhich is really cute it had at\nAfrica he's the African American it had at Indian family Hispanic family all white families so really culturally diverse\nAnd see those babies enter facing and communicating and the moms you know also the peer support that is so critical to me\nUm and to just see that but to see my baby benefiting from that\nIs really touched my heart rate time that happens\nSo it's it's like it's come full circle for that's a good way to put full circle to see that full circle\nWell we thank you so much for

right into it we got ... kick he's a local mortgage expert contributor\nAnd that's really not what you have to do you actually have to be strategic about it you have to do and you have to know which sites that are going to benefit you the most ... three or four and just emphasize those things matter than trying to do every single site yeah\nAh restaurants are very good for picture so they would do well on Instagram and insurance\nBy a writer like myself I don't do picture so I don't I'm not on those sites\nAnd so and for mortgage things that he would need the poster are ways to\nGet a good credit I I mean ways to get a mortgage even though your credit is bad or\nAnd where you're just as close to snip it and then you can\nUm call for more information I mean that's what the whole purpose of sesame is any way to get them back to your website kind of a teaser right it's a teaser exactly people don't want a lot of information when they're hosting they want short and sweet a picture on video and then back to you with yeah so but it it\nDoesn't have to be overwhelming you just have to know how to do it yeah\nSo are you helping people with managing their social media as well\nAs I like to say that I'm a social media coach as opposed to managing it has I feel if I train them how to do it and that reduces their anxiety consider right and then they're more apt to do what they are supposed to be doing what\nEntrepreneur ours are meant to do yeah and selling those products that they are creating and things like that yes\nThere are programs you can utilize to schedule it you know the post ... worked from you know a lot of people say oh I don't have the time well how bad do you really want to make a hundred grand five hundred grand whatever that number is right so when you go to bed after you're done eating do you go to bed at eight o'clock nine o'clock or watch movies that are we so in other words what do you do in between seven and midnight friday\nOn a consistent they argue investing in your business\nAre you watching Netflix right now that it's so somebody's when people use that as like rarely you know how bad do you want it\nYes and my favorite is who we are for the scheduling right I just love that program so that I Know there's others that compete with it and\nUh and it is it gets spend ten minutes scheduling it and then you're done for the week and or you can find somebody that will uh ... I'm sure the ... posts for you and\nThen um do scheduling for you or that interests will be great for that right\nWe used to have in the way we need to get back on that we had some insurance from UT it was great I mean we have lots of help and they were they love to do it and he does that matter yeah I Know I just it just feels like it's the other side of the county that might [laughter] geez right here and there but when you look\nAt that and it's interesting too you're brought up to me I was just listening you know when I buy audio books I like to read listen to him or even you know once a year at least when I was listening to grand car known as section where he's saying you know the the talking about you know people used\nTo use me as what not to do when posting on social media\nAnd he said because he was posting too much to really watch too much just because I'm doing a lot and you're not doing anything like that stuff like that and then he also says you know you got to think of it like the Internet is you try to think of it like throwing rocks in the ocean are you really going to fill up the ocean\nNo so ... so that's his point it was like post often pose pose early and often all day long you know play much as you can and to and if people don't want to follow your they get tired of do pay delete me down right you know ... and\nYou shouldn't worry about what people are whether the reading it or not really want to do is it's brand new awareness you want to get your brand out in a place that people are noticing\nThat the brain or whatever and then people will say oh well what's your are all why on social media specialist it's really hard to track indirect right agenda racked and it's one of those things where yes I have close deals where they had referenced you know I Love senior stuff on Instagram post you know you're always posting you're putting out content I can tell your marketing your properties\nAnd it sets you apart from the other agencies and sat in this particular client\nWas one that was a member of one of these networking groups where you have to give the ... the business to the group they introduce me over there in group deal because of the expertise level and and the marketing level and and the difference in and exposure because the bottom line it comes down to you know for them money you know everybody comes down to money ...\nEverything comes down to money and I will say that I have gotten business from Lincoln yup but it's not my ... I'm not going to say oh that's where I'm getting all my business is from linked in I live now that I Hope some linked in and I will eventually get this is from ...\nAbout you what are you seeing them

we can make him feel so much better we and and women and we check or a a a range of lives that include estrogen and protests around\nAnd I certainly always check fibroids and um make sure that we have all the hormones balance\nYeah that's a that's such a big part of it I think\nIt's coming from a perspective of finding okay what's my baseline understanding that you guys are you know you're seeing a lot of different patients in in in the industry itself has a certain baseline like they know if you're just us drones at a two hundred level it really should be at a\nYou know eight hundred nine hundred or whatever that number is so by comparing yourself to what you're seeing our national numbers in and then you know like you mentioned a well you know certain things are out of line that could be potentially leading to a you know other disease that goods onset could come so it's preventative medicine\nAt a very her Bennett preventative and and symptom control\nRight right yeah so uh

than than any medical right on west shore office located on west short now do you offer consultations some type of a free meal for consultation or how does that process worked in the process\nYeah the ... the competition is absolutely free um we're always hopeful that the patient\nAt that point or at least the prospect of patient would want to have their labs drawn because that's the real indicator right of way no basically by looking at their intake forms when they fill out those symptoms that you know quite frankly brand and they're going to need help right if we get to labs that just helps confirm exactly whether a\nWrite in and once they go through that process there they're kind of in the environment they're more likely to move forward with the with the uh the bud labs\nAbsolutely very comfortable it's um you know we're dedicated to you know giving personal care to each patient and when you come in and you can feel that answer very very warm inviting or\nYeah yeah it it uh you
