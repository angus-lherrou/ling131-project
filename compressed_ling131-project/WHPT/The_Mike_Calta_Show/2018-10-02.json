five or eight hundred seven seven one one of your body or I Want to\nGive you an update on something ... okay yesterday we announced that\nFormer major league baseball player John crux was supposed to be on the show today and I was concerned I said you better not baby pay some may cause you guys have a long history where he said he wanted to beat you up and right now I like John crux or like them up until you actually\nUh I like him I think he's always I at first of all I as a good friend of a a David Wells I Love baseball players and the fat guy John ... was one of the fat heroes um but he was a good baseball player he's outspoken he was great I best damn sports show he's one of those guys are not afraid to speak his mind\nHe was a suffering from just to kill a cancer some years ago and beat it and good for him\nSo he is known as the guy with one has to go it was a big joke thing he went on Letterman and he talked about it and my ...\nAnd um I have been\nFor him to come on this show is the gas for almost Twenty years now right at one time Randy Moss and I got into an altercation in the locker room after a box game and that altercation made national news is just some years ago\nAnd that uh it was talked about on every station I did interviews for everywhere from Atlanta to national\nSporting news radio ESPN and it was a big deal and I was orchestrated by me in order to try and capitalize on the fact that Randy Moss was getting so much attention and he had an attitude problem and uh I you know that's what I did\nAnd John crux head on the best damn sports show who's this guy cow and I want to take him into a room alone for Fifteen minutes after the after the thing and beat them up and blah blah\nAnd it was funny and for years I've been hoping to talk to John crock about it not mad whatsoever that exactly what you want to come out of having an incident happened he won John correct to talk about your national\nSo he was due to come in here to promote some\nCheese steak restaurant that he has I couldn't care less about cheese steaks I think they're gross not his all of them that squeezed cheese they put on there it's not for me I just don't like it um you know there are some of the west or make somebody said gee steak with the with the provolone mushroom and you know what I mean but I I Philadelphia gee stages not my kind of thing\nI didn't care I wanted to let John ... come on the air to talk about his restaurant and we could talk about his life after baseball and so maybe some fellas that we have in common and then of course talk about the Randy Moss thing and have a good time\nLast night I tweeted out that Tuesday we would welcome former Philadelphia Philly best damage sports show host and Philly cheese steak salesman John ... in the studio\nSo then one guy said well we hear about his one testicle which is a quote from Letterman when he was\nComing on the Letterman show and leather instead to Paul Paul we hear about this one has to go right\nAnd I found that to be mildly amusing really non exciting so I wrote back to the guy what do you want to know if it's only like I I don't know whether you want to know about the man's testicle I had no interest in speaking the aristocratic\nAbout his boss\nSometime later John crock responds to both of us he said you both are classy people I guess cancer is a joking matter nobody's anything about cancer\nAnd he rode the popular one has to go wave for years it was one of the funny things that he talked about he went on shows and talked about it nobody can anyway cancer how much this showdown for kids or cancer over the last couple of yeah ah so I tend to just\nGeo who have been working on this interview for some time in these let's say shortly after that John crock canceled out on\nThis poor guy this PR guy that they hired hadn't been working on getting them in Studio for us for like a month and we finally if you're in and out of date and they were going to get up and drive up here from Naples or wherever he lives and we're very excited to have him around the red carpet Spanish or got into either right and\nNow a John crux of big fat baby he's not coming in here because of that yeah\nI'm Glad to hear that what's got to look out um so if if I knew he was the sense of plus he I wouldn't have wanted to come on the show anyway well here's the\nThing is okay so cancer is the reason the lots of one tactical and stuff but the guy was quoting Letterman the thing the Letterman sad\nBut I mean if he wasn't he was just being a dumb comment yeah\nBut also you didn't you were almost like you know we're not going to talk about it like I what do you want to know who hires and a a tweet\nTo John ... and I said if you couldn't tell that I was being sarcastic what that guy that brought up your one has to go come on I didn't say\nOh I Hope so maybe it'll show it to us I Want to eight did you hear we lost his first one cancer [laughter] yeah but in a jar oh my God [laughter] I ... I think families\nYou didn't want to get up early and come in the morning just finally finally ... sounds like a lego and for all you people who were like hey we should hire John crux of beer spokesmen and will invest our life savings and then he'll go out and promoted there you go 'cause I'm not going to I've never even at the place I Would imagine it's just fine I have no idea I don't even know where they are\nBut I won't go there anymore not that it was ...\nBut I'm just saying like I Can't bashed the place because I have ever been there and maybe the most delicious thing every new life but we'll never known way to go Jon way to take your investors money and crap all over 'cause they're too much of a sense of policy\nAnd then a nice way to burn a bridge to him and some guy sent me a current picture of him and said do you mean when it collapsed Brittany is quite large huh yeah he's a big ...\nWhen\nThey ... they probably went on I'm not going to go probably won't let them use the bathroom at the ah that as I say I was laid off because AIG close to do more offensive than fact [laughter] I called the clothes are gathering cold I don't know things are called like a rubber Kelly went to a child Britain yeah\nI mean absolutely that goes against our credibility yeah\nWhere are you can point out other cases where you're like well this happen here so\nI don't know I'm sure we're going to be hearing all about that\nA president Donald Trump insult to the female reporter and the rose garden on Monday telling her she quote never things before asking a question from called on to Celia Vega White House reporter for ABC News and this is how it went down we have some video on bone TV and some audio here check this out here we go\nQuestion yeah go ahead Jeff [noise] she shocked that I picked her in the state of shock [laughter] I'm not thinking of that sort of there and you're not thinking you never do no go ahead go ahead\nActually this weekend Mr President he said that if I'm correct in saying you're limiting the skill of the FBI application\nWhat does that have to do is read I don't mind answering the question but you know what I'd like to do the tree and the other headline in the news the Capitol I Know but you know how that talking about trade and then we'll get to that will do that a little\nBit later think anybody ever trade O'Hara train yellow passed through Congress her a I think so but you know if it doesn't we have lots of other alternatives just totally\nBulldogs are going to I mean does the bulldog Canada and the ... ... what she actually said was I'm not and then she was getting up from her seat she said thank you Mr President and the way she said it sounded like I'm not thinking I'm ...

I'm not I'm trying all I said was they could do more Spanish we have sixteen lines and all of them say Spanish is wrong except for one guy let's take that one call Ryan good morning\nYes sir so all I'm trying to say is the point is\nThat our that that Amazon can offer their folks are purposely taken away during the the little times after the sequel ours are built so they really don't give all these benefits they tried to make it better than it actually is way say they got ... million\nSo it's kind of like Walmart they do offer those benefits or the full time employees suffer but they mainly hire part time and email and oil and then they lay those people often they don't need them so they're not really paying as much as you'd like to say\nOh they're still giving you fit in dollars an hour later if you're a ... if you will pick up a retail job for the season in the mall you're not going to get Fifteen dollars an hour to do it\nRight right right it's not a real problem with the real\nProblem is that companies like him or Amazon at all in all these other huge corporation\nAnd this is what Spanish was really trying to get at is that those companies all use offshore bank accounts and other ways to update our tax system so that's what really needs to be addressed is that they're not paying us tax dollars which could help the families that Spanish is really trying to actually talk\nAbout hey you think you're going to try and tell me than Amazon berries all of their profits in Oregon and oh by the dodging\nTaxes yeah yeah just like apple but also it off and I had to pay Ireland and backpack\nAnd okay thing user but instead of Amazon raising minimum wage they could hire more fulltime employees and give them benefits because of the cars go back to what Ryan was saying they hire all these part time employees they're paying them more but they're only working\nThere working a lot less hours so really the company is saving money because they're not paying for the benefit do you hear if they actually hired full time employees it'd be more beneficial to\nWhat do you think of a hard time employee and I was on does go goalposts off off the shelf support\nI Know I actually know someone who works for Amazon or\nThe ... and what does he do he worked on the line so which means why do they put it in a in an envelope and pass them actually I\nUh boxing stacking like they do you think deserves for female listener oh okay that the ... but I don't understand but\nIt but then ... using ... Fifteen dollars an hour\nAnd ... but that's not what we're arguing were arguing that this company is coming out and saying we're doing this great thing for our seasonal part time employees but the reality is like I said earlier the studies that have been done on these families that are getting their wages increase nothing beneficial it's happening to them\nThe the the seasonal part time employees shouldn't even be brought into this because if you are looking for a seasonal part time job then it's not your career\nThat to Amazon hires first of all of the higher\nEnd all of their employees I'm ...\nThere's a lot of fulltime employees are a lot of managers there's a lot of different different uh people that work there and stuff yeah there are some sees on a part time stuff also I'd like to point out just by raising that so that Fifteen dollars an hour or say that there are three hundred and fifty thousand employees which is low end of what they have and stuff\nThat per hour they're paying out five million two hundred and fifty thousand dollars per hour but is it a bit that matters that they're paying that much ...\nMoney again yeah the bottom line to the company what I'm saying is to me the employees are more important than the company and what I'm trying to argue is that like I said the studies that have been done about these families show that that the majority of these things for seasonal part time employees\nDon't benefit them because they cut their hours they don't give them any benefits and then they had\nA let me read the headline real quick here according to ... and this is breaking news from CNBC dot com Amazon raises minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour for all us employees not just ... not there is a minimum I haven't had any of\nThe art of I mean I Know what the headlines and but we all know the headline but headlines are made to grab your attention they're not all the time the most accurate\nAmazon and and CEO Jeff Bezos has been facing criticism for its pay disparity\nThe new minimum wage will benefit more I'm more than two hundred and fifty thousand Amazon employees so that means fifty thousand of them or even this is being ... including part-time temporary employees and a hundred thousand seasonal employees so three hundred and fifty thousand of their employees\nTo a hundred and fifty thousand of which\nAre their regular a full time employees will benefit from this okay\nSo the hundred thousand part-time temporary employees that they answered it to your question is don't take the the they become a full time employee and if it's not getting in there\nGo somewhere else I don't I don't like my my argument are arguing\nIs based on you are saying that it's not benefiting the people as much of the company would like to say and as I say if you don't want to go or somewhere else the company is voluntarily doing more to help the employees that they have\nI I agree with that they're doing more to help the plays that they do have but if you're going to be Amazon you beat your chest about raising it to Fifteen dollars they're there can be more that can be done this goes for Apple because there are a lot of big corporations that when they're CEOs retired but given away or a million dollars\nAnd we we live in a in a in a society where it's built on capitalism and the ... the idea is to we're not we're not socialist we're not here to hell am I rarely\nI'm aware but the middle class I Would you agree that the middle class has been shrinking over the years and that that this economy is the best it's been in forever and at that middle class might be growing a little bit\nGrowing in one aspect is that it's\nI mean the ... the people that you would say or lower middle class are are now becoming ... real middle class to hire me laugh so\nWith that being said I'm I'm appreciative that Amazon is going out of their way to maybe be a trend setter that other companies will follow but to make that middle class what it was back in the eighties and nineties everybody needs to do more and I will never stop trying to fight for everybody\nI mean here's the uh the economy is completely different you know time change as time to go out and stuff do roll your eyes on me because that's the most annoying thing in the world we're trying to have a discussion\nSo is Jeff Jeff Bezos should do all this stuff he should do all this up more and more and more you spend thirty dollars on Taco Bell\nYou just said that the other day you know thirty dollars could feed for a family of four for a week that's what some people spend so why are you doing more what do you mean why and why are you doing more clearly you can afford to do more in your life what do you do to help out other people you want Jeff Bezos do all this stuff\nWhat are you doing I'm not thirty dollars on Taco Bell give that to a family that needs it I'm not really an air and I really I didn't pay money all the homeless fired all of the five million two hundred and fifty thousand dollars per hour but he's giving extra\nBut he's giving you could afford to get thirty dollars he's a billionaire he can do that millions your a thousand there you can afford to get thirty dollars for a week a\nSocialist Bernie Sanders is Amazon's worth one trillion dollars bays those is worth a hundred and fifty five billion dollars thousands of Amazon workers have to rely on food stamps Medicaid in public housing to survive that is not\nAmazon's falls I agree that in the Amazon is that is not Amazon providing them you're talking to anybody who lived through the depression they would've been thrilled to death to have this job where they are getting Fifteen dollars an hour in that case four dollars an hour or whatever would have been\nA more that they're not they're very grateful to have the opportunity to work it should not be the responsibility of Amazon or any other successful company to have to take care of the rest of the world that's not how this world operates\nOkay I I disagree I if you have the means\nI'm not I'm not mad at you know but I I\nIt seems the you look like you'd think that I'm going to start yelling at you and I'm a I'm not but
