I didn't anticipate\nOh why oh why you know I have your money I'm not I'm not about trying to Rob no no no I'm not a\nPolicy but I did not anticipate the franchise throwing up the white flag in just you know packing up for the season I don't think they did I think I'm I'm now ... I I told you this earlier\nAnd it showed that you're back to those too and I can hear him laugh all the way down the hall but you watch fifty take them to the playoffs now and then they make movies about the steam know by the movies about this year the year ...\nThe quarterback nobody wanted ended up here they give you never going to play and he ended up getting a second chance to go in and take some moves your boy it's like that movie they made about Dennis Quaid about the race\nOr the rocky rocky there already almost mathematically out of the playoffs\nI don't know that that's going to happen but I don't know whether they're necessarily putting up the white flag as much as they are putting it in the hands of the guy that they think has a better chance to win with the team\nMaybe this year yeah but it then that's your damage is done downright James has done I think so yeah he's easily I'll be gone yeah you know we have ah any great they they take the a quarterback who is scored more touched Down syndrome or yards in franchise history than anybody else and just throw him out\nOf your ... or ... geniuses scored more touched Down syndrome or yards at any quarterbacking bucks branch\nI okay I Would say I would a ... as much time and he surpasses Davis\nGave them as much playing time no surprise um whether you wind up another [laughter]\nI mean James he he's one of the only quarterback separates over four thousand yards with a box so I mean it took forty years to get this guy I'm sure we'll get somebody great right back in their\n... on the next week we're going to have somebody agreeing there and his name was Brian Fitzpatrick\nHere's the thing though that I don't understand is you can say all the different stuff about he does this and these ... he's not winning games man no you're not winning games it doesn't matter about your stats if your\nThe worst passing quarterback in the world but you're great at hand it off and doing shovel basses during those screens and you guys win games you're like All right\nWell this is working we're fine with it I'm just bomb that now what potentially was a franchise quarterback then we finally took forty years to get is now looking like it's pretty much over so that now we're back at square zero you know\nI think if the box wind up getting a quarterback with the backing up a great quarterback right now it has a little bit of playing time and they can get that that guy who's been in the league for a couple of years I think that's the way they go I don't think they need to go and drafted\nI like to bring up another little Maine are you a journeyman quarterback who found his way easier that guy's name is Brad Johnson and everybody said it right and so I can use what's he gonna do a he was brought here to take this team to the Superbowl now granted to be friends took him to the Superbowl but Brad Johnson is want to do such a quest to make them when\nThe super bowl he's three twenty three interceptions which is more than James ever thrown into season\nYeah but you know what they got Super Bowl rings true find a way the one that went on the way to when they had a great defense ... you know and he wasn't eating W so I mean you know and he didn't have it and I think the ads were ruined it I think ... yeah ... yeah he didn't and now they don't have any more he ate 'em all\nI think the suspension is what the real all this uh I Know but the the yet and it was like what the hell is going yeah they just there's no defending that but you I think you can come back from that he's still played well after that the suspension being out for all the time that that that that time clearly that mess with his head\nWhile uh all I Know is fits she will be there now will fits you win this weekend no\nHere's an opportunity to do ... who were playing the Panthers ... I Will take a double or nothing but if you would like hold onto your money a lot of their mind I'll give you a little news about it\n\n\n\n\nI said gee will a women's game and you will have to pay me two hundred dollars or we can go ahead and just pay me now I'm a myth that you're you're just a string of losers\nWhen I got home last night I was already called them a whole by my wife ah has you know it was ... she always tells me not to bet on things because I always always [laughter] you're ... you're the father James White\nEugene ... you have nobody to blame but your cells and listen to this is why didn't gamble on the cruise 'cause I I'm horrible idea if you just keep doubling nothing bad some with Mike as famous as mentioned earlier when it'll just be wiping clean\nWhat he said you double\nOn the line is a minus six point five for the Panthers right now so the\nPanthers a very good guy lost two games also thing works\nThat James wings and are being out of the loop will make the team stronger and make them want to play harder and my gut feeling tells me that a riot fitzpatrick believe this team to victory so much willing to bet a hundred dollars\nYou've got the three and four buccaneers taking on the Carolina Panthers at Carolina no less a the Panthers or five until the lightest added a minus six point\nFive so\nJail I just don't have the right if it's Patrick ... ah gee what your money where your ... I Can't do it but you said you\nIs ridiculous she was making a joke and it should be allowed to be able to make jokes as day and age she was being so ridiculously obvious in this situation I've got to be honest with you I don't\nThink people are really making a big deal about it and saying that she's raises their just say it was she made a joke it was saying to me three times since this morning Hillary Clinton make racist jokes that look or to reach us hypocrites Hillary Clinton is\nThat's what I'm getting from people by the way I meant to go back and listen because I don't think that are making Kelly ever said black face but everything that everything is printed it's like a black face kind of a black guy that I wouldn't understand that situation of Tony burned and point out that they were looking for ... or whatever what it is rhetoric\nSpeaking and get rich getting rid of people box coach dirt cutters that Ryan Fitzpatrick will start at quarterback Sunday at Carolina instead of former number one over all draft pick Jamie It's Wednesday and ...\nIt's not my nature to change quarterbacks he said er during his weekly press conference the coach dead\nI said this is really about we have to do a better job of protecting the football ah Winston through for interceptions one in the end zone and another uh the bangles return for a touchdown and the box thirty seven to thirty four loss in Cincinnati on Sunday\nFitzpatrick who led the box to a two and one record during Winston three game suspension to start the season came off the bench Sunday to rally Tampa from a a Eighteen point the second half deficit\nSo one time they asked for jurors are put in the hall of fame I Do yeah I remember that not not famous\nKnown known that his magic ... they also asked for his beard and I'm Talking about\nThe same off [laughter] them altogether like that [noise] ah I really\nWish you guys would have made that double nothing that would have made him but otherwise it's always so much more exciting when there's betting on at eight o'clock Israel's wife and see if I'm going to do that yeah that would be as you know just like to do to get this hundred dollar bike or speaking of the NFL the first coaching change of the NFL season came down just hours after Sunday's a week eight action\nThe Cleveland Browns have fire both head coach Hugh Jackson and offensive coordinators Todd Hayley the team announced on Monday defensive coordinator Gregg Williams is set to take over as interim coach a while running backs and associate head coach Freddie Kitchens was elevated to offensive coordinator for the kitchen yeah\nFor the kitchen a move it up he is now upstairs bathroom [laughter] good for him I this\nIs kind of a weird story and tell me whether you think there's anything wrong with it whether it's weird a lesbian couple in taxes wanted to have a baby and their fertility doctor\nFigure it out a way for both of them to carry it OK both of the lesbian women couple to carry the baby different times one woman would carry the fertilized egg for five days while the embryo started develop than they would remove it an implanted into the second woman where she would carry it for the whole nine months\nTheir names are blessed in ... ah actually and it's the first time this has ever been done a you can see them up on bone TV there and that this is them talking about the situation\nI wanted to be pregnant for so long and so bad I'll even want to have a child I just didn't want to carry a child but he got\nThe uh Emery all off to an early start you know the extra fertilizing her body are my favorite time five days later we were meant that divide since I moved from Hama five hand from the time like it's a really life right now\nIt's time for five days and was a big part of the nation and then I came here for nine months down by a really special friend about that I that we that were involved and she she got to be a part of it and I got to be a part of that\nOne ... to people who will inevitably say you're playing five not how God intended for things to happen and this is wrong\nWell I read that Lincoln took great with someone high from far from family children a loving relationship in a ...\nIn our world\nOK so first of all anybody that said to me I'd be like well soon as you could prove to me that God exists then you can understand how God science really mad at each other\nOr and second of all it seems like a big waste of time to me but then again I'm not at the parent I'm not a lesbian so if I uh if it meant a lot to me to carry the baby then I okay it's quiet yeah you're messing with science you're you're expanding on science you're doing something now\nThat uh you you probably couldn't ooh twenty right\nI think as long as you're not a putting the baby's health in any kind of a danger anything like that it's ... I don't know obviously this is the first time they've ever done it so it may be a dangerous process so that may be something\nWhere you go Mm I don't know whether you want to do that seemed like they weren't too concerned with it like a very they did it at work and there was the baby was healthy your outlook towards that next story is cure for cancer right right the Oregon at it now they don't have that were just switch immersion baby or play\nWere playing three card Monte you as a baby and lesbians now yeah [laughter]\nWell he's got it was one guy was which one's got the baby and in a [laughter]\nA there is a fifty eight year old guy named Frank step or read a and he's a Republican in the New Hampshire state house of representatives he's in his seventh term and he's running for reelection next week\nBut he just had a serious road Bob because at thirty eight year old porn producer named Jonathan Carter on valley just sued him according to Jonathan he and Frank made a deal to produce porno and Frank\nWas the star Frank about TV\nIt looks like a porn star done anyway Eric I'm not going to have you on a a back in June he flew to California and filmed his themes are but he was really unhappy\nWith how they turned out probably because it showed as ugly face ... so the next day he went to Johns in house and punched him in the head oh the semi valley police decided not to press charges\nBut Jonathan is seeking an unspecified punitive damages and his lawsuit I and he says he has the tapes showing Frank in the porn to prove that it happened\nAs for Frank he's claiming it's an ... extortion attempt and quote I don't know what you're talking about I thought we were all done going after men\nSuch a let's realize that if you got a history of doing porno movies you're probably not going to hold office\nThen yeah it's not going to happen usually yank now it's just it's not it's you're it's eventually it's going to come back out and they're going to embarrass wherever supported you fight not divulging them information right now this guy's in seven term though even the senator I can do it guys ... [laughter]\nI Know but I'm just saying like you know that eventually it's gonna come back out it's like when you're stealing from work and you steal a dollar they actually feel two dollars keep going you're going to get caught eventually and you're like oh it's been like six months nobody even knows they'll know eventually you're going to get caught wasn't\nThere in a tally and checked it was a A N\nPorn and they actually was a random for all of us in one yeah and one yeah she was in there yeah so ... now but it also in\nEurope there are certainly different with their views oh yeah yeah it's you know um there was something else or maybe the oh I watch\nI Love John Oliver I watch last week tonight or last night yeah he is so God damn funny that show is so well right and you don't have to agree with anything except the difference between ... I I Can't watch Bill Maher because it's not only do I not agree with him and he says\nBut I don't think he's funny I think he's smarmy and I think he's arrogant and I don't think he's right John Oliver he's just funny and the way they present things is is funny they had last night uh what is the plural of a state attorney general\nPlural of\nState attorney general each state as attorney general the collectively they're known as what\nWill the attorney general counsel no they're they're the plural version of state attorney general state's attorney general uh no it's it's each individual state\nBut it's actually I'll tell you what it is it's state attorneys general okay I thought it'd be state attorney general's not state attorneys general okay anyway they was a big deal as when I was I had a fire oh I'm In fact and they pointed out that they have a guy\n[laughter] but they had been video of him or stealing another guy's thousand dollar pen a guy's pen got caught in the uh in the screening thing going through the metal detector and they've they've forgotten one of them may have video him going back and feeling the guys\nBut really it's just it's so much mall bussing

is what's called the victims proper years and years ago\nVictims can call in and say look you know nothing happened\nOr you know we we were you know drinking or partying and it was a you know we didn't mean to call was an accident you know there's a variety of different excuses and state's attorney's offices would go ahead and dismiss the charges dropped the charges based on that victims proper and then what happened is\nA someone got hurt you know they they were dropped the charges and an attack ensued and because of the victims proper or somebody I I think I heard that so a lot of the prosecutor's office to stop doing that and they said no no we're we're going to have\nA little bit more investigation to read and what exactly is going on to protect citizens of the community whether it's in the mail or the female 'cause I've represented males where they're the victim of domestic violence as well as female or\nAnd that's the issue that your attorney is dealing with it they're just not going to say okay this is going to say didn't happen we're going to drop the case because they don't know if your aging lunatic\nAnd so they're ... and you as well as the kids in this scenario that you have in the household to make sure that nothing like this allegedly happens again there is no violence that would continue in the home let your lawyer hired your lawyer to do that you hire may\nKnow ... wrong it's terrible [laughter] I'm not going to say about that when you have a if you do need to hire um a three to five one five five five zero or ask Saddam dot com\nAnd you could do it that way a shell yard dash down when he got to show\nAll get along all on my head and ... on ... for ... for a ... he died hostile straight\n... on the top ... ... and ...\nSay it's got to be Paul counting the ending of fourteen years old and now you know Neal [laughter] All right well let me ask you this what was the technical violations ... it's so it's not a new car here and there okay usually it's the so for folks listening when it when you're when you're on probation and it's a technical violation\nThat means you did it here to some terms technically of probation so you ... you ... did you didn't report curfew or the callers suggested a dirty urine or some type of positive tests yield\nThose are technical violations um actual violations are if you go out and commit a new crime or the that is not deemed to technical violation so how many prior violations technical or otherwise man\nHad he did he have four okay so this is his fifth\nViolation of some kind while on probation and the ... but his violation of probation did they say look you know is it a suspended sentence next time you come in you're going to get the hammer what they say you know on the\nFour hammer that's what we call it you'll get the hammer or Georgia all day long did they say that in a in the fourth time\n... well he was on her face all so I can they can solve all now in\nA while but I mean you control is is a higher as a higher level of probation quite frankly yes I Know yeah\nSo you know here's here's the deal or if you want to appeal that um or ask for re hearing that's got to be done within a thirty days or ... or ... or is that you know you want a father with or how long ago with its\nOwn\nWall old all set convert\nThe old dog up to our audience than\nThe end of August ... well usually you have a re hearing ... within you know within a month or an appeal within a month or re hearing your father hearing within ten days you can have it you know shortly thereafter would appeal within thirty so ah outside of that there's gotta be some other evidence or information that has come up and was not address the time of the violation probation hearing\nI don't know if you heard about the whole drive in Polk County they were putting them in\nA legal work what do you mean there is an attorney\nIn the mail and and and the legal if the the the mail that comes in is legal mail and there are allegedly putting drugs in what legal documents\nWell well ... the attorney unbeknownst to her leg at a now Sam drives it sound legal papers now they are I don't have ... they had to drive\nIn the paper what okay and his attorneys will that ... that she said she didn't know about it\nAll right well I don't know how that relates to the dirty urine I I mean you know I\nKnow that but I'm just saying that I ... attorneys are a lot ... so\nShe and I understand that but you're still have a dirty urine you that regardless of what I paid for it whether regardless of what the attorney was doing you know the less you want to challenge the test of the urine sample that would that would be a different argument I don't know what kind of defense ...\nMaybe ... thought that\nWell it affected us this is the council's interesting because you'd have to go back and see the hearing transcripts exactly what they did as a defense um now again that that's an interesting concept because you're dealing with a technical violation so the evidence to the state has the court's going to rule on that might be independent you know regardless of the attorneys conduct\nHowever and effective assistance of counsel is something that you actually can look into\nIt is it is an issue um and if you lie I mean you know I I don't do appeals but a bill ... does that ever since so if you want to contact the office they give\nYou information to build a lady had won three to five one five five five zero or after ... calm\nAnd ah you can always get him on Twitter at ... show tomorrow

it's all going on Friday nights we want to be a part of a you better get on and now let's go to the highlight of walking back to the show you know I'm a DJ from the Connors and Roseanne Michael Fisher Michael how are ya\nI'm good how are you this morning I'm\nGreat now it seems like we just talked to a couple of weeks ago when the show was coming back and now we have a new name a slightly different cast and uh the classic Connor Roseanne Halloween episode airs tonight\nYet and I would be a big one I waited a long time to get a little bit of how can I really enjoy\nHim and tell you right now I made no bones about it on the show have Halloween hate The Simpsons Halloween I have a blood aid skeletons Roseanne a Halloween to some of the funniest goddamn shows ever\nA good if you liked it costumes and you like people going after what how\nDo they got pranks David ... it's always been really good how's the how's the momentum with the ...\nWell off they're really good you know um last week I was standing on\nA lot of dividing education even it at work\nFor a lot of baseball fan right we're fighting night\nYou're going to get your Halloween very yeah very real Halloween with a lot it allows you gonna how Halloween to change a little bit punished that honors remade all in all luckily we kind of have this transition as we start moving\nTowards ... a little bit you're going to get a lot more ... case boy with his life and how they work and I think they may or may not have been well what is life goes away\nOh like that um we're talking to Michael ... who is DJ on a Roseanne and Connors and or the show I I heard is off to a great START I I thought I don't know I don't know I I thought the way that uh there was handled with\nRosanna character a dying and a damn going after the lady that supposedly gave her the pills I thought it was a little bit more real than I have expected but I thought I was a smart move to handle I handle it that way when do you get the call\nWhen you get the call whether like hey by the way we're back in action again\nWell you know I\nThink that'd be really rapidly will show no one imagined it off when they really don't think they can make [noise] we came back and then you can just go straight into it and I think there's a level of\nSteel exactly how we deal with these characters really belong to the audience if this show\nAnd you have Thirty years of history but you know ... why do we say the thing is and why we feel the way we always kind of like everything out and buying everything a lot of people the only\nI time zone you when I was a kid or not a kid when I was younger in the nineties\nAnd I watched Roseanne its heyday\nIt was never I never related to it about the family I my parents were divorced I wasn't like you know he went and watch it for the family atmosphere watching for the real type or storylines that you're related to you and I really I Lived with my girlfriend at the time\nAnd I really related to Sarah Gilbert character in her and her boyfriend and how the parents didn't want them together on the road so the showing me it was it was what you're saying we've never really about\nJust won a character it's about the each individual stories of going through your do your lives and I think what having that whole cast there\nAnd now and you let you kinda foreshadowed this before the season of Roseanne started when we had you on the show and you said that that they were going to be some things that happened with the day's character that we're going to manifest itself in later episodes I'm Glad that that they're sticking with that and that's happening now\n... ... ... ... ... ... how do you explain well\nWe'll see if we could turn the writers you know it's really important you know from the military and there's a life only\nYes but my island Robin plays my wife on the show also comes from a family to try and tell us a little story being a veteran of those things were really awful about but also in a racial having racial child\nOnly giving of view of what country in the world when they look like how you know\nAnytime you're in a relationship relationship cross culture here in\nThe way that your family and their family and all the people in your life together that's really what shapes a world in many ways to be able to\nKeep away we don't have to run away from everything I think it's one of the will show well damn Conn I started to date at some point\nYou know we haven't broached that topic I you know that's gonna be up to the writers you know for me it's too fresh out I mean I'm I\nHave to go forward and that's one of those things that that show is never ran for anything but I think we can think of the stuff out everything else was it was always knew\nI was saying earlier I think that um\nI I you know the cast is strong enough but eventually just like in Roseanne\nYou you've got zeros and mother and you've got to see a darling boyfriends and I'm not I'm Sorry the the Jackie's boyfriend I Believe me and you know in bringing new characters enrollees changes dynamic of the show and I think eventually if you find somebody who can come in and play Dan's Grover and I think that'd be hilarious\nUh this is Michael fishermen he is DJ tonight is the legendary a Halloween episode for the counters which is I I'm curious yeah I was going to play out 'cause usually Dan\nAnd version Roseanne are the two of them versus the kid and it'll be good to see how that plays out this is the classic Halloween if you love the show you know what I'm Talking on\nA well look I'm Glad things are American action\nYeah what's that [noise]\nI think well tonight the cars are going to do it right people are definitely going to get a real old fashioned Halloween\nRight I'm looking forward to a good to talk to you again I'm Glad you guys are ah are still doing this show\nThank you very much a pile take it easy [noise]\nHe's a good guess but that phone systems and [laughter] very Andrea ... is a guy I weigh three seconds to get a response from anyway um yeah I mean I'm town right now you\nHave you not seem you not know about the holiday inn episode now how does the owner really know how to a lot of good a lot of good I'm as bone pranks on each other and trying to them trying to for Roseanne ... they could\nNever get or gives you always ready but then they would finally get our minds they actually pretty funny stuff a lot of hand and the and the blender accidents and things like that a lot of blood Amish right so now it'd be great if they have some sort of Roseanne prop that they are and\nSome ... van Gogh zombie yeah they have Roseanne come and do\nSome sort of cameo you know what I mean or or even make it look like it's her\nAnd like a long lost sister another or do do it goes you know\nA man [laughter] put her on the board did like a scale again like Iran's hair opening darn it crazy because\n[laughter]\nYou can look or they you\nKnow you
