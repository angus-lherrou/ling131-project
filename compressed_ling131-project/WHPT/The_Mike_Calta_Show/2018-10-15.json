T let's start with the most important one they may know what it is down shall love\nThy neighbor no ... no that's when we were only recommend man um they'll always I I Will not lie no I Want to honor no other God's before okay so you're ... a lot but I Am the lord your\nGuard God you know other God's beside so weak telling you ran out of the gate you will worship only me you'll prayed to only me

God's beside me\nAnd then the first thing they did was start to fame and other people who should we should force I seem to me it's a violation of the right down alley I'm Out I think he's violating his own no he didn't he didn't say it even tell you that changes something to that but that's why religion so messed up\nSo stay say Jesus was real and Jesus was the son of God and he came down here to give everybody a message and that message was at my dad's\nGetting pretty pissed off of you guys let me tell you what the rules are first one no other jobs which I Know they've been bringing the rule I don't eat the apple first thing yeah but you know\nThat's also that's how I think they are I mean that's the tail or even though they have to do the other so that's about temptation yeah evil or ... but in this one like this when they're like ... like not only are we going to worship other people but we're going to keep the name of them in a minimum and name and\nI saw that Adam and Eve the first people to not be able to understand the apple contract [laughter]\nYeah you get a leg I'm Out I'm all for high fiving Jesus but I don't understand all the\nRight well there's always next year maybe this will be good we'll see what that right now I'm sure you probably saw this on social media fifty three year old woman has caused an outrage after calling the cops on a young boy using him as sexual assault\nDid you see that's no surveillance footage of the incident shows the child reportedly age nine accidentally brushed past the woman in a convenience store in Brooklyn\nThe woman is white the kid is black\nAnd ... pastor big problem well I'll show you first video of this lady white lady very New York very\nTall and the cops about this kid he sexually assaulted me that's what you're saying we have a video on bone TV check this out here we go [noise] why\nI I don't blame them yeah he has he didn't know that her yeah that's what I can\nHandle a ramp mine they unless they have no she\nSaying the son grabbed my ass and now the mom is yelling at her okay he is very nah you know kind of lady thing whatever alright okay would you like to see the ah security that show how far\nI Would believe that woman because she saying I Will not be violated ... you will not grab by yeah\nThat is a young boy who looks like he's I don't know maybe nine I think oh it's a kid yeah it requires a nine year old kid a sexual assault she's charging against them now here's the security camera footage or in the actual convenience store there is a woman she walks up there now there's the kid walks by law do you got to where the backpack\nYeah the backpack somebody said something and he turned in his backpack rubs the answer and then look at her but I used to actually out at me ...\nYeah and she even after seeing this video footage said no I don't believe he grabbed it you grab that indeed yeah then after everything\nBlew up and stuff she wound up apologizing the kids said that it didn't happen and stuff but meanwhile she used a nine year old and you know and again you can rewind it I'd like\nTo see it again or just to make sure there are a little more a little more to go by now it's no they're already passed a regular up a little bit more\nThis is this is overhead shot ... over the counter I mean you can clearly see everything that happens I hold on here you know you've got to go about technology yep there you go All right I just never the counter he walks his\nMom saying something to him he's got something in his right hey ... and his other hand he sold his mom's hand [laughter] yeah so it was clearly the backpack rubbed against her but she said sexual assault I mean look if he was a\nIf he was a teenager or older I can understand maybe why for a second as you were a kid yeah yeah I take a look we also have a picture of the lady like a good picture of her look at this lady man she I think why you have to deal with is that so I'm going to go

having a bad year ... all adamant about it though I was sexually assaulted no I Know a white woman calling on a black kid eh so we found out years racist yeah\nAnd she's quick to pull the trigger right exactly so there you go I make sure you have all the facts before you go back out there and so even after she saw the video she was like no no no then finally I think enough people guiding her and said this looks really bad for ya because clearly it was the ...\nOr an anonymous letter led Michigan inspectors to find badly decomposed remains of eleven infants\nHidden in a ceiling compartment

her but I did do that with Rob yeah\nYeah okay let's get to know I'm Glad you didn't it and it's very interesting I don't know who's\nThe worst person or I Would say wouldn't be here it would have been at a at CBS yeah yeah there was this one lady who I\nCan't remember her name right now Rita she worked on ... show and she was God awful she was God awful\nAnd they couldn't do anything about it

[laughter]\n\nI\nWas I just got attacked from somebody that's interesting we'll talk about it I'm Sorry about that [laughter] they asked me why I didn't tell them somebody was the garbage person but I'm confused on who the person is\nOh yeah I don't know what to say oh no no no one has a say on they're not at all but will\nThat you'll tell us how fair yeah okay well I don't know why it is I like to Rob I don't know I don't either but I didn't like I don't know how you are so blind to it but I wasn't blind\nTo it there are certain there's sometimes there's things that are better for the show and that's my main priority right I mean\nBut he wasn't good at all a soldier I ain't good hitters are yeah they are looking guy but he was a good producer and having pretty much got lazy fucking yes\nUh-huh that's an old producer does Harman I'm aware\nI Know but there were other things he was good at and like why he was good at at his producer skills about keeping things in the beginning he was and then I kind of all just kind of fell off I think once a comedy things started I think that ruined every uh well\nI think he also wasn't getting any sleep I remember at one point to sleep in here and I ... I Know but I mean just like mentally you know that'll that'll wear you down real quick but actually if you have to have a thick skin in here and you can't the mentally you wrap your head around that and then I ...\nAt the comedy like ... if you if this is your number one priority it was not and but that's the thing like you said when he first came here it was ... he was a good producer but then when he started the comedy thing and he started picking up other things this was no longer is number one priority which may\nAll he was one of those people will Harvard bad feelings and let them blow up yeah you can't do that I Can't do that and always sneaky snake yeah oh and nearly yeah yeah\nI'd I don't I don't tolerate that at all you can't just be all became you know what I mean you certainly don't steal from your friends you know I don't feel from a guy who gives you everything\nThat we were saying maybe just and he was asked for the things that he did pay\nGoes through your Spanish how many times do I not want anything like that I Love it yeah I Do for this so many times\nHere's the way you're talking the way you're moving all\nAside and he goes I used earlier today a a a a by the way ... breaking news oh Steve early just touched me yeah to\nKeep the car right now I don't want a now may have to come out [laughter] did you buy at traverse yeah just given that one back and keep the one that a body had ... ah [noise]\nAh so heavyweight champion ... you know him or the ... Wilder yes I Do know him he was in ... issued an apology for something that happened I'm going to show you the video first and this is what he's apologizing Florida those balls was hot ... says I'm On TV here we\nGo and look at them I'm going to say I don't know nothing about you and say hey wait and see on ESPN when I get up and said that I get up and said well I'll tell you I don't know [laughter]\n...\nOh yeah there is a whole a whole lot of not his fault one hundred percent you know the guy told me he\nTold him to do it but he is also the heavyweight\nChampion you have these looking pattern to it so what's happened is there's a mascot on that and the guy says\nThe ... the heavyweight champion and any pets or the mascot like the show it's padded out all that had hit I\nThink what he was doing was patting the stomach saying like you can punch them here you can punch him here why does it matter to you on the wilds doesn't speak the language and he didn't punch straight on a punch to the side OK broken knows for sure that's a broken job yeah tell me to\nPunch something I'm part [laughter] he did Well Google [laughter]\nLeave I it was an eye\nOn the guy who was inside the mascot thing broken job no way all real yeah the Wilder has issued an apology to the man inside the mascot catch him he ... on the SPN show the heavyweight champion was encouraged to demonstrate his punching punching power by striking the mascot\nOn ESPN Now nest young ah he said quote I sincerely apologize to pray for him there was injured\nIf this is true Wilder wrote on Instagram while they're also hit back at reports that said he didn't realize there was a man inside the mascot about other than a lady tall are you a quick waiting a VW Rio champion who is on beating then forty routes\nOr fight former heavyweight champion Tyson theory in Los Angeles on December the guys you get a rematch for yeah [laughter]\nHe invited this guy he said he wants to give and take it through his fight and stuff yeah are you there and be like yeah I mean but here's the thing if you're the heavyweight champion even if you're not even if you're just a normal person who's been on earth for I don't know ten years you would go\nAll right well I don't want to kill this guy ... and it was harder to other kinda he had a I mean you look at how he had some back about Joe ... show that he took a couple of steps and then followed through Ellis watches\nThat I had a hard enough that it's not hard to build it up\nAnd tell me I'm the heavyweight champion greatest in the world and point to something I'm supposed to ponds are not expect me to ...\nUh we will put that on the face that poor man inside [laughter] I ...\nI speaking with sports if you're interested in law baseball the Dodgers beat mirrors Saturday Night to even the er and I'll see asked at one game of peace and the red Sox defeated the Astros\nTo even the ALCOA I said one game of peace I I you know he's ... he's a baseball and then when they are due to return a and then a new report says it Aaron Hernandez\nWas physically and sexually abused as a child also did you see the other part what that he uh it's now come out that he had a sexual relationship\nWith his high school quarterback yeah how yeah how he had been a poor guy was gay and I feel bad more guy was gay and\nHe had also been a a torch I'd like I'd be honest I don't remember what Aaron Hernandez went to jail for a it was a mariners writer right but I didn't want to do it to somebody else do it or why I don't really remember the story gang related or something like that\nNo it was like her his sister's boyfriend okay well I only know what the reasons why it was like a family relations\nBut anyway my whole point is is that here's here's what I always say this is this is red and people want to know why or why you can't make gay jokes because of this because people are afraid to come out and they lived their whole life\nOr in secret and then as a result of that they're miserable and they take on other people when they do drugs and they get crazy yeah this guy this guy was gay and he\nCouldn't even be gay and it definitely probably added to his family during the two thousand Thirteen offseason Hernandez was arrested and charged with murder of\nOld Lloyd a semi professional player who is dating the sister of Hernandez is fiance\nFollowing his arrest he was immediately released by the patriots ... he was found guilty of first degree murder and two thousand Fifteen incentives to serve life in prison\nWithout the possibility of parole or and then of course he wound up killing himself he was found dead in the south or which was ruled as suicide listen I'm ... I I Know this\nIs a harder thing to do them in and do you do for me to say you're not in the position but there should be one of those motivate motivating things that makes a guy who is teetering on whether or not he should come out that's that's popular like in the NFL popular right like Tom Brady Pablo I'm not saying I'm ready\nBut ah she'd come out at the height of their popularity and say up and guess walk like also gay like oh now that I'm ... you know one question right but the thing is is that your that's almost insulting gives you assume old up outcomes gay gives you a blond hair and he\nDamned no because he's been seen with guys like very cozy\nIn the hot tub with the yeah the he also got arrested for trying to pick up hookers so yeah yeah but\nDid he do that did he purposely no right I think gay stories because it's been like human scene at the client\nYour oh del back I'm One of the greatest receivers in the game in marketing number one and you come out and go and guess what I'm gay market number one loves you first of all New York loves a gay guy and the fact that he's so good and care what you're saying\nThere's a certain ah I mean a lot of them endorsements ... other players wouldn't be getting that you know anything about that oh short I mean look at Nike right away will come on now like a brave\nNew player but I mean there's a lot of uh products that aren't necessarily for the straight football guide whatever that they'd be like oh this will be perfect for us to have this guy you know maybe it'll ...
