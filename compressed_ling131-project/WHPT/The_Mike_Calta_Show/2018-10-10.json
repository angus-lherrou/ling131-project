I've heard good what are you going to be [laughter] people that know nothing to do with\nNot ... but I Want to tell you the people that know know that even if it would be dynamite and you know and then be accused of nepotism if you can have it right I think if I'm going to be read up on that doesn't mean you you know and I figure because it'd be abusive nothing [laughter]\nEven though I'm not sure there's anybody more confidence in the world but that's okay but we are lucky that numerous people\nSo if I'm hearing that write a bonkers [laughter]\nDid somebody say to him how body bronco or does he just throw it out even that I've heard of ... I was like did you do that I Am I think it's kinda like whatever the ban goes uh we'll take requests we heard the clash already knew they were in the clash but I mean but it sounded like he uh was like I heard a lot of names and reason as long as he's like I've heard of aren't good\nOr do I live here let's see if we can hear is there is a noise in the background you here's somebody one play go you're taught her money [laughter]\nI've heard a lot of them\nAre they a couple of people said a ... a\nLot of name I've already von ... I've heard good what are you giving [laughter] people that know\nOh yeah ah I'm sure you'd love to do that yeah I'm sure he loves to do that and I don't know\nAnd I bet you she probably would be great at it uh yeah\nI mean the good thing about Nikki Haley she was she was combative when she had to be and I think you've on gay is going to do no matter how good she would be added because we really don't I mean where do we know we've only seen her her personal her public face you're right I'm Sorry I meant to say I think she would be hot at it [laughter] I I\nHear that listens to her more than people think you know what I mean like I feel like she could actually have a conversation with him and be like listen dad you're ... you're wrong on this subject here you know what I mean like\nI was speaking of President Trump and his kids did you see where uh what's his name ah the the lawyer the stormy Daniels' lawyer yes Michael Evans\nYeah I had to challenge Donald Trump junior to a cage match wind no but I I Know that Trump junior went after yeah there are going back\nOn Twitter back and forth on Twitter he was saying about some people that were in jail or in prison whatever and then uh the lawyer is saying hey I wouldn't make fun of them you're going to be there soon ... back and ... yeah and then he threw out that he would challenge him do a great rounds on the ... led\nUm junior seems like a guy whom him I went through a fighter assumes that are being shooter\nYeah no I don't know that that's going to I don't know what that means what does the shooter the only thing a hunter\nOh hey I thought you were talking about the wider worker and oh no no neuter he uh he is a hunter he's a gun guy right right I don't know if you really have you done any\nOf your hand to hand combat guy yeah a county west will meet with President Trump at the White House tomorrow they'll talk about bringing more manufacturing jobs to Chicago as well as job opportunities for former conduct south Kanye West making things happen okay [laughter]\nI don't like the my problem there is how do you just get access to the president because you're a big name and your influential I guess they are also like Kim Kim doesn't have any doesn't have the negatives that go along with\nBeing kind of you know what I mean like ... a jerk off\nAnd then what is he barely fill is Kim she didn't do anything good or bad and she actually had to have been good drummer celebrity money I have power and influence or\nAnd I have something that I Would like to bring to the president's attention this woman that's been incarcerated for all these years for a minor charge and they say OK cool but it's a good a good story also ...\nA ... yeah the ... who I don't particularly like Bush is an influence there is a big name and stuff and he's trying to bring jobs the elementary manufacturing jobs to Chicago trying to al ... good opportunities whenever they get out of prison and stuff so you know he's\nSigned on that yet but yeah I mean they're all garbage it's weird that the president's meeting with them yes but that's not really I allow it like I didn't get any\nKind of you can just get a meeting with the president I say I go I go okay Tonya when he got I think you should bring more jobs manufacturing jobs to Chicago he's like okay and how to approach you or I don't know you're the president\nRight that's what I think it's going to go I'm wearing a hat yeah yeah I ...
