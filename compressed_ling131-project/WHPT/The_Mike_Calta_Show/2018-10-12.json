completely wrong minded\nThat's the point but I just don't know if that would fly now he said are there is a very high awareness of offensive things today which is good for sure but at the same time when you take your character like that to literally it just doesn't work yeah\nThat's that's the thing they're saying that that's the grill saying yeah we can do the show and it can be successful but
