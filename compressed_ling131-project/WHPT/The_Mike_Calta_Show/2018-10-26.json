night degree I the blue night so now when you buy your ticket you could pick who section you want to sit in\nAnd then we will ah then when when we have to pick a contest to play for us or we played for that\nOr we play with them we will pick from our own section ... so I'm just saying for those of you who want to ... you might want to sit in my section because I'm so great that\nSpanish habit as we get a read my lips and write a which will be doing there so uh we we also do like a a redneck bingo so yeah we got to figure it all out but I mean when you go to ... comedy dot com you can purchase your ticket and you could pick who section you want us to them and then it's up to each person\nOr are we each one of us to provide our sections with banners and a sign like they do and maybe will die right and then when it's time to play I wouldn't want each year huh yeah yeah yeah and I ...\n... ... you could pick one if you want a reality over right now right now when Hugo Chavez let me click on it so I could show you when you select your seats\nThere is a small amount of VIP what you just closer to the stage and they're the ones selling the Quakers but you can go Carmen regular ... or carbon VIP Calvin regular shooting ... et cetera yeah so they're not colored but they are divided among the room and when you know like\nOn the ah the it'll show you whether the seat up and if you click on

time\nThere were a little packages on your tables a than the sheets behind each one has like lays on 'em 'cause there was a theme when Cruz theme so they'll all be set up that way and then we'll be competing against each other I'm very excited for this yeah this works this could be huge and we could do is a little experiment on\nBut I'm sure it's going to be awesome so that is happening the night before Thanksgiving right now that it's time to check in with Calvin\nWhat do we have a news gallery [noise]\nMe I mean I had to learn the male facility right here in Florida as investigators try to find out who is behind a series of crude explosive packages targeting several prominent Democrats devices have been sent a eight high profile people including ex president Brock Obama\nAnd

security footage was being scrutinized a bomb squad and canine unit copy federal officials to check that plays out\nSo yeah that's what's going to be the uh the key to catching whoever did this are going to review the the bar codes scans of what time the stuff was checked into the post office are going to look at video gonna get you out there and check your cell phone records\nAnd then eventually going to pay the experts are saying within Seventy two hours they should narrow it down and have themselves they are who now again what do you think it's going to be one person I think it's one crazy person\nI think it's one person leading but that there was some help there are some uh side people as well\nThey even say that there's a chance that it is so they're sending the Democrats they're saying there's a theory that Democrats are doing it to make the Republicans look bad and then the Republicans are saying that the Democrats are doing it the regular hope against look bad then there are some guy saying maybe Russia's doing it\nTo make everybody to look bad there's so many theories but I think when it comes down to it you're going to find that it's one crazy old white guy\nYeah yeah yeah I was going to be that most likely yes it will be a a white guy in his uh fifty fifty yup late fifties\nHe doesn't understand technology doesn't understand these when you're caught and are certainly those move the stand the severity of of what he did and why this is so bad he thinks he's doing this because of ...\nRight but it's it's not a by the way I don't know if you
