old baby dot com hurry and tonight valid ten twenty to ten twenty eight select styles lonely\nSunday Morning of public affairs program courtesy of Cox media group Tampa Bay I Am Jeff Slater glad to be with you on a Sunday Morning as always\nAnd today we're going to learn about after school programs not only after school programs that take place in school but those that take place outside of school and why they're so important to the kids we've done a lot of interviews about after\nSchool programs with our friends at afternoon school alliance and we've got them on again with is today but a certain representative for the after school alliances somebody that really piqued my interest\nThis person has worked in the White House and the U.S department of education making changes on the federal level and she's with the national league of cities Audrey Hutchinson joins us this morning to talk about after\nSchool programs that I think will will agree on the same things that we agreed with the after school alliance about the importance of after school programs\nAudrey great to talk to you you've been on the federal level you worked in the White House you worked for the U.S department of education uh you've seen things on the federal level when it comes to our funding when not only comes to education but two important after school programs\nOr how does the future look when it comes to funding these programs\nYeah first of all thank you for having me um after school programs as you said are so critical to the wellbeing of young people families in cities\nAnd we are fortunate that uh we we have gained some support for after school because it's a bipartisan\nIssue but the need is so great\nThat we don't have sufficient funding um to meet the millions of children who I Would say the unmet need the millions of children who still rely on these programs um to keep them safe to inspire their learning\nAnd also give parents peace of mind that they can go to work state work knowing that their children are well supervised so we have secured funding for it but it's still there's a great on may need across the United states both in cities and also in rural communities across our country\nAudrey how ... how to our local cities rate when it comes to coming up with Bundy's funding for uh some of these after school programs I Know you've seen it on the federal level but as part of the national league of cities you worked very closely with mayors across the country and what what kind of future in and funding do you see coming from them\nYes yes I think may is um over the last two decades that I've been doing this work nearly two decades I've been doing this work mayors encounter members have become\nChampions of after school programs um overtime clearly um funding for after school\nIs dependent on a combination of federal state and city and more and more mayors across the country are putting their own city resources um to support these effort so it's that in addition to parents are paying a to support so city leaders\nUnderstand the benefit they understand how important um after school is to the public safety of the out of their city because kids enough hanging on the street\nGetting involved in risky behavior they understand the economics of this in terms of creating a strong tax base so that after school programs you know are engaging young people in in activities that\nAre helping them to think about college\nAnd also giving them hands on skills like science stem science and technology and robotics and boating and all of that so that they can feel like they have a future\nI'm In the workforce and they also understand that after school programs give young people additional um support from caring adults who have their back at me and people would say\nHave their back and want them to succeed so that's why I say the leaders are so interested engaged and\nIn many instances putting up city resources um to make this occur for for families in their communities and quality of life is so critical the more kids to save the better off we are\nAnd and you know we've got a lot of people out there that are listening right now Audrey they'd say well gee I pay enough in taxes at all to be up to the private sector to take care of after school programs how would you answer those critics\nWell I I think after school it has after school programs um have you been down there must support no one sector supports after school it's a combination of funding from the federal government the state and the localities and I think\nParents at least the data that I have seen 'em suggests that there's unanimous support for after school among\nDemocrats among Republicans among parents because they understand that if we're creating well rounded citizens in our communities\nEveryone will benefit even folks who don't have kids will benefit because if you can keep the kids safe a kid who is not you know doing involving techie crime or you know attacking somebody and their engage in something that's meaningful everyone in the entire community um is a winner\nWell I think personally after school programs and this is my opinion\nAfter school programs are great for a physical development social development but also as you couldn't agree because you worked in the department of education are educational development because many of these after school programs\nAre education related specifically when it comes to a child's homework and a child may be lagging in math\nOr maybe lodging in English literature and a lot of these programs they have the mentors there and tutors that help them with their school work so I don't see any disadvantage\nIf that if we're helping with their education and keeping them out of trouble\nYeah absolutely I mean homework help is a big winner lots of kids are ... are ... are especially in poor communities are lagging behind in reading and math and just having that person there to give that kid a leg up\nMakes a huge difference in terms of boosting their the student their grades in terms of reducing their test scores um and and ultimately if that's if they're on that trajectory they have a\nBetter chance of getting into a\nCollege of their choice if they choose to do that or find some meaningful career technical education that they can can pursue so yes and also um helps parents who have to work\nNot having to worry about coming home from a hard day's work or to have to worry about the homework a fair trial because they're so tired so this is a win win situation for everyone for parents I'm for the kid\nAnd also for the community and that's why mayors on council members are concerned about this and that's why the ... National League of cities with the help of several national foundations I've invested time and resources to work with city leaders\nThrough technical assistance to help build high quality programs in communities across the nation\nAnd I think something else that people need to keep in mind when they're talking about after school programs\nAnd that is basically food and when you think about it in the poverty areas where you have concentrated poverty you have a child who's last meal may have been one should school and there is no there is no dinner on the table and most of these after school programs do provide some kind of\nOf food or nourishment to the kids and you know as an educator with out a full belly you're not going to have a full mind you're you're just tough to learn when you're hungry\nYes it's yes we ... yes absolutely we have to take care of the basic needs of kids what I call it is you know um cities have to think about eco systems of support for young people and food is a critical\nComponent of that in fact at the national league of cities we have a whole program that at that deals with after school meals you know drawing down um resources I'm\nFrom the federal government to ensure that programs have access to these programs so No Child comes to that program and leaving hungry and you're right sometime it's perhaps the only meal they'll have for that evening so\nAfter school programs or provide that critical basic needs if I Would call it basic needs um so that child does not have to go to bed at night I'm Crying because he or she is hungry\nAnd they're able to even focus more on their education when they're not worried about being hungry absolutely\nOh absolutely I mean even though those of us or adults we can't function if we're hungry so how do we expect the child to a focus on academics when they're hungry so after school programs are so key to meeting that need for so many young people and families across um cities in the United states\nAnd when people think about after school programs Audrey they often think about the programs that are in the schools themselves and you know\nTheir sports programs there's band there's theater there's debate there's countless programs that happen in the schools when the learning stops but a lot of these kids aren't into programs in the schools they get out the door and frankly between three and six before mom and dad get home from work\nAdults who are working in varying industries\nAnd also giving them a mentor who can help them navigate the system so yes I mean older kids\nBenefit significantly from these opportunities many of these kids especially in poor communities don't have\nThat adults who can help because that adult it's probably working two or three jobs and and on may not even have the knowledge or the expertise\nTo help their kids navigate the system so that's where after school come comes in very very handy an ... I Would say necessary for older youth so we can't forget our older kids because they need us even more because they're now\nI'm that transferring into a different system the whole system of adulthood um to to help them become meaningful and productive citizens\nAnd and I got to ask you Audrey how can we as citizens who were not involved in the U.S department of education we attend the parent teacher meetings we are active in our children's lives but we do have jobs\nWhat can we do more or even better as a community and as a parent to be involved with our kids an after school programs\n[noise] yes I think um adults you can you can\nBe there to things we need more funding for after school programs so each of us can contact or local elected officials to talk about the benefits of after school um folks in communities can can volunteer to become\nTutors and mentors lots of young people need someone to help them finish their homework or to read to took the booth literacy rates uh in in communities um we you know we can\nVolunteer volunteerism I think is really good lots of young people's income you're just whether it's rural or urban need mentors um and the opportunities there for each each and every citizen to do that but more importantly millions of kids who need after school\nPrograms around the country don't have access to them because there isn't sufficient funding um so we want to continue to make sure\nThat these programs are intact for all kids and I must say that after school programs is funded not just by the federal government's a ferret critical piece but also by parents parents pay but there are lots of kids who\nWill never have access to this um unless um we have that combination of funding resources to enable those who cannot afford it to go\nAnd and our young adults you know do we talk about after school programs for the teenagers that are getting ready to go to college and we mentioned earlier the homework help and the mentors ship I Know of several programs that are after school programs were\nThe seniors in college actually mentor kids in elementary school and help them with their homework and a lot of these people have the a dream of being an educator a teacher of some type of when they do graduate college and I don't think that's something you and I are the after school the lines of ever discuss\nThe role of the role of a of a mentor that's actually somebody who's basically still a kid Eighteen and getting ready to graduate and if they're men touring and teaching in helping with homework to somebody who's maybe nine ten eleven twelve Thirteen\nOr ... they both benefit don't you think\nOh absolutely absolutely um yes and you know many of those kids are either finishing high school or in college I think that that that's a vast resource that needs to be drawn upon\nAnd many after school programs um rely on some of those students we we you know in cases after school programs are using Mr\nVista of folks from the ... corps AmeriCorp vista to help and it's a benefit to not only the younger kids but it's also a benefit um to those who are providing the service and that's why a mayor and council members are so critical\nOr because they can use their leadership role and their bully pulpit\nTo bring various stakeholders together\nBring together not just school leaders and ISIS's but also the volunteer Cora hum to really figure out a system a system of after school that works for everyone and\nPut everybody at the table to find out what's needed who can do what you know what are the resources we have in the community colleges and universities um our business leaders are nonprofits um our our school district leaders come together and create um\nA a shared goals develop shared goals and vision for what quality looks like so that every child who needs these um programs can have access and it's it's it's really\nA benefit to the community as a whole entire city um regardless of where you are rural urban and by the way I must say that this issue after school is not political it's a bipartisan it's supported by Republicans and Democrats because they ... the data tells us that\nUm regardless of where it where you stand\nOn the political spectrum after school matters in every community because it's all about the health and wellbeing and the safety of our ... our children\nAnd one more thing and I think it's important new uh brought this up this key word that I'm getting ready to segue into in\nYour life statements you said that the volunteer record and I think a lot of people need to realize in our areas some of these after school programs do consist of the kids giving back and volunteering and the community I Know of a local afterschool program that takes care of one of our local parks\nWe have tub farms over in Hillsborough County which we all know the word food deserts they're teaching kids how to hydroponic league robes food and basically the the area of a bath tub\nAnd they're selling their own produce stand they donated a lot of yes produce to a homeless communities and to soup kitchens\nAnd and it shows them where their food comes from it appreciates words the food comes from and and they're actually giving back so the volunteer opportunity in after school programs absolutely tremendous and more of that is needed\n[noise] absolutely and I should make a plug for the uh Mont foundation um statewide national statewide after school networks there are fifty statewide after school network so I'm across the country including Florida and they have been doing a very good\nJob of using AmeriCorp vista is in in programs across the United states I recently had um learned about the the one in Maryland and there are many of those across the country\nAnd what you just said about using volunteers not only are young people developing skills with these gardening but\nThey're becoming entrepreneur is by learning skills about entrepreneurship and if you're learning about food you know you're dealing with with science so then you enter into the whole area of stem science technology engineering and math um so those are all ... skills young people sometimes they don't know they're learning those skills\nBut they're really um you know bracing themselves with with skills\nThat are going to be fed beneficial to them in the future\nWhether it's in college are beyond\nAll right Audrey it's been great talking to your ... with the national league of cities your website in L. C. dot org after school alliance after school alliance dot org\nAnd we've been discussing the importance of not only funding participating in and looking into after school programs for our children you want to learn about some of the after school programs in your area\nThe website again is after school alliance dot org do your homework get some uh things done you know talk to the teachers talked to the counselors Audrey and and gets direction for a program that's best for your child because the computer program\nAfter school deal may not be what another student needs and look at the ... areas the urban areas African American communities Hispanic humidity's the demographics and the needs differ all over the place\nYes and don't forget your city leaders your mayors and your council members because they have to care about this issue\nAbsolutely Audrey it's been great talking to you and an honor to talk to somebody who's worked in the White House and for the U.S department of education and continues to care about our kids' future that's that's exciting for me to seek\nThank you so much it's my pleasure\nYou've been hearing Sunday Morning of public affairs program courtesy of Cox media group Tampa Bay I M Jeff Slater have a great we\nContinue the conversation following one of them to find a bone on Facebook Instagram and Twitter twenty four seven that was that he's one of those two point five boom you raw lady oh well\nGood morning and thank you for waking up with us on this Sunday and tuning into another edition of spectrum I'm your host Tiffany green this morning we're joined by extra lead a low bury the president of reach up incorporated and low first of all would like to welcome you to our program\nThank you for having me\nAll right so when um you got into this line of work and we're going to\nTalk about it just briefly um but what is reach up incorporated how we even come up with the name and what is reach up and corporate at all about\n\nRich I think is a not for profit community based uh organization in Hillsborough County\nAnd um we basically work to do several health things but\nWe save lives we assure greatness into the world\nUh with the help of our participants and partners in funders them out all from staff or we work with a sense of urgency to strengthen families so that they have optimal health which is the best health they possibly possibly can\nSo in order to be part of this program you cannot have had any previous I'm first and it really ... last longer too because you really target the family you want to work with them up to five years and so what you hope to happen\nIs that you work with that family and that mom on many things on you know financial literacy\nOn a self sufficiency a on a educational or vocational aspirations and really planning pregnancies so you want them to be very deliberate and strategic about okay when is the best time\nTo happen next baby and that be a a very deliberate decision and family planning so really big um big proponent of planning the person planning when you've got to do\nThe next birth and delivery so that is the nurse family a partnership program um that we have\nAnd then we also have\nA programs or to reduce stress and I'm I'm a really emphasizing focus importance of peer support network and so that folks can get together\nNow only talk about the stress that's in their lives\nReally address and take a look at mental health\nWhich is a very hard thing to do for many people to really get in a an atmosphere in a space where they can talk about issues that they normally don't talk about\nBut then most importantly connect them with the resources so that they can get a says they can get diagnosed it can get treated or if need be so the the stress component in addressing a stress and help is another a program that um\nYou know that we do I'm so curious to know just some of the\nStories in which you've heard a participant start at one point and by the end of you know working with and through reach of\nThey have now made it to a point B or C um is there one or two in particular that stand out to you by way of one of your programs that you know it makes you really stick your chest out and say we did that\nThere's a few ah one that ah I Want to mention is um we also have the family resource center that I just didn't mention um\nAnd it's in ... city and so the family resources are really focuses in on a child development and it creates\nA safe environment by which family members can come in and really be a in tune and educated about where their children should be\nA as forest developmental milestones and didn't really being aware of what may be red flags and what they need to tend to weather is\nEyesight weather is hearing what is communication skills and just have that that atmosphere\nWell in these centers we also do developmental screenings were in\nWe have a clinics a mobile clinics that come in and places like St Joe ups and other places come in and do screenings\nAnd then there's one particular screening um are are never forget um this was in about two thousand and two it was a staff member who bought her grandchild 'em to a screening with our encouraging\nA and oftentimes people are embarrassed\nWhen they have a child um [noise] uh who have special needs but this child was like two years old and not talking and so when it came to our attention that this was her a grandchild of hers and there wasn't talking we encouraged a screening\nI actually had one of my staff members\nOf who still working with me today a company in her to the screening um and it found out that the child has some serious artistic problems and some real serious emotional mental health problems at that early age\nAnd so they did the development of screening got the child into\nAll kinds of resources with developmental um screenings with mental health\nServices ... provision with um special needs services and we actually walk that family through for the next two years with all those services\nProvided what people are now calling a health navigator\nUm to really accompany them and be that support system and so we were told when we first started at this child was not gonna probably ever talk and uh because of the mental and emotional damage that had been done in spite of the intellectual capacity\nThat there was going to be only minimum movement and that certainly isn't the case\nUm he is now in his twenties or you met him performing I'm at winter out functions and he's won our our big advocates\nA he has completed high school\nAnd uh he places instruments of publicly uh he speaks very eloquently uh about his past\nHistory and where he is now\nHe acknowledged that he has some social\nAnomalies but very much know that he is in a very good space and a good place so every time I see him he's still seems like our little baby but my heart just goes out to him because\nIn spite of what people said and the odds we could tell with all of the various ...\nEntities coalescing immobilizing around him he became the best that he could be and what more can you ask\nIf you're just tuning in we're talking with extra early to also known as low bury the president of reach up in court British just finished sharing one of the success stories and how reach up has impacted the lives of so many others especially the total family you know sometimes when you think about\nA a a child it's just okay the child and their mother but there is the mother the father and that support group that also helps uh to fill in the gaps as well if you don't mind I'm just curious to know then how did you\nI don't think it's a happened upon but how did you get into this line of work that's a\nFun question that I get asked a whole lot in the bottom line is that this is my call on life so I Believe we all purpose for something in life and so my purpose from the very beginning has been to\nHelp other people particular with um health and mental health issues or I can recall my beer first experience in first grade I Know this child's first and last\nName a still today a he missed school a lot and he was probably the brightest person in our class and it really bothered me when he wasn't president\nAnd I can remember going up to my first grade teacher and saying where is he and uh she seemed to be taken aback that I even noticed and ah she said you know he's out sick and then um he came back\nAnd I had a conversation ask them how you felt um and then he was very shy he told me very little\nBut then he made a a on a test that day and had\nBeen out for what appear to me weeks probably days and then uh he was gone for another two weeks\nAnd so I went back and said we're is he he's missing again and so uh she told me he was sick again and I remember from back then that people didn't tell you when people had sickle cell\nAnd so forth but you know and I heard different things in our piece together in my head oh he has sickle cell anemia [noise]\nBut um he really really impressed upon me the urgency of getting\nHis knees taking care of he was always tired always sleep and then I remember finding out where he lived mind you I'm In first grade\nI found out where he lived and I asked my mom if she was stopped by there so we could take him something and I did and we went by his house and then as so I'm the house environment which made me even sadder\nBecause there was a lot of children in the household and he seemed to be care taking for all the children\nAnd so I can remember in first grade really be friending him but my heart was always and I bugged him about how you feel and how things going but we became really good friends that was first grade\nActually take well no one told me whatever you really want to go to college and we really want to have [noise]\n\n\n\nHey wake up you can't train your way into college their actual steps you need to take for all the steps they didn't know how to do dad org ... by the

I heard something kind of on the other day and was talking about how you know the statement knowledge is power yeah and they actually ended up nonsense that knowledge is power it's taken a knowledge and turning into action I read that you know nowadays yeah you don't do anything when it to have no power yea yea potential power for reminding interrupt him to a guy [laughter]\nBut I did not great

credit pointing active getting were able to use that to get the credit putting a these are\nTarget them for violation of due process that's how the information goes all the credit for no other way that people in India and staying up trying to simplify and these guys are\n... billion dollar industry this multibillion dollar industry that and they're selling your information to whoever will buy it credit cards insurance companies mortgage to all these different companies are buying that can be information\nGreat job they make it a lot of money off of due to their job I applaud them what they're doing yeah if the consumers that I that I kind of condemned because they were letting them do this okay ah a promotional block on your credit report could take you off that list yes right off the live free it's a free service\nWe're kind of you know the best place to invest people know that worldwide and you see a lot of that's why you see a lot of the Asian money flowing in South American money flowing in a in an traditionally going into real estate and other investments are but then you know something interesting happened down in Argentina I Believe right yeah if you want to tell that story\nYeah so in Argentina I'm a Hoover obviously they operate in the country or Argentina and so I I guess the bank of Argentina's and doing some crazy things up recently and they got into some type of dispute with the with the company who burned itself they shut down all their bank account\nHoover I immediately within twenty four hours switched accepting bitcoin is a payment method and then immediately went back to doing commerce for the phone to having to worry about you know governments you know I'm introductions into regular commerce you can just have open you know free market capitalism yeah so that's what they did they were able to switch over to decline payments and continue to operate that they were\nRunning the banks have been griping yeah citizens were going to get their money out because every other day or our it would just lose that much value\nThere inflating the purchasing power of the currency way but I like a an extenuating right much faster than even you usually see right um but it kind of going back to how this is going to revolutionize the real estate industry\nYou'll see things like um like he'd give the blockade as an example uh it's infallible incredible and it has its settlement possibilities as opposed to like you mentioned um people from other countries to try to move\nInto real estate here but if you actually look at what that process looks like for them it's kind of Congress them or not the easiest process in the world a kind of have to go to the same amount of hoops to move their money from whatever country they are in here yeah we're using crypto currency is you take all of that\nOut of the equation wow uh Internet yeah internationally so the credit crisis there's no borders there's no country is associated with it yeah so I can move a billion dollars in bitcoin to China without any government saying in me moving\nSo to give you like a really quick example of someone who just said that recently someone moved two hundred and six million dollars worth of a theory on that's expensive currency\nUm the other day it took a forty two minutes of the trends actually confirmed and it costs six cents to move that money wow\nWow that's an incredible innovation the technology that required into a third party they gave it directly to the other party without you know any intermediary\nYeah it's interesting we're ... we're talking with Jason Solomon here on the consumer quarterback show I'm your husband or Brian for talking crypto currency here specifically and uh I like how relating to real estate 'cause it's kind of an interesting conversion of two different major major I mean do you think about back in the United states when we went off the gold standard a lot of people really frowned down on that\nAnd and I think when we originally came off it was the intent to go back on it at one point but now here we are twenty eight team a lot of craziness in the world a lot of interesting things but you know one of the one of the pillars of of any society is real estate you know it's always going to be that way people to live somewhere so now we've got you know an emerging technology\nAh combining with a ... real estate I like\nIt get insurance and you even saw 'em there's actually one of the largest brokerage is I'm In the world of just recently partner with a crypto currency to do a beta tested in Mexico to censor use to block chain\nFor their for their real estate transactions wow they're going to you they're going to do that a country wide through Mexico kind of a beta tests before they before they move forward you're talking about like the number two brokerage in in the world wow I'm so\nIt's being adopted faster and faster yourself a deli investments the institutional investment company yup they have a a over eight million dollars in management they just moved into crypto currency this last week while I\nAm so it's moving faster and faster the adoption is is happening so it's a question of whether somebody small scale the little guys like every person that's listening to this right now is going to get involved in this technology before it above their pay grade for last year about action then what what should people do\nSo first of all people need to do the research like while he was saying they need to go find the information they need to look at what bitcoin is one of the currency is\nWhat black chain is I spend about two and a half weeks in my original kind of research phase doing this and then once I looked at it and I'm like oh this is going to be the future and then I was a question of well how do I get involved in it and so you can find your own way obviously you know do what's best for you financially but you need to get involved in this in some capacity whether it's a small amount or large amount you need to get involved yeah it's\nYeah it's like Tony Robbins said you know one of my mentors of course you know\nHe says you know fill up that that security bucket you know build that bucket up first thing you know ten twenty percent thirty percent of your check filled that bucket up you know do your timing to your philanthropic you know and then that extra bucket that you have you're saying you know hey if you get an extra five hundred thousand dollars to put it into some type of a crypto currency to recommend a certain\nSo there's there's a lot of great ones out there I'm just as a general blanket opinion I'm not your financial advisor yeah yeah but don't listen to people's opinions do your research I can tell you right now this is the best crypto currency it's going to the moon you gotta buy right now don't listen to me\nThat sounds like a zero to writer cs and by the way most financial advisors they're not they're not produce shares a lot of them aren't so even a financial advisor they are not necessarily the right person to speak to about where to put your money I mean most of them aren't there they're selling\nYou know whatever their I don't want to say specific companies and set myself up here but you know whatever that company they work for they're selling their paper and making more points on the ... just like we used to in the subprime game when we'd sell a subprime loan\nFor sure and I think what's interesting about the financial advisors 'cause I've talked to people about this all the time and so it might wonder what they'll be like well I asked my financial advisor\nUsually get one or two answers from like yeah civil show financial advisor yeah which is either\nOh I don't really understand that or I don't know what it is or\nOh wow that's risky right but like even if you look at like um the purchasing power of your own dollars since the creation of the Federal Reserve and Nineteen Thirteen\nFor something like Ninety five percent of its purchasing power since the Federal Reserve note came into existence while so I mean if you just look at dollars alone as a as a simple enough but that's a pretty bad investment like historically yeah so I think it all depends on perspective um and that's why I'm so excited about because of course because\nThey have no ability to be inflated you can inflate the purchasing power away yeah\nIt's interesting the way that we came from a recession and those seven and then I remember I read Robbins book money master the game and for the first time in the history of the world\nWe went into a negative banking a scenario in other words if I gave my money to the bank instead of the ... them paying me a small commission or a percentage interest rates it's a flip flop yeah paying money to have the bank hold your ... it makes no sense\nRight but but like tell me what a bank does for you right ... ... what's the what's the function of a back well yeah well they hold my money they keep it safe and so what if I could shut your technology that could keep it fate\nOr using simple math right right and and you didn't have to use a third party that if you ever seen what a a a currency collapse looks like the banks are not actually keeping your money safe yeah no they're not the reserve\nRequirements we're all real low and then they they made him keep more money in reserves and you know it gets into you know derivatives too when you start thinking about the way that they're sold a in an exchange but\nUh you know one thing we didn't talk about it in and we got about thirty seconds is the ability to mind is this type of ... and you can mine that by solving mathematical equations right yeah we'll get we'll get into\nThat an expert essentially it's done is very high and computers are but for me I think that's one of the most incredible passing come opportunities existence about that in the ...\nYeah pretty

I Know the purity it's been a business now for\nWhat is it over Twenty years ago Tom reading from the better Business Bureau and people can get complimentary bottled up this green T. C. R. today we'll get that number out in a few minutes but first what does this she are\nSeeing foreign second you designed this formula in a liquid soft deal why do you like the liquid soft technology so much\nOkay first questions first it's called green tea CPR which is short for green tea Kirk human and there is there a troll\nThe big three ingredients that are in this product and meaningful protective amount the recent that it's in a liquid soft shell is that\nThat allows for rapid and very complete absorption\nI'm not suggesting that there's anything wrong with tablets or capsules that contain powders because there isn't but when you have a fluids soft shell\nYou just happen to get more quick break down of the capsule more rapid absorption and to some extent more complete absorption into the intestines that means that your body utilizes more of the ingredients and the supplements so Greenpeace\nER is green tea ...\nAnd the reason for a liquid soft shell is it's just a superior dosage form especially for these three particular ingredients\nYeah of course before we tell our listeners how they get their very own complementary bottle green T. C. R. tell me this you wanted to buy this green tea plus the ... bc um Ninety five per human plus there was marriage will I mean you spent close to probably least Seventy five dollars for all three bottles\nSure and yet today purity products is giving away a free bottle how are they able to do this\nWell you can consider it kind of a smart that and what I mean by that first of all there are these big but they're also very strategic they know\nThat if a person who is listening will pick up the phone call in and get their free bottle and it really is free as free as and it doesn't cost you money if that person will try the product take it as recommended they're going to feel it\nAnd when they feel that they're going to say gee\nI Want this as part of my regular daily regimen so purity is really betting beyond the free bottle\nThey're betting that people will have a positive experience that they'll say gosh I like this I Love the way I feel on green T. C. R. and they'll order more so from purity standpoint I have to say\nIt isn't much of a risk it all\nKrystle that's on I Want to get to the special offer more from my gas coming up in a minute there's an incredible free bottle offer today on purity products amazing new green tea she aren't super formula here's the deal\nHall purity products right now in fact the one of the first thousand callers today just before Ninety five for shipping which is one hundred percent refundable purity can rush you want to complimentary bottle of green\nT. C. R. formula for you to put to the test you try you be the judge purity knows that once you experienced the benefits of Greenpeace ER you're not going to want to miss a day of taking that's why they're willing to send you a free bottled today So Paul right now operators are standing\nBy one eight hundred for nine nine seven five zero five again that's one eight hundred for nine nine seven five zero five call now one eight hundred for nine nine seven five zero five\nGreen T. C. R. delivers a potent combination of green tea plus patented B. C. M. Ninety five Kirk human and\nRe spiritual in one easy to take liquids off do you do it for your energy level you're focused mental clarity your cardiovascular health to support healthy dieting immune defense joined comfort in so much more to claim your complimentary bottle call now\nOne eight hundred for nine nine seven five zero five one little catch\nThis free bottle offer is not available in stores and you won't find it on line either only through today's ...\nLimit one free bottle per household call now one eight hundred for nine nine seven five zero five one lesson for those writing it down here we go one eight hundred for nine nine seven five zero five okay Chris talked about some of the headlines\nJust on the green tea to we didn't get to you and I understand the dieters just loved green tea because the supports healthy fat metabolism than right and what does the research say about green tea when it comes to weight management\nWell this is one of the\nEspecially wonderful things about green tea pat we know that green tea has thermo Jenike properties that is it has heat generating properties in the body so it actually causes your body\nTo burn more calories so when you eat a meal you're going to burn more calories from that meal as a result of taking a good well made concentrated green tea extract\nIn addition it has a specific fat oxidation properties said actually burn fat I'm not suggesting that you're going to lose twenty pounds in a week but I Am saying that this is going to help your body to metabolize fat more efficiently\nOver time taking a green tea extract can help you to have a better fat to lean muscle ratio so from low weight control standpoint this is very good news additionally green tea\nHelps to stabilize blood glucose or blood sugar and unstable blood sugar is one of the contributing factors to increased wait\nSo by stabilizing blood sugar you have an effect on weight control in weight management so it's really quite remarkable stuff you need enough of it we've got enough of it in green T. C. R. it has to be the right extract we've got the right to extract but the science is there for healthy weight management\nRight now Chris you see that with ... formula it provides you with about three cups worth of green tea in each to Capitol serving of these cutting edge liquid soft Joe so you know the green tea is concentrated benefits for energy for heart health for alerting us in just too soft gel caps\nPlus you get the Kirk human and the ... too so it's easy you call your daily short cut to better health explain this idea of a healthy short cut and explain some of the top benefits as well\n[noise] well I mean you could for example drink three cups of good concentrated green tea each day\nEat at least one really rich curry made with a lot of tumor accrued\nAnd drink a couple of glasses or red wine you could do that every day most people will not do that every day but they still might want the benefits of three of the biggest superstar protective health and Hansing nutrients on the entire planet\nSo when I call this a daily short cut I'm simply saying that\nYou can get in a capsule and a good liquid soft gelatin capsule or you know otherwise half to get by drinking a few cups of tea eating at least one large you know ... Laden curry every day and drinking a couple of glasses of concentrated red wine\nAgain we're talking with Chris killing the medicine hundred now in this new Greenpeace ER formula purity it's really about the research share it with some of your favorite studies in the headlines on the ... that we didn't get to yeah I Know this is one of your favorite ingredients for joint comfort and even for brain health\nWell I especially like the liver protective heart protective and joint modifying properties of this stuff the liver is our greatest detoxify Oregon and we know that we're constantly bombarded by toxins in the environment in fact\nBlood studies show the newborn babies contain two hundred and ... pollutants in their blood at the time of birth so we need a functioning super healthy very strong liver\nWe might not think about our livers that much but we need that ... and we know the curriculum and protect the liver at detoxify deliver it keeps it strong\nFrom a cardiac standpoint it's highly beneficial for the heart\nIt's very good for maintaining healthy cholesterol and healthy platelet levels\nAnd from a joint standpoint we have in numerous ... studies showing overall improvement in joined health and relief and stable inflammatory activity better joint mobility as a result of taking curriculum and\nI like the brain protective studies as well you know I think everybody wants a sharper clearer mind and Kirk human delivers solve this so I regard it as one of the single most important things that you can put in your body and I'm very well aware path but most people are not going to eat enough rock tumor Rick route\nThis is very very exciting who's krill oil sensation I mean it is all over the news docked in the eleventh grade studies are out there many experts are declaring that cruel oil is better than fish oil so give us this low down on this cruel omega fifty plus formula right right right\nSee you know if I told you I did talk about this before the show that this is one tiny pill that benefits the joints and the brain and memory mood coronary heart disease wonderful for the arteries makes your hair shine great for the skin I mean what would you say that\nHey where is it working I get that right and\nWe have it it's clear lawmakers fifty plus and we're going to give it to everybody for free today and that's really cool because pretty want everybody to try this because they know they're going to see a huge difference but get this\nOn top of that for the first thousand people that call today and we're giving way second gift because I just demanded this you know we're dealing with the fifty plus her and said hey\nYou know if you're forty and you feel like your energy is low this is for you also but for people fifty and over we're also giving away free beat twelve energy melts I demand this because hey as we're getting a little older we don't absorb that be twelve is well and I want you to feel\nThe benefits from this cruel and making fifty plus or to Jack up those be twelve levels for you today as well you know what a value proposition you\nKnow when it comes to your health they really is a win win this is amazing I heard you say that this can actually reduce the risk of coronary heart disease I mean when you hear that whose ears don't perk up after that how exactly does that work anyway\nRight right well Crowell maker fifty plus remember this is the combination of cruel world with the high omega three highly concentrated they should also which is much higher and omega threes than most cruel oil formulas would be so when we're dealing with the higher omega three fish oil we're talking about\nSupport for the HDL cholesterol\nHealthy youthful flexible arteries that's so great for the circulation heart muscle strength platelet activity red blood cells that stay nice and soft and flexible so they're going to work their way through those little ... oh what about triglycerides that become so important so\nThis ... fifty plus supports the heart in so many ways\nAnd you know the bottom line is we need to think about this because as we're getting a little older fifty plus maybe mid forties certainly sixties and seventies\nIt's decision time I mean you know your body's not working the way it did when you were in your thirties energy might not be there you need to make a decision or are you going to take it laying down and just let yourself get old or are you going to do something about it you're going to stay physically active but you're going to do the things you need to stay healthy\nAnd getting these omega threes the crew loyal of vitamin D the antioxidants makes such a difference this is a game\nChanger for anybody in at fifty plus age group\nNow this is absolutely great information I Know that a mega threes talk about that just for a second our best known for their cardiovascular benefits\nAnd they're certainly also known as brain so now we discuss this in some of the past shows if you would touch on the brain benefits for our listeners listening out there today and tell us why you say that supplementing with omega threes isn't just a good idea for the brain but an absolute necessity\nGo oh this is such an important point that you're bringing up absolutely for brain health we must must get your omega threes back in there you know when you think about omega threes and you
