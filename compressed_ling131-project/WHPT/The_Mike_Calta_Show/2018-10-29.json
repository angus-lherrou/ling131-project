I don't I don't care because at least ... side whether it's comedy dot com you can get on there I have two seats left I'm just like yeah they're nice seats they look at us [laughter] that I'm a ...\nReally fun I'm looking forward to that oh it was removed before the richer I'd tell you the check in with the Galvin right now he's got today's news a lot of things happening\nWhat do I have a new thing Alvin well then you say non men who frequently posted anti Semitic threats on line burst inside a busy Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday and opened fire killing ... eleven people and injuring ... others\nAfter ... exchanging gunfire or\nA police officer I after exchanging gunfire with police forty six year old Robert Bowers surrendered in was taken into custody the department of justice charge batteries with twenty nine federal counts including loving counts of obstruction obstructing the exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death\nAttorney general Jeff Sessions said the charges could lead to the death penalty and I saw where the uh the da da da da da du or the or suspect was injured during the shootout with police underwent surgery and remains hospital his eyes\nYeah Roth is working at the start has been totally fine yeah I Know but he's not going to last forever and need somebody who's going to be the next ... we'd be living on bell I should recall Pittsburgh that's not happening that Wal Mart or ... or you could you could trade Pittsburgh James ... and give us three first round packs and I still don't pick up what happened\nWell right now you got the bell sitting there doing nothing yeah okay well yeah I mean hotter were totally fine I Know God damn counter scared me I\nI just think the team is garbage across the board and I think you have to ride James what's out because you've invested too much there's a lot of people they're gonna lose their job because they put it all in on Seamus and if he loses it you have to ride it out because if you go with his Patrick didn't what\nJames wins and said to us when he came here I'm done with all field a ... and the first thing he did was do something to get them suspended for three games and now a he's throwing for interceptions in one game ... is just sitting there going I I'm here if you need me and every time you put them in he's been fantastic\nBut if you go if it's Patrick the rest of the year where does that leave you at the end of the season\nAh ... quarterback you're not going to win\nSo now you've got all these players you're might cabins your oh gee how you're going to bring in a rookie quarterback\nWith these guys and you're going to start over from scratch no you're ... you're going to the trade for somebody who I have to try to get somebody you have to hope that there's somebody there or you're screwed down because you've got thirty six year old quarterback there was run out of New York because he was\nTurned over city yeah and that was that he was the chamber of new [laughter] nobody remembers influence six picks against the patriots\nIs girl from New Yorkers ... I put on the uh ... has type ... you know that you wrote back I Wish we have a guy like that up here [laughter]\nI'm listening ... ... I'm telling you right now my cabins just Sean Jackson who asked for trade this we\nAre a good Peter [laughter] if you're just trying to action and you've got all that speed and all that uh you know that ability and you can't get a guy to throw the ball to you and you were excited about coming here so that you could play with him and they have like maybe it's me and then they put fifty and and he's like well maybe it's not me\nI think this is all on overreaction because James played well down the stretch of the end of the season that is why the bucks gave him the fit your option they picked up his contract was they they thought he was next quarter they write\nThe suspension happened which is stupid you came defend that I think they're into deep not only financially but you know they just like a four year thing really glad I Would ride it out and see where do I really didn't make the decision\nForty eight games Seventy one turnovers\nRight but I'm saying\nThe league if you go with fitzpatrick elite where's it leave you\nYeah they're they're going to have to trade Seamus they're gonna have to try and get something for him and they're going to try to get a quarterback obviously right Patrick isn't going to be the guy that takes them and he does have an issue but he's the guy who should be playing with for the rest\nOf the season this this team's not going to the playoffs Iraq with or without the tobacco because the entire team of the entire team does is there's so many problems across the board\nI Love it I don't how many ... and none of them are ... oh yeah it's a GPS just genuine every destroying ... the highest paid person on this team and he has done nothing he's got what one ... ah one tackle I mean he's just he's just I ... get rid of him to\nFitzpatrick probably should be the starter but I don't think he will I think because they they have to they have to around his investments hundred\nDollar bet on it All right and we'll find out I'm probably Thursday\nBecause where do you go from there do you take what I hear your hundred oh I Know but it like it\nBecause he didn't he I think this entire coaching staff will be out at the end of the season anyway so because the team is not\nThey're not going to prove you're in and that division you're not going to win the division all of a sudden we liked Farr by no I Do I don't like him I Do like in my opinion do you do you think people are going to change they had he was forced to give up play calling to a monk and because he was about to lose his job\nYeah yeah I think he's just getting to be a head coach [laughter] you know what I mean but you know\nYou don't want to go to like a ... you have to look like a head coach Steve\nAre you happy that they didn't bring a agreed and back\nAnd oh yeah he's doing terrible yeah I don't know yeah but he's ... he's gonna do terrible that's why he's over ten years are going to rebuild that whole thing ... trading for draft picks well yeah crazies he's building a team as when am I doing guerilla ... not grading them care about Oakland grew dirt and trying to win the super bowl for a Las Vegas that's when you try\nAnd also fitzpatrick last game he threw three picks and got replaced by James\nYeah oh okay but ... listen there was a lot of pressure on him and that was one game\nRight I was one game everybody likes to look at the first two games that was fun when you know he said no I'm\nOnly as it was still growing up the first year games right I'm looking for the fact that they were able to call him yesterday at half time he hasn't played in three games and the call them out there and he was able to jump right back into fifty mode now and a throne touchdowns not afraid he ran his first three players were big runs\nBy the way did you see fitzpatrick whenever they're lining up for the a field goal the bangles we're going to\nCare for these active I said to my son I go now is when we all go like this and he goes why go 'cause we don't blow it up off guard with silver and right and they showed the lawyer and but also did\nYou notice he was smiling yeah he's not he's playing like I got another ... win win either way if I tie this game I lose because of a kick my fault right\nI just really think they're into deeper James Winston and they're going to be forced to ride it out for at least ... under law says yeah I bet a\nTiger losses now they lead fits you see what he can do for the rest of the year and then they go listen we've started the year we've started plenty of seasonal worst quarterbacks yeah and we we built a running game if they could bring a running back in here\nIf they could leave it's Patrick if they could bring a good running back in here and beloved described in defense now the defense is bad enough shape before now without Kwan yeah now were even worse but ah you know at this point you have to wait until next year as far as ... goes\nYeah but I just got to ride out what your guy where's your Jamie is a guy let's bring money given his old he was all\nBefore yet uh okay so Jill and I have a hundred dollar bet I like I say a fits dog is going to start and you say James is going to start yeah\nI Will not nonfat like Thursday or friday I Am probably numbers\nToday they may they may come out and say no James or man or whatever but I think that um\nIt'll be the big question and then once they get in the practice it'll be you know because who's practicing with the ones compared who's ... actually went to two so\nYeah I I say that fits you definitely starts I'm not even saying he wins but I'm saying definitely starch and I'll take ... hundred dollars and that will give it away at\nThe poncho [laughter] nice as part of a intend to get it all in one showed up and then\nI I Can't argue the fitzpatrick you'd probably be the star but I just don't I don't I think they're into deep that organizations into deeper James once they have to ride it out\nYou had to make sure we love to one of them who were to be on either come out of your kids' lives or Mm yeah probably Seamus yeah no\nI I Want to hear it in my face and the as we are to\nBe afraid of Jim Jim I got to be when I don't know\nThe funding was eye on Sunday I was at publics and I saw those fitzpatrick shirts and they were like two for Fifteen dollar alright I almost treated our picture to be a jerk off like a Saturday the seizures and I didn't and I'm Glad I did\nYou want to know what surprisingly I only saw one say it's an abject um ... yeah I Know it was Saturday and there was someone who was a good one or the counter McGregor with a an underwear and stop the like pack it pretty good uh yeah that was that was a funny one\nIs I think it leaves the bugs to know where fitzpatrick has been a turnover monster his entire career that's why he's been run out almost every city yeah although I'll guess why it's fun to watch and he probably should be the starter but the bucks there into deep money wise and just the entire project of trying to have a franchise quarterback that they you have to ride it out to the end\nI say a geo gives me a hundred dollars aren't\nFitzpatrick is announced as a starter for this next game not the not the rest of the year yet\nI say by the end of the year Jamie It's Wednesday and becomes roommates with Josh Freeman\nWherever I saw that he was living in the other and they're like I say they announce it and then immediately you started getting bitter dream as she started hearing stories about him being mad and paint in Tampa and blah blah blah\nI'm not going to say he's not fighting to keep his job right now because he he played like garbage but I I think they're going to ride it out and he could be he very well could be gone next year and maybe it's a better thing that goes another team because he he still is a good quarterback he's shown flashes of being good that's why they picked up his last option but you know\nJust remember we don't pay impending easier when you pay\nOne time and that guy or a check off of\nA sticking with football yesterday Indianapolis Colts kicker Adam military became the all time with our NFL points leader after making twenty five yard field goal against Oakland Raiders on Sunday Morning ... was the previous leader here is the call here's all went down we have video on bone TV talking about\n[noise] [laughter]\n[laughter]\nIt out in the\nJared unbelievable whole yeah I Wonder I\nThink about that they'll be he's been making decent money playing in the NFL and he's one of the ... for that long time and then I Wonder if he gets any kind of bonus for that like if you started a mile and whatever and get a big bonus for and stuff you\nThink the NFL game that bonuses for records and stuff like that\nI go to individual team yeah I Would have done you know if they looked at it and they say hey your whatever from breaking that record if you get the however many points we'll give you this many uh but uh that's pretty good man to be a\nSplit tongue yeah eyes she later removed her belly button as it is a quote what makes us human she said before giving it to her a boyfriend\nOr but the

see the uh Peter ... her village has movie no is it out yet I saw the other day I guess it was like an HBO movie or something\nOh really I don't know what I'm watching\nIt it was actually pretty dumb but pretty cool to sell you actually watch it yeah so it's called my night with Hervey and it's about this reporter who stayed with him for the whole night and a female no a male okay and then he tells his story to this reporter\nAs all night goes on about how he was on top of the world with um fantasy island that it just all fall I'm\nYeah I'm looking at it to see where it is a word is playing out but I saw like a preview for it and he's painting a check who's a little sick whatever but hot and like big bugs and stuff and everything and he's painting or any does that and then you just go to the Disney puts a paint brush down and then\nRuns in jumps and they just got back Monday or like jumping on camera so the idea is that a Hervey\nVillage showed was admitted and he was a Frenchman and he was born in France and he was an artist and he never had the acceptance of his parents certainly is not as mother because he was a little person she always kind of\nAh she I think she was more worried that he was going to be treated unfairly and he was always trying to get her acceptance and he ended up leaving he's inspired to come he didn't fired by television and movies to come to the United states and become a big star\nSo he comes over here and he makes it into the James Bond man with the golden gun movie ... and he thinks at that point that he's a big star then he's living in his van\nAfter that 'cause you can't get my work\nAnd then he's aging tracked him down and says we've got something else for you\nAnd it was fantasy island and I didn't know this ... on the seventies and eighties so I didn't I certainly didn't know any of the behind the scenes stuff so I guess tattoo had become such a big star and that you know a advantage the island that\nThey wanted to do more with him but Ricardo multiple bond was the star so he was constantly like well I uh so they would have conflict all the time and he ended up drinking\nAnd drug gang or images and girls and then he got married and he cheated on his wife and then there was guns involved in human crazy little midget man they used to go to strip clubs and spend hundreds of\nDollars or so that was on HBO came out on October twenty as a also in there is a Jamie ... who I Would imagine probably plays the uh the reporter guy yes ah he is in a great show did you ever watched the fall\nNo it's really good I've watched the fall guy no you should watch the fall it's a really good ... ah he is he was terrible and the Herbie say oh well he's great and there\nAre Gillian Anderson is in there and she is a detective he is I'll give you a little bit he's a killer oh like people don't know how to family and everything is that right yeah it's really interesting it's I'm going to a ruined the herbal lawyer is either Kelly\nA reason that\nHe uh was not a very good actor and the problem is he is going yeah he was an alcoholic beer reporter ... so the whole story is really about him and his battles with alcohol and how it's ruined his life and now he's interviewing Hervey about how he threw away all his fame and stuff do you how did her ... shows di\n... ... ...\nThat's what I thought died image and write write died somewhere around into his in his thirties image\nIs what I have a fire right heart like they were like ... ... oh my God this is well I've done that yet no he killed himself did he was on yeah okay that sounds familiar\nHuh yeah well this guy's not as a holiday and so they they flash back and\nForth so her Vega tell their stories and then they flash back and forth to this guy they could show by the alcoholism and this guy goes out to a club meets a chick brings or at home it's making our given all of a sudden his wife walks I mean it was a drug you took it back to us

going to be missing out on a ...\nI Love it up by the way a talking about the Simpson stuff I have this last week our producer or it's not with the Simpson says The Simpsons planned to drop who the character altogether but al gene who is the executive producer has responded on Twitter saying that this guy Eddie ...\nOur or does not speak for the show oh yeah so you know so the ...\nYeah that that some guy just saying that that's happened maybe it is maybe he's got some inside information but this guy who was actually an executive producer for The Simpsons there's this guy didn't speak for the shell\nGotcha okay a ... a I have a hundred dollar bet with geo are you aware of this\nRight as I've heard yes I just had a discussion was Mr\n... my uh my hundred dollar says that Ryan Fitzpatrick will be the starter for the Tampa Bay buccaneers next weekend\nHis says Jamieson Winston will be the quarterback what do you think and radicals former ah have a buccaneer I Would say congratulations to you right there's no way\n[noise]\nYou know in the world started well there's no way yeah James has been there it just\nTells me one thing that is to Glazer speaking because there's no way that they're cutter could look in his players eyes and say we're going to play a guy that substantially worse than that guy yeah if it's if it's if glaring stop\nAnd also that they said that everybody everybody saying that the players lit up when fits you wanted it is yeah well they did yeah well\nIt's not and I said this is the most important thing to me 'cause you know I Do a podcast and everything I talk about who should be playing and I I I've gone back and forth but I have and flip flops because I said this this is the most important thing I said when you finally go away from Jay miss it has to be because of Jane is and not fifty\nBecause that's the first time it was because of ... this time is because of Seamus so it's justified you catch this lead Jay must run on the bench\nNot getting it all out of him it all came out of him yesterday\nYeah all came out not any for you've got more enough sections and nothing else obnoxious\nThat his demeanor he just looks like he doesn't want to be there at ... he looks like you like manning when he's losing and that's a bad luck yeah that's a good look when you're winning everything's great when you're losing nobody was rallying around that you know nobody\nYeah 'cause that makes the best quarterback who's the guy who even forget the last ... get it forget it that's gone and here's what we're doing now in driving down the field and you see that\nWinners you see that and guys like a far be seeing that you know guys uh what's his name from uh New Orleans a breeze breeze you know all those guys they can go OK that happens it's gone now or go on\nBut we are talking about best of all time dream is right now we thought that he ... he's taken a couple of steps forward\nThat's the worst I see them play yesterday like symptoms rookie season and it wasn't just seen as ... and the intercept sort of a big deal where it's little things like even a completion Z were off like a completion if you're going to do in the chest you can keep on running their diving for the ball so he was off yesterday it was bad\nYeah it was a it was terrible I'm ... now and then breathe some life back into the team and I I was very excited to see a man I was like here we go and the fact that we almost won that game and it wasn't fifty that lost the game it was a defense couldn't hold them couldn't stop them from moving down in the field goal random and they put that little highlight up there\nAnd show them were filled go range was and they were good seven to ten yards away from him and he could not hold them from one more play\nWe have a whole than we have been held anybody this year\nWe haven't held anybody when it's matter like some of those who are defense got better the second half well they're up by
