but I think but he ... yeah he owns a piece of it or something and so he gets more than the rest of them are so [noise] yeah well I mean I don't I'm sure that's their value or\nHe was getting more and he's producing more things that he's worth more than they are and then we started cue [noise] she was a fireman and I said\nBoy do I know how how great it is I have to run into buildings anymore do you live now here's one here's some terrible I'm retired now because I've got six and she goes on sometimes on the weekends on while I just go down to the firehouse and fight fires with them just as a volunteer\nWas like why you're rich now those are new fire that's\nInsane I'm sure he's not running into being dangerous anymore but I'm sure that\nThat would be an Asian yeah that'd be [laughter]\nGoing down to fight a fire it'd be fun you know the fighting a fire if if I if I was a firefighter Mike\nYes the spiritual and one time now where the guy who has experience of being in the fires you know he's going to want to go in there they're not going out for the fun of it he's going down to be in it 'cause he misses being in the blaze\nAnd that's what all of these or do they look like you're it inside of the fire is he he likes being in a\nFactor was on I learned\nWas like I'm all over\nThe place he likes it really is a juicy\nThat's and that documentary and firefighters from Detroit because all those people have because the great white flight when all the white people left Detroit all those homes\nCome in there and they manage um they ah\nThey make more money off of burning the house and getting the insurance they then sell it and there are these people just like these homes on fires get the money so they're fighting fires all the time\nAnd these firefighters are bad as in the country and so they they go we most firefighters fight fires from the outside and we fight fires from the inside out they go in the house and put it out from the inside\nRight now there was a firefighter let's say that's gone that's what we do it too or is there are no way they can do about it I Love the blaze I mean [laughter]\nLive for the fire they live for the blame the blaze [laughter]\nWhat do you think you would be doing if you do if you weren't doing comedy\nIf I'd be a counselor really be a cause that was a counselor when I before I did comedy why is that\nPeople who are who I mean I can understand the immediate reaction of wanting to help\nBut largely in our teacher I was going to be an art teacher actually what can I tell you is how do art at all we did a little fart so find out what can you do I was painting and drawing and stuff like that that was fine I find out I was going to a oil painting\n... well I mean I I pay I started watercolor and God send you one of my work I was but I I was going to be told you I was I was not only pictures of a joke on your phone yeah I Do so we see yeah you wouldn't\nThis be amazing if there was a brilliant well I'm not I'm not good enough to be an artist and I have good enough to be an art teacher I was good enough to teach our kids but not\nLike your coach so right before Gary Goldman did last comic standing meet him and this other guy Garrett would do the same I think his name was rich words\nOr went to coffee bean and talk about our careers truck figure this is like a month before ... Gary got almost comic standing and he came and he sat down and he goes I think I'm just going to quit and I was like what and he goes I don't know I'm just gonna quit I'm going to quit I don't I don't think that\nThis is right and we're all like Gary and he goes I think I'm going to be\nI think ought to be a high school guidance counselor and we're like really and he was like yeah we go with the draw\nYou know where it goes so [laughter]\n[laughter]\nNot only is he going to solve it was a mother\nAnd then he got a standing of life to do that [laughter]\nNot\nYour mind is defend and by the way I got I think very Kennedy I think she did not I think she kind of probably use me to an extent and just like and was like\nI don't even Robert I got an agenda I'm ready to route real through and I just sat there and kind of took it I Know that that's what my friends that my friends my friends that I guess there were like dude why didn't you stand up yourself but it was like I don't know I just sat there like I don't want to kind of like a ...\nPart of the things you want to hear they have to say I do what I'm saying let them hang themselves but you do you were you afraid\nTo senator or did you just I don't know I I don't know the how many women were working at the store I don't know it was all about ... you you listen to it right yeah I just don't think Europe prepared for that ... well yeah and so\nIt's part of it and I'm being serious as part of the reason why you think in the back of the mind you want to be confrontational is because they get mad and walk out there for a walk out of your house no I'm Serious if you like I could personally or the studio right of the ...\nI never thought\nI'd\nCome on I said\nDon't [laughter] and just hold the screen door open to say that I'm cooler being confrontational with like with like a friend like Nicki Glazer came on\nAnd by that love Nicky and I was like I was like a ...

[laughter] while the the guy\nCame over the twenty two from the from the civil war and is one of the bag or it's headed\nAnd kill it but then I was scared when things coming out was rendered for the ... that's a good thing yeah yeah slightly\nYeah [laughter] I Want to go ... I don't my killing an animal I I have no problem with that I read it\nIn a yeah and I am and he tried to be here and I but I tell ya I I see so many during my neighborhood every morning that I think I'd have a hard time shooting here just because I I'm not saying you shouldn't do it but I don't I\nI Know like I never heard a nine hour you know I I wouldn't shoot again hogs are needed animals in Florida and you're allowed to kill them and you're doing more good I mean I Would\nDefinitely shootout I you know what I saw a guy doing that look awesome is a\n...\nHere's the problem with that so the way they do the ... have you ever seen them so they get they get the spears and they get above them but what they do is they get\nThey send the dog's after the hogs oh and the dogs get the hogs so now you've got two pit bulls or whatever they are growling and barking attacking the hog the hog squealing and then you have to go in there and just to have ... no no no no dreams ever talking about\nThe the guy they play a little scene at the bottom of the tree and the guy just sits in a tree stand to wait for the ... to come up and usually it's a pocket him and he's just stopped there literally just holding his sphere and then at the right time it just goes like this oh you're in his drops and he's got\nNo problem the end of it oh and you\nCan see it's just go funk and its name that and they go nuts\nAnd then you see 'em ... just hit the dirt and scared by that\nWe ... we want ... hogs in Hawaii with dogs but those wind pit bull is really it it's it's\nTelling you feel bad for the animal it really bad human and they're biting their biting in it and the\nHolding it down and you see like for animals holding a Hawk Down and then they're like they give you a knife that extend it in the heart and uh I gave it to my traveler I was with or triplets I was like does your vacation off\nOut [laughter] I like I said that but then they were like the network didn't like how happy we worry about killing it uh\nYeah so they they don't edited around it made a solemn\nServices such as like avatar and quite honestly [laughter] for Seventy I Love ... thank you for the life now he brought up\nBefore um but ah but yeah that that uh\nI don't remember probably ... killer did you kill somebody okay they're coming after you you've got a gun uh-huh 'cause you just shoot them that ... what would you shoot them devoid\nI give them like they're going to my wife let her film I shoot someone who wound up ... uh well I don't know if I could shoot someone I guess I I I play the scenario out my head if someone came in someone was in my backyard right yeah so like I Know like clearly there in one guy he's in my backyard and I see him my heart's racing I have my gum with me\nAnd I'm standing in my house I Would definitely wait until he got into my house and shoot him but even then there's a part of me that goes he's on drugs like I there was a homeless guy that broke into our front yard war during the renovation\nAnd I had a I had a gun I had a a a um ... you know a gun on them no air gun [noise] Reagan no I had a tiny guy had a ... gun I ... and uh\nHe broke into

that this was going to end okay I Know that he's just on drugs and he's arguing with me and so there's part of me that would play it out until the last second like I don't have that that George Zimmerman or but let me tell you is\nA is an George Zimmerman let me tell you the time ... you you let that guy go he comes back you take care of like I don't mean killing them yeah but you do

I'm old almost by just ... I think radio is great for you precedents Steve Eliot Todd and Tyler there's a lot of places but then you look at like other places where you go\nWhere you go it is just dying and certain markets that but that's because certain markets didn't change with the times in our mark you're on I'm speaking of my experience that we've seen mc Donald's restaurant disappearing on every corner you start saying you're not any Ronald smuggling video stations disappear you seen them change\nYou're seeing them go to different types of ... stations\nThat are in or wherever you are in one maybe automated now and they don't have a morning\nShow for you to come in and talk still have a very successful very fiscally a positive radio\nOr they have some a radio guy that ah you know probably been from some other state I never I don't ...\nI don't disagree that radios succeeding in certain places what I'm saying is being on the ground in the war\nI'm going into places where you used to do radio and now they're like oh yeah they all everyone's gotten fired we all they have is Mexican Radio on black radio right but the radio itself is still very successful they just realized Joe and Bob\nWe don't need to page on about two hundred grand a year we're still going to get it by playing Mexican Radio and then they play it so it's still very successful in our case yeah the the\nHeadline writer here at the top I just you know person now if I I use my cell phone with Sirius satellite radio ... and I use a podcast apt in my car I didn't I never ever ever turn my radio on average\n... year old or forty eight year old man\nAnd and but then the opposite the twenty two year old kid who doesn't know anything about radio all he is is like on his phone on Instagram Joey Joey just pass through the TV to be he didn't even want to TV because only watch his YouTube that's t._v. yeah but no but still the like\nJoe each generation when they get their first car do you think they're going to be like hey what channels uh\nRadio will be in your phone or in your car\nRadios already in your phone but everyone allow that shipped to the broadcast through radio is already in your phone and radio is already all the radio stations like you said I heart and tune in and all these broadcasts apps that broadcast that we've already been doing that for years we've already been now I listen to Katie you in New York and Florida all the\nTime I'm not sure I I'm not ... of rank and he was going to be a man on the wizard profit from\nWeight and tell me wait but now go back to what you're saying how many people have a ... not abortions but you were saying\nNo to how many really um I got a hundred percent because he was saying yeah there's no way not even close by so many people that still do have computers that have that are not using them the way we use them and there's so many people still pay for AOL\nYeah pay for AOL he's Robison was paying I didn't mean to a couple of years the only in dollars on people who are still paying for a oh yeah yeah that's a twenty four and in fact he told me that\nSell the Saturday but I'm saying is the thing that radio is not going to be in cars\nI don't know I was I was ... years no to that was simply making\nA an argument of like ... that's how we didn't know what I'm saying if you said to a millennial what would you rather have a fully functioning reclining in heating seat or radio they go oh give me the seat I think a millennia would look to the ... and it always generation lives in silence no they have their phones right it but\nThey're listening to radio on their phones they'll find their favorite shows endless on their phones\nIf you're playing music you're probably being pushed out by the genre you like country music you like a dancer who you are being pushed out by the music\nBut if you're a talk radio host whether it be on a morning show radio or on their political radio you still have a job and you were still very popular New York city the number one show in the mornings and towering left has been sports radio people like to hear other people's houses\nSo you're saying that radio still a viable it's still popular it's just what was popular\nJust changed just change so this is talk radio but that's how it's always Mac show him they involve it evolved and it just changes and then it is evolving into into\nAll other mediums how many how many how many years ago that we have on TV and now every radio station does that where they have a video component with\nTheir radio show let me ask a question what what is this we're doing right now this is a hobby number what is this what do you mean there's a podcast or is this on the radio\nFor us it's already for us yeah Russia's a radio show but we're looking at things in a hobby it's a business for some people but every Ninety percent of what I as a hobby yeah yeah it's a hobby and it's a waste of time\nAnd it's guys who you listen to be on your this'll be on your channel yeah well I'll be at the science letters uh this weekend and I urge day friday and Saturday or if you sign of a gun don't uh sell the place out\nWhile ... language like that I don't know how many people are going to show up but I just don't want to have had another well yeah [laughter] there's only been four thousand I'm\nJust trying to write ... now there are too many comedians that come in and do good radio with shows like ours and presidents Steve in LA and as you mentioned and they're like God damn as easy I could do that and ... why do we get cut out the middle guy and then they do their own show and they're like little guy and we can we can function and we\nNow know no no no didn't I was saying this right now I Do it if you stuff I live in the shed I Do the pie cast\n... doing what you do I don't ... I Am not I can give you can do it I have fun doing it I like doing it but I did that like when when you do an interview or when you talk to somebody for eating a shallow along with more than one person or just an interview you one on one\nHaving that room and pushing it forward and directing staring at you it's a gift\nYou know that's I guess you know in that sense for\nThe touch for Opie 'cause obey doesn't get the credit for the I only I Know I always say you're not doing well but I but people do you have to obey obey is a ... always wanted to change the subject and he always wants to move things along when Anthony and Jim are so funny 'cause you need a guy after a while to steer it into the next round here that are now yeah I've been on my show with\nI mean some of the I mean Burt and you're talking about the sunny alpha comics and to steer like here's what you realize if I'd be like oh I've done it before I'm going to go to the bathroom\nJust take over the show birth tried to do whatever it was in with us it's it's hard man it's really hard to do just to keep to show moving\nJust staring at let people talk brings coming up\nAnd down the ...
