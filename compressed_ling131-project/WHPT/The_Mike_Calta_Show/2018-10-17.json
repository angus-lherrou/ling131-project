seems to me like the guy that I can think of where in the store and there's something on Russia goes to stay behind me I got this yeah get out of anything uh speaking of security I finished watching a mystery of between\n... they love it yeah it's really good best it's best show I've seen on time yeah I like a lot yeah I don't but I don't know I feel like it's I feel like we joined it in the third season like I Need to know more no that's the that's the first I Know but I'm just saying like I feel like I Need to know more about this guy we need to fight the\nLast episode I liked what he did the very end with the other guy out I was hoping that was going to happen I was like OK respect you know what I mean yeah it's\nA it's it's a good show it's called Mr in between it's on a FX\nSome people tell me and like the first episode and watch I watch all their only about forty minutes long I think they're half hour or ... or so or they go quick but there it's really enjoyable\nAnd some people have said that they had to put the subtitles on their Australian and they're actually I Believe it was that bad no there was a couple a couple of things where you're like man I don't know a a Jim good morning rather Mike how the show\nHey like a I think that the lake when city commissioner actually old that store\nNow duty on the ... added that day when we talked about the said he can't do this unless he owns a store if he owns ... but even in this case he's wrong he's never going to be\nOh no I'm not saying you know all by saying that you're reporting it that he doesn't own it he didn't stop at all that stuff he does all this story is everything that then this story\nAlso it also makes jokes funny or that if you didn't write ... ah here's how things are a ... rather shut up if he owns the store\nAnd he has a right to protect the goods that are in the store right or hold the guy there uh in till the cops come a but in this case here I chasing him outside and shooting them outside I don't think he's going to get away with that\nI don't know it's just it's odd that we don't we really don't know like everybody's so confused about what the laws are I just can't believe if someone was murdered over a hash it like that it's not over ... million loan explain to you if this guy does in fact owned the store\nOkay and the other guy is leaving he's not just leaving with the hatchet he's leaving with stuff that you have worked years to to save your money to build this business is clearly not a Walmart is a mom and pop store and why should he have to\nLet you steal from him I mean granted you don't want to kill the guy but you can understand where the guy is like I worked so long and so hard to get this door open and make this mine and now you think you're just gonna walk in here and take my stuff away from me take food out of my kids mouth\nThat's what makes you get angry like that yeah now now is it worth killing a guy over no that's the thing is though you\nKnow here's the deal the guy Mike Dunn who is the Lakeland city commissioner he actually does on the story that they bats Army Navy surplus okay yeah and he does actually on the store yeah so I thank you for bringing that up so we were wondering about yesterday and I never\nFollowed up on it now uh that that may change the law a little bit in his favor because you're allowed to use force to hold the guy you know the cops right\nBut he is literally like the guys leaving and he's trying to pull them back into the store and stuff and shoot some I mean it was you're allowed to detain the guy yeah try no way you could easily just tall and I'd wonder why they go yet there is here's description here's a video of him what he looks like and everything\nAnd that he has his gun out while he's holding I'm like almost ... like it looks like he's preparing to do\nThat well because he's a guy who knows how to handle a weapon right you know and look he probably can front of the guy the guy tried to go he pulled a gun out I Would have said hey stay right here I'm I'm ... I'm going to shoot them not really sure but\nThat's the thing is like this guy is having a very emotional response to situation that I Would have been handled by right\nNow if I thought that I legally have no ah\nRepercussions from it a shot of yeah I don't take my stuff don't come into my\nIs that I worked for years to try and establish to keep this open to feed my family to do what I have to do to maintain as a commissioner and a store owner and the community and be a good upstanding citizen now you think you're gonna Walton even take myself\nI ... I ... I don't ... I don't want to die that's what I ... I I guess just for me I don't believe a human life I but I understand the origin of it usually work\nToday and there's a guy in your car rummaging through this stuff in your car and you had your watch in the console and he's taking your watch and he's about to take off you can grab 'em you can you can shoot him and get your watch back\nI don't know if I'd shoot him but I Try to buy them how to manage here's again you're here's ... you have your gun\nAnd it's legal for you to shoot him no repercussion repercussions whatsoever you know here's I honestly don't think I could shoot a guy two things one is they have a lawyer Harry quoted as saying the law specifically says you cannot\nI repeat cannot use deadly force to protect a property crime ... you can detain them yeah you're gonna you can use as I wanted to know them and hold them there until the police come yeah yeah I also like I'm telling you right now I as a as a normal human being I Know you can't shoot a guy\nThat leaving your place you can shoot him in the belly and and ah you're not taking the repercussions of killing someone I think that's in a way I knew a lot hobby [laughter] I [laughter]\nI I'm Down in the right now you have a ... year old daughter's crying and you're paying a huge how my dad eyes eyeball is he's a piece of garbage and he's had to steal from my kittens but he was beaten when he was a kid and he has a drinking\nProblem and on and on all we all had family problems before listen I well I feel bad\nFor the twelve year old girl short you out of using I'm going to lose one second asleep over over that you're I'm just telling you I'm a horrible person that way I think you would have to go through it to know that for\nA okay yeah I I Know\nYou're thinking that and I understand the hey don't take for me and the only thing that I Would weigh on me is whether or not I'm going to go to jail maybe you know all clarity not going to go to jail now if I shot a guy over the hatch it\nOr maybe right now much as a ... by what am I got in a confrontation with a guy and the guy pulled a knife I mean I shiny yellow eyes and the way that my way and he started swinging the hatch that yeah yeah ... right there\nI Would I'd be laying in bed planned my little had brought a ball game and that would be wise rather Bob good morning on the Mike Alva show\nHow the gal good Bob\nSo like interest as well how does that story and that he does not that he should have shot him but like this shovel super excited nervous crazy looking guy comes to a store filled with items ills single hatchet and tries to make that what happens after that\n... you know the other end of the story was\nSo where is Glenn yeah yeah so it's not a very big community the guy had an excellent surveillance system you can see the whole shooting on tape or are they they take his picture they floated around and they find the\nGuy who did it or are you at the ... the guy\nDid it I didn't need the patch it for like you can't shop live with it if you're not going camping and like you know it's an argument that\nIt's an Army Navy Stuart perhaps he went in there to look around southern ... there was like I like to have those but I Want to pay for it\nOr serial killer\nBy that's always good to pick the worst crimes you I mean ... to ... he's the guys it's not he's not traveling would for fire he's probably a serial killer maybe ... game [laughter] maybe his name with Jason yeah I mean I don't know what the deal is uh Justin good morning good points or\nDon't reward I got there what's happening now much\nWill share is

he just got tired of people still cars are tired of the first time so they sold out of there and ah you know my personal belief is I think it's going to be charged with murder and if she still has to be rude to the city council\nTo I think some level on a wall there's there's all ... states church but he tried to cry you have to have a nice city council but I'm also that you should have shots or there's other ways to go but I think also you just heard of people still going to get it started out in the world\nAnd that very possible I mean you if you're a guy who owns a business and and ...
