Would think and I love Pete I Love Pete I think he's a nice guy he's certainly a great baseball player but he is autograph is so diluted that it's not worth the ball that it's written on\nOh ... you

I'm like I Can't imagine\nThat there was enough speed on the bridge at that hour to get it wow from end to that car I mean I the cars destroyed noise no tires left by the whole crime is gone I didn't say what happened when a north bound lanes according to far higher because of the crash occurred\nRight here in their fourth street man a meanwhile another crash to slow down or not it doesn't several Carmen\nThat cars unrecognizable I Can't even tell you what kind of car was afford or red cars all I can tell you I'm In the front end is back into the into the front of the car and that looks at the batteries on the floor I mean it's\nA I have an update the deadly crash on Howard Franklin bridge was a result of a wrong way driver oh going south down in the north bound lanes the driver under the influence of alcohol hit a car that a third car ran into that ...\nOr the wrong way driver died I ...\nI I was just about to say good too good but certainly better than the other people\nDie down all around and will that like you said it's better him because he is the cause and if you're going to be drinking and driving like\nHow do you not know so if he got on fourth street here how did you go the other way so he's got an island in the ... no I I bet he got on when this man\nBecause you know you'd think these people that are drunk driving and they close their eyes and they think they're closing their eyes for a second but you know they could they have the right clothes for\nSo he was or he or she I don't even know I Would have had to have gone up and gone I crossed and gone on the ramp no because it was going\nOh he's always north not always I okay when it did was it went down when over here like we go home right and then when I got to the bottom made a left\nJesus you know what I'm saying ...\nAnd when that gives it was we went to oncoming traffic wow I mean if that's the fourth street Israeli entrances right here in North bound would have been that way but it was going the wrong way so we got our own Illinois I found is going to Tampa right so he was coming from within ... hours ... it's a north I'm Elaine\nWas headed north bottles north on land that got shot and he came on at the fourth street so what are you what he probably did was go to get on and decided he had to go south bound and tried to make a left and there and you over the media right I I I saw a guy the other day\nWho wasn't that big of a deal but it it was that it was a dead street but he turned and instead of going why they went to Jordan eternity is of attorney when he was coming right out of me but he quickly jumped yeah amen imagine that it eighty miles an hour and a guy driving and all of a sudden you see the car in front of you\nRight or if you're adding on the doors family the two Seventy five it is a close right now how would Franklin so you're going to have to\nIt's gonna be awhile awful ah Dennis ... you know he passed away the other day from the uh the bunny rabbit I Do I like that she was a good guy or well the ranch was shut down immediately after the owners that\nThat was the sole owner of the famous brothel and no one else is legally permitted to run the business the law branch had it's a prostitution and liquor license stripped\n'cause that was the only name on the paperwork or an apparently shares have been trying to close the law branch ever since then is announced he was running for state assembly sell as soon as he died and it was done so because he was the only one on the paperwork\nNo he didn't put like ... like any business partner a lawyer like against that hoping\nI guess not crazy to think that that's been such a staple out there that I knew about it since I was a kid running HBO and now I'll never be able to go there's a lot of places like\nThat like a for instance my brother owns a gentleman's clubs and they are grandfathered in and won one of them so if they were two salads if the person wouldn't have be able to have another strip club really yeah\nThey unless they sold the business to them completely and nice to build a are just that not just that building and that strip club whatever yet or staying out of the way their grandfather than just a little you know laws change as they all along so\nYou do that um when David Wells played for the Yankees the second time he had an apartment on the Upper East side of Manhattan that was a three bedrooms it's pretty big lead living room dining room and a very small kitchen was seven thousand dollars a month okay\nMy uh ... their extended members of my family it was my grandmother's best friend call me when they were growing up in Manhattan lived on the same street as Martin Scorsese is family all live in a lizard with street in New York\nAnd everybody assumes moves or die except for ... sons who still live there in a rent controlled apartment ... about Francis Ford Coppola bought the whole first for about an apartment building for millions and millions of dollars\nThe brothers live upstairs and pay a hundred and twenty five dollars and my wife a rock and a pot in soho like one of the most\nSought after the words to live in a hundred and twenty five dollars a month rent now I think the downside to that is that they can't make any major upgrades and the environment so I think that they're bath tub might be in their kitchen but I Would live with that because what they do is they live in the apartment for a hundred and twenty five dollars\nAnd then they rent out a bedroom like Yahoo a guy for like eight hundred dollars or so three people live in the house and they're actually making six hundred and something dollars a month\nOr to live in places still do that rent control you know you you had to have been grandfathered okay I Can't just he had already controlled apartment she was a that I really will have to be All right though yeah\nOr some sports news at the same speed the ravens this weekend Drew Brees will become the third quarter back to have defeated all thirty two team oh wow yeah the only other to to do it our our Brett Farr and Peyton Manning so he'll be in good company\nAnd then also Adam been a Terry the colds kick her age just ten points away from surpassing more than ... mark\nOf two thousand five hundred and forty four points which is the NFL's all time scoring record and MORNING EDITION was sixty forty head so I think really Terry ... forty five all MORNING EDITION was like Fifteen yeah a military who ah three weeks ago eclipse Anderson's record for field goals in a career\nHas reached a a double digit point total in a single game three times the season so it seems like he could possibly do that beat that record this week he will do that and Drew Brees will do it and Drew Brees will I don't know if\nThey're going to win this weekend but Drew Brees will also be the all time a passing the he'll pass far for all of ...\nAnd it's unbelievable 'cause Drew Brees I bet if you walk past them in the mall yah this guy around the office for [laughter] a there is a rumor or speaking of football there is a rumor that\nWas NFL's first choice for the super bowl halftime show but she turned them down because she disagrees with the stance on the national anthem really yeah so she's not doing that halftime show who's around a hundred and five oh five I ... in Atlanta\nKaty Perry again I'm I'm Adam er and five doing is\nNo no but everyone is kind of upset that they take more than five for laying out because it's such like a hip hop or yeah staple I like you can't find someone in hip hop like literally just had beyond the Bruno Mars you got out of who they had\nThem all yeah I think ... gonna bring out outcasts and that would be cool All right well why not I don't I don't know\nI mean does a great those are the best ones yeah find a a key band that's going to do it and it's surrounded with local talent from Maria ... is a good bad right\nAble to play this stuff and they can play funky cool stuff whatever's that'd be cool to have them come out do a collaboration but maybe some of the other get a big uh what's uh Atlanta horn section what are they called the lemon rhythm section Lenora this actually yeah that's a whole\nNot like ludicrous I share like you know what I mean there are major yeah but like I mean that would be cool to see like I say are out there\nI got to be
