{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WHPT", "content": "Yeah no kidding in Titusville we have a grandma hall last friday morning who got up and went up to look for the kitty cat that she's smart old Penelope Peterson hey by name Penelope\nShe's All right so but now there's an analogy is a grandma and she's going out to look for the kitty cats but whenever Penelope goes outside before she goes outside she does something smart she lives up the blinds like grad is Gladys rabbits and she looks out make sure nobody's out there\nSo she gets up to let the kitty cat and friday morning she opens up the blind and there are some guy twenty eight year old ...\nMake it by getting GI rating on our front porch well this lady wasn't sure what to do so instead of running a call nine one one she figured she'd scared of this guy she didn't grabbing I've she didn't grab a gun\nShe took out her dentures and walked out on the porch and duck our hands in the air like Barrett claws and said granny no tea [laughter] scared this guy off the porch and he took off running for Middle East found him naked down the street and they do believe alcohol is a factor\nWhich my mother or the guy got to be the guy that drive to admit coming up with no teeth trucks get\nGranted she has former experience a law enforcement so she said she wasn't scared but grandma coming out without a deep and she's screaming ... years\nAnd finally a story that just kills me out of St Louis a woman in Missouri filed a federal lawsuit last week claiming that high school officials\nYou know with age discrimination and sex discrimination after her son failed to make the varsity soccer team and then wasn't allowed to play junior varsity the woman only identified as Jane Doe in court documents is asking for restraining order against the school\nAn injunction so her son can be put back on the soccer team apparently her son played for the junior varsity team at this school\nTried out for the varsity team now if you don't make it to the varsity team and the coach said he just wasn't that good\nWe have so many kids trying out we have so many spaces he just wasn't that good at is what happens so in this school there's a rule that if you go from junior varsity and you try out for varsity and you don't make varsity\nYou're done because there's an open slot now on junior varsity and there's an up and coming player were already putting in that position so he went to go try out for varsity\nFailed miserably and now his mom is suing the school she wants him immediately put back on the junior varsity team she says it's age discrimination because he is getting older as a student and it's also sexual discrimination because they don't have the same rules for the girl's first city team\nWhy people like to find loopholes all she does not want compensation in her lawsuit she's just saying she wants her son reinstated the judge is going to hear that case today and make a rule\nSo what what what does that have to go to court because if that you put that kid on the team you might have to cut it a little kid\nYou put the kid on the team and he's going to be miserable because of his teammates or oh you think the rats and the kids going to get in high school your mommy mommy put you back on the team and maybe this kid saying Jesus mom come on just let it go I'm not that good I seriously that's what I'd be ...\nHim to play more than he does if you look into it I bet he didn't work out much he wouldn't didn't take it serious and they may because it's not for\nEveryone you know what not every body is going to succeed not\nEverybody is good at everything they try though I have tried many things in life that I failed miserably and I walked away from it and I learned a lesson I've had my ass beat in sports before when I'm late pop Warner when I played little league when I wrestled in school I didn't win every time nobody and how I walked away from that loss\nWas going to how I'm going to act in the future or in there and cry about it you can be down about it or you can look back on it and say here's\nWhere I screwed up and here's where I Need to improve or get to the point to say maybe this isn't for\nMe maybe I got to get bigger stronger faster maybe I Need to get better at\nMy college you like to have this misfit as a mom she's not helping all she she's not helping him she is not helping the whole situation and if the kid if the judge rules today to put him back on the team as kids high schools or what's left of it doomed\nWell I suppose might be doing it might I might get to a point you can't cut the players any more\nThan that a bunch of crap man well everybody's a winter man here's your trophy ...\nHello all good All right my kept us coming up and have a good that

watch it I'm not a gives in fact I Believe I own it I think I did buy it before one of our trips I just never gotten around\nBut uh the hot thing that everybody is watching and raving about was the Mr Rogers documentary and I also know that there was a movie being filmed with Tom Hanks where he plays Mr Rogers and they released pictures of him did you\nSee that yes we talked about a lot of guilt yeah which is funny because a colon hangs played both writers on a Drunk History oh really yeah 'cause I I I was watching a documentary and go I think oh and hangs would make a good young Fred Rogers even more so I watch the uh\nThe show\nI have to tell you it was the most boring God damn thing I've ever seen now now I Want to go back to everybody\nTold me it was good and punched him in the face now there are a few different uh\nDocumentaries out there about Mr Rogers this is the will you be my neighbor one that everybody's talking about the new one okay because\nThe viral video of him appealing that Congress to get twenty million dollars for a public television was pretty impressive it was it was it was almost like that was a movie because you have this real Italian\nYou know tough guy congressmen news cheap on the budget didn't want to give them the money and everybody was coming into play in our case and he was getting away with them there Mr Rogers came in he was like well I guess you just got your twenty million back\nLike you want them over and in the documentary alerted Mr Rogers is definitely a sweet guy\nAnd that he was genuine and he wasn't creepy and he wasn't gay and uh I never thought he was gay but he uh he did get questioned on that a lot and one of the guys on the show was gay and he said that the amount of time that I spent a Fred Rogers I never once or one sign that he might be homosexual\nUh but you know that he was just a legit guy who had a genuine care for children in the upbringing of children and it was in my story but it was one of the most boring guy damn documentaries I've ever watched in my life quite possibly one of the greatest middle names of all time by the way I don't know what's going on and it is Fred\nMick feely Roger semester\n... illegal Israeli them to yeah [laughter] that interesting yeah\nYeah and and are you on TALK low budget I mean half the\nHave the staff of him and his wife and he did all the pumping voices and they write I wrote a ton of songs and oh yeah yeah I was a trains a pianist I liked it it was it was really I watched it and it was sweet for a couple of minutes and I thought Jesus Christ they're going to be some sort of conflict here on this thing\nI mean even his death was wasn't even that big of a deal ... you know um there wasn't any choke up moments it was just all\nIn my life like a huge advocate for like public television and stuff like that like he did a lot of charity work\nHe started he basically gave them they were there was public television was established\nAnd they had a lab channels for learning and stuff and he started there he was going into the ministry and then he saw that the TV and he was like I think I'm gonna do that instead so he went and he worked on one of those uh those shows\nHe said but those solo budget there was so bad that he knew he'd have to come up with something else or go back to the ministry and then he invented by accident Mr Roger's neighborhood\nAnd you know and they show they show things though that Facebook is already ruined like he he during a time where everybody was you know racism was really bad\nAnd they were ah they were kicking ... a black kids at a public pools ... and uh uh he would incorporate black folks into his show in in good positions or you know with good jobs and stuff and then he would subliminally\nShow you him like he shared a a he was sitting in a little kid\nHe pulled right and they invited a black gentleman to step in the beginning won't put his feet in there with him and and it was just him showing you there was okay to be in the pool of black people out I already saw that stuff on Facebook now when\nI watched a documentary I Know all these ... get with me to tell me about the one guy that ah who's getting a little to make really with another guy\nWell I mean but how about that or I should or other documentary you didn't even know my feeling was his middle name I did I Know I like that I kind of job out after a while if we had that on was the story of how he came up with the show at least interesting you know now that was my ... now\nThey have actually a book so he worked at this uh the station\nWhere they had a free movie used to show like they were but they weren't real real and he said the problem free movies they're old and sometimes a tape breaks so they run the movie and the tape break so there's a they need a secondary said it\nSo he had this woman who was unsaid and she was just kind of blank face and he popped the hole with a little\nPuppet through the thing it was like oh I'm On the saga that tell us public you know [laughter]\nYeah All right you don't have any backup movies that you like bought that you can watch well\nYeah yeah yeah but I mean I I was also watching the bucks game and you know I but I I thought I I you know let me give it a shot sometimes you know I I got this documentary one time a minimal Islam and the first ten minutes I was like you have\nThese guys just kind of ... so they have to church as high a but then I gave a time and I watch and it was an excellent documentary um you know sometimes you just need to give things a little bit more time at ... his stand up comedies but it's like every ten minutes I didn't like it galvanize only keep watching it and I thought it was for getting whole area so\n[noise]\n[noise]\nOh no you can't buy or sell a the fitzpatrick era of Tampa Bay buccaneers ended at four games though is taboo was a force to shuffle quarterback send a blow out last Sunday that was so bad\nThat here is what joke coach dark color add to say about the game and what was going on and listen to last\nNovember I rented in all aspects of both they owe us thanks based on ... we couldn't make enough changes we should fire every person that was on it and feel today starting to me that was I was arrested\nOh fire or Buddy Guy will uh they've played terrible but the one person I Need to fire is my expensive defensive coordinator because there is no defense on this team\nAnd we have no running game whatsoever we cannot run that ball for more than four yards at a time bomb maybe you guys will pick up a ... I mean right now it'd be worth trading wherever we have to\nTrade together ... uh you can't blame anything I've fitzpatrick for that for that came be it would the Fitch magic ... I think that everybody was okay ... now now if you'd say well we were trying and uh you know it wasn't it wasn't as\nPatrick and no no no but I think that was a good time for them if they were going to put James back in half time okay I see what goes on and he didn't do anything you know did it but it's Patrick who had died three four hundred yards passing games to lead the box to a two to one record was bold after the first apple to Chicago Bears and British replaced\nBy Jamie It's Wednesday and an eight forty eight to ten defeats so Winston that I had one\nTouchdown pass right or was a even a pass I dunno they scored seven points in the second half they had three in the first seven in the fact he I don't like watch to see whether he threw I'd rather not somebody ran an or whatever but uh\nYeah I don't think it was like Oh thank God yeah Jay Mrs back I mean I Know the GEOSET that but I don't know if he feels like that after the yeah yeah didn't seem like he did a a ton of stuff\nI I was just I didn't I was embarrassed for the team and it sucks now there were two into\nA but this next game really got to be really good now James comes out in the sex of the joint or do they do at that point they put fifty back in a half time what do they do now you gotta keep ... yeah when the only person that said they send the pre game or a scholar coward he said\nJames is there a guy James should be starting you should go in it's Patrick got lucky I mean I met on it\nThey put all their money in their hand they do they say they've invested every so much into right he can't just turn your back on it now but he doesn't have a beard a tragic\nOh you're going out is that right ... yeah you find is that the heart of the bandwagon and ... you should send us the a team with Bill Cosby in Paris subway for the new show I haven't made him\nOut of my favorites or have you with all the cat to yeah a lot of ... I I think that game was doing from the START I remember I said last week it didn't matter who started that game it was going to be bad for either James or ride this patch because the bears defenses crazy\nYeah fares are all over them and then and our defense I mean when they they made the plane trip there\nI didn't see that I think they tribute ski without Ford six touchdowns almost tied the league record which I write you know Peyton Manning that seven\nRight and he and he did something in Chicago I hadn't done since Nineteen forty something\nYou'll yeah that was the last time I mean a ... scout quarterback and thrown for more than like five touchdowns and you for sex\nIt was just a bad day or so what's the next game\nOh we play the falcons in Atlanta two hours from now have stuck by week next week and then fell couldn't falcons in the back here for the browns\nThat that's a lot of work for a\nFor a dream is a lot of time down time to get back in and what do you think people do now with all the fake beards and the T shirts in like ... where it's fitzpatrick back in before the end of the nonsense now all I'm now I'm On I'm saying could be because injury to because I'm we see fitzpatrick in within the within three games\nAnd ... outside of injury I don't think that's happened right there\nYeah I mean it's going to be and if it is an injury it's a minor injury by no means chopping it up because he doesn't want to be here anyway so he wants to\nWatch the show here's how it goes really here's how it goes Jay must starts the next three games they go a one into the next three games he gets hurt fitzpatrick comes ... comes in takes some of the playoffs yeah yeah yeah right they lose in the first time now that the [laughter]\nNow I Know you're right that would that be\nBecause the buck they finally played a defense that was good\nAnd you know they couldn't get a winning issue that because you figure how do we shut down Drew Brees well that we didn't ... that was a high scoring game the first three or four games were all high scoring shootouts teams are putting up tons of points on us\nBut nobody was really pay attention because fitzpatrick was just killing it yeah you know throwing for time like it was big shoot out of high scoring games now when we met a defense and stop the fact that we have no run game\nAnd we're just you know only passing through the air\nI mind this music but I don't know who won last night to Pittsburgh limb and I'm Sorry\nYeah you guys aren't one two and one I yeah I should not happen in the NFL no loss it's not really anything\nBut a lie and everybody will stick with the game while it was being played out yeah baseball and the tall thinning I reserve and I'm going to\nHappen like can they have over time\nThey have overtime but if they don't score and overtime win over time runs out then it's a tie what they should do overtime win over time runs out they started with the ... and they go from fifty yards and they keep on moving it back five yards until one Mrs right aren't easy enough yeah you know how it works at a do over and it's all the pressure\nThat like the NHL how they do like a shoot out like a kickoff yeah college\nYou have to go for two points after a certain point it both teams were touched down right then the next time it'll be scored a touchdown again you have to go for two and that usually you know breaks with the game\nOr you do like quarterback challenge and you have the tires\nMaking now I think you know\nIn hockey when they do like to shoot outs yeah something like that\nOh yeah I'm thing reports because I have to say no I said oh All right the Spanish over the weekend was at a sports bar and grill yeah that makes it easy ... you're a foreigner and you show up at American you're like where do we want to lose ...
