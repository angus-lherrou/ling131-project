[laughter] I even have an office or the ... job and he's got to the news\nWe have a new city um reciting bombs were ...\nWell that's the big story someone send bombs to several high profile Democrats over the past few days including the Clintons Brock Obama former attorney general Eric Holder\nAnd congresswoman Maxine Waters and Debbie Wasserman Schultz I didn't even hear about Eric Holder yeah yeah there's a lot man bombs were also sent a former CIA director John Brennan all of it on Brennan should get by and of course it started out with George Soros\nOr the or do you think that they are mad at that are like at the source has got to early yeah yeah and I also got to do the same day maybe they maybe they live close to him a re I started looking there how about that\nAnd also the CNN or New York bureau\nAh fortunately none of the bombs went off in the authorities were able to intercept\nSome of them before they got to their targets they all seem to be connected since they were built in the same way and they all used to watch 'em and shoulders office as the return address oh they are saying yeah everybody out of Miami the FBI says that they're a top priority to investigate who sent them\nAnd they warned or more should be out there as well and of course we just found out breaking news a a package similar to those sent to CNN and the Democrats and all these people I was sent to uh the New York restaurant owned by actor Robert De Niro\nYeah finance below Seattle open the the mail today for a couple of weeks no I'm trying to think a a high profile Democrats or um\nOr if I'm like if I what's your name a bull Damien Chuck Schumer should not open their mouth right yeah a lot of people yeah but uh it's crazy though I mean no matter what side you are on who you're like oh my God that's just insanity right there\nAre so CNN was actually reporting on them and then had to evacuate in the middle of live coverage about their bombs here is uh the CNN report listen to that so there's a few different things and then they actually wind up having to leave because you hear the fire alarm go off in the back\nThe FBI you saying that they were rudimentary but functional that means they were explosive devices and to have projectiles another\nExcuse me that sounds like a fire alarm here will keep you posted on that but the projectiles that that is a a picture you'll often see in bomb the terrorists you didn't\nGet a house where ISIS has used that kind of ... we're going to jump in their ... their monitored in the background we're going to find out what the latest news out here I back then were to be right back but we're\nOutside the family all of our colleagues do we know are are outside right now everyone has said we were told that they should a package of CNN evacuated\nImmediately the light shut off we walked down the pike and you're out you're they're now moving I at Gemini and everyone here from CNN all the way down the block towards ninth avenue very far away\nHow crazy that recording I didn't let it happen to you I was watching Fox News on my way home while this happened and Fox News reporting on Fox News sent the guy on my cell phone over to stand outside the city and they're building a report on over there yeah I I mean it's crazy it was very similar to the unfolding of nine eleven\nIt was happening and as it's happening you're going All right something's happening right now thankfully there was no destruction involved and it was just chaos but\nIt ... it reminded me of that day gives that morning you're like oh ... that's awful what is going right okay oh wow in the Pentagon and now all of a sudden these are just unfolding in there so I mean the thankfully nobody has been hurt but who knows what else is happening uh what else is planned what was supposed to happen right you know\nYou're not also when it comes to the un and they have\nAnd called out for faking stuff\nYeah well I don't I don't think that you know you think that fake\nThis happens as your reporting like that since no coincidental\nNow it's not there twenty four hours a day new but also it all kind of happened carbon in the same window yesterday I Know towards the end of the show we heard about one packets in another packages and CNN had their package and you know they were having a\nGood conspiracy though that was true they wind up finding out that they fake that are oh man over to anyone\nBut would anyone be surprised because I get that CNN has been called out and now you know what I mean like news yeah\nAfter nine eleven there was a couple of instances where somebody would send a white powder in the mail anthrax right yeah\nAnd then a couple of people in the media got and don't think we've been sit around and go what if we send our shows just how come out or I mean they will but just enough to get the press out of it and then we went you and your guide their mind\nAnd then we didn't do it but I mean we were in desperate for pension\nBy so I told you about that garbage human that a wind up dying ... taxi bill ... audio guide whatever he wound up uh there was something where there's water bill or something or whatever and he sent powder and was it was a yeah yeah\nI mean you're just that it it was the dumbest thing in the world man uh so President Trump signed a bill yesterday those are meant to address the opioid crisis or he took a few minutes beforehand to talk about the bomb threats here as President Trump talking about that\nIt's a full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable acts to justice\nAnd I just wanted to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together\nAnd send one very clear strong mistake message that acts or threats and political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America is a very bipartisan statement I can tell you from both sides we both agree on that\nDisagree just conduct is abhorrent to everything we hold dear and sacred as Americans we're extremely angry upset unhappy about what we would this this morning and we will get to the bottom of it\nI always love how Trump uses like he four or five words for the same\nWord you know like you had to make it at night yeah stop once he starts yeah can't stop saying I'd rather that unhappy not fulfilled\n... little angry that would be great yeah it would be awesome yeah so the best ever get worse as it goes on\nA really fantastic I Hillary Clinton talked about the bomb scare while campaigning for Democrats and right here in Florida did you know she was here in Florida I did I hear she is talking about the bomb threats\nWe are fine thanks to the men and women of the secret service or who intercepted\nUh the package and dress she was long before it made its way into our home every day we are grateful for their service and commitments and obviously I never never more than\nToday but it is a troubling time isn't it and it's a time of\nDeep divisions\nAnd we have to do everything we can to bring our country together\nIce had bomb threats I should've said Bob scared 'cause there was actually ... cents so that's yeah a scare in Idaho right yeah it's absolutely crazy so I'm sure we're going to hear every year and a lot more about this in the days coming here and stuff and the FBI like I said it's a top priority ...\n[noise] I got to think that it is you take it to one single person\nI Do yes that's my theory is that it's one single person\nAnd that person is crazy not politically motivated like I'm saying that like a Democrat sending it out as a Republican to make the Republicans look bad not a uh I just think it's one of those super crazy a Trump supporters\nThat as well All right yeah yeah I\nHave a feeling though that there is more than one person there's definitely a leader one\nPerson is getting into the roof or no I don't think it's like a group I think it's like him in is a cause in him and his yeah his wife helped out to Seattle when the DC Sniper was I was a kid right like uh\nAround the holidays are not many other times as well one of my favorite dishes I'll tell you right now yeah I Love this\nDish dark as our door shows Reilly is the woman that gave the world green bean casserole yes yeah well you should have said it I

I mean I I think a lot of my friends left you know when I started I started with like\n... or tae and Jason today 'cause that's where it was a great group we all started together and so then when they all left that kind of felt like I lost a lot of it for him\nAnd uh and then they bleach shake came in you know started writing to it became really good friends or or help me uh it it also just the thought of work you know when you're working with a friend that makes it a lot easier\nYeah and then also when you do weekend update and that your main thing they kinda they let that be your thing you don't have to worry about doing other sketches right\nYeah no I mean occasionally though you know someone to write something for us but which is fun too if you just pop in and do it but it's a generally it's a lot it's enough to worry about we cannot that and also writing stuff so it's a it's the it's the job\nPlus your your words for you good looking and you got like a you got that news guy head on your shoulders and you got news and the news had so it looks like you belong I got that\nNews had yeah yeah [laughter] uh what are you\n[laughter] we're talking about ... who's going to be at the Capitol theater tonight at eight o'clock there are few tickets available seven to seven Seventy nine seven nine one Seventy four hundred a if you want to get them and go see him and uh I I've been\nTo a couple of the Senate alive tapings and I'm like you said he remembered\nYeah so I saw what I Do remember\nThe first time I went when I was trying to impress my now wife was that my girlfriend and you get a David Wells replacing the Yankees a good friend of mine he got me tickets so I'm like sitting right outside of the ... box John C.

I was fired apartment and she ... she was a doctor with the fire department and then my dad was in engineering taught that no tech\nOh so you're you're destined for Martin is like your smart parents like my dad was a my dad was reactions officer and my mother worked on like a diner\n[laughter] are they I mean my parents were very smart and I think that's partially why they did not understand what I wanted to do comedy of the job\nUm but they it faithfully I work at the one show that they know like I was working at robot chicken they would probably wait what\n[laughter] but Saturday Night live when you grow up in New York that's like that's like playing little league and they're playing for the Yankees\n[noise] it's crazy yeah it's a very it was a place I always wanted to eat but you can't when you're starting out ... I I couldn't even let myself think about being married 'cause he gets so possible so you just try to think like I'll do any job and then hope you get there so but you kinda can't even\nThink that er drives you crazy you know\nAnd then you get now being ah the anchor weekend update that's the comics bothered me not only a handful of people have done it over the years you'll go down in history as one of the better weekend update host over overtime\nEm thanks I mean I it's pretty also very overwhelming thing\nGiven you don't think you don't when did you you don't think about like I asked slashed one time as you realize that long after you're dead\nThat hat and that guitar that long hair will live on forever and he was like I never really thought about it the long after you're dead and then time I would probably still on the air and Seth Meyers is producing it they'll you'll be listed as one of the a long running host a week and I think that's a big deal\nLight hair wall so\nLive on like yeah because you have news had [laughter] avenue might need that [laughter]\nI don't remember old news had yeah he was good [laughter] who ... who is your favorite weekend update host before you\nAre I mean I Love nor I that's who I grew up with you know and uh and he's I still love his comedy and I like to go see him when every town he's get Caroline you the best\nI made normally I don't think it's been taken a studio is one of my greatest accomplish yeah ever that was pretty yeah All right [laughter] the spin water everywhere in the studio and it was fantastic\nI and and I grew up watching Dennis Miller who absolutely love and ah then there is you know the mediocre guys like Kevin meal and ... and then there was calling quaint and just felt like he was rushing through every time I kind of things yeah\nAnd so the the combo that you guys have now I think is great and I and melt when now when you're a host and weaken up they then they look at you and they go oh you look at Jimmy Fallon your luggage had Myers you think or maybe a talk show in the future but not even call any more than anybody they may think about that\nI I don't think about it because I think if there if it gets really a tough life when you're doing it every day it's hard to make it like special doing it every day for me\nBut um it's obviously it who knows I think I think most of the people that are doing it don't necessarily think that's what I Do but then you you know maybe that becomes that option and you're like oh that sounds pretty good actually [laughter]\nYeah I I mean I Would imagine especially a Harvard harbor lampoon guy I mean you guys are you guys are set up for greatness like that\n\nI mean like ... and it was the Conan I was one of my favorites I was growing up like that you know and he just did a bunch of your stuff on the show which at the same weight Letterman is\nGo back to the Mike ... one of them [laughter]\nYou know it just shows you want to [laughter]\nI enjoyed talking to you\nUh [noise] your dude yeah [noise] there's definitely a typical guy that he ... he was running to the city he was getting off the island going to school getting off down the word\nThat's right way to do it or Galvin Megan Kelly it was announced last break will not be live on the air for the rest of the week a suspension if you will after defending her blackface comments which he is now apologized for\nAre both on Twitter and on television do you have the original ... yeah I have the original comment here if you want to hear this here we go [laughter]\nYou'll get in trouble if you are a white person who was on last yeah I mean or a black person and puts on white they Halloween like I mean that was okay as long as you address and got the character of LA feels like something is offensive to them then you ... and that's fair game\nAnd they begin to dress up and if you want to take yeah when they mentioned as people passing up like nothing that's offensive and probably the controversy on the real housewives of New York with ... as she is Diana Ross and she made her skin look darker than it really is and people said that that was very\nCritical she wants to look like I Am around her one day I I don't know how like that got raises on Halloween my walking around ...\n... if you are dressing up for Halloween and you want to win a contest or if you want to just to impress your friends the way to do that is to look at the most\nLike the person that you're dressing up as and if you're trying to be if you're if you have an opposite opinion and I do please call and try to explain this to me if you are if I'm going to be Don King for Halloween\nAnd I go out there with my heritage ease up and the suit on and my glasses and white skin I'm a little guy colonel Sanders got electrocuted that's the absolute truth\nAh but if you are going as a black character now as a character I mean a character from television played by a black actor I'm Talking about a a a hobo and I'm going to be all black hobo or I'm a guy who\nDoes the black face like al ... and that is that this racist but if you were if you were going to be Mr T. you cannot wear a mohawk and jewelry and be white\nWell that's it that's the big thing is you had on the word is that's not race as it is not racist you're trying to be the character you're trying to be the person you're trying to you know look at like you said at the most like or whatever but you also have to know that in this day and age that people are going to be offended by that have to know what I wanted to know celebrity what is what is offensive\nAbout that oh there was no and when I Want to know if somebody's if don't call up and tell me well\nThis is why somebody might be I don't want to I\nWant to know if you are specifically offended by that if you're black why whenever you are\nAnd the idea of so many dressing up in a Halloween costume trying to look like a character and that character involves you put it now you're trying to do an Asian person than you paint your skin yellow Asian people aren't really yellow that is you're trying to be a racist\nSo my son has homecoming and since it falls right around Halloween they're doing you can dress formal or you can do a cash 'em and do stuff like that guy he wants to go as a character from really video game or from ... in its low key\nBut it's a a day of the dead ... okay so it's kind of a cool thing but are people going we will people be offended if you do day the dead because the ... in the you know Mexican outfit and stuff yeah is that cultural appropriation\nIs that a call ... ... in\nMy mind and if I'm wrong and there have been times where I've been wrong and people who said yeah but you're not thinking about this and I go okay I get it but in this case I I Can't see how that's going to happen but ... ... this is a\nHoliday of sorts where their tradition is to dress up like a character\nAnd to be so much like the character that now the cool costumes has to do a variation of a character I'm going to be a a whites Mr T. would be cool if that's and look you're going for but if you are trying to ... like the character you have to do everything down\nThe the more you're more detail you have the better the characters are going to be the joker have green hair yeah\nI I I Can't I Can't understand why her\nI have no reason to like Megan Kelly I have not and I'm not trying to defend her for any other reason other than I agree with her and the situation\nWould you like to hear here from al ... and they're all I\nKnow if I was going to be our broker we've I was going to be our worker for Halloween I Would have a floating weather map behind me and glasses and it has to be black or else I'm Lindsay young going or\nWhat was his name is uh is uh do the turning one hundred and uh oh yeah the ... oh God what was his name was ... will oh Jesus play this about what I hear is that our ... you're talking about making Kelly\nThe fact is a while she apologized for this that she does a bigger apology\nTo folks and color\nAround the country because this is a history going back to the Eighteen thirties minstrel shows that to me and denigrate uh a race wasn't right when I'm old enough to have lived through Amos and Andy ... where you had white people in black sayings playing to black American I mean when you just\nMagnifying the worst area and talks about black people and that's what the big problem is\nThat it that is completely different Amos and Andy were pretending to be stereotypical racist\nBlack character locking ... that is entirely different from what she said I enter Ross is a I God yeah she's a superstar has an international superstar and has been for decades\nAnd I can understand how that is that now if I ... I I Will take your phone calls here seven to seven five seven nine one oh two five will it Scott what's her name we were looking bad yeah Jennifer good morning on the Mike how the show\nBig Maureen how are you good what's happening I was just\nGoing to comment on a lake in LA thing I Do think they're pushing it much further than needs to go but I can understand that the grass that side of it that I think they're trying to get this catchy trip lately lady the skin isn't the most defining credit for Christmas or if I wanted to be the jail I don't know that I Would have to go with darker skin\nWell here's the thing if you wanted to be J. lo what's number one thing you have to do\nThey how\nYeah because that's the metal the fighting there they guess defining characteristic the biggest detail that's it so if your if you have the wig and the dress and the big as we could look at you and go ...
