measure for\nQuite a little monkey\nTrial check your panning out after\nI don't even know how do I make something funny I don't even know you lose you lose\nAnd they are a big part of state and local economies and state and local government expenditures\nAnd and I know the big argument about people saying we're not for recreational marijuana because the kids will get their hands on it and you know they're worried about that and I'll get to that later but\nI don't fear that once I've actually been to one of these stores and you know when I go by my weekly beer for football on Saturday and Sunday and my bottle of Cheetos um you know they still even at my age and trust me I don't look like a teenager anymore\nThey still take my ID and run it through the cash register before they can even bring up the product to prove that I Am of age let me tell you what I went through to buy the product I bought a Californian urban leap\nYou show up and there's an armed guard out front you show him your identification he checks that make sure it's valid\nYou go to check point number two and it's a little Biddy lobby without bank window with a bullet proof window and she has the little drawer you put your license in there she makes a copy she double ... make sure you're good then your lead into a now they're waiting room\nWhere you sit until you have your own personal shopper that will take you behind a locked door in to the store itself I went through three different checkpoints to go in\nAnd no way in hell is a minor going to get in there and get their hands on any smoke all edible vapor bubble rubble marijuana product\nIt's that way it's set up that way and it should be set up that way so kids don't get in and it's the same thing with alcohol and you agree the kids that are younger age that aren't legal should not have their hands on alcohol either it's just a little easier to get their hands on alcohol right now and what it is easy to get their hands on marijuana but not legally\nRight I mean it is it's not easy to get their hands on alcohol legal either that the issue is and we've learned a lot of lessons over the last eighty five years about how to minimize underage consumption\nAnd ... you talked about in Colorado is the result of regulation\nAnd what needs to happen in every marketplaces that effective regulations not just on that point of sale but also regulations about marketing\nYou know we don't advertise alcohol or our industry doesn't advertise alcohol in places where a large number of miners are going to see those products um we were very careful about how products are are marketed as it doesn't show people that appear to be under age are consuming the product\nAh we're we're very careful about making sure\nThat our product is is not a you know targeted at minors either through with labeling or his name's or any of the marketing practices and more importantly there are strict penalties for those who do provide the product to minors because\nRegardless of all those checks at whatever retailer if somebody leaves and and then takes it to minors and gives it to them\nI'm that person needs to be held accountable for that person is that needs to have strong penalties that they face so there's a disincentive to engage in that type of behavior\nAnd we also know that the state itself at least here in the state of Florida and I'm sure other states do\nHave state agents that pay minors to go in and try to purchase alcohol at a grocery store at a liquor store\nAnd sometimes the system fails and they actually get it and I've seen people lose their jobs because of it they're no longer employed at that grocery store because of the grocery industry and the liquor store industry taken very seriously when estate agent comes in and catches them goofing off in\nA mess in the system up and and I support that on and they say it's a set up that it's entrapment I see it as hey we're just making sure the laws are enforced and we're keeping the the liquor out of their hands that shouldn't have it\nRight and what you're really talking about is effective regulation and enforcement\nAnd that's what we're calling for across the board and and the cannabis marketplace and not just for under age issues but also for driving we don't we don't want a people you know consuming marijuana becoming impaired and then getting behind them mode and were motor vehicle on the highway\nThere should be penalties for people that engage in that type of behavior we think that each state should have the right resources and the right penalties in place uh to prevent under age access to prevent impaired driving and and really the reason that all those liquor stores you're talking about take it so seriously is because they're licensed by the state and if they\nDo provide the alcohol to a minor there are strict penalties that could go all the way up to losing that license and losing their ability to do business all this goes back to an effective regulatory structure and ineffective enforcement mechanism that creates a safe and responsible marketplace\nAnd before we move on I just want to make this point for all the people out there on the opposite side and I'm willing to listen to your side and listen to your stories and I will do it with an open mind\nBut for that argument of if we have recreational marijuana all the kids are going to have\nTheir hands on it and then we'll have a big problem oh let me say this you mean the children the young ones that can go to mom's medicine cabinet right now and get their hands on by could enter him at all is Xanax Viking in in a number of other pills and ah that's fine because they can get another mommy's cabinet\nBut they don't want the kids to have the marijuana and the kids shouldn't have marijuana that's why we're talking about\nEnforcing the regulation and giving law enforcement the power to deal with those issues so let's move on to some of your market regulation that you're looking out with the wind and spirit wholesalers of America who is for federal government respecting the rights of states to legalize cannabis\nLet's talk about what you mentioned earlier\nQuality control you mentioned that a lot of these states like California Colorado now have tourism and there's even you've heard of Arab BNB there's bug BNB that are set up in these states that actually have\nSmoker friendly places to stay and they have marijuana tours of the area and even some of the growing areas and they were allowed to go take tours at\nAnd there is great quality control with a product when we have this recreational marijuana and other states\nAnd you have the same thing on the liquor industry you're always looking at quality product from the people distilleries the the breweries et cetera so how how is this regulation go to improve the quality control the product is a state decides to go ahead and respect the rights and go ahead and legalize cannabis\nPolitically and in eighty five years of alcohol regulation we've developed an alcohol marketplaces the safest in the world a counterfeit or illicit products are almost unheard of and the American marketplace um but it also is one that allows for a wide variety of consumer choice and innovation I'm at the producer level\nAnd we think that our regulations brought to the cannabis marketplace will be similar\nUnique trace ability and your supply chain\n'em with trace ability and the supply chain you can make sure that unlicensed producers are getting those ... their products on the shelves but you can also make sure\nThat products aren't getting diverted out of the legal system and going to jurisdictions that have chosen not to legalize are getting out of the system and going maybe to under age people provided by bad actors um\nThat trace ability within the marketplace is very important uh to to uh regulated market because with a product like this you need to be able to ensure that that license\nProducer a has that product traveling through a regulated stream all the way to the retailer and eventually to the consumer\nNow what what about the people that say yeah you have recreational marijuana in Colorado you have it in Oregon you've got it in Washington D. C. California and you know people are putting it in their luggage and they're bringing it out of state that is one issue that has come up and frankly I'm not going to lie to your Dawson\nI've seen I've seen some edible products that have come from California and the form of a ... a cookies and brownies and Bob Bob bags of popcorn chatter coded popcorn and it was very tasty\nUm you know you're seeing these products that are still making it across the border and this is something that you're concerned about here saying wait a minute there there are ways to keep this room going over the border\nAbsolutely and we we spend time in our industry or making sure that the alcohol isn't being illegally shipped across state borders uh because it's important for the regular regulated system to\nBe respected or to make sure that taxes are collected a lot of times they cross border sales a result in lost tax revenue for a state when we're talking about alcohol and I think it's important to take similar measures and the cannabis space\nI mean regardless of what somebody thinks about uh their state's decision to legalize or not\nThe law should be respected and and there shouldn't be mechanisms in place that give law enforcement tools to stop diversion out of the state to state that has legalized and then also penalties for the people that do that so that you know there's not an incentive to to try and divert those products and try and take them across the border\nAnd and one thing that I Want to point out on my receipt for urban blows out of California is and this is something I Want to get to that your organization is talking about is tracking I actually because I made one transaction at the store\nAnd now use their number one seven seven I Am part of a database\nI had friends of mine freak out over that dos and saying wait a minute you're in the system now and the government knows and I said great I got no problem with that I got nothing to hide you want to do a background check go have a ball but we're this is important when we're talking about this and it's not a joke\nThat the product and the user is tracked so we know that it's being done legally and above the board\n[noise] yeah I mean I I I think what's really important in every state's gonna do it slightly differently but what's really important is making sure that those people that would want to follow the law are\nAble to do so easily and that means that they can't\nGo buy a product from multiple locations bundle it and then take it across the border into a non legal jurisdiction take it you know go resell it to people maybe under age people that shouldn't have it all of those things\nGood morning and thank you for tuning into another edition of spectrum your host Tiffany green with this morning as princess ALS Lee she is the c._e._o.\nOf elite business strategies and also elite office and biz solutions thank you so much for joining us this morning princess thank you so much for having me All right so princess when you hear all the business strategies the audience may say what is that exactly explained to them well at least\nAs strategies as a professional services consulting firm\nThat specializes in emergency management and homeland security and I like to like in as to the private sector side to FEMA and so after disaster we're that team that goes out and we can do damage assessment\nUm we help with the recovery process of making sure that residents are able to submit their packages for reimbursement to FEMA to receive um their payments are reimbursement for whether it's built up our buyout\nWe also work with them um before disasters to do planning training um program management just to make sure that the government is set up and ready should've storm happen\nAll right and obviously we've had you know very busy season's going back to I think Hurricane Sandy when it hit the north east and just as recently Hurricane Irma I'm so from\nA disaster such as that what happens let's let's let's go back to just one of those hurricanes and say okay what do you do well\nInitially what we call the day of impact we're bracing for it\nThe storm and so after we actually are impacted the storm hit a our team would go and we would survey so we're a part of that team that will go out and look at the damage to do a damaged assessment um that damage assessment is then used and\nTurned into the state where they didn't submit to the president of the United states to say to show how much damage occurred to their to their um state or to their city or that particular location\nUm but that is what the president then determine how much a deck disaster recovery fun that state will receive for that to disaster\nUm our team is kind of the team that goes out and initially does that damage assessment for residents\nWe then once that funding comes in we help with the long term recovery and so after a disaster where you see a lot of people are either displaced UC schools are closed ... businesses damaged are closed because of that damage\nWe're that team that goes in and we help the community to rebuild and restore after ... after the disaster\nAs our listening audience may say well wow how does one get into that career path how do you either choose it or it chooses you so little background on your store\nI like to say it chose me um I fell into emergency management and just had the opportunity to start in the field right after Katrina and outlook immediately deployed um to Katrina to work\nIn Mississippi and fell in love with just the whole process and being able to help people\nWhen they hit experience probably one of the most devastating events of their lives and being able to go out there and and and to serve them and to help them and you know help them get on that road to recovery meant a lot to me and so\nI call it my gray sky jobs um when I worked in emergency management I had a blue sky and a great guy job and that was my greatest guy job and\nThat really was the motivation to keep going and it was something that I saw I Want it to do on a larger scale and so when the time came along for me to step out it was just natural that this become a part of what I did and what services are provided\nWith emergency management and in this is just something that I Would say is personal so we hear all of the um guidelines and encouragement of what you should do and how you should prepare for a disaster\nFrom your perspective what is the area that is lacking the most when you go in\nTo help those recover\nI Would say insurance a lot of people do not have the proper insurance for if an event should happen\nUm you look at flooding flood insurance while a lot of homeowners I don't need flood insurance I'm nowhere near the floodplain I'm not in a hundred year floods out and so they look at it and they really don't feel that it's it's worth the extra cost what happens when a hurricane\nTimes is not only do you have wind damage but you have a you have flooding in the area\nAnd so a lot of home owners are I'm left really in awe of of I Would say a horrible to predicament because they don't have that the proper insurance um which makes it harder for them to really recover\nI Would also say for residents to make sure that you have your documentation and plays make sure it's stored make sure it's on you I'm In a safe place because what we also see is homeowners once they lose everything they lose the documentation that\nThey need to really get the help that they need from the federal government and from their state government and so it makes it longer for takes it it makes it harder for them\nTo recover your business obviously it was two fold you mentioned not only the consulting side but also\nThe uh office supply side and there are a lot of changes have you read up on things and and just how you know some of the major retailers and corporations are up navigating in that space how did you get into office supplies\nWell I tell people what happened it really does all fit together so before the storm are before he met people are always looking for products they're looking for water they're looking for generator they're looking for supplies\nAfter the storm happens they're looking for tart they're looking for high they're looking for different commodity and so it was a natural transition for us because we want it to be a full service consulting firm\nI'm In that area and so we um originally went into looking forums maintenance repair operation equipment which is the emerald\nUm and that's how we started in the product world and because of that it just expanded into now we offer\nEverything from IT products to safety um equipment to um furniture lighting the full of full suite both um office products are often how the business of central products that you would need\nA we have an online category that hosts about two hundred thousand products that we have on line and so\nIt was a natural transition for us about two totally different fields it all comes from the desire to want to help people and won't wanting to be that for that helps after before and after ...\nUm I Would say the changes in the industry are heart for small businesses were small we're a small company compared to your ... your big box stores out there\nAnd what I've realized is that people are what power us those small businesses and I don't I don't just speak for me I speak for all of the small businesses that are out there that's looking at you know your ...\nChain stores that are making these moves and they have the economic engine behind them they have the marketing behind them you know their name\nIt's common place to go to them and then you have a small was the mom and pop where we had the same capability but we have that personal touch 'em you have that relationship building so it's the same person and I say that the all of my customers I'm helping\nYou fulfill any fulfill a product whatever it may be for your for your business for your home for your school for the classroom but you also seeing in the\nGrocery store where you can ask me hey I didn't get my delivery are you know do you have this product could you get it to me tomorrow and we have that ability say yes we'll we'll get it in for you is that relationship\nThat you get with this um is the technical expertise that in the hands on approach that you get with us the small business that you wouldn't necessarily get with your big box and it's so do so do you sometimes pay more for that customer service yes but ultimately when you're I'm In a crunch I think you need and you would want that\nAnd so we've thrived in that environment but it's it's hard for small businesses just because um you were the small guys in a big industry [laughter] you know that's changing so\nI think you answered a lot of the question as to\nWhy a consumer would choose the small business versus one of the big box stores as you mentioned\nA so from the perspective of okay yes I can see you feel you touch you if I Need to get a hands on your as your questions ... where do you see small businesses fitting in obviously it helped to develop us a as a country\nUh but sometimes it seems as if small businesses or being overshadowed by some of those major retailers and for you\nPrincess I'm like how does a store or a house or a real retailer like Amazon affects you well really\nAmazon is is you have\nWhat I Would call a love hate relationship for Amazon Amazon has the capability to get your products\nTo millions of people that know nothing about elite you know Miley products at all and we have the ability to get our products to them through Amazon\nThe flip side so that is you're competing with everyone across the U.S everyone outside of the U. S. anyone who has a computer can sell products and so what happens is um depending on where you\nAre your costs of goods are different and so that makes it a little more competitive where you're constantly cutting which didn't know you have to make that assessment is a it's if it's even worth ... should I sell this product on here\nI guess better appreciate [laughter] you know where you are now\nAnd then also give you a great perspective of like you know what this is what it takes people say oh I Want to start a business and then they don't think bill take everything into consideration uh 'cause you get that one contract can you say oh this is it a give me some of your perspective on that [noise] well\nI think fat\nAgain it's one of those things that as a business owner you have to count the cost\nWe um when I got that contract and like I said we went from one extreme to the next and so when we got the contract um for us looking at it that the fear is you don't want to get the contract of fail [laughter]\nYou know it's like you know you're ... you've gotten your opportunity now it's time for me to prove myself\nAnd in so many cases um because of the lack of resources that's where our fault are small businesses fail\nUm there there have been stories and I'm sure you all have heard of ... because they've made the news of FEMA contracts that have gone out after the last storm where people couldn't service the contract because they didn't have whether they were a small business and they got this\nHuge contract and they weren't able to perform and so because of that um it's all boy when you kinda feel back all the layers it goes back to your funding and your financing I Would say all of a plan in place is always important but also you know I I'm\nI'm a woman a faith and you know it's a lot of faith and a lot of God and a lot of up you know a lot of talking and reasoning\nAnd asking for direction and honestly um\nThat that's what got me through I Can't say that I had\nA secret formula um I can just say that I Know what got caught me too and what he told me to do and I'm always made sure that I got his okay princes you know go for it um and I did and it worked out\nIt wasn't easy it was very hard and challenging I'm ... I had I had\nPlans in place but at ... at the end of the day it just came down to um I had a lot of favor\nYou know to help get me through that and I know that's probably not the you know people don't like that answer but you know because they want something a little more concrete but that that's honestly what it is [noise]\nPrinces when we go back to the office or at least office in business solutions some of the things and and we talked about some of the challenges to where does\nIt go from here where do you go from here and competing and this this competitive world\nWell we had the\nOpportunity and we're very fortunate that soon after we started the company we were able to um go after the state of Florida contract for office supplies\nOn consoles and we are the only independent vendors that's currently on that contract so right now the contract is with us staples in Office Depot\nI'm that contract were able to service every state agency and Florida and so for us it's continuing to grow that government market that's our\nCustomer you know um and it has been our customers were still working we're new on the independent side were new with working with the independent that individual users and that's an area that we want to grow in and so I Would say when you look at us\nAnd how we're growing we want to be able to offer the same quality and the same level of service that we currently offer to those government customers now toes independent customers to those small and medium size businesses and those nonprofits\nThat are spending and that you know are are that have the need for our commodities and are good but maybe feel that they're not getting that level of customer service that they need maybe they want someone that they can pick up the phone and say okay you know my account and you know how things work in my office\nAnd so hey I Need this yesterday because we're having an event and you have somebody who can make sure that they're going to get it to you and so that's what I Would say when you look at where we're growing and how and how things are moving in the industry\nWe want to take it to the next step and say okay let's build that business to business was build that nonprofit let's build the churches and how can we go and how can we service you how can we be that arm to your organization\nYou know it's going to say and beyond that are just as a company as a whole and that you have you know different different arms\nYour there do you feel like there are other areas that you're quipped to tackle\nAbsolutely um I always said that we're constantly growing and evolving and you don't even realize it a part of us winning the contract for the state of Florida we had to do delivery all throughout the state of Florida\nAnd so now you're delivering your own good and so from that you realize hey we have delivery services that's not something that we originally planned but it's something that we started doing and had to do to support one business and so now we're building out that delivery component to our company\nUm which was totally unexpected but it's something that just naturally happen\nFor instance before we wrap up this morning I'm just for those who are aspiring to be in your position sort of small businesses um and and and just\nTrying to get their feet underneath them or words of advice as you've given you know throughout this this interview but some words of advice that she would share with them\nI Would say don't quit as easy um to give up on your dream and to um\nTo walk away from it but um as an entrepreneur as\nSomeone who has seen ups and downs and the peaks and valleys of business I Would say the one thing that it's been consistent is you cannot give\nUp you have to keep pushing 'em it may be a note today but that doesn't mean that it will be a no tomorrow and so one thing I've found are the same people who have told me no one\nYear the following year a couple of years later we ended up doing business together or they um I found out down the road that have that wasn't the best partnership so I'm Glad I you know I'm Glad I got to know at that time I Would also say that\nAlways be in control of your vision I'm as business owners we tend to\nTake on seek advice from several people from ... from everyone to kind of validate are confirmed\nOur vision or what we're trying to do and what I've learned is\nUm only you know the fullness of what God is giving you are what you desire to do and so always can be in control of your vision be in control um control of your destiny part of the reason why did this is when I was working for one of my state agencies I was\nUp in um I was up for a position for a promotion and the um both at the time told me she said your your perfect for the position but you're just not old enough\nAnd you were looking for someone that's a little more seasoned and I remember thinking to myself wow I don't ever want to be in this position again I don't want to I don't ever want anyone to tell me what I'm ready for 'em but I'm not ready for you know I Want to be the captain of my own ship when it comes\nSo that and sell 'em that to me was the motivating factor too it's time to step out I knew I could do it at the top and if I could do it they knew I couldn't do it but um\nIt was because of something that I can control that stop me from progressing in that arena and so\nMoving over to the um entrepreneur side has allowed me to grow as a person it has allowed me to take everything that has been stacked against me as some would say and use it as motivation and as I step and blacks and get to the next level and it's worked people see the drive they see the passion\nAnd ultimately they want to be a part of it and they want to invest with that and so you just have to make sure that you connect with the right people and that you don't lose faith and don't lose heart in the process\nPresidents we certainly

telling Tampa story the business world up there and and some of the media he had made it an appearance on business weeks economics I'm with Peter coy chatted about Tampa's recovery from the recession economic growth investment taking place\nAnd then he appeared on Bloomberg TV balance of power\nI'm Talking about with David West in and then he had some different interviews as well now some of the things that you talked about Mrs important what the conversation we're having real estate mortgage or I or re investments as well so he talked about the topics of interest for Tampa's transformation from post recession\nInvestment in infrastructure and the role of emerging cities and also the playing of the health care the health of the economy or USF help or more sunny College of medicine move downtown and the exciting developments in the river from the urban core\nSo ah interesting story and this is all good news for us investment in infrastructure I Wonder brings got our into the conversation now Scott\nOr you know with it with advanced diary you mentioned that would've banned to Iranian investment in multi family and this is just good news for everybody when it comes to the investment that we're making downtown\nYeah we're ... we're ... again ... drive around the city you can see the growth ever owed new condos Hartman complex is that there's a lot on the move especially I'm curious\nThe jump for ten years to see what downtown looks like the changes are going on down there but obviously whip a lot of that growth I think our clients and people who've contact us investors are finding a lot of opportunity to\nGet into a new property for you know that they can rent that they can rehab maybe something they can flip\n'em whether it's single family homes are like that we've seen a lot of multifamily lately with people using\nA their retirement account as that kind of additional capital to get a ticket to go by either anything ... unit building to uh you know three years at a hundred ... complex yeah using their own Iran and more so\nUsing other people's highrise yeah so you gotta you gotta raise that capital to to qualify for another bank loan or if you're trying to get away from using bank loans altogether just use cash yeah razor providing some of that capital\nLet me ask you a question I've got you know a a\nBusiness acquaintance ... says hey I Want to start doing some flips I got it and you know some ways it I can get city code violations um I can find these deals he's just looking for money guys had a connection that you might be able to make for him\nA potentially we can certainly talk to that individual say here here's the different people you could look out the ... I think the biggest uh thing we bring to it to an investor\nIs when you know about self directed IRAs when you were you know if if I'm the investors are looking to raise capital I'm Out there talking to other people you know what I'm basically talking I Want them to invest in me I Want them to use their cash in their savings account or wherever they might have it but that with me allow me to put it to use it in my investment\nMost people have no idea that including the investors themselves have no idea that Iraqis are those old four one K. is can be used in this fashion everybody's condition to think it's gotta be mutual fund rye ought to be ... so if you're an investor knowing about self directed I raised when you're out there talking to your own people that you're trying to raise capital from\nLetting them know that ... hey here's my project here's what the details are on it it's a great deal of has a great return for you\nDo you have money in old or what games do you have any just sitting there doing nothing that's another bag of money to most people don't consider or they could editor but hey I Can't even do that it as an investor you telling them yes you can use that Iran you can use that old four one K. yeah make the best way to tax tax advantage\nIt and it it is like you said we've been conditioned over the years to oh you know to invest in these mutual funds that they've got diversification in and it's it's like this this mass um you know over the years right I mean it's just\nCrazy it is it's it's something that it starts mainly for most people who have four one K. is you work for an employer they're they're gonna hook that that ... going to hook up with a mutual fund company so off of that or one case you just think that those are your investment options it's not until you leave that employer or you have the ability to\nTo roll over some of that money is ... now what am I going to do with it and a lot of people just those mutual fund companies those brokerage firms are not going to tell you\nYou can use some of your money to invest in real estate right would you like to go buy a rental property would you like to invest in a multi families syndication they're not going to offer because they don't do it so they don't they don't even based device right right and they ... yeah they don't want you taking your money away and moving it somewhere else where they're not going to be able to charge fees weren't so that's why they're advertising it\nThe people that find us either get you obviously hearing about us\nThrough other sources maybe they're Googling and finding is on the road but they're thinking outside the boxing what else can I Do with that money right why am I stuff why do it but I don't want to feel stuck in this mutual funds the stock market roller coaster what else can I Do\nEspecially right now the market's getting ready to take a pull back Scott too I Would think so at some point at some point it's got a uh in in ... to Ninety five percent and you know Tony Robbins I quoted on the show before\nNinety five percent of mutual funds don't outperform the market in other words you can invest directly into the S. and P. and not pay all those high fees that they're gonna charge you going through an actual a mutual fund\nRight yeah I mean mutual ... those phones\nHave so many hidden fees ... um that's that's a story I Love to tell ... years ago I had a seminar where someone was asking what we charge for our pizza and we charge you know roughly three hundred dollars a year to record keep a piece of real estate where he received ... pay your bills\nA and somebody that seems high 'cause my irate you know the ... I paid my Iraqiya fifty bucks a year and that's it\nBut there is a financial advisor in the ... actually who is who is a open door but we do see let me see your statements looked at the same and say here's iffy iffy because of that because of the on the line at um doesn't say administrative be yeah of stuff that you wrote into the mutual fund\nLike I thought he was paid fifty bucks it turns out on his hundred thousand dollars so portfolio is paying about a grandy or one percent\nWow yeah any any didn't even know it and it didn't\nHe didn't know that that's where they have to be found out he was paying a thousand and then to here say we're only charge three hundred for something you know to to buy a rental property now he already wanted to do yeah it was a no brainer\nFirst of all three hundred dollars and not that much money anyways you turn to collect the rent on on an investment property ... by the way if you just joined his brain arrives here we're talking with Scott Mauer\nAtlanta I re here on the consumer quarterback show and we're talking about buying and selling a real estate financing real estate and then also through the eye or raise the opportunity to self direct the opportunity to take control of your money and invest it in real estate or other assets water some of the other assets\nI mean we were very real estate heavy a rentals and re has went up but in addition to me kind of talk about mortgages obviously they were there to your IRA can be a private lender or to other people that could be you obviously you lend on real estate but we also people who will lend money to private companies and take back\nAn equity position to that company uh you're you're you could invest in private stock a goal you know physical gold and silver ... the only things you can't buy or life insurance and collectibles well the IRS says there's only two things you can't buy\n\nFar as a list I'm right back into it so uh Nick kick in the house got our uh we're we're talking about mortgage finance seeing some of the options out there for investors\nAnd us Scott's also talking about you know the self directed IRAs ways that you can legally avoid paying taxes so we're helping you understand more about these different products today so a Nick what else are you seeing out there man what are you seeing people have those misconceptions out\nThere are a lot of misconceptions um you know are just type it in with the people at the notes those in costs and things that we've talked and weeks past um but I wanted to talk more about something that's been more successful to for realtors and buyers\nUm you know because there is multiple offers on properties right now so you're competing against a lot of different people that want the same home is you yeah I've seen a lot of people waiting to make an offer a day and then the property is already a southern there so that they missed the boat on that so what I'm suggesting and what we've been doing it with a lot of clients that have been very successful is getting them pre approved\nGetting their application done getting their documents in and getting them into underwriting while they're searching for a property this\nHelps your real estate agent when they're making that offered no into there and say okay here I have a pre approval okay they've been through underwriting their income asset credit approved all we need to do is find them all home\nAnd on top of that because of already have all those that don't\nThey can run the contract to closing what twelve to fourteen days ... so you get somebody up the street that's not pre approved\nThat's going to be thirty to forty five day closing they come to me they get pre approved I get everything through underwriting I get a contract I closed in two weeks you know like what seller doesn't want their money faster you know this this allows him to go make another purchases if it's an investment property allows them to move their family allows that to get their peace of mind knowing that their home is sold\nAnd that they can close in two weeks yeah so if you're able to give that fire power to your realtor you have a better chance of getting that home that you want to hear that letting somebody else scoop it out from underneath you yeah absolutely it's an important\nPart of the process multiple offers happened and and it's a big part of the real estate spaces you know finding out there working with a great by region will help you on that front end up finding that property\nUh getting out there right away that's important state you know stay in tune to your MLS feet if you're getting a feed from an agent\nA look at early in the morning and late at night 'cause sometimes they pop up at those two times and then if you could be the first one to view the property first one to get that offer and you know like they say the early bird gets the worm but you know I've always heard the second mouse gets the cheese I don't know [laughter] I don't know how that happened [laughter]\nBut yeah so with with the mortgage approval process the you know it's important to make sure that you're getting the I like what you said income asset and the credit underwritten\nYou get all that approved right up front so this where there's not any surprises that come out in the um they ... they view your S.\nIf they view what your credit profile is we verify your income so this way we know that you've been at your employer long enough time that the income calculation is done correctly that we're giving you pull\nOn the full amount that you're actually earning on a road space as\nPer month or per year on this way the underwriters the only thing they have to look at is the property appraisal than a title paperwork no it is important when documents our request that you get them in as quickly as possible so then I can submit that to the under writer and have the underwriter view everything\nAnd it also saves you from our break because you you know you think you may qualify for home you know I look at you just a ... document the limited information you put on an application\nThat the information you put in and and so I'm able to do it I don't know a hundred percent but off the basics of what she told me that can approve you write well now after looking at your documentation\nYour income isn't as strong as you thought it was ordered something popped up on your credit that you weren't aware of or you just didn't have enough money in your couch to qualify for a home we knocked it all out so this way it takes the guessing game out you're not hoping and praying you qualify you know you'd while if I can you make that offer\nYou can feel comfortable and qualifying for that home and then it also makes the southern comfortable with\nGiving you the contract or actually except in Europe or because they know you already pre approved yeah pre qualified there's two different things free qualified\nI take what you told me and get it and say okay you're good to go to make an offer free approval as the underwriters says yes you can afford this home yes you are approved for that had that effect and you know the ... the seller agents out there know the difference between the two so it's going to make your offer that much stronger\nSo start working on the process even if you weren't thinking about buying a home but see if we can get you into home let's see what you qualified or I'll put you in contact with the one of them\nRan Israel or Brennan himself to help you find that at home this way\nEverything there is no guessing I don't like I guess this is the biggest purchase you're going to make in your life I don't want to guess that makes that I think you can maybe not let's play out a little bit less get your proves completely and then you find your home now it's a very strong thing\nThat absolutely let's and I want to shift gears and talk a little bit about some of the renters out there because if you're still renting\nYou know you're paying really high rents I mean Harvard did a study called the rising that was something like four or five years ago that they did that study and they continue to rise out here in the Tampa Bay markets too you know had levels that we've not seen and they're setting record in terms of rent that's why\nYou know what Scott was saying earlier about people buying multifamily ... lives by some multifamily as an investor\nYou know it's kinda like to have it in the have nots rights of the people that are renting and and sometimes it's you know I get it you know hey I got I'm just moved to the town I Want to find out where I Want to be that type thing I get it but for a long term play that's not the way to do it man you want to get into a property buildup equity pay down your own mortgage and not pay your landlords mortgage down plus you can't throw the coup parties\nRight [laughter] yeah as you could I didn't want you with us you may not have a place to stay the next day let's get something you\nCan call your own so this way you can't get yourself out talking about a reimbursed\nHis own analysis if we have if we do a text offer here and we have an accident or rent a payment soon you'll be able to take that and break it down versus what they could purchase on a home correct\nCorrect I can let them know what they're going to actually be paying compared to that right I just did a woman for a borrower um last week and he was paying a thousand dollars a month in rent is mortgage payment with taxes insurance age away and everything is coming up to one hundred dollars greater a month so he's paying a hundred dollars more a month\nBut he is owns this home so he already has like what he builds and the whole what did that by a hundred and fifty thousand there was a hundred and fifty thousand dollar home he got\nPerfect ... it was a larger lot it was a it was an older home so it was the other ones were the homes are next to each other we can pass those are the butter dish between house through the window\nSo he got he gets\nTo call his own work clothes and at the end of the month I even got 'em down payment assistance on the low so he is literally coming out of pocket with about twelve hundred dollars as of right now all without any solar contributions one at all\nI live and\nWhat that twelve hundred dollars he's paying out of pocket when you close on a mortgage and the month of October you don't have a payment due in November your first payments in December of ... that he was going to pay a November dissipate is closing costs and basically coming out of pocket with nothing in order to enjoy his own own yeah his own home where he's not getting kicked out for having a party leader yeah\nSo um it happens quite a bit you wouldn't be surprised\nLife changing man at the editing to end this thing about you know if you have children as well you know the difference they pick it up you know there\nIs seven eight nine ten to ... you know they're picking it up there say oh wow we own this home is different ... and I didn't get the mindset of the child changes I mean just think about the legacy difference that you're leading with your family when it comes to that versus being a long term ten ten or\n... and just the the the equity that he's building up in the financial freedom that he's building for himself because he going to going to have that I could do to borrow against that make another large purchases in his life\nOr to hell with college tuition when he has children there's another twenty five year old gentleman that I'm working with her about it is already starting his legacy yeah you know I mean the young people out there do not think that you cannot buy a home

November\nYeah 'cause I mean especially I Know I Know kids already prepared for it is he yeah I mean I I Know that that's that's a weight tournament right so what what do you do\nWhen I was going to have to have some sort of calibrated measuring device you know and that's just talking from fishing tournaments before but you'd have to have some sort of measuring device on the boat that's going to be you know why are you guys that has nothing to do the law enforcement after we see but that's where you turned me got something to happen\nThat's what that's what he did he have especially that woman ... remember that too yeah yeah yeah so they got to have a scale that they give out to everybody the same scale and that's how they measure the weight you showed up to the camera you gotta go
