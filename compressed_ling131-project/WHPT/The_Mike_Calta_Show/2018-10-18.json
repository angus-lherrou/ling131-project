you're you're bringing back a pie a payment upon receipt Arabs or I'm Sorry but almost\nMaybe you're paying them to get rid of your kids yeah but if you're willing to pay sixty five dollars an hour what would you be willing to pay to\nGet them back and have a certain set of skills are a good time I'm taking the golf carts this year yeah yeah yeah well it's not it's not a surprise three houses in my circle and then the rest of them are far away and we don't have to hand and you're cutting down on time that I got ...\nOn why wouldn't you take the ah off guard I don't know some have called me lazy [laughter] that's my wife uh and I mean I don't know why you got a golf I\nPretty much pretty much a knowledge in great shape I've doing proper maintenance through it all the time I had a dead my buddy Dave came over and\nTo know the batteries regatta constant charge I mean we're ready to go now nice legit Halloween I think you're a time saver my neighbors have gone into a grill that's right new neighborhood for a turkey yeah yeah so I mean I I live in a cul de sac\nAnd the neighbors to my left leg of this jerk off those golf cart out their church really all I live in the Gulf community in\nThe area [laughter] yeah I did I I remember the first time I saw like a golf community and stuff we're out on a boat\nAnd we had to stop and get gas and there was a gas area near like this and this guy came down to the golf cart and like all that is the dream that's it I Want to drive everywhere and a\nGolf cart I don't want to see the thing I the first time my son was learning how to ride a bike\nI like what do you do when you when you're teaching somebody I ride a bike you run inside yeah right if you have a bike if\nYou don't have a well known you run like if you're teaching them how to ride a bike you're holding and then you go like uh you're you're doing that you're doing it you know\nRight or they disappear well no but so uh I got my son taught him how to ride the bike and then I got it on the golf cart and drove next time around the circle as he rode his bike because he was practice okay oh guy and there was like\nOh what a what a jerk off your so lazy I'm like I I'm Sorry but I Can't run the circle and I can't run at the same speed that my son was biking I thought of having the golf cart would be brilliant yeah I can write only falls I'm right there but you have to understand that everybody on Twitter is right [laughter]\nOne million five hundred and twenty dollars per I mean one million five hundred and twenty\nOthers yeah per week or per day he is making almost two hundred thousand dollars per day ... he was making almost eight thousand dollars per hour he's making one hundred and thirty eight dollars per minute I'd heard my heart\nOr per second or two dollars and thirty cents by while by seven eleven breathalyzer is every second it is still look how far I\nGot them in the play oh it's a rubber ... no no no this is the breakdown for ... o canal and yeah yeah I Love canal is now the register and stuff yeah\nYeah you know anything about his upbringing was he just like a poor kid from Mexico that guided boxing and now he's run in the ... and\nHis older brother boxed and uh yeah then you get started on and off yeah he's been doing it and stuff uh\nBut yeah that is unbelievable how much money one of his losses by the way he only has a few losses but one of his losses was to uh Floyd Mayweather yeah Floyd Mayweather has responded to ... call is call out as saying that he is ready to take on another UFC champion who were fighting to be a Mayweather\nSays oh I mean who's going to take on to me he's no way that this is what may weather says we're fighting Mayweather told DMZ sports I my own boss I Can't say what's going on I can be then but on my end we can make it happen\nOf course could be challenged Mayweather after successfully defending his title earlier this month at USC two twenty nine with a fourth round submission over a counter macgregor who stepped out of the ... and into the ring last August to take on may weather may weather of course maintained is perfect record there so you know the\nThe I mean I don't think even people would be that interested in it because the reason why they were so interested in McGregor and a Mayweather is because of the smack talk in the international\nA promotion that was done nobody cared about can be a\nHuge amount of draw like like McGregor is a I don't think so either but here's what can be has going from international dry he does has international dry he's Russia though you've got more as a national Eric in Auburn rocky three yeah but he's really he's bottom of the barrel Russian like he's not we're not talking about some\nYeah I I Am just talking about an appeal to countries that aren't\nThey're not they're not stacking them like the entire European section it's you know what I'm saying if\nEverybody in Russia and everybody in America bought the not every but yeah a lot of people in Russia and American than other areas obviously you're still gonna by and watch it but also you have undefeated against undefeated so that's a big\nThing as well yeah but you do because you have an undefeated Floyd Mayweather had a career where the fight against\nA opponents and uh you know great opponents and and and ... and all that stuff and then you have to be who is a flash in the pan right now like most of the fighters\nAnd in a over a year you're never going to hear from them again you're going to be fighting ability or like the rest of them but yeah well yes and it's just not the same I'm not saying I wouldn't watch it I'm not saying that interested in it it's just not the same\nI got to be honest with you I don't think it'll ever happen really not again I didn't think that the uh main whether a recording are they going to happen so who knows but you have a you know undefeated against undefeated a committee is twenty seven oh Mayweather of courses or fifty you know so\nWe'll see what happens Mayweather says he's his own boss or you can do whatever you want to have\nA Ben Affleck is hanging up the Cape that's according to a report the actors are leaving the Batman franchise athletics an exit comes on the heels of another departure from the DC Universe\nAccording to the Hollywood Reporter which claims that Henry Campbell will no longer be Superman however capitals agent tweeted that uh the actor is not quitting\nSuperman yeah I guess he's represented by the rocks ex wife oh wow Danny Garcia Andy Garcia and ah she she said look don't don't believe all the hype but I think that's going to end up being the right thing I think he's got about as well\nYou know one thing that you don't want to be if you're a young actor like that you don't want to be stuck like\nYou know the original Superman where you want to be a serious actor and everybody looked Superman how many Superman says that Henry ... to ... to and then the soup removing no three Superman Movie the uh Justice League and the Superman Batman and he was it was in Wonder Woman or no no she was in ... was in justice league and the Superman Batman movie\nYeah so I go to Ben Affleck is only done the three due to the ... the Justice League so to it but he was great as that by man you know I was thinking about the I was watching Logan yesterday the Wolverine moving right was on HBO or whatever and I was fantastic movie really love that\nMovie but there's so many consistency is in there with Logan does he have a daughter is professor ... is dying yeah and then the other guy the the was the other guy had made appearances on movies how old is he like there was just inconsistencies and then I started thinking but if you read the comic books\nAnd you're a comic book fan which is usually what draws most of these people to the movies they went off on so many tangents that didn't really stay with the storyline hulk can find anybody who is the strongest kind of where you lift planet you can do all this stuff\nOver and beat him up on yeah I Know what I mean like ... but you but that was in the ... whole ... mini series you know what I mean so you're allowed to have veer off some inconsistencies and that in that world and the fantasy where\nI was reading about that Logan movie cause I agree with you and I I think it was the Hollywood Reporter did an article about it and uh it said that so that whole series is supposed to be a an alternate universe where the bad guys when\nA and that helped me understand loading a little bit more as to why I'm professor X is dying and all that stuff so you're right that I don't even like that and I'm like that I don't like that talk\nOr by the way Logan one of the best trailers because it had the Johnny Cash hurt a song and then I was really good that was a great rail really great movie\nYeah like Henry ... working on now that is causing all this conflict as a show for Netflix called the winter and he's playing the main character named Carol was like a a buck and now they're doing a series I ... it has to pick it up on or is there any developed development yeah\nYeah I'm here for him on another show on their watch probably yeah here's a show you may or may not\nWatch are you ready for re boot but it's an interesting way that they're doing this did you watch NYPD Blue I Love that show so I didn't watch\nThat her she's for some reason I didn't watch that it was huge though I remember him why he blew the big deal with that was they were the first primetime show there was gonna have cursing and nudity on the show they show up with but should support just by several women side breast they uh they were really they were trying so hard to compete with\nThe HBO because they knew that's the way that that things were going with with a pay channels that shows were going there and that was what is his name Bob Bosh where the guy who created a botched go was that it even ... I don't yeah he was on one of the blue you might be right but I don't know because he is also Capra\nSo I don't write but he also did a a Doogie Howser oh he was loaded yeah and why pretty blue let me see if created that I thought that was him yeah Stephen batch produced earlier years so yeah but anyways here is the interesting thing about this\nSo in NYPD Blue pretty cool series is in the worse it will be about in the seventies it'll be about the son of Dennis Franz as character Andy ...\nOr ... well that one of the ... ... it's pretty cool series yeah that doesn't make sense that would be an anti civil which was a ... kid that you played them in\nThe uh oh yeah it doesn't say who's going to be involved in this what so Andy ... the son of a you know simple it's from that and why pd blue who is trying to earn his detective badge and\nSolve his father's murder ooh everyone was murdered I guess I don't remember ... mobster anything or maybe the way they're saying that and then no word if or any former cast members will be involved or what the deal is there and stuff but that's pretty interesting yeah you know a little twist on it it's kind of like how a rocky and then they did a a\nYou know create a great movies and stuff different version of it so I like\nUh maybe we're just sick of New York cop shows you how much more attractive to people\nI Would like a New York cop show of or the seventies or I Love that seventies show especially when it involves New York cops I don't know why that\nUm movie where they're they weren't cops there like private investigators whatever with Russell Crowe and uh uh the other dude\nRyan Gosling yeah yeah all that good guy yeah I did it was very much Abbott and Costello I felt like okay I like that\nOr orange is the black is coming to an end after its next season which will be its last\nThere is no word yet whether the when the show's coming back for its next season but it will be probably be sometime next summer sergeants new glasses over are you finished with the I don't know I give up well really happen over there are no yeah there's a lot of stuff but I Will tell you the way that this season ended this last season ended could have been a good just anti\nYou know not too crazy yeah yeah yeah it started off like kind of believable or were you like this could happen in print than like this could be it\nBecame self aware I became aware of what people thought and they tried to lean into it yeah yeah it was weird that way uh let's see do you know a big bird from Sesame Street I'm familiar with ... uh the guy who plays big bird also plays another character on there do you know that I Do know that I can picture the guy who plays when I've seen them before but I don't know\nI don't know we have a picture of the guy got up on TV that Harold spinning yeah yeah there you know all these old now I mean he wasn't that old obviously when I started and stuff but he plays big bird anyplace\nOscar the grouch ... yeah you know most of them you can't play to ship it but if you listen to it and if you listen to the voice after knowing that y'all yeah totally I understand that what happened to an Oscar talks to big bird oh man mind blowing whoa yeah anyways\nTemperate be the toughest competition ourselves [noise] yup\nWe invented the bar and now we breathed introducing reinvented temperate\nPrecious material yet combined with superior court to touch technology for your most rejuvenate equate it to have to respond to your body unique needs throughout the night and be standard than we\nFirst heard that experienced the new ... repeated today by your troops retailer at ... dot com\nOr here with ...
