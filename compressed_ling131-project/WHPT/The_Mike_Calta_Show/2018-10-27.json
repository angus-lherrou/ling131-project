Mediterranean diet but I got to tell you personally I couldn't handle that maybe you could\nWell I don't know but I\nBut you'd have to drink to the glasses of red wine a day\nYeah to me about how many capitals have got to take when they do take the money that a multi vitamins I take fish oil\nWell you just need to take too soft shell a day and that's really easy to take them the best time to take

jak your president just about everyone would lead to enhance their energy levels sites that you can feel stronger so how can these co Q. ten plus was very tall blimp do that and I know they called their co Q. daily super boost formula but how does it work\nWell it's very interesting it combined some really amazing nutrient specifically co enzyme Q. ten and resveratrol and a number of other nutrients we'll talk about later that support your health and energy and that's the bottom line\nYou're looking at what we call the advantage of combining the very nutrient that create your body's energy co Q. ten with the benefits of resveratrol\nThe energy stamina that comes with it and it's an unbeatable combination that gives you this advantage this cardiovascular system benefit\nBenefits to your brain cognitive performance your skin aerobic capacity it supports normal ... activity throughout the body it's just an amazing combination and that's why we called it the advantage\nThat the press and you know I Love the fact that in the new coke Cuba's very tall super formula for purity products combined the co Q. ten with ... you\nKnow there was there was a key molecule found in red wine which is studying at Harvard and I knew that it activates genes are those are just to to talk to us about all the excitement surrounding was neutral and why you specifically wanted in this formula well\nLet me tell you the researchers at Harvard under the leadership of Dr David Sinclair this is what they found\nCaloric restriction eating less slows the pace of aging\nThat's pretty darn impressive and what they found in the laboratory studies of animals is that an extended lifespan and it appeared that caloric restriction eating less food and you're eating right now by a certain percentage increases your longevity you'll live longer it increases the activity of what we call a longevity gene\nThey get switched on day help improve metabolism it increases your ability to cope your ability to adapt in fact this gene helps increase tissue repair\nAnd its switched on by a group of genes called short too and now they've found two things at Harvard number one caloric restriction increases these longevity genes the sirtuin\nWell so does resveratrol at least in their animal studies and this is exactly why ... been making all these worldwide headlines because if it works in humans as it does and these animals and I'm optimistic it will\nIt represents an entirely new approach to managing health and wellness where we potentially using a traditional compound like resin ... target the exact genes associated with these various areas of improvement then our health and our aging and our longevity\nWell now that the president you said that took you ten ... elite status in the nutritional supplements industry has been so well documented so well researched you call this evidence based nutrition maybe give us a brief overview of the research and explain why co Q. ten researchers so widely respected\nWell let's go back to Nineteen fifty seven University of Wisconsin\nThe Nobel Prize for Peter Mitchell in Nineteen Seventy eight\nThe University of Texas Medical school Purdue University in Indiana Stockholm University in Sweden the great study recently at the University of and Conan and mentally on mitochondrial energy and co Q. ten University of Grenada in Spain\nTalking about co Q. ten being a powerful anti off some articles published constantly throughout the world\nThe archives of biochemistry and bio synthesis the proceedings of the national Academy of sciences major studies major universities right here with the United states and abroad the bottom line in these studies\nEnergetic mitochondria without co Q. ten you don't have energy combine that with resveratrol I'm telling you pretty darn amazing\nNow that you present purity products occasionally does these free bottled give away with this one sounds really special wasted is so important\nWell I mean you really get an opportunity you get a chance to see for yourself what I'm Talking about I mean you can hear me speak about energy and physical performance and there's nothing quite like experiencing it for yourself\nI mean you hear me say some pretty amazing things and you say well that's pretty interesting but until you know until you try this for yourself by taking too soft gels a day of this co Q. super boosts formula\nYou're not going to really appreciate what I'm Talking about and the best way to do that is to call the number you gave out get your free supplied try it for yourself and you'll see the difference\nMore with our guest Dr Allen precedent in the middle but right now purity products recognize leader in the field of evidence based

this and I knew there was a meeting with Dr canal from the vitamin D council and it's made me a believer would you added vitamin D and you've added vitamin B. twelve\nAny lifelong scars from that because they have lots of H. A. on board highly around a gas it\nAnd to make this easy to understand for the audience I think we can all appreciate that women have smoothing skin and thicker hair and so on all of that is because estrogen sends a signal to make more ha and that's why the girls\nHave more limber flexible joints they can get in a kind of a load of posture kind of the men can't get into they\nThey certainly have all of those advantages and that's because the estrogen sends a signal\nTo make more ha now women have more ha to lose the men do and you see the skin shoveling up the joints and so on as women age but there's a way to get it back and of course parity products for years now has been talking about ha and they have a new formula just for the joints\nH H joint formula and it's so important today because\nI think everyone's confused an article in the New York times says consumers are confused what to do to support their joints took people are looking for alternative we need cushioning in between the joints the bones in our joints when a doctor looks at an X ray\nAll he's doing is measuring the space between the two bones there in the knees so it's about a quarter of an air and space without that cushioning you've got bone rubbing on bone\nThat's what age a is it that\nHello or the cushioning agent in between our bones we lose it either due to wear and tear or age and so we started getting problems the more that we find pain relief\nThe more pain relievers we use\nThe more we're going to use these joints and then we're going to wear out more bone and they've noticed this people who chronically use pain relievers\nAre going to have more bone where so what you need is the actual cushioning back there to lubricate the joint and that's what ha does that what ha is that doctors call it ... fluid\nThey actually inject this into joints orthopedist do dermatologist injected into the skin I doctors use it as a lubricant during eye surgery so it's nothing foreign to modern medicine but it may be new to you as a listener there and you have never heard about ha before well\nYou need to learn about it it's a wonderful molecule it's all natural and you can get it as a dietary supplement purity products was the first to introduce it now\nIt's a great big long molecule path that six million Dalton's and molecular weight think of\nSix million paper clips put together its big you can absorb it and purity found a way to knock it down so that it's only about Fifteen hundred to three thousand that means that you can absorb this orally we actually proved that in studies conducted at the laboratory right there in Florida and we're going to tell you more about that but\nWe proved that it's orally absorbed most doctors are told that oral ha cannot be absorbed that's true if it's the regular ha it's got to be knocked down in molecular weight and more important it needs some other antioxidants to be added where that we're going to talk about one here in just a moment but\nPurity products is introducing this all new joint formula for people that are searching for alternatives or their joint health and of course this isn't a drug it's a dietary supplement meant to of course support healthy joint health as as we think of it\nYou're just tuning in we're talking with Bill ... acid or Eighteen bill you said recently that the H a revolution is under way more and more people are using it tell us why ... such a breakthrough and what exactly can you do for people\nI think the brick and mortar analogy is probably the best for everybody to understand it there are bricks in our body the cells there's mortar in between and the mortar is the college and now within the college and not the college in itself vitamin C. makes college\nBut within that college and there's a moisture rising agent that looks like Jell O and everyone knows you put some jello in the refrigerator and the water separates out after a time and that's what's happening in our body we're losing the water holding molecule ha\nThe body is Seventy two percent water\nAnd as we lose this the connective tissue that connects all of our cells that connects all of everything that we have begins to lose its water at separates out and then we begin to lose\nThe substance the scaffolding ... the support structure that holds our body together\nAnd of course we didn't get into a wrinkle we shrivel up we lose an inch in our height\nWe we see the the brain a shriveled up in the eye and so on all of these things occur with age and you know ... daily on was looking\nFor a youth molecule and he wanted to find it and of course the fountain of youth the water he was looking for water fountain the body needs water but it has to hold it and of course I Want everyone to think\nOf having something like\nA jello a type of a water balloon filled with jello or one filled with water which one do you want you want the one filled with jello because it's still from but soft cushioning and that's the way our bodies are when we're young babies\nOr even a pregnant woman is loaded with this which is an example of how the ha is made more so at certain times of our life but as age goes on we're going to lose it we're going to see the wrinkles that thinning hair\nWe're going to see our joints lose their flexibility we're just telling people that after thousands of people have tried this if you're\nTaking ... supplements you took Thirteen Years\nFor doctors to adopt glue casa means sulfate it's a regular dietary supplement noun drugstores health food stores\nPeople ask me well why hasn't my doctor told me about highly ironic gas it well it took Thirteen Years for casa me it'll be on the front page of time magazine it's just going to take time\nAnd it'll get there because patients are going to take this to the doctors and pointed out\nAs they did glue costs I mean the revolution starts with patients and people that have issues and want to have healthy joints and skin and hair and eyes and want to see some of these useful levels of ha restored in their body\nNow do you've written a great deal about the role of highly want a gas it in the bodies connective tissue how does each a work in the joints and the connective tissue\nIt's a natural cushioning agent and pat we're talking about between the bones it also surrounded the nerves there's a ... addict nerve there's an owner nerve there's a carpal tunnel or\nAll of these are going to need the special cushioning that ha can give them there are people that tell us this stuff works here's Bernie writing to me who's actually teaches and plays golf in Dover, Delaware he found this purity joint formula and were telling you\nIt work miracles for him why because purity is not only taken the ha but they've taken a brand new substance called high drops that's taken from olives pat you notice\nYou can put a bowl of olives on your table and a year later come back and except for a little bit of a shrinkage due to just the loss of moisture they're very stable they're still there\nThey didn't shrivel up and waste away do the fungal contamination so\nThere's something very strong and all as we've known it for a long time Dr Roberta Korea an Italian researcher who is now here in this country doing some research on hide Roxy tier is all\nExtracted from olives and found out that it does some of the same things that the molecules do that trigger like estrogen does the production of ha so\nWe began to think why don't we combine this wonderful strong antioxidant from olives into ... new ha joint for a meal you know we're getting results like we've never seen before this is why bill of rights to us this year saying I'm taking ha from my knees it's done wonders for my joints so\nWe get these letters from people there unsolicited\nYou see this is the kind of thing we hear and of course they're astounded with this\nThey just can't believe it here's someone writing to me this is a doctor ... saying he looks like a man that's Thirty years younger and he says people can't even believe this level of fitness and youthful appearance and he says I tell you to tell them it's just the H a formula\nAnd of course he sent us pictures on the Internet\nHow fit he looks for his age and you're going to look a little younger because when you were young you had a lot of this now this stuff works fairly quick much faster than glue costs I mean and it's all safe all natural its purity H A joint formula and pat\nMost of the people who write to me or call me or not people who regularly fall for you

mean some of these studies you sent your absolutely incredible\nAs you know I'm very into neutral picks the anti aging community has taken a keen interest in Korea teen specifically the cognitive benefits of Korea Team\nOh absolutely this is one of those areas where Korea Team really shine you see what we need to understand is that your brain even though it's only two percent of your body's weight it utilizes twenty percent of your body's energy this is a very thirsty Oregon\nFor energy and just like your muscles soak up decree it seemed like a sponge because this is a naturally occurring molecule in the body it passes right through the blood brain barrier\nYour brain or an soak it up like a sponge and it increases your Korea Team phosphate reserves in your brain to now in your brain you have more readily available resources to do was to recharge those neuronal batteries to make more energy inside the brain so basically what do you notice what your memory is supported\nAnd pat scientists have done some amazing research here they found the people that take Korea teen\nIts support their memory it actually helps the brain to utilize\nOxygen better it supports memory and people that are sleep deprived it's been shown to help people add numbers quicker and for longer periods of time without mental fatigue get this study pat just five days five days of eight grams of creativity and supported mental tasks in subjects that we're getting\nRapid fire question scientists were asking them\nMath questions in science questions over and over and over and

has all your cellular battery so all of your cells tissues and organs have more readily available energy\nOr dark I loved that ever strong appeals to athletes and people want to get more reps\nJim maybe get some extra power and their workouts\nBut you're also saying there's a big push a nutritional community to encourage people in their forties fifties sixties seventies and even eighties to leverage the power of Korea teen to stay fit strong and healthy if you say\nKorea teen is going mainstream you know I share the story with me for my mom who's in her late seventies now she's taking creating she works out a couple of days a week three days a week she goes to novelist does the free weights because she's got osteoporosis she wants to maintain her muscle mass and she wants to make her bones stronger and as you pointed out creating helps to do that\nAnd then the other three days during the week she'll go and she'll swim now she's not trying to get bigger stronger or anything like that but even at her age Korea teen has benefits\nOh yeah and what blows me away about that story 'cause you told me before\nIs that her medical doctor recommended for your team for and that just goes to show how much more mainstream this is it's called every strong\nAnd it supports the muscles that supports your power your strengths your speed if you're an athlete you're certainly going to love it but even if you're not an athlete you notice the difference let's go to another study one more review study this out of the journal current aging science December of two thousand thirty and I thought this was very cool\n'cause the researchers looked at the body of research out there on creating and seniors without exercise they want to see what happens when seniors take Korea teen and they don't\nExercise so I'm quoting here creating supplementation without associated resistance training seems to enhance muscular strength power and insurance increase lean body mass\nFor those that don't know what that is they're talking about muscle and improve the functional capacity of the elderly they go on to talk about how it supports bone health as well and then they finished with this creating supplementation without training in the elderly could potentially delay atrophy of muscle and unproven difference and\nStrength so here again we see bottom line ... team is very very effective it's

O. B. and then there's a lot of people out there listening that frankly hate their jail the and and maybe some people in the middle my point of view is this\nIf you could make the money you're making now at your J. O. B. and instead work two hours a day from home would you make that change\nI think you probably would you\nKnow I used to work for a large corporation in my normal day was twelve hours and maybe that's a little bit more than what the average person works but you know let's say you're working eight or nine hours if you could trade in eight hours for two hours\nJust make the same amount of money you're making today would you make that trade\nAnd I think for most people the answer's yes and I you know the second question to follow that up is then what are you going to do with all that extra time that you just gained\nWell the fact is ... it's a life changing thing you would be able to do something else productive spend more time with your family or utilize that time any way you want to\nSo this opportunity is potentially life changing\nTo anybody that is working now I realize that there are some people that are already in control of their schedule or their hours but I'm telling you this is an easy way to just put in a couple of hours a day and make a full time or or more than a full time income you know the great thing John too is\nThere's no limit there is no end cap here and how much you can make you can keep going and going in progressive leaves you get better you can make more and more money\nBut you know the main message we want to get across is this is for that average person that's putting in that long day\nAnd I used to be that guy I used to work six days a week and when I was off on Sunday [laughter] I was so tired my kids were like oh you better not better not bother dad it's only day off\nYou know and now it's like I've been in heaven for a few years and I actually get to raise my son and my daughter I get to spend all the time in the world with them you know we just got back from California and I got to spend\nBhutto's from once a week month after thirty one twenty five I'm a critical I wanted to be able to do some sense of credit thirty dollars to fix the scripts into my\nCar insurance visit Geico dot com to see how much you can save your life in a new one I decided about me Carmen from the Knight Cal to shout at a great weekend and make sure you check out our show Monday and every weekday morning\nThanks hand\nCount that after ... [laughter]\n\nI like to welcome you back to the trading room show this show is about an amazing opportunity we say make five hundred five thousand dollars a day like Michael said you can make more than that but this is what I Love about this opportunity and I want you to hear this anybody can do it anybody\nWhat makes it phenomenal and makes people laugh\nIs my wife has even said that when she sat in on a session\nAnd she said John this is so easy I think even you could do it [laughter]\nAnd and that is so true I'm not tech savvy I'm not Internet savvy I'm One of those guys who needs a dumb phones I even I struggle with my smartphone every day and even I got this\nIt was absolutely like Michael says really easy and our mentor\nHe monitors you and the session and and that helps out a lot too because it's nice to have the software and it's nice to have the expertise but to have him there motivating you and telling your stuff and his analogies are spot on they make everything so easy to understand so\nThat knowledge that you get in my opinion is second to none you'll walk away with a Harvard degree in making money or how do you get involved you call\nEight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven\nAnd someone will answer the phone and get you in the session and Michael and I will go over that now Michael how can you get involved\nOr thinks John you know first of all ... just to make sure we're clear you're not technically going to get a Harvard degree or just have to just an analogy there folks but um you are going to get an education and\nThat's what makes us different from other trading groups is at our mentors providing an education most groups you show up and if it's live you're usually just reading a software\nIf it's alive group you're sitting in session and I've been part of this if there's nothing going on if there's not an active trade developing there's just nothing there is just silence no talking and you can attest to this year in the group and um you know our mentor is never quiet\nSo between what we would call action he's providing an education to everyone in the group and like you said John you're going to receive\nThe utmost level of education from one of the for most people in the industry he wrote this program he developed his program research this program for over twenty six years and he put it all together and then he put it into a format\nHe coined the phrase thinking ... so that he simplified it into a process that anybody can do it it's a simple follow along color coded system\nThat he verbally describes as well as it's happening there is no panicking needed when you're involved in our mentor actually verbally talks you through it\nThere's a precise entry point and it's clear as day right on the screen so when we say the system is very simple and and it's written on an elementary level it's color coded\nAnd then on top of that you're being verbally instructed so it provides a level of mental comfort that you're doing the right thing at the right times it's just reinforcement and on top of that the accuracy of the software in its signals\nIs unprecedented compared to anything else I've ever seen\nAnd I've shopped more than twenty different programs if you want to see it here it and witness this for yourself we don't want you to believe what we're saying here on the show\nWe want you to see it then you can leave us after you see it\nYou can call us at our eight hundred number after you've come in and sat in on a session and let's talk about any differences you might have seen between what you saw in the real session and what we talked about on the radio I I'd love to hear if there was anything that you thought was different because [noise]\nIf anything I feel like on the show we under state things um we like to be very conservative with our expectations I'm not going to sit here and and talk about hey you know we had someone in the group that may twenty thousand dollars in the day or is this guy over here routinely makes ten thousand dollars in a day [noise]\nI don't like to emphasize those types of stories but I'd rather say is that an average person is going to make five hundred dollars a day maybe a thousand dollars a day and maybe more than that so if this is something that you might want to take advantage of give us a call\nEight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven that's eight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven\nReserve you're spot in a couple of our sessions there is no cost to you all you have to do is make that reservation we have people right now answering the phones live\nI'm so give us a call check us out in and see this for yourself see if it's right for you you can witness real people\nAre trading real money our phone lines do get busy during the show this is hugely popular like I said we welcome to a lot of members just within the last month and this really is the new age of income\nIf people can trade in their current job\nAnd get out of their traditional habits\nYou know it's interesting when you think about traditional habits it's like you know my dad had a J. O. B. or my mom had a ... and you know they're just used to that and you know back in the day hey if you want to make more money will go out and get another job that pays more\nAnd with this this is completely different you don't even have to leave your house all you need is a computer and Internet service\nSo check us out for yourself I'm at the very least you can probably replace your current income uh but more likely\nYou can far surpass that\nAnd uh you know I Want to comment on what I said at the beginning you're right they won't get a Harvard degree because that cost about three hundred grand and uh and and now you come out with a degree and then you have to pay that back\nNow you have to get a job and pay it back so are there are other trading schools but there are two things they don't have\nOur software and the leadership of our mentors or we have the software and the leadership of our mentor every morning he he gets as motivated his leadership and personalities and ...\nIt's like a classroom and it'll it literally it'll change the way you think uh I don't think the way I I used to anymore at all or he reduces the variables in this thing to make it where you can make more money\nBut what's more important is his passion or isn't just getting people to make more money his passion is also in people keeping it which is so important\nWhen I got involved in this I was building my nest and now what I'm doing is building my nest egg and I want a big will ostrich egg or like you said I don't want to say how much I made last week\nBut let's just say I did better last week than in any job I've ever had and that's working just two hours a day and I I did I think eleven trades nine were winters in the other two I did wrong I I I didn't really I didn't exactly stick to the plan I didn't follow our mentor\nAnd are the two I did wrong I did on my own so that's that was my fault you start you start to think you know what you're doing and that's kind of when you get into trouble so where else are you going to find a group\nLike this where you have a mentor like we have to guide you only are trading group has mentors like we have to guide you and only our group has the software program we have to guide you and make this easy like Michael says this is the new age of earning\nA like you said I was raised to think you get a job\nAnd you go to work at seven in the morning and you worked there for thirty plus years and with this with this it was hard to grasp since it's it's two hours a day that you could work literally a couple of hours and just click the mouse\nWhy like that you talked about the number of trades you attempted yourself personally you know if we attest to the accuracy of the software that a couple of weeks ago or a mentor was in session and he was near rating and describing ...\nChain trades that he made that week from Monday to friday and fourteen of those Fifteen trades were good this is not an exact science no one will ever win a hundred percent but fourteen or Fifteen that week we're good we don't want to sound like we're selling this\nWe want to show it to you\nIf you see it and you think this opportunity is phenomenal and that's what you're going to see a great way to make money from home or any location yeah I was just in California last week and I'm In my hotel room on my computer and you can trade anywhere the Internet is\nSo if you're looking for a very intriguing an easy way to generate income or invest this is a nice way to do it\nYou get to hold onto your own funds you actually open up your own account it's in your Dame nobody sees and nobody has access to it but you all we do is guide you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Mike Calta Show", "city": "Sarasota", "day": "27"}
