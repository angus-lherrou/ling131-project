today's news\nWhat do we have a news\nPaul Allen the co founder of Microsoft died on Monday in Seattle He was only sixty five years you know he was sick I did not know even in the yeah the cause was complications of non Hodgkin's lymphoma\nI guess he had come out he had it like six years ago is in remission and then a few weeks ago came out and said that it did come back whatever and then boom starting to think it's for the gamut from the computer screen oh maybe it's a possibility\nI Ellen was also the owner of the NBA or Portland TrailBlazers the NFL's Seattle Seahawks and had a stake in Seattle sound or soccer team along with the drew Carey and some other people there it was worth north of twenty billion dollars and\nWas married for him and didn't have any kids\nNo money to somebody well he is given their zillion where they dodge huh [laughter] I was having a very good day today he has given billions of dollars to charity and stuff he was a big Jimi Hendrix fan\nHe's the one who built that whole experience thing in Seattle you know so he does a lot of a full entropy he also gay men ah I don't know I think\nHe's a smart with is twenty million ... million dollars a year old says one of the biggest yachts that you'll know really and you it's been parked over here\nSeveral times right off the candy bridge you could see it over there because I Believe that the uh the company over there does maintenance Stewart cleans it around here but there were a lot of times where it would be parked out there and everybody would just lose their minds over this gigantic floating houses\nHad a helicopter on top of it had a sailboat on it had other boats to get to short boats that are bigger than most votes that they have all the time whatever three helicopter yeah ours\nAre so listen to this this guy that we knew uh whenever I Lived up in Destin he would tell us how you would\nBe a party and stuff and he goes yeah I was out and uh I was out on Paul Allen's a yacht and stuff and really yeah okay and uh he goes yeah and a bottle was there and we're a party in this and I'm like approve it like I mean you were saying this stuff and he goes oh yeah here and get pictures on his phone and its\nThey haven't bought out anytime the yacht and I go\nHow are you there turns out his family owns Napa off ... yeah and uh I was out okay you know somebody says am party with bottle on Paul Allen did not an actor\nLike OK guy whatever you say the a yacht it was called the octopus nice and it is worth two hundred and fifty million dollars oh it is and it's a small cruise ship yeah\nCredible a small cruise ship but then like Alberta has so many other vessel within it right there is a garage I don't know if you could see in the back where they got a full sized boat that goes in and out of their incredible yeah I mean well that's because if you want to live on this thing and you want to park it out and\nYou know uh you know five miles offshore or whatever you have to go back and forth you're not pull it up to the er well taken off\nThe main yeah you're not going to wherever the Jacksons [laughter] to go check out shepherd's really good question so at this guy didn't leave is money to anybody in particular in his well what do you take your own all the sports teams do you remember when I got\nTo make a wheel right now I'm sure he did I'm just saying he didn't have a wife or a kid so they're not getting the money so he used to go now I'm sure give the money to a lot of different things that you know how people and what\nI my question I guess it's more if you don't leave your money to someone does the state just take it or does it government take it or does he you know ...\nAnd ... next to Ken yeah they say yeah they'll they'll find somebody but um you know it also depends on whether or not he's got a a you know he's got what every oh it was money to like I'm sure he's financially tied to whatever sports teams the on so they got to get the or a piece of St live you\nDie without a will it means you have\nDied I in in a in a state entertained I don't know that's where I'm an adult when this happens the or laws\nOf the state where are you a reside will determine on how your property is distributed upon your death this includes a bank account securities real estate other assets you out of the time you're done yes I Would imagine if you don't have any family if you were totally alone and you add twenty billion dollars Seattle is like here\nWe are [laughter] Pixar [laughter]\nGonna make it a habit I this is some pretty interesting video Lakeland police Lakeland here right here Lakeland, Florida\nReleased surveillance video that gives the public an up close view of a shooting it's a crucial crucial piece of evidence that investigators are using to decide whether lately in city commissioner Michael Dunn who was forty seven years old should face charges and the October third killing of Cristobal Lopez who is fifty years old we\nHave the security video up on ... TV there is no sound but watch this is a pretty crazy I I don't know whether you're trying to do stand your ground here but there's a guy and he grabbed him by the I'm the ice trying to leave them shot right that he was Amish shoplifting\nStill that's what I'm saying but that's why he rather that that's a cop wouldn't you for shoplifting yeah that this guy's this guy is definitely the wrong yeah I don't I don't know what I stand your ground you stand your ground the guys trying to run\nAway from you and you're holding him ... right you're kidnapping is what you're doing yeah there is no way he was in fear for his life is those parts of the video goes I mean certainly doesn't look like\nYou're you do you he is not somebody who has to be responsible for somebody else shoplifting right when even shoplifting now as he was accused of shoplifting\nHatchet oh yeah they said it they are on the uh thing\nBut I mean if he wasn't using that hatch try and hit that guy in the face with it then there's no reason that this happens right and uh oh there goes down and they're going to have a\nUh that's horrible yeah had horrible and that is a blatant abuse of\nOf power and a authority where a guy thinks or because he hold some sort of a office that he can wield his weapon that way that he was a cop now right that's not the case and even a cop would not use lethal force to stop a guy from shoplifting statutes that guy goes to jail\nYeah yeah he's definitely I Would imagine he is definitely going to jail or fears plans to close another one hundred and forty two unprofitable stores\nAs part of its chapter eleven bankruptcy on top of the forty six stores are closing announced in August liquidation sales at the additional stories are expected to begin within two weeks to get into Sears if you need some stuff\nAnd what about what though like I'm going to go to ... and I'm going to be like I Need to get some tools because I don't have any tools nearly okay well we're just kind of right now instead of eighty dollars Seventy six ... not the only time it's worth it as if you go to the very last the very next day I'm nothing left\nMe and stop the way she says it which is unfortunate but that would probably be the case but what a pitch fishy is ah Hillary Brooke\nIs a lady and with that it looks like she has a lot of black friends on Facebook Like a lot of gangster looking a black friends like guys friend about money and stuff you know what I mean right a guy spoken we'd have a toilet that's the kind of gang style in particular she is that\nThe um ... it's unbelievable to me enjoy your job or so you were talking about this morning your neighbors had a big pumpkin had floating and scared the hell out of an ... foot ... going to\nSell it happens every Halloween I had happened there's maybe five year old guy in Ohio his name as a ... whole singer all ah he made it look like a plane had crashed\nAs bright yard ... that's pretty cool yeah with fake skeletons in which is in the\nCockpit okay okay I'm so far so good but it looks real enough for people to call nine one one I mean real quick though are let\nMe see we have some B roll as a video of it and stuff and it shows the skeletons and stuff it's a very small looks like an ultralight almost it's a very small little plane whatever Wachovia you're killing at the scale I'm sure\nYeah and you can tell that it is not a real plane or a plane crash may even interviewed died too like teenaged neighbors and they're like we can't believe people are calling like clearly it's a Halloween you know decoration and stuff do we have the uh for the ...\n... ...\nAll Galvin that's on you write I so so what do they do they call nine one one yeah and the guy with the ... uh which is one of the human right house yeah the guy laughed about it and stuff so that's acceptable and ... except in two thousand one anytime after a while before that or several years afterward be OK\nYeah it is and like take a second it maybe go go to hide that concern go to that house and go hey did a plane crash in your ... nope those are my hallowed Halloween decorations which is on the loose yeah\nWas era which there was a pie leaving your aircraft that I fell into your thing yeah them either as a joyous energy but don't worry about it next step is the guy who looks like somebody we know\nIf they were fat OK okay but I'm going to give you the back story I don't put the picture up yeah tell you what I call for it now what do you guys when I call for it for you guys to a a immediately yellow your answer okay All right man was\nBusted for child pornography when his apartment company noticed his child porn screen saver during their fire extinguisher ... now this is how down this guy as he was booked on ten counts of child pornography but tenets\nNotified by email three days prior to put their fire extinguisher\nOut front of their apartment or they were coming together or their income and get them yeah so this guy didn't do it left a screen saver what child porn on it so they went in and they were like obviously it's not even one of the smart [laughter] yeah right [laughter] I'm Down now this does not reflect on the person who this last like okay I'm gonna I'm gonna have to show the picture\nAs soon as you see it yell out it as a person that we know if they were fat who does this look like do you go\nOh really oh I had a who all of our all of a you know I don't really know that fat my column Errol yeah Joey and you\nGet to the media lobby and I see it now you say if I stared at a little longer I ... I even got expecting someone with a more obvious as soon as I thought I'd go that fast myself Federer right but like if you told me this is my older brother I Would be like your average yeah yeah I Am fine with me [laughter]\nI've also seen five dollar oh yeah I remember those years oh that that's why it was like that but yeah yeah I see it in the face yeah for sure in the face this guy is like of all over it and how many ... [laughter] yeah right and he was balding and he worked in like eighty or something right now he he was my Colorado without Kong\nFor Kong Gina Hi the way if the guy working id he'd probably wouldn't have child porn is extreme favor or maybe a little further I don't know put it in a folder\nSomewhere that more of these stories that you tell us about the more I think Mike is right and one of these people they know they're sick\nAnd they just want to get caught I Want to be done with the guilt that they live with there'd be down there would be I mean why would you do that all you had to do what's right what's your out front that's it they come in\nBut the other thing also is well maybe your rights when it's like if you're just looking at child porn that's that's like I never understood why people who look\nThe child porn always going to travel and people may ... child porn seem to get away with all the time you know what I mean yeah like you always believe like oh we busted this guy or a library vote child porn always you know that looking at it and then like you know what that looks like it's from Wisconsin you should probably trace it back to\nFind out who do then they go out I ... I think what the problem is is the people making the child porn are a lot harder to get than the people that are looking at it well and it sort of looking at Andrea if you're looking at it you're probably you could definitely act on it you know and then making your own so\nI uh have you given people that like a child porn to pass or no no it's just kind of like you're saying is that why is that\nAlways like you never hear about a child video production ring\nWell yeah what I think it is and you do sometimes but I Would equate it to you never you don't hear as much as we got this guy with you know five\nHundred pounds of cocaine where we we busted you know eighty different people that had a little bag your cocaine or know what I mean so a lot harder to get the main guy than it is you get all these idiots that are leaving porn on their hearing seriously now I'd definitely\nYou definitely don't get a pass by I also so I was talking to some cops about I'm about ... you know kids are trading now the now the new thing they study use these video games\nBecause people are trading through the dark Web and they're trading on line and and the porn guys the the pedophiles are doing it on video games 'cause we're sure either way to find a bunch of kids that's why I hopped on four nights a little while trying to learn how to play nice by on my son when he played there once in a while\nJust to make sure no groups are coming out of him yeah um but they do all that there and\nNow the cops are going in and monitoring them they're playing it and they're getting in which I think is great uh but I said I was like why\nDon't you do it makes it gives a lot of the production comes from out of this country which makes it impossible for us unless you're a great job he'll order it's\nToo far to writing and what area of ... charges against you know whatever country around which is brilliant yeah\nUm no but uh uh he said that any photograph that you get right now that's child porn they have already\nThey've seen it like there could be millions of us are going but they've mark them all so when you get it they know that you're getting a sure now if you get one in your email and your opener they gonna comes former house no but if you start collecting thousands of them and distributing the other people right\nAds when you've than when they got a flag and they know to come the comes swooping in and yeah so have you been getting away for for a year that's what he or the you know you're also not getting away with it they no no I Know why change are getting away they're watching to see what you do it it's the same people that don't pay their taxes\nThey're like oh it's been like four years my taxes yeah they're gonna get like you know it's not like they're like oh no they're just building a case against you and let you do all your dumped\n... I I used to not there was one year where I was late doing my tax returns and I didn't do it and then I was like I was getting money back Mm this is decades ago mhm and I was oh man uh then the next year I was afraid to ... ... square right up next\nTo Chris down around this fits [laughter] All right I'm\nGoing to go over the world around me were three stories up a seat on the on the tree right there\nAre by labs grow squarely news that I should tell him right out and ride to me and I forget my tax or [laughter] that terrifies and by the IRS absolutely Frank now know the interesting thing about that though you said you were getting money back and you still didn't do it\nRemember that portion of your life where no matter what you had the money to pay your electric bill that you're like I got a male and get a check and then I go and have to do and you wouldn't do it it was ... down there until the power went out and there are a now you got to pay an extra fifty dollars or whatever my credit\nWas so bad from the time that I graduated McGregor very left saying Leo and live with Pete and it wasn't that we didn't have money it was just that I couldn't remember to pay right stuff on time say that my wife took my credit from a for hundreds to the eight hundreds and just because you pay my bills on time yeah that was it\nThis dummy gotta ... because I was in ... it was the worst in I mean not that I had a ton of money but I have money to pay my car payment and stuff and the guy came in was hooking up my car and I was like oh what are you doing knowing full well that I hadn't paid whatever and he was like I got to take a borough is listen\nI'll even five minutes to get whatever you want out of it and stuff which was cool of him to do and I said I wasn't trying to find them or anything I was like I Know I\n...

thousand dollars are\nSo let's say this town of ... says you know what we don't get the tax dollars here and the tourist money from Daytona Daytona five hundred bike week uh we don't get the money nobody travel in Milton right right and ... when they do uh we're not getting the money that Disney gets\nMiami South Beach more international tourists from your\nGo to South Beach we're not getting the tourist dollars from the Tampa Bay market that come and get condo rentals and fishing charters from cs sticky all the way up to palm harbor or up here in the Florida Panhandle now this little town in the Florida Panhandle did a study I'm going to grab a number just outta my ass\nThey said you know what we're counting five thousand cars a week that Dr ... to go to Biloxi to gamble\nAnd does not happen I oh yeah yeah we lived up there\nAnd they said you know if we had a casino we could compete for the tourist dollars with Disney and with Daytona and with ... beaches are nice area and they went on a county wide referendum and Seventy five percent of the county said we'll do it because that's one of the poorest areas of the state of Florida\nSo this time before amendment three they would go to the state and say look we've done this study we've got county approval from all the voters right voters this is something that they won\nThe state of Florida would look at it and they would try to make a deal or make something happen under amendment three if this passes and this I Want to make very clear\nThat people of Miami that people uh Jacksonville that people are Daytona the people of South Florida the people of Tampa Bay are going to make that decision for that casino in the panhandle do you want people across state deciding what's good for you and the Tampa Bay market\nI don't they don't live here and do you think mentioned is there's a guy got two kids and a wife driving down to Disney for the Florida vacation\nThey stop in the panhandle casino dad blows two hundred and fifty on the blackjack table you think Disney isn't over here saying\nYou know we saw these backdoor passes at two hundred and fifty a piece he just lost it up in the panhandle ah we got to have more money it's greedy Disney corporate America who has put in over ten million dollars to back amendment three and so is the seminal Indians because\nWe've got the hard rock here and we don't want any competition\nAnd we have it here and we have it in South Florida in Fort Myers right\nBut as a statewide initiative with the money they have to put advertising as they're doing now on TV and radio and print they can fool you\nSee so so what is the all the alternative if we vote no on three\nRight it gives the power back to the legislature and frankly the Florida legislator legislators at the pooch\nThey've gone through so many different gambling contracts and deals with the Seminoles you've got para mutual tracks all over the state that right or wrong county wide referendum and said we need this in order to keep people employed in order to raise tax dollars\nAnd the state of Florida said at one time okay you passed it on a county wide referendum will give it to you and then they change their mind I'm not saying the state of Florida is doing a good job when it comes to expand it gambling this will completely stop it and that's not only are we\nGoing to explain it's a way to completely stop it because you think the money that lies with the existing a Disney is on the existing casinos will be enough to ah\nTo stop absolutely and and the people of South Florida don't care about Milton, Florida\nThey don't care about their needs and it's not just milk and I'm just using them as an example there's a lot of poor areas in Florida that could see a financial gain so we had a future down the road let's say Twenty years down the road we're being very short sighted we're not going to see casinos in the next five years I Know that\nBut Twenty years down the road when they need to build bridges and infrastructure and we need which we need now more schools and teacher raises\nIf a casino paying billions of dollars statewide could go into that fund would you support that you wouldn't be able to Twenty years from now I wouldn't be able to know not if not amendment three passes and\nWhy we won't be able to have the votes statewide vote\nYeah you will but convinced that people in another location that's something that's good for your area and something unique\nBut why I Am now I'm just playing devil's advocate why why if you come to me and say hey we're voting on this casino and milk\nMay need to know why would I care for those I go to the does you're an independent take her and you ... your\nHair let a lot of people most people and I ... a lot of people just listen to the commercials and they vote that way why they don't bother reading\nHere in ... you're better than never listen to the commercials those ... and I don't just mean for this I mean if you're looking at what the real issues are and what the candidates in four to five minutes of your own Google research even Google Now can be bought out and dig a little deeper\nIf you're a registered voter they send you the information I got mine in the mail yesterday and I've already read every amendment yeah and there's a lot of them I'm totally against so many confuses so dry there's a um it's like this ... amendment number four it sounds like a good idea victims rights\nThere's already victims rights in the state of Florida asked the dumb\nYou weren't notified of court hearings you're notified when somebody's ongoing for parole and by the constitution alone you have a right to face your accuser in court why do we need another ... this is another one of these bundled amendments by the CRC out of Tallahassee that meets every Twenty years and Pam Bondi was leading this one [noise]\nAnd basically what they did is they bundled a bunch of amendments into this amendment six it's amendment six not for by the way Murphy's law\nAnd that extends the retirement age of a judge\nTo Seventy five in the state of Florida do you want us Seventy five year old man deciding your fate know if it's civil court criminal court do you want a Seventy five year old judge I sure as hell don't rise out of the\nFive year old judge has nothing in common with Spanish\nRight out of the men\nAnd right now retirement age for judges I Seventy in Florida a lot of people don't realize that we're going to extend the retirement age oh this amendment as well I'm In ...\nHas another little bundle in there that states that a judge cannot go to another judge or law body and get an opinion on a court ruling right now you're in front of a judge and the judge is looking at past rulings he's looking at the law the letter of the law\nAnd he says you know what this is like king Solomon did we cut the child and a half to share it with both parents I'm not sure I mean let me go and ask judge brown and let me ask this opinion that\nThis would stop the judges have our friend asking for outside help on a case and as I've said this ... totally strips the defendant of due process that means you if you're innocent and arrested\nYou're still a criminal my ... and you take away due process that's guaranteed under the constitution of the United states you're messing with something you shouldn't be messing with says right sounds good then\nAll of them ... my heartstrings have you seen the commercials remmer oh you want to cry you want to write a check\nWhen you say something on your radio voice and you're looking at I feel like I've got busted\nBy ah [laughter] I got no more [laughter] if I Do I let me say this and I hope you guys will join me ... ... yeah no no I'm Renee I'm to cook and wait to see those commercials\nAnd your eye and out of ... really [laughter]\nAnd there's one more thing amendment number for that I did screw up and got that messed up with ... amendment for is one that I think is very important and I can explain why and that is what you'll hear people Boo Boo out when I say this\nReince storing of felons right to vote right now convicted felons do not have a right to vote in the state of Florida and let me give you a for instance Eighteen year old African American kid in Orlando screwed up ran with the wrong crowd yeah did something stupid it was a felony and he got busted and he was sent to start prison did his time\nHe's a fifty year old man now with two kids getting ready to go to college she's been married to the same woman his nose has been clean up a homeowner and he's a taxpayer and he's fifty and he screwed up at Eighteen sure he's still pay for that\nBrown and these people that I wrote a time and I argue with people and they say the first thing is what about repeat offenders repeat offenders if they repeat offenders in our lives ours are already behind bars that you'd think they'd get squat about who's running for they\nShall I think even if you're even if you're a young kid got busted for five years and you get out you know you do your five to seven years around five years\nAfter that time over after you've done your time you're back in society you should be able to get your eyes to keep your nose you have your taxes you sure are and looked property taxes aren't going down yeah oh I mean read these amendments to come in again or the day before election day and go over these men\nUnfortunately a lot of the mail in ballots are already going in and a majority of mail in ballots go right in the trash that's already been proven look it up Tampa Bay times did a great article you don't really go to them unless they need them right no it's a matter of your signature first of all there is a thing\nNurture portion on that mail in ballot and if it's if it's not their\nVoice and and if it doesn't match up to your signature with the voter registration office was mine never do yeah I registered to vote at the age of Eighteen okay\nMy signatures changed drastically since I was Eighteen if they took my signature from a mail in ballot and compared to when I registered to vote in the state of Florida ever would look at it and go oh there's two different people used to some of them like Michael Jackson this is the right this is a fraud and they throw my ballot\nAh I I Am moved from county to county I moved from ... to Hillsborough congratulations Oh thank you I'm moving up and I tried to go on the website and you might change of address and then told me a yes I'll go to ... no sorry I Can't do it\nI was a guy then there's a map and I'm like oh let me try that ball here but this new at it as well go ahead and that was already came to my so now do I go to ...
