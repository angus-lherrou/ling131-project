{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WHPT", "content": "We're that to happen today that would be picked up by others there would be those kinds of patches there and we just need people to download the patches having the patches is fine um but that's when Microsoft and others have done their jobs\nBut cyber security is a shared responsibility we have to do our job and downloading those patches and updating our operating systems to it\nAl ... is Ross real quick let me interrupt and ask you because I've always told people do not clicker do not go to the automatic downloads 'cause you know Microsoft is constantly and you keep saying patches I see all these security patches downloaded but every time\nI get automatic downloads it defaults all my programs and I have a home studio with ... to the card that's inside\nThe computer and I've got an M audio box that I use that as its own sound card\nIt's a pain that I have to go in and reset ray thing so I go in weekly every Saturday morning when I'm having coffee it's part of my routine to go into the downloads pick the ones that I think I Need and then installed him am I doing wrong is that how I got caught by not having the automatic downloads on\nI certainly can't say what caught show are dead and talk to catch you I think part of it is that you clearly are highly sophisticated user you have more your\nA studio and your sound worse than a lot of people do and I think you did everything that you could have done I'm speaking at this\nPoint to a lot of people who are doing one tenth of what you're doing and for them the automated updates may work if they don't have all that and your case where you are doing stuff there where this is a your interest or livelihood where you have much more sophisticated equipment\nI think yes you have to figure out what works best for you I'm Sorry it takes you a little bit longer and I'm fascinated by your store I look forward to share and if you don't mind a because it it is the perfect example of how are we all have to figure out what works best for us and for our families\nAnd yours is a much more complicated story than um than the average person has to do\nAll kinds of people dead a quarter of what you did I Would be thrilled\nYeah absolutely but something else that also concerns me because I Do live in an area next to some really big apartment complexes and I want to talk about why five for a minute because I'm Still not sure you're secure about why by using it I have mine actually disabled\nAnd I'm paying for why pie is part of my cable bundles for high speed Internet I've got that one disabled too I don't eat at my home there's no product and I know was smart TVs people need a wife I now I've got everything hardwired in so I don't have to worry about the wife by but Russ it scares me that I can still open up my ... wife I search on my computer on my phone\nAnd I see a whole bunch of accounts that aren't secured and are wide open you ask people about that why is the wife by not secure oh there's really no way they can get into my home or my computer or a wife I can you explain to them the ramifications of not securing a wife by\n[noise] yes everything that they've ever done is going to be up for grabs and probably for sale it's that simple uh when you look at it free public life ...\nAnd airports in coffee shops all the rest of it it's a it's a it's an invitation to sort of to have people come in and stand your computer to look at key stroking to look at what's on there to\nSteal passwords and to try to break in a some of the people who do that in their homes\nAre playing a numbers game they're saying gee there's so many other easier targets at the local coffee shop in the airport at the train station in the in the library that they're not going to come to my house or into my apartment to do it and it\nMay be their right but you know is that kind of a number of Jim you want to play when there are other ways to do it whether it's hard wiring or even if it's just downloading a VPN of virtual private network that's something that will go a long way for the average person\nThe other part honestly is to be very careful about what you're doing over ... by you know your transactions on the net on medical conditions on your children\nReally needs to be more secure perhaps encrypted at rest as well as in transmission use a VPN is a much more robust pass phrase than the average sorts of things that people do if they're trying to find out what time the latest marvel superhero movie is playing at the local cinema\nRoss we've talked in the past and I'm sure we will have another show with you coming up before Christmas about staying safe on line while you're traveling and while you're shopping at the mall but people now are shopping more and more and home of course Amazon now one of the top billion dollar companies and\nI ordered from Amazon I Know my neighbors do I know that people across the street do because I see the box is sitting on their porches before the barge pirates can get it\nAnd uh you know just all this online shopping at home or that's the new trend but there's another way for them to come in and you're talking about opening up a financial account to shop online to easily get your identity stolen and your account drained just by shopping online\n[noise] that's right there's the crux are very sophisticated uh it's what they do for a living if they're constantly looking for the next opportunity and you don't want to be the the the next opportunity for them\nAnd say you you may have heard me say before it's it's like the old joke about that the two camper surprised by a bear in one stopping to ties sneakers on hasn't says you cannot run the bear and the guy says no I just have to run you\n[laughter] I Love that [laughter]\nAnd that joke is you know at the exactly it's like the Internet you know the crux are going to get the people who aren't wearing sneakers um you can't necessarily out run them if they want to get you there are going to get you but chances are you know you want to make it hard for them to do it\nYou want to make them you know go to easier um to easier places\nAnd then when you're doing shopping online and I love shopping online yeah\nUm you have to look for how to the delivery comes and make sure you're getting a hold of Amazon and not a spoof site and ... people do do things that help them like that some of them say use for example a shopping email address so anything that regard\nRegard shopping comes from this email address so you get spam and things like that is only one email and you can just sort of ignore it\nYeah I was that way they they can't jump into other areas of life\nYeah I've got three different emails set up in one is for shopping and for filling out surveys because I got nipped by one and I'm not going to mention it it's a big company you know the name\nWhere you go in and you buy something and they say if you fill out the survey or you know on line and they give you a code at the bottom of your seat you're entered a win a thousand dollar gift card well I'm going to a thousand dollar gift card please give me one so I go home take the survey\nAnd I'll tell you what Ross as soon as I finish that survey\nI don't know how quick it takes them to sell my email address I was in and day to with emails from all other merchants and then you go back and you look at this survey you took at the very bottom there's some very small print about your information can and will be shared\nHad I Know and that and thank God I Do have one email account I use for that if I use my business email it would have filled up my inbox so quick I couldn't talk to clients\nDeath [laughter] well it's like the if people said for that warranty cards at the same thing or during the shopping mall they've got a great new car they're shiny car fill out the survey fill out this card and you have a chance to win the car\nWell part of it is it's all about the data it's not about the car a part of it says you know once you give your data out there it's it's always out there and now they're saying is you know if you're not paying for the the product you are the product\nYeah and and that's that's the way it is now with social media don't you think after we heard about all the security and all the personal information that was taken or sold from Facebook\nOf people do need to take a you know you need to have a\nOwnership of your online persona you really do need to uh be careful about what it is you share because once a chair that's gone and you have no idea and the Cambridge Analytica part they uh\nWere ... they said they were supposed to destroy something they didn't Facebook didn't follow up about a about the destruction which they've said was a mistake but you don't know what else is out there and who's doing other things\nAnd I bet that survey that uh you filled out they wanted to know about your ethnicity or age or a ZIP Code your income so you are able to re slotted beautifully into targeted advertising\nAbsolutely and that's one thing that also bothers me about social media and I tried to tell my friends please stop doing this\nIs you see these uh quizzes that they want you to take on social media for instance what was your first concert what's your favorite rock band what was your first pet as a child or things like that and then I see people filling it out and it's like you might as well go ahead and tell them\nYour mother's maiden name the street you grew up on your high school mascot in the last four digits of your social\nBecause this is how people can get their identity stolen all of a sudden they got the key to get into your credit card account when they ask the security question you're giving them all that information right on social media and it's very dangerous\n... absolutely the other part on these kind of apps or you know depending on on your age and and thing it's like a witch of the Hogwarts schools which have been sorted into or what is your royal ...\nAnd it starts at home if it continues into the workplace and you got to be mindful of that even when you're out in public about our national critical infrastructure cyber wise when you're using an open why pie and a lot of these stores I think are at fault when they say shop here we have open wide fine if you go to this website while you're in the store\nA you'll download a coupon for your phone for an additional ten percent off you're encouraging people to use a wife I that could be hacked into the guy over in the shoe department not an employee but somebody shopping who's a creep\nOver across the store it could be hacking into your phone as you're standing there downloading that special coupon for that ten percent off and we all what ten percent off come on\nAbsolutely we all want ten percent off a part of it is going to be using a you know they have in the stores and be responsible for why five part of it is using a virtual private network and part of it as being very very careful as to uh what coupons you want and they how you share information\nIt's a owning your online digital presence\nStay safe on line dot org is your website rush writer always fun to talk to you executive director national cyber security alliance a rust before we let you go I got exactly one minute left is there something that we didn't discuss today in our talk about cyber security you think it's important to our audience here\nYes I there is I think the one thing that we didn't talk about is that jobs in cyber security is not just for college graduates with degree in engineering who've been coding since birth there are so many jobs out there and cyber security um that require other skills that are\nPerfect for under served communities perfect for veterans\nPerfect or people who are looking for a change to want to move things these jobs are portable they're well paid you're doing good while you're doing well and I think that people should really think about new jobs in cyber security you can\nLook and different websites are and how to volunteer in your community a lot of community colleges have little training\nCourses in cyber security but we're trying to encourage\nYoungsters to get into it to keep\nA our cyber security infrastructure safe but we're also looking at it for people who are looking to make a change to make a move to upgrade their jobs to look at jobs in cyber security as well\nAnd as part of homeland security has worked on a new program it's called nice and I C e and if you type nice and anti H. S. you'll get into how they are working to bring in more people into the cyber security workforce than I Do encourage more people to think about getting involved to\nEarn college engineering graduates code hers because there's a lot out there\nAnd we do need a lot of dedicated people working to keep us safe and thanks again for putting people on to stay safe on lined up or and I look forward to talking with you before Christmas this is great\nI look forward to and it will be in touch and well up makes your audience knows that you're going to be on because every year you do share some great information about shopping using your phone these digital coupons and and one thing I'll just tease everybody would we talked about it last time why it's safer to use the wife by on an airplane than at an airport will\nGet that answer from Russ national cyber security alliance getting coming up in time for Christmas shopping hey Russ thanks so much rather always good to talk to you\nKnow I had to take care Bye bye\nThanks for us once again October is national cyber security awareness month a couple of easy steps to make sure your home computer network is secure and your computer at work is

of spectrum I'm your host Tiffany green with me this morning David Bailey who was a real estate broker here and the Tampa Bay area with real property experts thank you so much for joining us and not to shed some light on the real estate scene here in Hillsborough County yes\nThank you for having me I definitely appreciate you are inviting me and a pleasure to be here\nAll right so let's look at ... if you look around the country I think real estate is hot and especially here in the Tampa Bay area we've seen several different neighborhoods are communities with in the area\nKinda sprout up and and really kind of take forming and and change shape\nOh hi this is a very popular one and a lot of people are probably\nFamiliar with what have you seen from your professional experience about what's happening here [noise] uh we seen a lot actually uh with that we've seen some medium\nCells or grow a we've seen the number of cells grow 'em\nAnd ah which is all excited and those are good things um ... inventory is low a\nWhich puts us in a seller's market [noise] um so if you're looking to sell definitely you you want to get it on the market now 'cause right now it's time to do it so um we're happy about the growth we love what we're seeing a we have people coming into the area as well population is growing jobs are growing\n'em all those things indicate a pass a prosperous uh economy for the Hillsborough County or the Tampa Bay area so that's something that we want to see and we're glad to see it\nIf we're painting a more of a broad brush ah what are some of the trends are locally statewide or nationally within the\nReal estate industry um right now we're starting to see as a as the third a quarter\nEnded um we're looking at a closed sales or an increase year over year a route around four point two percent um\nMedian sale price or we saw an increase their um\nTo about two hundred and forty five thousand [noise] and then uh the average sale price here in the area uh in Hillsborough County all the stats are for Hillsborough County ah we're looking at a two hundred Ninety three thousand or roughly I'm\nAlso we're seeing\nA a a median price is kind of like a a\nClose to asking price ratio a which sits at around Ninety seven percent that's important because it tells us you know what people are what sellers are gaining a in terms of\nThere if they're asking you know uh whatever price that they're asking um they're getting close to that that kind of speaks to her in a cage [laughter] hey demands out there were sellers are asking for a number and they're getting close to what they're asking for so it's sort of indicates how well or how um [noise] the demand\nFor housing in the area so in that around about Ninety Ninety seven percent\nWhere have you seen some of the hot bed areas with in Hillsborough County what's selling that uh [laughter] uh so obviously\nPopular areas are obviously some little hide that is a growing up and unpopular area um\nRivers you were seeing a lot of growth down there ah especially I'm In new construction you know that's where everything's headed a new Tampa\nUh I Can't go out and speak to enough\nThe importance of a tenant representative and and and that's something that real property expert says is focusing on we're a commercial from that\nIs a tenant representation from\nAh our job is to help small businesses are located um\nThe rights space for that business and help them walk through those leasing terms to make sure they understand everything in the lease but also to make sure they get the best deal for them okay and with that a lot of people don't understand a lot of businesses don't understand that and working with a tenant rap\nYou know there's really no cost to you it's it's no different than if you are buying a home and you have residential agent identify properties that meet your criteria\nAnd send them to [noise] ah we worked in reps work in the same capacity or we identify available properties that me you're a business names and we kind of walking through that entire process and then at the end were compensated any or we sharing the commission that's being paid the listing agent\nSo it's similar to that and residential where a listing broker or the the buyers broke her shoulders and the commission that's been pages list of aerobics [noise]\nSo we're going to shift gears a little bit and you know talk about things that are probably really popular in hot on the table if you will um the raise a potential to move over to ... city that stadium there's been so much talking a lot of development kind of going around the\nPort camp or ... city area\nUm what type of impact do you expect it to have at the stadium does in fact get built and uh the raised move over to Tampa so\nFrom an economic impact a stance I think the impact will be huge um [noise] I think from a real estate perspective you'll start to see a lot of increase in a sales prices are you going to you will see a a a um\nA rise in rental rates are you'll see a decrease in vacancy rates in terms of office of dust real ah any multifamily that's around there or you know that will make that area that the place to be [noise]\nUm and with\nIt being so close to say channel side and we all know what's going and going on and channel side the growth that channel sided thing right now\nUh you know you have the law school you have the you know the number of condo units coming on line here is the next year or two of the public's that's coming down there it's really opening up that area to be\nA the ... area if you will for Tampa you mentioned this is the what's hot a yet earn you mentioned what's hot and we were doing a segment previously a ... this area if the race come\nIt will be the area to be a without a doubt\nAnd it's so funny because if you think about what channels side was when it first opened it was\nPlace to be and and then it kind of just subsided a little bit but they're looking to revitalize it and I like in the potential of the race stadium a in ... city to what the soccer stadium in Orlando was like a because they came into an area just off of downtown\nWhere there were you know more rental opportunities there or an older more established community there but it it had the potential to to grow and be revamped\nAnd revitalize and so they did it there there's a potential for it happening here any potential drawbacks to it coming or\nYou know the drawback wouldn't be it would probably be the people who are currently there and now\n... and in terms of a traffic congestion a few live there now hey you may be used as some of the traffic a bus with a stadium and bringing in that many people at any given time [noise] All right well if you work down there and you might want to call in that day [laughter]\nSo so traffic concerns um obviously or any displacement\nHappens I'm a new to have\nUm a\nThem coming in and now\nYou have a huge developer buying a property\n[noise] um you know where to those people go\nThey're getting they make it displaced at a time where again we go back to interest rates are the people who are there may not have\nThe purchasing power to kind of go to some of the other areas so what happens to to them if if they have to go or if they choose to go or whatever so it may put them in ... and a hard place I think um\nBut yeah those are the some of the drawbacks that I think\nWhat's kind of a conversation that you would have and we're going to use again the racing him as a good example but I think this is just a a microcosm of any real estate investing where you have someone to say OK I'm interested in investing because I think\nThere's a good opportunity here and I want to get in on it at the ground level um how do you advise your clients and obviously each\nClient is different because you mentioned each investment strategy is different but what are some basic tenets that you say okay if the race come here\nSolid gold or or sell it was seen but if they don't how do you make sure they kind of leverage they're betting protect themselves given the fact that OK well something fell through [noise] okay so\nI ... and you're right their investment different our investment strategy is different I'm also with that said uh depending on what you're investing and\nUh also plays a part um in general I'm\nLooking at what can be a a a huge draw in terms of investment and I want to put my money here because the return that I Would get a meets my objective I'm definitely a re value at projects okay I'm\nTrying to identify those uh those ugly homes a\nAnd a or ugly commercial properties\nI'm figuring out with that highest and best use will be for those a particular properties\nI'm invested their money and holding on okay ah I I Know plenty of people that do a great job with flipping homes or ... or flipping projects are great make your money I I Will never say that that's not a way to go\nUh for me personally though and kind of what I Do I focus on those by and hold strategies a and then I Am I'd look at how that asset performs\nAnd I do it in two ways uh you know our or capital accumulation of [noise]\nUm depending on their best her with that strategy is\n[noise] um so a value added projects and and and holding on to him as where I Would say focus um with those value added projects looking at projects that may be a are multi tenant\nOkay that way uh\nYou're spreading or risk over you know as sort of just a single Tennessee just multiply tenants them and and and especially if you're a new investor\nThat maybe something that should look into a looking at projects that already have a base in terms of hey we have a strong tenant based here or the tenants been here for a number of years are looking at those projects because at that point you already have a foundation um\nMaybe your future goal is to look at what will what Ken this project be with the new stadium coming in okay maybe there's value in the land so also understanding the investment\nUm you know know what you have if you're buying that dilapidated home okay no the reason why you're by um and and just make sure it's a sound strategy a those are the couple of things to say look like opportunities\nWhen you get an opportunity to meet with your real estate counterparts in kind of talk about you know what's next what's on the horizon for real estate here in the Tampa Bay area what are some of the conversations like what are what are people's seeing or for casting of what's to come\n[noise] uh [noise] you know I think we we we talk about um\nThe new office buildings that are coming online we talk about the changes in downtown [noise] um I don't\nIf people realize it or not but the skyline of Tampa is about to change drastically over the next five to ten years or in terms of the amount of high rises you're going to see 'em and and and how does that and and what does that mean for you [noise] um we're starting to see a lot of\nUm growth in terms of residence in downtown Tampa and if you've been here\nLike I've been here we got here my dad was in the military a Mac do and we got here in eighty to eighty four and\nI remember as a kid driving through downtown and as a ghost town\nA UC total leads a rolling down the street next to you you know that was downtown Tampa back in the eighties nineties uh and now it's it's it's such a vibrant area you have people that live down there a with Curtis Hicks and they're they're holding events down there you have restaurants down there [noise]\n... I'm sure I I you know it was really hot they haven't seen those are lately is that Dr CDLs and that comes from yeah tickle kitty mhm I've every once in a while she pops up and my my ...\nWho is that yeah she's uh Jillian and grace yeah that's the one the David Spade and\nThat's the or his mother I've had as I Do not my type ... for you David Spade a very pretty soon on my diet she could play Miss America yeah does she does very or Mrs America\nI Know we've talked about it became it's made is so funny I nor McDonald showing that yes I was reading on everything but yeah he's really on\nTheir God or some wrestling stuff do you know what big show what unique stat he holds overall other wrestlers big shopping show has\nYou mean like beside the physical feature yeah there is is that one of the things that he is done in his wrestling that uh you know the only one\nAppearances on um wrestle mania smack down now but you're you're a long year long to say right lines there with that most times being not that most I mean big show is completed\nI'm the first ever episode of WWE or show a nightmare diamond mines backed out yeah\nHe is also the wrestler from that show to wrestle on the nine hundred and Ninety nine episodes back down where he lost around New York oh man tell he was on the first a smackdown in on their most recent yeah\nHow about that ... ... who else is on the roster that\nThey've none of them are there any more because of the time I don't know they split them up it was Jericho and a\nAnd B Guerrero and it was all those guys who came over from from WCW ... satellite very sad [laughter]\n\nDrink on satellite satellite Saturn and he was Saturday color satellite those buy\nOr sell here is a a new survey of two thousand Americans looked at the most common holiday foods\nWe cannot resist what is something to over the holidays whether it be mashed potatoes mashed potatoes or mashed potatoes right in there man yeah yeah that that's like the big first number one Mac and cheese mashed potatoes and they're a no back in ... oh\nYeah sorry man he's cranberry sauce nothing ah stuffing yes\nRules yes turkey yes\nYou guys are on a roll [laughter] ...

can say hey I appreciate\nYour donors an artist I get what she does she's a performance artist\nMoney by the time and then what do you walk around with them and your headphones train ride home ... relaxing time you're on the treadmill and I uh I got to die or she's great I Love wearing a money thing I've ever heard your area I mean\nYeah and I and I think that's a big part of it by the way if you just joined us I'm your host brainer Bryant's we're talking with Vincent Jackson here on the consumer quarterback show and I think that's a lot of the issues that people see is because they're texting or there are behind a keyboard there are a little bit more uh you know a little tougher or you know there were warriors right\nUh but that I think that's one of the challenges that we had to navigate as we move a into this technology you know driven world that we're in [noise] yeah ... it is\nYou know and and I'm sure you know you think about these kids playing video games and now they would have tests on it and be whatever character they want to be so that's really transitioning into this you know the the technology and social media and communication as well because like you said you create a profile\nAnd you put images off where you can put you know most of it may not even be accurate to what's reality yeah no one else would know that except you and maybe those close the so um you know again that's part of the education for for people when they go out there and they're looking for information um understand that not everything out there is going to benefit you will be accurate\nYeah yeah I'm with you there now you'd mentioned early you know earlier in the interview your your coaches who were who were some of your favorite coaches and what we're maybe some of the lessons they taught yeah\nI'm One of the first guy that sticks out as I'm a college called her head was named Ernest columns and uh he was actually the guy they recruited me to go to University of northern Colorado\nAnd I'm an artist was a a special teams coaches even back coach and you know the best thing that artist always gave me was just you know belief in yourself and he really gave this like you know no matter what situation or a badly happens that ever just bounce back and just know that too and all that out on that always out and just\nBelieve in your training trust your training trust your hard work\nAnd go back out there and make a play yeah and the artist was able to get me to remove my from my red shirt um so I have to play the true freshman there because basically of of his convincing and influence I coach um\nAnd to get me out there I was able to be an all American as a as a true freshmen and special teams just returning kick them on and while you know I didn't even play a lot of receiver at that time I didn't even started receiver at a division to school until I was a junior\nRight out of me and so I really work my way up the ladder and and and this was a big part of my development because he kept me focused to not hear that noise about well you know you should be playing more or maybe they should be transferred 'cause you're losing your\nYour career college opportunity here I might not being on the field yeah you know so I just kind of to do that out you know what I mean when you work everyday took care of my education was always first and foremost and when my time came as a junior senior um and I was able to play more um take care of business\nYeah it's interesting man and he sure did take care of business a great career\nLike I'm In the end you know sometimes when you think 'cause I left us F I played the three ball up in Virginia\nAnd people say oh you you know the kind of minimize that deep three are deep to level ball but you know I was playing quarterback in and allow their teams they would have the back and they would do exactly what you mentioned they would recruit the backup from Florida State or Texas or Oklahoma\nSo you're literally you're going against a bunch of you know number two is from a D. one school but at that the three levels they were fast they were bigger faster stronger lotta level there's some good talent there\nThere is an NFL does a great job I Would say they probably do a better job than NC double A. as far as getting fillers out there and really exploring every avenue ... um you know\nI didn't get highly recruited from colleges you know what I mean I think there was a a handful of of local schools in division ... division three schools I'm In a guy that just came and they do their normal tours in different cities right kind of the you know shake the trees and see what balls out maybe they'll find a gym their job but\nThe bigger schools the big programs Miami's Oregon's how they're going to go straight to you know on line who the four star athletes you know who's going to be at these Nike camps things that I just didn't have exposure to yeah so it's a different type of recruiting process you get to the NFL\nThey don't care what level you're on you know what I used to be there isn't too division three whatever it is they're going to find you and if you've got a skill set they'll give you a chance\nYeah yeah absolutely I Would talk some real estate when we come back with her and more from our expert contributor here in Studio and we have a feel good story the week

Jackson here in Studio ... Jackson in action and very very philanthropic a benefit and doing a lot of good things in the community at the Getty had been coming up\nYeah you know the uh the Jackson actually three foundation man has been been just a labor of love it's really been awesome here you know I've got here two thousand twelve and a free agent and um\nYou know I knew right away that this was a very very philanthropic town\nA strong military community with Bill Airforce base in our backyard um you know they they welcomed me with open arms been able to engage with that base and so I Want the last ... which is um you know a lot of people say oh athletes have foundations so you know Rahm Khrushchev brand but you know for me it's it's near and dear to my heart I started it because I grew up in military brat\nMy ... my dad sort of Twenty one years in the army and a bounced around understanding what military families go through so\nUm is truly a passion that I have to support and reach out and in these active duty men and women in their families their children and um it's been absolutely great each and every year program continue to develop\nAny ball a lot of generous businesses to support us I'm inclined and in through a financial donation so um it's been great you know really really focused a lot on the kids in that family structure um upcoming events one thing I think right on top of my head um [noise] we have our bodies and Bruce a golf tournament on November night\nI'm not going to be a shovel a golf now at a club um we're taking registrations right now on line to go to W. W. W. dot Jackson in action eighty three dot org\nAnd um you register register for some um their sponsorship opportunities um you've got a business wants to come out and and then maybe um donate some items reduce promotions more open about that we're a community driven foundation um and we just want to support these families you know what I mean every dollar every dollar we rate goes a right to the programs and it's um it's been awesome to do\nThat's awesome and thanks for doing that it's great that my dad was an MP in the military I didn't have a chance to serve I I I was recruited by the Naval Academy up to the trip and everything is an option quarterback but\nToo long a trip [laughter] cold out there you know Annapolis, Maryland and you know but so you know my hat's off to those that do serve and those that you know paid the ultimate sacrifice and thank you for doing what you did man with ... said the foundation that's awesome [laughter]\nAnd uh you know kind of speaking of that you know with kids moving around a lot you know man that's a challenge for kids you know in the military and not in the military\nIt is you know again I'm you know you think about athletes and and I think about what what comes to mind that are coaches you know what I mean uh coaches are very transient job you know what I mean two years here and there and you're bounced around I got guys might have been coaching for a while and you know they've been in a different cities and matter of ten years twelve years so\nI'm putting my military life it can be a challenge but\nOnce I got older and I am matured and look back at that I really saw it as a blessing and a male made me more well rounded I'm exposed me to a lot of cultures you know an early age living overseas for a little bit so a lot of things that you may not get by living the same neighborhood and yeah house or I think there's anything wrong with that but yeah um it's a gift I think looking back at that I was able to uh to experience that\nWhen you when you see different paradigm you know you do different things I remember I went through kind of when I joke about as the Garth Brooks stages in our town so I did high school rodeo I mean I wrote bowls that team roped in you know so\nCertain things that you're exposed to learn something you'd pick different things up a from just being around it\nGreat very self um again and I absolutely love you know a\nSupport these military families you know these guys again like you said make the ultimate sacrifice\nAnd I think what kind of you know makes our foundation unique if you know there's a lot of foundations out there to support those active duty men and women wanted warrior project the beauty of the things all issues that we support as well yeah um but I felt that there was a niche that was kind of\nMaybe being overlooked hum when you talked about the spouses yeah and the children how are they being affected by deployments how are they being affected by happening to transition around and change jobs and yeah you know quit their job and move again because it was it the climate so\nUm I went to make sure that they weren't forgotten and we kind of bridge that family structure and make sure that you know these these guys because they were supported in any knowledge as well\nYeah absolutely a brain it rhymes here I'm your host for talking with a bench in Jackson here Jackson an action eighty three dot org sign up for their event coming up on November ... ball golf or the golf club there\nAnd ... but you have to get involved with the community

why he had so much success at the coach and obviously now as a as a professional in as a man and a father and husband is a wonderful man\nBrandon today has won three six seven oh Seventy three Seventy

check it out at platinum MVP real T. dot com\n[laughter]\nRight so we got counter killer in the house and a insect IQ what's happened to me\nOh I'm trying not to get stung these days yeah I mean I really had been dealing with a lot of African ice honeybees and it really becomes a dangerous situation rapidly you know even yeah proper equipment knowledge skill\nOr I was doing a job or a power company here locally\nI was in a back yard and south Tampa there would be the top of the polls they were trying to switch ... switch out so it was kind of a yeah a a unique situation to begin with and you know not not your typical power line out on the street with the big trucks right um got up there to the pole and they're African\nEyes honeybees and just got attacked and I had my suit on and\nThey found a spot in the south part of my my elbow a man I got probably some ten Fifteen maybe twenty times I stopped counting after the first few and I literally had to put my glove over that area to prevent them from singing me anymore\nAnd then while part I wasn't in control of the equipment and the guy on the ground to slowly back me off of it\nUm the point of telling you guys losses yeah what do you do if you come across as in your backyard yeah it's not something you can go get a can of watts freeze in the garage and spray\nOr one you know it's it's not really going to work to you're going to get her mhm even one single kill you if you're allergic to honeybees yeah much less twenty thirty forty times actually they say fifty things is equal to a rattlesnake bite yeah so keep that in mind when you were to allow guys I'm\nSo anyways uh you you you know what you're doing it's it's probably not as a big deal I was able to go right back in and resolve the issue ah basically we remove the colony from the poll we screen over the poles that they're using the nest in ... um treat the outside of the poll with a residual pesticide which takes care of their returning field these\nUm these they can be out working for food for up to forty eight hours\nUm another thing I'd like to point out these are honeybees African ice honeybees are the same I mean the as the European honeybee the what you hear about on the news right are\nAre in trouble in different parts of the world the problem is they're much more aggressive they attack you enforce a man will continue to attack you as you try to get away from them and and and as a matter of fact\nA cloud of our lives on your knees can follow you quarter half mile down the road while hopefully or with somebody else and you can run faster\nThan than yeah yeah that's the thing that's a good one right if you're a suit when you approach these these honeybees you have just a small crevice in the students' ... no not that old suit on as my normal be sued I wear every day\nI'm of course you know it's it's a hundred percent humidity in Ninety three degrees so of course it was a little hot outside right our sweating and the suit as a caught and it's just caught on jobs are okay I'll get sweat and uh but not fees target a certain area and they're a new with enough force actually\nYou're getting a singer is I look down and I had just had a lot more ... and the suit wow just a few of them found their mark in my skin below yeah so they they try to tag on the same area too yeah so what happens is once a honey bee stings you\nKnow that ... and ...\nBasically rip out of the abdomen of the stinger or the honeybee to be and then continue their muscle reflects to inject a vet them into the victim in this case it was me wow but also a a Mets an alarm pheromone into the air which is basically that proverbial target Mm they say it gets and on your back\nOr in this case my elbow wow and then the other a worker bees in this case that are alarmed by that are models zone and\nAnd the thing you in that same while man so it was a good example and unfortunately I didn't get video of it next time I'll Try to get my\nInside and that is a cause for everybody but\nYou weren't thinking about that either where it's pretty intense it's it's like you get a cloud I mean literally it's like a B. tornado around you when you get into these things that I Would say these Wilder feral honeybees I'm dealing with nine out of ten of them are at least a hybrid so when you get mad they get mad like African ice bees and attack you\nYeah like African ... wow so I'm going back to my statement earlier what do you do if you get honeybees in your yard\nUm yellow jackets that's another stinging insects we deal with on a regular basis even pay for a while under the ease of your\nHouse during the doorway sometimes you get 'em in the windows those are the little boss that build the card ness um all of those are ... and all will attack and ... you write 'em as a homeowner you know vigilance and maintenance are key preventative maintenance keeping the shrubs turned back from the house or the south is clean and maintained\nUm to your yard free of debris will lemonade a lot of the conducive conditions that what attracts insects chair yard\nBut through you know Mother Nature and randomness you still get the activity in your yard so you try to take care of yourself you know really be aware of of the risk and and if you don't have the proper equipment and the knowledge\nSome things are actually best are professionals and I really think one of these this is in essence of a you know calling a professional letting us come out and take care of it we do that in a safe and humane way\nA public safety in mind of course insect IQ and all sort of be removal were license and ensured we carry two million dollar liability insurance\nUm a lot of companies are not you know even on the state of Florida allows a beekeepers that don't necessarily have insurance to come out into commercial be removed will charge you for\nA removal of honeybees like as soon as they fall affair ladder um let's say there in your wall and they have to cut your wall open and cut into a water pipe or an electricity you can imagine Mm their uninsured or problems on cars are\nSo yeah I could see that by the way we're talking with counter color insect IQ dot com here on the consumer quarterback show and um he's handling you know all types of pest management pest control everything from your a stinging insects are we just described sharp to a termites um\nWe've we've talked on the show about um rodents and and different types of animals even alligators approaching from than\nA a bat you know because they had their their guano was very it transmit diseases correct\nYes and more the guano itself isn't a problem it's a mold spores or the or\nA mold that grow I'm Sorry uh what am I trying to say I'm\nI'm all for that is emitted or grows and a while ago yeah and that can cause his job last most of mammals you a grade that while there that's the real problem in the back to get into your house into a wall and that can build up in those boys and the combined with moisture\nThat those mold spores or release and you're breathing that even if you're not directly exposed or you could so brave those\nMold spores and often if you had an environmental company come in and test your living space if you have bats in and around your home those mold spores are present in the air raid wow so this is another instance where as a consumer you know if you if you're vigilant you look at your house and you look for openings\nCracks crevices um construction falls mainly these are the types of things that colonies of bats would exploit move into your house I want to change the subject I'm not I'm not sure how much time we have but I wanted to talk about goes to answer this Halloween and there were getting into that time of year ago\nBut I'm getting a lot of calls for goes dance goes to answer as a exotic species are not native to Florida but they've been a big problem over the last decade\nUm there are often called true grants or his hands uh they're they're adamant is translucent are clear so they look much smaller than they are and often you'll just see a little specks crawling around on her countertops in the sink maybe in the cabinet or getting into the sugar\nThey're sweet eating at they love sucrose or anything that sugar based sugar itself ... I'm candy a mini sweeteners often you'll see her on your coffee pots or orange sugar in your coffee and you're still little grain\nAnd wants one aunt gets in and finds that a food source and they recruit the hundreds of thousands of workers and you have all of your house and most people make the mistake around a can of raid and spray the ants calling crawling around on the countertop\nI've done a lot for a long way away I got coupons you admit to go on the subway Jared was here yesterday or the you know what but what we do and we got our foot long look at the the I was running mate you take two yeah [laughter]\nOh man looking as one nation it brings in some way I've always taken gave me I mean there is a dog I might get you are you only gave me ten or Fifteen dollars\nBy ...

studies you sent your absolutely incredible as you know I'm very into neutral picks the anti aging community has taken a keen interest in Korea teen specifically the cognitive benefits of Korea Team\nOh absolutely this is one of those areas where Korea Team really shy and you see what we need to understand is that your brain even though it's only two percent of your body's weight it utilizes twenty\nPercent of your body is energy this is a very thirsty Oregon for energy and just like your muscles soak up decree it seemed like a sponge\nBecause this is a naturally occurring molecule in the body it passes right through the blood brain barrier\nYour brain or an soak it up like a sponge and it increases your Korea teen phosphate reserves in your brain from now in your brain you have more readily available resources\nTo do was to recharge those neuronal batteries to make more energy inside the brain so basically what do you notice well your memory is supported impact scientists have done some amazing research here they found that people that take Korea Team it supports their memory it actually helps the brain to utilize\nOxygen better it supports memory and people that are sleep deprived it's been shown to help people add numbers quicker and for longer periods of time without mental fatigue get this study pat just five days five days of eight grams of Korea teen supported mental tasks in subjects that we're getting\nRapid fire question scientists were asking him\nMath questions in science questions over and over and over and they found the folks aren't Korea theme didn't fatigues quickly mentally so this is amazing stuff it's like a turbo booster for your brain it's\nLike a super charger for your muscles that recharge is all your cellular battery so all of your cells tissues and organs have more readily available energy\nOr dark I loved that ever strong appeals to athletes and people want to get more reps in the gym maybe get some extra power and their workouts but you're also saying there's a big push a nutritional community to encourage people in their forties fifties sixties seventies and even eighties to leverage the power of Korea Team to stay fit strong and healthy if you say\nKorea teen is going mainstream you know I share the story with you before my mom who's in her late seventies now she's taking creating she works out a couple of days a week three days a week she goes to novelist does the free weights because she's got osteoporosis she wants to maintain her muscle mass and she wants to make her bones stronger and as you pointed out Korea teen helps to do that\nAnd then the other three days during the week she'll go and she'll swim now she's not trying to get bigger stronger or anything like that but even at her age Korea teen has benefits\nOh yeah and what blows me away about that story 'cause you told me before\nThat her medical doctor recommended routine for and that just goes to show how much more mainstream this is it's called every strong\nAnd it supports the muscles that supports your power your strengths your speed if you're an athlete you're certainly going to love it\nBut even if you're not an athlete you notice the difference let's go to another study one more review study this out of the journal current aging science December two thousand thirty and I thought this was very cool\nCause the researchers looked at the body of research out there on creating and seniors without exercise they want to see what happens when seniors take Korea teen and they don't\nExercise so I'm quoting here creating supplementation without associated resistance training seems to enhance muscular string power and insurance increase lean body mass\nFor those that don't know what that is they're talking about muscle

they're all found in our diet and all are considered super foods the green tea human there was berets role why did you want to combine this re there's always a method to your your madness if I can see it that way because you combine these things together because they have a synergistic effect they make it\nIn other words you quote a real game changer\nWell you know when I look at the is there actually isn't a reason path to put them all in separate products they do go very well together as you said they're all food derives so it's kind of like you\nCan make a salad if you choose out of many vegetables you don't just have to have a bowl of lettuce or a bowl of cucumbers and well that's a little bit simplistic the fact is that\nAll of these are very very rich in groups of protective compounds that are both antioxidant so they actually retired the aging process of the cells in our bodies\nAnd protect our organ systems till they maintain a healthy inflammatory status in the body and this is really a big breakthrough\nI also like the idea that people can get a concentrated supplement of green tea extract curriculum and extract and resveratrol\nIn one product with truly meaningful amounts of each one and not have to go out and basically by a shopping cart full of stuff\nInto the headlines and the research especially on the green tea because it's absolutely amazing\nI Know in Asia and they've been using it for thousands of years for healthy aging but what do you see recently in the press you know you told me the nutrition research journal and it's July twenty twelve issue revealed the green tea significantly increased\nPlasma anti oxygen activity in whole blood unify on you recap\nSome of these headlines and tell me why you're such a green tea advocates\nOkay what you just said about increasing plasma antioxidant activity is really critical there are many antioxidants that people consume\nBut don't actually wind up in the body or they don't wind up in the body in any significant amount the green tea antioxidants which we know are among\nThe most highly beneficial antioxidants\nIn the entire world are very well absorbed they improve plasma antioxidant activity that is the blood concentration of antioxidants so what happens is you get this great concentration of antioxidants substances which a protective compounds floating around in the body and protecting the cells\nOf your body your organs every part of your body from premature destruction due to exposure to environmental pollutants some things in the diet with regard to the whole blood glue to fire on when we take in\nThe right antioxidants and not all antioxidant compounds are the right antioxidants\nOur bodies produce more of its own super protective compound called\nGlue to ... so you're taking the green tea extract\nYou build the antioxidant activity in your blood and you also cause your body to produce this enormously beneficial very well studied very powerful protective substance called glue to ... so it is remarkable this isn't something that most high antioxidant foods or supplement ingredients do\nBut it does happen with a concentrated properly made green tea extract\nRight let's switch gears and talk about this for human which is number two on your list and by the way these three ingredients are all found in the new green tea combo formula really offering free bought on a few minutes but talk to me about the human what'd you smelled C. U. R. G. U. M. I. N. now most people haven't heard of it\nBut scientists and researchers know it's one of the most powerful super feeds on the planet you can positively influence our DNA maintain joint comfort\nHealthy inflammation in more can you share some of the incredible headlines on human and tell us why you use this and we talked about this off year a few minutes ago this patented B. C. M. Ninety five formula of Kirk human with seven times greater absorption\nOkay well first of all I think while people might not know the term Kirk human\nThey may well no ... group which is a yellow spice and it shows up in curies and it's part of the five thousand year old Indian ... system of medicine I've been studying tumor Rick and its derivative ... human since the Nineteen seventies\nAnd I'll say this right off the bat that they were almost no plant materials in the world as extensively studied as there's a couple of thousand studies can be found in the scientific and medical literature we know that Kirk human is powerfully antioxidant we know that it\nHas a remarkable capacity to protect the liver and deliver is our primary detoxify Oregon it greatly enhances joined health so people are experiencing joint discomfort due to overuse\nThis really helps to relieve that and it's also what we called cardio protective it helps to protect the heart it helps to maintain normal healthy cholesterol\nAnd one last thing that is really kind of astounding is that ... actually causes your body to produce what are called neuro protective factors in the brain so it causes your body to produce these\nAgents in the brain that protect the actual to issue of the nerves in the brain itself there's almost nothing else that we know of that does this specifically the b._b._c. um Ninety five that you mentioned offers about seven times\nThe absorption of any other ... human extract so\nWhen you take two hundred fifty milligrams of this stuff you get about seven times the activity that you would if you took say a comparable amount of another curriculum and extract so this in my opinion\nIs one of the most life and Hansing protective totally beneficial substances on earth and it has just decades of scientific and medical studies to back it up\nChris I Know that we turned over to you by the green tea in the human in your new green tea she aren't liquid soft your formula which purity given away for free today but first tell me about the third nutrient on the list the risk their ritual which is\nSuper hot right now here was on some of the headlines in the science behind a spiritual I Know it's from red wine and the French love it but why is it on your shortlist\nWell Rivera trial is one of those remarkable compounds that\nI just sort of shake my head at how many different things that does it is found in grapes in wine grapes it also shows up and cranberries what we know about resveratrol is that like green tea and also like Kirk human extract\nIt's profoundly antioxidant but more than that it shows significant properties when you look at some of the things in the body if that happened during aging as a result of fat accumulation in tissue and insulin insensitivity\n... helps to protect against those things it's a powerful immune regulator and you know our immune system is responsible for keeping us healthy it is remarkably beneficial for the heart and this is why it's\nConsidered one of the key is to the so called French paradox you know the French drink a lot of red wine they eat a lot of cheese they smoke cigarettes and they stay slim and they have good cardiovascular health which just seems completely unfair but Reza Vera trial appears to be\nKey in that an additional a there is a brain benefit like there is with the current cumin\nWith blood flow to the brain so when you take resume or a trial you get rain blood flow this means you get more oxygen to the issues of the brain your brain cells stay healthier longer your mind is clear sharp and focused\nSo this is on my short list for all those reasons and for about a dozen more that would just plain take too long to explain\nAgain we're talking with Chris ... also known as the Indiana Jones of natural medicine sometimes called the medicine hunters well\nChristmas laser in on how this wonderful formula you created to judge Judy ... I Know the purity it's been a business now for\nWhat is it over Twenty years ago Tom reading the better Business Bureau and people can get complimentary bottled up this green T. C. R. today we'll get that number out in a few minutes but first what does this she are seeing foreign second you designed this formula in a liquid soft deal why do you like the liquid soft joke technology\nSo much okay first questions first it's called green tea CPR which is short for green tea Kirk human and or is there a troll\nThe big three ingredients that are in this product and meaningful protective amount the recent that it's in a liquid soft shell is that\nThat allows for rapid end very complete absorption I'm not suggesting that there's anything wrong with tablets or capsules that contain powders because there isn't but when you have a fluids soft shell you just happen to get\nMore quick break down of the capsule more rapid absorption and to some extent more complete absorption into the intestines that means that your body utilizes more of the ingredients and the supplements so green T.
