even know if I have family that would give me thirty to give me that I was I ...\nI'm not going to go out there but I mean if but if you do it there's a right way to do that you put it in writing you have an agreement you know if there was a breach you don't wait five years and what this fellow was doing was probably close friend or ice\nPay me a couple of box you know every other month or whatever it was these kinds of string and I'm an outright and he ended up you know running what twenty three grand\n[noise] no it's not a good friend you know a rod your own asked nominee I rod\nHey Don thanks for taking my call the morning every one of the uh I got a situation\nWhere my mother passed away and um [noise] she wanted my grandson to have her property or one of the sisters or wrote a promissory note had to sign a notarized\nA ticket to the state to state says there's not a witness that they can file a [noise]\nI mean they still get the property my son's name\nThe property we talking about is this real property or is this personal property says jewelry or is this land and land All right it was there and is there not a will there's they're not atrocity\nWell there was a will but the other sister when my mother was on the deathbed went to the house and took the cat was not filed [noise] you know it has a copy of the well [noise] yeah the one sister does but she won't give it a ... yeah\nThat's interesting because ah Andrew Gracie told me peoples and Gracie this this really surprise me a few years back he says if you're not entitled to look at the will if you're not in it [noise] okay and even if you're even if you're a family member 'cause I said well if if someone says well how do I know you're in a while and I says well the executive will\nPass abide by the content language of the will and drew was telling me that yeah if you're not labeled new wielding you're not entitled to do the contents of the well and I go that's crazy and I but then I kind of you know we were talking about it on the air with kind of making sense to me I Will do probate law but\nIt was it was just curious to me that the family ... family would no maybe and the other half what now the promissory note\nWould have to be executed in similar fashion as out of a well we'll have got to have two witnesses it's gotta be are you on that you have an amended will but you have to follow the protocol under the statute says doesn't sound like sister number two if I got your story correctly\nI've followed the uh requirements and the statutes when\nYou want to have an agenda is is is the word I'm Talking about too well which I think was her intent on the promissory notes a promissory note\nCan be different than a will if you want to make it in conjunction that what they want to do was to have an addendum to the will be properly executed added to the will document there there was a way which to do that so she should've consulted with appropriate lawyer ...\nYeah we had a probate a lawyer everything you know we had a lawyer and what's he was released into all three of us okay the ... so we were hanging operatives and all three of our names now\nNow now are getting new information so you had a probate lawyer but the the property was now divided into all the three siblings exactly and then the one ... the the one sister wanted to do a promissory note for her property to your son\nYes and she did she gave me the note and everything then the other one she you know she said you know what you're right\nMom did want him to have this and that will but mom's dead now so you're asking\nMe while yes well that is a lady this lady who went into her mother's a [noise] a deathbed as she lay on her bed crossed her arms and said winter we fully employed [noise]\nYeah well that's hard that's that's a horrible story well if this is a different scenario now because the if the the property was divested to your sister and she wants to give that to her nephew I don't see how the U.S too much\nMoney because she says that she was under duress when she did that\nAll right well it's time to time to look at the problem is that we know and it's time to sit down with the Andrew Gracie and figure out what why it's I'm trying to figure out what exactly is going on and how much is here or is there a way to defend it absolutely and you ... it's it's it's last time\nI answered all the ... he won three to five one five five five zero or add asked about um uh what about I Want to get more information and they kind of I was going to last Sunday went straight right I I suppose going this way and then went that way a David good morning or I Want to ask about\nYour morning my morning or good morning hey I had\nI had a automobile engine and it\nThey repossessed that\nUh I was wondering if they could come after me for any other property that my name or the balance out onto the\n... of how long before blew the engine like how long after you bought it\nOr like maybe seven eight months after about it\nOkay so jurors free and clear there and then you didn't uh pay after the ...\nCorrect okay so now what I mean they come after is well it does I assume is not a new car no man\nAnd you know it's not new alone or how much how much did you all the little\nThirteen thousand\nThirteenth out now did you blow the engine\n\nBlew while I was driving and I didn't purposely blowout\nI may come out this is the days of thunder moment here I mean are you going to talk of the Swiss not they go up and maintain the yeah I mean do you call it trickling over there what are you doing\nYeah yeah\nIt was faulty it was a faulty um switches that but let me know that there was overeating at the sun blew up and they want or two but ... isn't the cars were\nBut that's not the fault of the other folks that you you have the contract with you haven't you have a note you have a contract to pay for the car\nRight you have the car for the better part of the year you're you're right in the car there's something that went wrong in the car which happens with cars in the engine blows your ... that is that's not the fault of the folks that soldier the car\nCorrect\nAll right so then why would you breach of contract with them that's ... that's problematic so your answer to your question is if you don't pay them the Thirteen thousand they can sue you for breach of contract\nAnd then what they'll do is they'll if you don't answer the suit or there's a default judgment then they'll get a final judgment then there'll be a judgment against you for Thirteen thousand assuming you don't defend it properly\nAnd then what happened right as your your question was can they come after me for other things the answer is well yes and no they're not going to come after you for things like your home if it's homesteaded and things like that they're not going to come get your personal property will ever take his iPhone today what they'll do is more likely than not try to garnish your wages depending on who your employer is\nA ... or if you uh you'll come into any money to put leans on different things like that they'll do but they're not just in that come in and started clearing out your living room furniture ah but you will have\nLike like other vehicles like I have a a a fifty thousand dollar boat that's paid for it another vehicle that space or\nNo on the line name you\nKnow not necessarily in the sense that that's going to happen but you're going to have a judgment against you and more likely than not that I've seen is are going to garnish wages\nI mean are going to come in I mean unless of course you're in a bankruptcy then you have to start dealing with the bankruptcy trustee of the sound like you're going to do that for Thirteen thousand dollar let me ask you a question no right I mean between you and made all the great folks listening I mean why don't you why your work why does pay your ... your breach the contract or\nWhy don't you negotiate a deal pay well\nI don't have the car the longer I don't I'm not in the vehicle yeah last\nNight ... that's not their fault you breach the ...\nThat's true yeah\nThe call and then start making racist the battle ... and this is why I I Do call them up and say listen guys I\nI was upset you know the cars you know it broke you know I probably shouldn't a breach the contract by bad however can we work out a deal maybe pay you guys back a grand or or or ten or ... something like that and to get that in writing\nMaybe put a lump sum down and you pay somebody and and now you've minimize your damage you've avoided litigation you've distressed your life you don't go to worry about any judgments people coming after you for any other reason\n\nBut only to hurry up and put my other vehicles them all I Know you don't need to do that now and then I started to tell somebody possible us if we can say no I don't I don't even\nThink you need to do that at all if you follow my advice negotiate with these people and if you need help with that I've got a great lawyer that can help you with this in a breach of contract scenario just go to ...\nGet some good folks for you I bought a yellow face down your well I'll give you a call\n... there was a lawyer telling you you don't need to go to court\nI look oh so you're in a lawyer telling you I'll have another I'll turn it on to another or while I go by you yeah ah Jerry has a question Hi Gerry\nHow're you doing how's it going to be more than a\nQuick question really an issue but a way to a lawyer can you just say okay maybe if something happens in the future ... lawyer\nJust if I was taking it'll trouble you X amount of dollars to retain or do you does that mean you're going to bail me out of jail\nTo ah for less resent me when I was\n... highly their way out of here and uh\nYeah it depends on the agreement you have with the lawyer and the answer is yes you are I don't take\n'em preempt three or advanced retainer is is what you're
