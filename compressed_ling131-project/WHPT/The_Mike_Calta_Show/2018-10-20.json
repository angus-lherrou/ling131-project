much for us we have an even touched on the incredible brain benefits I mean some of these studies you sent me an absolutely incredible\nAs you know I'm very into neutral picks the anti aging community has taken a keen interest in Korea teen specifically the cognitive benefits of Korea Team\nOh absolutely this is one of those areas where Korea Team really shine you see what we need to understand is that your brain even though it's only two percent of your body's weight it utilizes twenty\nPercent of your body's energy this is a very thirsty Oregon for energy and just like your muscles soak up decree it seemed like a sponge\nBecause this is a naturally occurring molecule in the body it passes right through the blood brain barrier your brain or an soak it up like a sponge and it increases your Korea teen phosphate reserves in your brain so now in your brain you have more readily available resources\nTo do was to recharge those neuronal batteries to make more energy inside the brain so basically what do you notice well your memory is supported and pat scientists have done some amazing research here they found the people that take Korea Team it supports their memory it actually helps the brain to utilize\nOxygen better it supports memory and people that are sleep deprived it's been shown to help people add numbers quicker and for longer periods of time without mental fatigue get this study pat\nJust five days five days of eight grams of creativity and supported mental test subjects that we're getting rapid fire question scientists were asking him\nMath questions in science questions over and over and over and they found the folks on Korea Team didn't fatigue as quickly\nMentally so this is amazing stuff it's like a turbo booster for your brain it's like a super charger for your muscles are re chargers all your cellular battery so all of your cells tissues and organs have more readily available energy\nOr dark I loved that ever strong appeals to athletes and people want to get more reps in the gym maybe get some extra power and their workouts but you're also saying there's a big push nutritional community to encourage people in the forties fifties sixties seventies and even eighties to leverage the power of Korea Team to stay fit strong and healthy but you say\nKorea Tina's going mainstream you know I share the story with you before my mom who's in her late seventies now she's taking creating she works out a couple of days a week three days a week she goes to novelist does the free weights because she's got osteoporosis she wants to maintain her muscle mass and she wants to make her bones stronger and as you pointed out Korea teen helps to do that\nAnd then the other three days during the week she'll go and she'll swim now she's not trying to get bigger stronger or anything like that but even at her age Korea teen has benefits\nOh yeah and what blows me away about that story 'cause you told me before is that her medical doctor recommended routine for and that just goes to show how much more mainstream this is it's cold ever strong and\nIt supports the muscles that supports your power your strength your speed if you're an athlete you're certainly going to love it but even if you're not an athlete you notice the difference let's go to another study one more review study this out of the journal current aging science December of two thousand Thirteen I thought this was very cool\nCause the researchers looked at the body of research out there on creating and seniors without exercise they want to see what happens when seniors take Korea teen and they don't\nHave an exercise so I'm quoting here Korea ten supplementation without associated resistance training seemed to enhance muscular strength power and endurance increase lean body mass for those that don't know what that is they're talking about muscle and improve the functional capacity\nOf the elderly they go on to talk about how it supports bone health as well and then they finish with this creating supplementation without training in the elderly could potentially delay atrophy\nOf muscle and unproven difference and strength so here again we see bottom line ... team is very very effective it's gonna help you to feel stronger whether you exercise or not it supports your strength and power your brain health\nAnd on top of that it supports your bone health I mean

twenty five thousand dollars a day and get this from the place of your choice you could do it from your home heck you could do it from the beach a coffee shop anywhere you have Internet or wife\nBy you're going to be in business today we're going to share with you how you can do that\nYou're in the right place at the right time I guarantee you that so right this number down now\nEight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven\nAnd we're going to share with you like I said an opportunity to make five hundred to five thousand dollars a day and all that Michael share with you get this working a couple of hours a day how you doing Michael\nThanks John I'm awesome folks it's a fact you hear a lot of stuff you hear a lot of bologna and you're probably wondering if it's even possible to make money on the Internet\nWe've all done the same thing you find yourself on the Internet you're looking for this opportunity that opportunity you're looking at ads and a lot of what you see is or not that credible fortunately\nWell we have this is the real deal\nWe do it every day yes you can make money on the Internet I don't leave my home to go to work I haven't for a few years I worked comfortably from home\nIt's the real deal so we take a lot of pride in what we do here on the radio show and what we say we represent what we talk about and these are cold hard facts\nAnd to prove it what we do is we open up our doors we invite anybody listening to come and see it here it and the witness it for yourself\nYou don't have to believe what we're saying on the radio we don't want you to we want just here's for now and then take us up on our invitation it's free\nIf you have a computer you can sit in with us you can sit in on one of our training sessions and see exactly what we do the sessions or every day Monday through Friday nights and early in the morning and you can see it and hear it and witness it for yourself\nAnd watch real people trading real money and like John said if you want to make some serious money or just make some money from home you want to trade in your jail bead work from home\nIf you want to make anywhere from five hundred five thousand dollars a day\nIf maybe you're someone right now is looking to buy or or start a business and hang it up there there isn't a business out there that you can turn around this quickly and start making money within two weeks and be in the profits on within two weeks and start earning\nUsually let's say you buy a brick and mortar business and with a brick and mortar business it can take a year or sometimes two or three years just to get your initial investment back\nThis is not that program this is actually the complete opposite if you're looking for a job or something productive to do from home we've got a lot of seniors we've got housewives and people of all backgrounds\nThere is no experience needed this is simple it's a a follow along simple one two three\nAnybody can do it it's really written on about a fourth or fifth grade level and we're going to talk more about that a little later in the show if you're a business owner and you're not making the money you need to\nMaybe you want to supplement your income or replace it altogether I traded in my business for this a few years back you might want to check this out if you're a day trader and you already understand the J training business\nMaybe you're not realizing the profits that you want to what we have here is simple and it works there's no research needed on a daily basis there's a lot of guys that trade and they got to put a lot of time into doing research here there is no research we literally just show up\nProbably John the hardest part for people to believe other than the money that we make is we actually only work two hours a day it's a fact\nSo folks if this sounds interesting to write down this phone number ... give us a call we're inviting you in to one of our free training sessions you can sit in a live and you can see exactly what we do the number to call this\nEight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven that eight eight eight six four six\nSeven eight seven\nSee it for yourself here it for yourself see if this is something you are interested in we're the largest private trading group of our kind in the country and we have active members in almost every major U.S city from from Miami to Salt Lake city\nSo basically what we do every day we log on to our computers from wherever we are and we trade as a group with our professional mentor leading the session\nSo we invite you to sit in for free and see it and hear it and witness it you can even sit in a couple of times you can participate\nYou get to participate as a guest and ask questions if you like the developers of this program our our mentors they have decades of experience in day trading let's be honest everybody knows day trading can be lucrative but\nUm you know while day trading has made a lot of people into millionaires there's also a lot of people that have failed because it takes years of practice Stephen learn and understand what you're doing\nSo this program uses our mentors experience this program makes it simple we call it thinking in ...\nIt's taking something complex and making it simple for the average person and that's what we've done with this program are developers took a software program\nThat we follow and they color coded it is only two colors so you really can't get confused\nAh I I guess more than two colors possibly some people might get confused but our program is just blue and green so if you can tell the difference between blue and green and if you can count to three you can do this\nI Know I'm making this sound ridiculously simple but folks it actually is this actually is this simple and it's easy there is no experience needed you can be productive from home and make money and a John I you're in the group yourself\nMhm that's true and and well one of the things I really appreciate about our mentor in this program is not only like you just said\nThat he's going to help us with making money but he's also going to change the way we think\nOf what's great about this is I always say it's like taking Warren Buffett and Tony Robbins and combining them and and then put them together and you've got our mentor\nOr how would you like to have someone like that and guiding you every morning motivating you to make more money and keep it that's what he teaches us this isn't just making money this is also about money management and a ... changing the way you think\nHey John thinks a you know first of all I don't want anybody to get scared off or intimidated when I talk about what we do or if you've never experienced trading don't be scared off this is as easy as a one two three process um what we do\nIs we trade one product on the market and again it's an easy one to three process that are mentor and strikes and the software instructs\nWe trade one product it's called the e many future it's on the S. and P. five hundred\nWhat's nice about the e many future is it's treated in both directions so when the market is moving up we're making trades when the software tells us to and when it's going down we make money and trade so we actually don't care\nWhat the actual results of the day is whether the market is up or down we make money either way we get to capitalize on all types of markets and all types of market conditions\nYou know this week for us was just another typical week uh you know all weeks are good for us but in particular yesterday was very very good and all we do is follow the instructions that the software it gives us\nAnd like I said before the software is presented on a very basic level it's color coded and it's only two colors so it's easier than looking at a street light or a street light as three colors right Jill that's right [laughter] this is only two colors to blue and it's green\nOr the green light is going up and the blue light is going down so it tells us exactly when to get into a trade and when the exit a trade\nThere is no thinking and that's what I Love about this there's no thinking about the trade itself\nThe software tells you when did get in and went to get out and it's phenomenally accurate it's for all types of people experienced and non experienced we've got people in the group\nThat just heard the radio show several months ago they called us they had never even heard of day trading or the fact that they could make money doing it from home and now they're in the group and they're making more money than they ever thought they would ever make\nIt's truly a phenomenal thing and what we do you know it's kind of amazing and the fact\nAnd even to this day I\nI sometimes sit here and I I chuckled than myself and I realize that all I'm doing is listening to my mentor tell me to when to get into a trade and and the software tells me when to get in as well and I clicked on the mouse on my computer and I make money\nI mean I made the other day I had a really big day and\nOnly flipped on my mouse three times you know I always joke it's so easy I'm not I'm not at risk of\nA polling muster muscle in my finger [laughter] and I know you know we laugh about that how easy it is but\nThis is a fact folks um we're trying to appeal to the average person\nYou know there's there's a lot of people out there listening that that like their jail will be and then there's a lot of people out there listening that frankly hate their jail the end and maybe some people in the middle my point of view is this\nIf you could make the money you're making now at your J. O. B. and instead work two hours a day from home would you make that change\nI think you probably would you\nKnow I used to work for a large corporation and in my normal day was twelve hours and maybe that's a little bit more than what the average person works but you know let's say you're working eight or nine hours\nIf you could trade in eight hours for two hours and just make the same amount of money you're making today would you make that trade\nAnd I think for most people the answer's yes and I you know the second question to follow that up is then what are you going to do with all that extra time that you just gained\nWell the fact is ... ... it's a life changing thing you wouldn't be able to do something else productive spend more time with your family or utilize that time any way you want to\nSo this opportunity is potentially life changing\nTo anybody that is working now I realize that there are some people that are already in control of their schedule or their hours but I'm telling you this is an easy way to just put in a couple of hours a day and make a full time or or more than a full time income you know the great thing John too is\nThere's no limit there was no end cap here on how much you can make you can keep going and going and progressive leaves you get better you can make more and more money\nBut you know the main message we want to get across is this is for that average person that's putting in that long day\nAnd I used to be that guy I used to work six days a week and when I was off on Sunday [laughter] I was so tired my kids were like oh you better not better not bother dad it's only day off\nYou know and now now it's like I've been in heaven for a few years and I actually get to raise my son and my daughter I get to spend all the time in the world with them you know we just got back from California and I got to spend\nGood quality time with them and and this is my life changing story and this could be for anyone that wants to make that kind of change now we've got people that are retired so\nMaybe for them they're not checking into that job but\nMaybe you need something productive to do and you know a lot of seniors are usually on a fixed income and they might not have an easy way of making more money so this is a great way to not commit to a full time job it's just a couple of hours nice in early in the morning and then you're done\nSo folks here what we're saying and you don't have to believe us right now\nUntil you show up for your free session and see it for yourself we want you to see\nWhat we do so that phone number again to call his\nEight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven\nReserve you're spot for free no obligation on your part you're you're simply going to sit in with us from your own computer we're going to send you a live link for a couple of days to sit in and all you got to do is click on it\nUm if you're Pacific time it will be seven o'clock in the morning and if you're eastern time it's ten AM so just depends what time so when you're in\nWe're all on together all across the country and that link that we're going to email you it's going to take you right into our live trading session you're going to witness real people\nIn our group trading real money and sit back listen and a witness exactly how easy it is and you're going to find out that you can click the mouse on your computer a couple of times in the morning and and make all the money that you want and probably more\nThan you're even thinking yeah we're we're basically riding on coat tails you're getting on the coat tails of an experience trader your mentor he's he's got I like to say a PHD and making money and he just makes money he's basically been doing this for over Twenty years\nAnd he practices what he preaches he's doing it and trading while showing you what he's doing\nAnd that's why I say coat tails because we're literally riding on the coat tails of somebody who's been doing this for over Twenty years and if if you were to start today you'd be Twenty years behind so he's already made the mistakes\nHe's already done all the things that you would that you would have to do to be successful\nOr when I found out about this program and I got involved it basically changed my life\n[noise] you know what John ... that's actually really important what you brought up when when you conduct trades\nWe actually use something called a trade ladder the mentor leading the training session actually puts it on the screen it's not up all the time but he puts it up there for training purposes and it's alive\nAnd he's you know he's making the same trades like everybody else that he's instructing so you actually see it you hear it and you you witness it for yourself being done right there in front of you and the mentor he's very open about the trades\n[noise] this is really elementary kid level where anyone can participate and you know the other part of it is let's be honest this is day trading so it does take a little bit of money to participate you're actually going to open up a brokerage account\nThough it doesn't take as much money as you would think most people are thinking I'm going to need you know thirty thousand dollars to get started it's nowhere near that the minimum brokerage account is three thousand dollars or sometimes even less\nIf you're looking at investing a small amount of money and making it grow\nThis is a great avenue to do that and what's really nice about our program to\nYou you actually received the software now with other groups you don't receive anything you get to view things and usually that software is way more complicated and you've got to go to technical school just to swallow what you're even looking at let alone all the multiple different types of trades that they have\nWe've got one trait we've got one trade you're going to learn and about an hour and it's based on what the market does every single day of the year that it's open\nAnd it's called the one two three turn around and it's it's really simple anybody can do this so if you're looking to be productive from home if you're looking to start a business or buy a business forget that you're going to want to check this out\nThat he Berkeley describes as well as it's happening there is no panicking needed when you're involved in our mentor actually verbally talks you drew it\nThere's a precise entry point and it's clear as day right on the screen\nSo when we say the system is very simple and and it's written on an elementary level it's color coded and then on top of that you're being verbally instructed\nSo it provides a level of mental comfort that you're doing the right thing at the right times it's just reinforcement and on top of that the accuracy of the software and it signals is unprecedented compared to anything else I've ever seen\nAnd I've shopped more than twenty different programs if you want to see it here it and witness this for yourself we don't want you to believe what we're saying here on the show\nWe want you to see it then you can believe us after you see it\nYou can call us at our eight hundred number after you've come in and sat in on a session and let's talk about any differences you might have seen between what you saw in the real session and what we talked about on the radio I I'd love to hear if there was anything that you thought was different because [noise]\nIf anything I feel like on the show we under state things um we like to be very conservative with our expectations I'm not going to sit here and and talk about hey you know we had someone in the group that may twenty thousand dollars in the day or is this guy over here routinely makes ten thousand dollars in a day [noise]\nI don't like to emphasize those types of stories what I'd rather say is at an average person is going to make five hundred dollars a day maybe a thousand dollars a day and maybe more than that so if this is something that you might want to take advantage of give us a call\nEight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven that's eight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven\nReserve you're spot and a couple of our sessions there's no cost to you all you have to do is make that reservation we have people right now answering the phone is live\nI'm so give us a call check this out and and see this for yourself see if it's right for you you can witness real people\nAre trading real money our phone lines do get busy during the show this is hugely popular like I said we welcome to a lot of members just within the last month and this really is the new age of income\nIf people can trade in their current job and get out of their traditional habits you know it's interesting when you think about traditional habits it's like\nYou know my dad had a J. O. B. E. or my mom had a ... and you know they're just used to that and you know back in the day hey if you want to make more money will go out and get another job that pays more\nAnd up with this this is completely different you don't even have to leave your house\nAll you need is a computer and Internet service\nSo check us out for yourself I'm at the very least you can probably replace your current income or but more likely you can far surpassed that\nAnd uh you know I Want to comment on what I said at the beginning you're right they won't get a Harvard degree because that cost about three hundred grand and uh and and now you come out with a degree and then you have to pay that back now you have to get a job and pay it back so are there\nAre other trading schools but there are two things they don't have our software and the leadership of our mentors we have the software and the leadership of our mentor every morning he he gets as motivated his leadership and personalities and ...\nIt's like a classroom and it'll it literally it'll change the way you think\nUh I don't think the way I I used to anymore at all or he reduces\nThe variables in this thing to make it where you can make more money but what's more important is his passion or isn't just getting people to make more money his passion is also in people keeping it which is so important\nWhen I go and got involved in this I was building my nest and now what I'm doing is building my nest egg and I want a big will last or ... or like you said I don't want to say how much I made last week\nBut let's just say I did better last week than in any job I've ever had and that's working just two hours a day and I I did I think eleven trades nine were winters and the other two I did wrong I I didn't really I didn't exactly stick to the plan I didn't follow our mentor\nAnd are the two I did wrong I did on my own so that's that was my fault you start you start to think you know what you're doing and that's kind of when you get into trouble\nSo where else are you going to find a group like this where you have a mentor like we have to guide you only are trading group has mentors like we have to guide you and only our group has the software program we have to guide you and make this easy\nLike Michael says this is the new age of earning\nA like you said I was raised to think you get a job and you go to work\nAt seven in the morning and you worked there for thirty plus years and with this with this it was hard to grasp since it's it's two hours a day that you can work literally a couple of hours and just click the mouse why\nLike that you talked about the number of trades you attempted yourself personally you know if we attached to the accuracy of the soft wear a couple of weeks ago or a mentor was in session and he was near rating in describing\nFifteen trades that he made that week from Monday to friday and fourteen of those Fifteen trades were good\nThis is not an exact science no one will ever win a hundred percent but fourteen or Fifteen that week we're good we don't want to sound like we're selling this we want to show it to you\nIf you see it and you think this opportunity is phenomenal and that's what you're going to see a great way to make money from home or any location and I was just in California last week a man I'm In my hotel room on my computer and you can trade any where the Internet is\nSo if you're looking for a very intriguing an easy way to generate income or invest this is a nice way to do it\nYou get to hold onto your own funds you actually open up your own account it and your name nobody sees and nobody has access to it but you all we do is guide you\nIn this group your mentor will guide you your mentor will provide an education that no other group provides\nThese other groups that are out there you follow their process and they don't actually trade anything they just show people how to observe different markets like if you're interested in a certain market you pick out that market they show you how to live the J traders lifestyle\nBut they actually don't trade anything they don't have any software that gives you trade signals\nOr anything like that and they charge an exorbitant amount of money they come into town all the time with seminars and they ... people they have a great marketing program\nBut it takes you nowhere and if you add up all of their fees it's over thirty thousand dollars I'm Serious I went through an added up all of their classes it's over thirty thousand dollars\nIt's crazy that there's another group that comes into town with a three day seminar and it's three thousand dollars to sign up\nWe don't sell this opportunity like those other guys do\nIf you like what you see with our group and you think you can operate within our simple guidelines and and trust me their fourth grade simple and you were interested in making healthy income from home then this is it I mean this is really a life changing opportunity\nIf you want to keep getting what you're getting then keep doing what you're doing is the old saying goes well we're giving you like Michael says is an opportunity we want you to take a look at this and see what we saw when I first saw this I couldn't believe it I I bumped into Michael\nAnd he told me what he's doing and I went into the session just like you'll do and I couldn't believe my eyes I went to my wife and said this is incredible and and and she said we've got to get involved\nSo it's something we do together now every morning it's at it's absolutely changed our
