yeah yeah you just go to the store a Trader Joe's has all the way they are they are really really they're very good [laughter]\nOr if you did not know now you're about to know oh man some nights mega millions jackpot is up to one point six\nBillion with a B billion dollars that is the biggest lottery jackpot in us history and it makes the Powerball jackpot look weak even though that's going to be six hundred and twenty million\nPeople I Do go in Powerball last week\nYou apparently did not you may want to hear something but you did not win the Powerball is on Wednesday of course making millions is a model I saw yeah Tuesday or if you want both of them that'd be over two billion dollars would when I'm idle walk over\nI no one has won the mega millions jackpot since a group of co workers from California headed back on July twenty fourth jeez yeah and no one was one the Powerball since August eleventh the odds of winning the mega millions are one in what for Clinton earlier one and now it's a lot less than that actually one\nOf the housing and for some reason people already tickets I Would buy back for about\nA one in one billion one in three hundred and two point six million\nMan that's the odds of winning the mega millions question do your odds go up the more I tickets you get no right is it ... listen there's people went out late I bought two thousand dollars that minimal minimal increases\nRidiculous it's unbelievable thing friends between one ticket in two thousand tickets is unbelievable if I'm going to school yeah ... do the ...\nBy one as I figure I Do like five quick fix that the other day I was like ... ... actually I didn't write or just in case I don't know I don't get wind I've decided that's what I I I went in there and\nI'll take thirty those nothing thirty the Powerball yeah for sure last week the guy makes for a one on one of the free or half a harder\nI saw Floyd Mayweather is spent I don't know how much on and whatever but it's like he has millions and millions and millions of dollars if I may have a little taller than ours and all that a a a huge amount of your life that would be hilarious I was working so the dodge for the millions are the odds of becoming a a lightning victim\nA victim of lightning in the U.S in any one year is one\nIn seven hundred thousand while the odds of being struck in your lifetime is one in three thousand why don't like that\nLightning can kill people blah blah blah or cause cardiac arrest or give you a superpower ... never know that's one of the ... that's one of the things that it's possible I pointed out of thing they said what to do if you win the a mega million or when the Powerball and stuff\nA few things that they said sign that immediately surely you sign it\nUh you should keep stay anonymous as long as you can why or just because everybody\nFrom or out of the woodwork says when time and try and get money from me I\nDo all that stuff and I guess you know just overwhelmed with all that stuff uh uh it said definitely you know I talked to a financial person you're you know financial whether you have an account of our with our into all that type of stuff\nA and it said yes definitely take the lump sum Yan said you're paid you know the thing over Thirty years whatever\nBut it said money now makes money as opposed to money that you're waiting for whatever so you take the money and your ... even if you're just earning interest off as you're making money off of that and not that you need more money to lay off one boy six billion but you know what I'm saying but it was funny because I haven't really comment on the picture\nThat came with the articles from Forbes magazine at a picture of somebody holding a ticket with the\nDirtiest fingernail in the world of hiring\nAre like hey I'm ... good clean up and photo shop or something on your even said he goes I'm not taking advice from somebody with dirty fingernails all I don't think that person wrote the article they are holding the ticket ... drove my wife and I got into a pretty heavy argument on friday night\nReally of who gets money and well we went to a boy I tell you I Love that mobile crushed yeah and you know what that is

to go see Halloween and there were like ... a noble crust\nAnd we're talking about the mega millions and I said she goes listen I got to tell you\nI like what your idea is to give some money away but I think that if it's like eight hundred million or nine hundred million you should keep more than a hundred and twenty five and I go why and she goes 'cause our grandchildren should have a lot I go man if we have a hundred and twenty five million dollars in the bank cash\nWill have enough money off of that to make our grandchildren rich and she's like well what do we just keep half or they go oh my God like spoiled you\nKnow I completely agree with him in a way to live in places like\nRwanda half ... half now there are a hundred and twenty five million visit you don't need any more than that in your life in your life\nBut if you have more yeah just to be safe I'm ... I Am away last now and I'm doing just fine listen to me\nA hundred and twenty five million or say it say how much we're going say five hundred messy five hundred million five hundred million so you take a hundred and twenty five million put it away give away three hundred million and then put the Seventy\nA million in a secret secret account okay so if I'm already putting fifty million and a secret secret high and then I'm putting Seventy five then I got Seventy five million dollars on top of that\nTo play with ... you don't need more of a you know it is not a thing in the world that I couldn't do with fifty million dollars or something you tell me well we all want to go to\nSwitzerland to go skiing for Christmas okay bring a hundred friends all chartered jets yeah I guess what tell us about where are we going what Switzerland to do what\nThe right way like in the ... are you paying yeah okay\nI made a lot at the end I pay for everybody I still live with a million dollars ...\n... oh man if you agree or so we know officially what middle age as\nWell or hopefully hopefully it's a I say middle ages forty two\nNow thirty six no forty is a is now officially you are middle age seven forty\nSaturday that even though you may not live to be double that whatever they if I Do I'll be very happy with that yeah Ninety One Ninety chew it should be about enough\nWe know returned to the Mike Celtic show on one of those two five the bone\nOr they have the top fifty signs your middle age I'll give you some of the top ten worst black Sox has handled [laughter] or you feel you know more about politics than you ever did before you feel that way yeah yeah\nUh you love a scouring the a home and garden stores [noise] yeah [laughter] I Love it uh you except now a a\nA dress size bigger shirt size being I guess it would be and there's nothing you can do about it or has now are being happy to spend big money on things you know will last like a garden fans are new flooring and you're home stuff like that are not real happy about that [laughter]\nBut there's other things yeah yeah yeah I was a man what\nWhat other ... charity events and how many charity events so I mean you should start thinking about it I'm already had already\nMad the humane society and I told you end up seeing a oh I Would have been nice to go to the humane society charity ball why\nYou go well they didn't invite me oh yeah well you'll get invited you buy a ticket to it I Love dogs I mean the media invite me yeah Mm that's how bad our youth thing Charlie Belgian Jeanette seeing them or bought a ticket a possible now\nSo you say you're as popular as Charlie Belcher\nI'm not saying that I'm saying I Love dogs way more than most of them put together while they both have dogs and on on the radio and yes I'm way\nMore both of them come on ... ridiculous [laughter]\nI ... and I've seen every time I Do public so [laughter] I just can't I go up to the the cart thing where you put it away and just take some of them out a what a lot of rural oh I mean I just thought I'd pull them out like kick now I live and that's why I saw in line and now I just brings the ties with being a dime to the handle A People's cars and you can\nDo that I feel like every time I leave public's about people are watching right now I guarantee you it's somebody's and pick a picture of me leaving my cart somewhere a worry I'm not going to stop doing it just because you ... your eyeball the\nPublic's made the parking space is big enough to hide a thing in their ... don't try to change my mind a Steve good morning rather my child to show\nHello Steven ... yes it more to Michael\nSays Steve has an idea of a costume from your job and is it going to be good or ... really good okay are you guys are really good\nLike you would be perfect but still\nYou know what's funny is that um when I was a kid and I mean like like eight or so my uh cousin Phil went as Fred\nFlintstone and my cousin vi V. when a woman and she kind of had the woman hair and the power and all that and maybe made the uh the Fred Flintstone costume so years later when I was a senior in high school and we got to dress up I asked if I could borrow that costume and I did and I want to all sorts of contests where that now I don't think I could ever fit in that thing but a ...\n... she she would be the best well look you could carry around the giant turkey leg and then she got to draw in misbehave you sweat or what the turkey like no you need to take\nYeah you don't know how to deal with Congress or not she gets to drug and I just stick meeting around ...

I forget and I'm like\n... that you are gay and the way that they found the car and that huge property with all those cars and this lady went right to it\nI mean it it really does seem you could definitely make an argument that the Manitowoc police\nGot the wrong guy for the rape right he got out was suing them for upwards of thirty six million dollars\nHe was looking like he was going to get that in that it gets put in for a murder yeah you should definitely make a case for the ... ... you know setting him up and doing all that stuff now is there is that there was a breaking the chain of command on a three to haul back some of her items that they were supposed to take that they talk\nTo the farm that they took to the cell the auto salvage area\nOr that they should have taken it there they should have taken it back to the precinct\nBut there is a there the chain of command was broken it was very weird there's a lot of stuff so\nIt's definitely worth watching but like I said the first one you know Scott you ... well this is what it is just a follow up right plus yeah they probably shouldn't be action yeah be as a post conviction lawyer who is very good she's gotten I pick Eighteen people out of prison right or wrong [noise]\nSome might shellfish oh\n[noise]\n\nThe bones so a veiled colonel it will give him some time this hour and if you don't get to hear and where he

right don't get all mad at me marriage but every time he looked at the clock and the clock stopped moving like the second hand which that moving heave weight and he'd go\nJust want to see we're going to get are from a nuclear attack what so I guess if there is a nuclear\nLaunch the electromagnetic pulse is will stop the clocks from working something along those lines maybe I'm right marriage tell me a\nAnd so he'd look at the clock and he tells you to run their nuclear attack or that card means new batteries and we all wait to see it but exploit them happen and then we carry on with their work\nHe would lose is also like to figure out if a kid where oil yeah teachers that he would lose his job one hundred percent\nYeah he did say he did say in a very scientific way and then he
