shows\nThe skeletons and stuff it's a very small it looks like an ultralight almost it's a very small little plane mother-in-law soldiers you're killing of the scale I'm sure yeah and you can tell that it is not a real plane or a plane crash may even interviewed a too like teenaged neighbors and they're like we can't believe people are calling like clearly it's a Halloween\nYou know decoration and stuff do we have the ah ...\n... ...\nA gallon that's on you write a\nGuide so so what do they do they call nine one one yeah and the guy in the ... er which is one of the human right house yeah the guy laughed about it and stuff so that's acceptable him except in two thousand one anytime after a before that or several years afterward be OK yeah it is and like\nTake a second it maybe go go to ... that concerned go to that house and go hey that plane crashing here for nope those are my ... Halloween decorations which is on the loose yeah was era which there was a highly mia aircraft that I fell into your thing yeah them either as\nA joyous energy but don't worry about it next up as the guy who looks like somebody we know\nIf they were fat OK okay but I'm going to give you the back story I don't put the picture up ... what I call for at night when you guys when I call for it for you guys to a a immediately yellow your answer\nOkay All right man was busted for child pornography when his apartment company noticed his child porn screen saver\nDuring their fire extinguisher now this is how down this guy as he was booked on ten counts of child pornography but tenets were notified by email three days prior\nTo put their fire extinguishers out front of their apartment or they're coming together or their income and get them yeah so this guy didn't do it left a screen saver what child porn on it so they went in and they were like obviously is going to be one of the smart [laughter] yeah right\nI'm Down now this does not reflect on the person who this last like\nOkay I I've never I mean I have ... show the picture as soon as you see it yell out it as a person that we know if they were fat who does this look like do you go\nOh really oh I had a who all of our all of a you know I don't really know\nThat fat Michael yeah Joey and you\nGet to the Media Lab I mean I see it now you say if I stared at a little while there I I even got expecting some a little more obvious as soon as I thought I'd go that far fat myself Federer are right but like if you told me this is my older brother I Would add yeah yeah I got to tell you I'm fine with me [laughter]\nI've also seen five dollar oh yeah I remember those years oh that that's why it was like a yeah yeah I see it in the face yeah for sure in the face I didn't think of all a rare didn't have any ... [laughter] yeah right and he was balding and he worked in like eighty or something right now he he was a rare without Kong\nTong Gina highway is a guy works at night he he probably wouldn't have child foreigners scream favor or maybe a little further\nPut it in a folder somewhere more of these stories you tell us about the more I think Mike is right and one of these people they know they're sick and they just want to get caught I Do I Want to be done with the guilt that they live with good being down there would be\nI mean why would you do that well you all you had to do is portraying what's your out front that's it there are some in but the other thing also is well maybe your rights when it's like\nIf you're just looking at child porn that's that's like I never understood why people who looked at child porn always going to travel and people may child child porn seem to get away with all the time you know what I mean yeah but you always believe like\nBut this guy or a library of all the child porn always you know that looking at it and I'm like you know what that looks like it's from Wisconsin news you're probably trace it back to find out who do\nI ... I think what the problem is is the people making the child porn are a lot harder to get than the people that are looking at it well and if ... if you're looking at it you're probably you could definitely act on it you know and then making your own so I uh are you giving people that like a child born a pass or\nNo it's just like why is that\nAlways like you never hear about a child video production ring well yeah\nWhat I think it is and you do sometimes but I Would equate it to you never you don't hear as much as we got this guy with you know\nFive hundred pounds of cocaine worry we busted you know eighty different people that had a little bag of cocaine to know what I mean so a lot harder to get the main guy than it is you get all these idiots that are leaving porn on their ...\nNow I'd definitely definitely they'll get a pass by ... also so I was talking to some cops about um about do you know kids are trading now the now the new thing they still use these video games\nMay weather in boxing oh in ... he wants to boxing\nI thought it was ... now I have to turn to go into the room\nI don't think may weather is dumb enough to get in the ring in the acting\nOctagon and um it could be because I'm trying to be a boxer yeah no I mean they may further payday McGregor newly originally or kill too I just did it for the payday any any earned it 'cause he was such a great heightened machine can be can barely speak English\nYes of course I think we all agree if Mayweather gotten the octagon he's dead yeah if I can be caught in the ring he'd be dead Mayweather is dead with eighty percent of the roster\nYeah yeah I mean whether is dad with the local guys that are you know that even the U. S. E. don't really know yeah that's a whole different animal like he's never done that\nYou know sure he can find stuff I Will always be Maria from the ... I bet she ... she would beat him yeah because he's going to throw a punch and she's going to take him down and once you get them on the ground you know what he's doing down there\nBy the way type you can use this opportunity or talking about fighting sure to try and learn all ladies in okay a November second we've got Mike how this punch our number four happening agendas lie abroad to you by Bud Light and we've got a might run through some of the matches and I want to tell you everything or are we going to try to do the whole day oh no I'm\nJust going to give you some of the things we talked about yesterday uh because I had some ideas I don't know if we're going to be able to pull off the ... match\nWhere we sprayed two guys in the face of Mason and let them fight right on the roads at my main concern with that was the crowd getting it and then um my buddy Tom are called and said I've got a phone little despair right in their face and I was like ooh that's pretty good\nFor a or a way to do it is I well I guess in that they're punching out as I say spray it into a a ... and then what do you regard yeah and then they have to but then if your position in the face of goggles to\nWe have one legged that Dan and then another one like a guy said he wanted to fight so I wanted to do a a two guys two legs match\nUm we've got a whole bunch of we got the vanilla gorilla fighting to people once we've got a bunch of fights here in the building that are happening including a hobby and Garrett and the baby versus Goliath\nUm but we also have the ladies battle royal part to ... and I need to nail down our participants now and who's going to be in that battle royal now\nI I Need action out of this one because it's going to be a thousand dollar cash prize right and we had come up with a remember the idea I had to keep it moving along yeah so what if if the if it gets them in the crowd eliminate somebody well every uh I think yeah you know either every thirty seconds or every minute we go and then we eliminate we eliminate right now and that are getting that action\nThen every minute we're going to have one writer I guess the problem was\nIt got down like four or five girls who just hid in the corner right so we're not fighting is going to get booted out so uh I I'm calling all\nBig girls I'm calling all fatty he's um called giant ladies I'm calling for basketball players I'm calling just bash pitchers in general one thousand dollars cash prize on the line for ladies ... all you have to do is get in the ring with the other ladies\nAnd throw ... how they don't even have to go over the top are all big north to the bottom rope do you have to get them out and they eliminate the other players and when there's one person left in the ring that person I was wondering I Believe last time we had to split the money we won't do it anyway\nA by the way the the girl right there in the uh black sports ... with the uh a colorful leg English or maybe that's not her okay but one of those girls I I'm trying to see which one it is was my date for a apple a oh really yeah from oh no kidding yeah she was in there\nOh well look if you look there's a lot of hot a skinny checks and there\nThere's a couple of begins in there I mean really I I'm a I Would love to just see some big old three hundred pound Betsy from Plant City you're there but I Would do is is that we didn't get enough country girls there that's a problem well I was skinny Puerto Ricans remember they were never any and then we get all a big boost calling their uh what about a Spanish is friend\nNo she doesn't live here in the room or but one of the people I think it would be great especially when there's a thousand dollars on the line is last year's contested who fought hobby crystal oh yeah it has a giant and she's got a flexibility\nRight our strong right out of it he goes that are like shoot at her and stuff and she does a stronger yeah blackout honestly [laughter] ah\nSo I mean uh there's no age limit and there's a ... is right and oh yeah that's a reality that uh if you're a brood bitch oh if you've if I'm telling you write out if you're going to\nUh be in this and you
