commercials for it absolutely no on ... this is already been back just in the month of September by two major organizations Disney in the month of September alone over ten million dollars\nAssemble Indian tribe over ten million dollars why anyone at it because Disney does not want gambling in the state of Florida was basically be what they want to give away the tourist alright yeah are you man\nHe had ... this is bull crap because it says voters you thought I was going to say about our own I this is bull crap because it's titled voters in charge when I was like a good I ride that's certainly in charge\nBut what it does it takes all future gambling including possible sports book out of the state of Florida because the legislature will no longer have control\nIt will go to sixty percent of a state wide boat do you think the voters in orange county that has universal Sea World all the Disney properties wanted to give away those tourists tax dollars you're out of your freaking mind you think the state of Florida is going to flush all that tax money and revenue down the toilet you got to think about schools\nYou got to think about infrastructure and we're talking Twenty years down the road right on money that could be made\nOkay so you so we're voting no on three you know on why for knowing why gambling Noel laundry\nIf you want to expand it gambling in the first couple of years sports book in the state of Florida estimated to raise over a hundred million dollars and the seminal should have sports book right now oh yeah I U.S Supreme court said David built on they build out the first casino with a sports book and I go out into the main bothered I\nTV's let you got to remember a lot of these amendments that we see this November or put together by the Florida CRC\nThe constitutional revision committee which meets every Twenty years in this one was led by Pam the which bond the weather channel and who've been cool wow black skinny hard and they met up in Tallahassee only\nTwenty years to put constitutional amendments on they came up with over thirty and they said you know this is going to confuse people so let's bundled them we have bundled amendments half of them have already gone to the Florida Supreme Court and taken off yeah but you can't bundle amendments like this ...\nBill of rights for victims sounds like a good idea right we already\nHave a bill of rights and the state of Florida when it comes to the victims you are notified you're told when they're being bonded out you're told when they're being parole and you weren't do restitution so why don't we need another one what it does nationwide because this is supported by a millionaire out in California who is trying to push this nationwide now shutting it down our throats\n... law basically takes away due process talked about that sometime you bring him in here for about due process\nIf you're the defendant if your the defendant it strips you of due process and they bundled into this amendment Marcy law number six\nThey bundled in let's stretch the retirement age to judges to Seventy five oh if you want some Seventy five year old guy deciding your fate and your future\nRead these bundled amendments they're illegal they're unconstitutional bad huge you the only one I like is for give felons if they serve their time their voting rights\nI ... I don't know very bad medicine and now now my opinion\nOn this uh as far as ah Orange County is maybe not Disney gives I've been on a Disney cruise and they don't have gambling every game I buy universal to open up a a an adult area\nLike the planet Hollywood and don't they have like a ... casino out and\nYeah but even if they if they put one or two properties on one or two places on their property that we're gambling\nUh establishment said oh man I Would be fantastic yeah but you let me tell you the state of Florida just average things up\nRemember for years when it came to expanded gambling and this was before Charlie Crist made the dug a very good deal of state of Florida with assemble Indians\nAnd keep in mind at that time the symbol Indians were holding us hostage they said look we are we going to commit eighty billion dollars in tax revenue to the state of Florida if we get this contract Chris sign that people were pissed you know the Indians could have said OK screw you\nWere going to the department of Indian affairs in Washington and cut a deal with them\nWill give Washington aid on a billion dollars and not the state of Florida Charlie Crist is hands were tied he had to make that deal with the Indians and you got to remember for years the state of Florida said it's a statewide referendum which we're looking at here with us your song three which is a nightmare\nAnd all these para mutual the dog tracks horse tracts they're constantly losing money and give a slot machines give a slot machines in the states said no and then the state finally said I'll tell you what do it on a county wide referendum you go to the county voters and if you can pass it by certain amount we'll let you have slot machines\nLake County which is Naples Fort Myers\nSarasota kennel club Jacksonville Orange Park up in Panama City borough is that track all voted for slot machines overwhelmingly right Florida said yeah we kind of changed her mind on that can't have it now really a Supreme Court ah\nSo you're talking about up and up a free lunch the state of Florida is what we saw with medical marijuana\nI don't understand why they're so against the gambling I mean you have to look ... look who's in charge yeah but I what I'm saying is uh you you I mean look who's in charge that guy was\nThe only one I like is for give felons if they serve their time their voting\nRights I ... I don't know three bad medicine and now now my opinion on this as far as\nUh Orange County is maybe not Disney 'cause I've been on a Disney cruise they don't have gambling ... gamely by universal could open up a a an adult area I like the planet Hollywood and don't they have like a ... I Would get out and yeah\nBut even if they if they put one or two properties on one or two places on their property that we're gambling uh establishments man I'd be fantastic yeah but\nYou let me tell you the state of Florida just average things up\nRemember if it were years when it came to expanded gambling and this was before Charlie Crist made the dogs were very good deal right a state of Florida with assemble Indians\nAnd keep in mind at that time the symbol Indians were holding a hostage they said look we are we going to commit eighty billion dollars in tax revenue to the state of Florida if we get this contract Chris signed that people were pissed you know the Indians could have said OK screw you were going to the department of Indian affairs in Washington and cut a deal with them\nWe'll give Washington eight billion dollars and not the state of Florida Charlie Crist is hands were tied he had to make that deal with the Indians and you got to remember for years the state of Florida said it's a statewide referendum which we're looking at here with us your song three which is a nightmare\nAnd all these para mutual the dog tracks horse tracts they're constantly losing money sent gifts slot machines give a slot machines in the states said no and then the state finally said I'll tell you what do it on a county wide referendum you go to the county voters and if you can pass it by certain amount we'll let you have slot machines\nLeak county which has Naples Fort Myers Sarasota kennel club Jacksonville Orange Park up in Panama City ... was that track all voted for slot machines overwhelmingly right when I said yeah we kind of changed her mind on that can't have it now and then the Supreme Court ah\nSo you're talking about open up a free lunch the state of Florida ... we saw with medical marijuana\nI don't understand why they're so against the gambling I mean you have to look ... look who's in charge yeah but I what I'm saying is uh you you I mean look who's in charge that guy who seems like you'd sell his mother for money he added\nThat he uh he seemed like a guy like yeah OK away I don't mean one of the west and what do I get a perfect uh I don't know I I think that we're probably in this day and these are probably getting closer to it but we don't want to get a sucked into voting for the wrong thing but look how many times they do that\nWith the amendments remember the solar him and met a couple of years ago that was actually sponsored by who Duke Energy to that would actually halt all solar in the state of Florida we're called the sunshine state we should have solar tile panels on every home every ...\nI have some solar in my house and it's amazing what it does I mean they should get a ... effect of it you know you if you go vote so I mean there's a guy who works here I mean nobody wants to put out there but I Know I got him back all others hustler man he's he's doing it right All right Slater thank you yeah ... ... and I told you
