about\nThe same as the either the giants we can all rich and gently all of a different kind of thing too we also I'm trying to sort of it the giants\nIt would have to watch that yesterday ... it was it was tough to watch I felt I felt bad for ya\nI for you know I just I feel bad you are deserves better but he's not playing well either so I honestly I Hope I Hope they trade them\nI was just going to buy a home in New York\nI Hope he ends up in Jacksonville I really really do hope because I Would like to see could he do it if he's not running for his life\nBut I honestly feel like I watch them play and he's like a quarterback will be TST like even when you like even when he's got time he's got happy feet 'cause he's afraid of getting hit I'm not even making jokes I'm being honest\nAnd I'll be honest like he just looks scared and I wonder if he could give them one like give some team\nThat's on the boat like like a Jacksonville veterinarian she's having a crab season for their built when now I mean they went to the sea championship\nGame you know and they'd be built if I remember correctly so they went to the AFC Championship game they're ready to put their problem is the ... but they haven't even line for\nMy just one that I Would love to see them get it because I don't want to see 'em well then who you want what do you\nMean the giants who do you want it\nDoesn't matter anybody from Ohio either going to get killed you have that\nMeant that you have to have someone you know killing hide you over until the ... you know what I mean we're just going to just be quarterback free just random you got to handle\nThe oil the young kids ... experience I don't know do they still have Web nor the Web is now one of the practice squad for for the jets yeah or they got Carlo letter but they haven't dress them yet so how most I I honestly don't know it's rough for several weeks there\nI'm sure there are like I think um yeah I Know you kind of like\nThrough teddy Bridgewater out as a wide receiver like once or twice as much but um [noise] we have um [noise] [laughter] well we gave a ball 'cause it's a disaster or New York a disaster\nA true of our lives six okay what's going on\nI'm Hi how are you good how are you\nI'm just fine I Want to tell ... she has her sports teams talking talking about ... like he's a relief pitcher\nLike a backup quarterback backs only job is to come in at the end of this and when the game that the quarterbacks job is stepping in and for the quarterback of the quarterback not doing his job\nAnd that may mean start in the next game that he is the best person to lead the team\nWell see yeah no I Know what you mean and not just because it just so happened to be in this situation yesterday was the end of the game but what I meant by his job is that he does step in like you said in and and clean up for the for the first quarter back and it's not doing so well but here's the thing is just like you said right now\nTo come in and if the Cuban one isn't doing his job\nThat doesn't mean start that means coming if you'll be one isn't doing his job so that's the opposite of starting\nTo be one wasn't doing his job I Know homes and well that I mean we've got to be when a chance to see if we can do its job\nYeah how many chances do you give him before you just say you know what ... it could be one kid should not be ... to ... should move into that position\nNot money that you don't want ownership and management and the coaching staff have to stand back and say okay which one of these guys that gives us a better chance to win on Sunday yeah not about the franchise not about who's getting paid what who gives us a chance to win\nI understand that it's mostly if this team had any kind of shot to make the play offs and I'm Sorry and I love I go and I even tackle box before the game started\nI'm not anti bucks or anything but I've I'm able to look at it objectively and say that this is not I'm not like fan growing or anything the team is not going to make the playoffs so then you have to start making decisions based on the future\nOf the team but they can go on to run and the three and four you make it sound like the giants and the one in six\nThey're three and four but look horrible they look horrible ... Khan wins in the back no ...\nI haven't watched every down but I Know those first couple of weeks when fitzpatrick was and now they look good and then I Know we had ... game three that's it and you hope that one I got a bad game\nBut then you walked in if you if you watch just today and you watch the way that game change it went for Patrick got on the field ... change I agree\nAnd they they look like uh did they looked like they wanted to play for ... Patrick versus maybe not so enthusiastic about playing\nFor if I'll give you that so it'd be gives you the best chance to win why wouldn't you think he should be the ...\nBecause he he has to be one now add add it lists on the roster\nYou you got to go by that now if you want to change that or whenever listen I'm not management or whatever that's one thing but the way it's played is to be one goes in if he throws boring exceptions like he did obviously\nIt's Patrick comes in but you you have to realize he Patrick\nPhysically impossible to keep the taste I Wish I Would have saved a sweet but I saw out of all the games ever played in his career as a backup mostly by the way and not for a reason I think it was that he'd be starting somewhere he's had and I can't remember the exact numbers but like Seventy one intercepted he don't plenty of interceptions Annette plenty of life is\nYou know would be phenomenal right now is if he's driving is listening and he drove the radio station\nWas love design molecule getting balls [laughter] does you walk into the studio whatever anyway\nCome on come on man yo ...\nFriends we [noise]\nThat and all that [noise]\nJak on one one good driving\nOn a nation as usual I actually\nAgree as a as usual hijackers\nBut anyhow as far as I'm getting ready to call people soon as you can make a I guess ... Sunday could get caged setting it ... the ... over that and ... yeah the book out into just a Vegas today\nAll depends on which way they want people to the ... but if people to Green Bay port seven and a half you know\nYou touched on with over it and a lot of will also really upset about it but at the end when\nOr how many homes as that happened with a last minute field goal to though ... we would have made it or not may come on man you but we were so\nConscious of spreads and stuff like that would play I mean do you hope to players play the game where it's supposed to be played in Moorhead they don't have the spreads and do what they should do now or fantasy thoughts in their head\nNow if you told me somebody ... somebody found out that girlie um bet Green Bay for seven and a half from now we got an interesting story\nBecause they're more likely to like one of the guys on his team about what a lot more like this don't run on the on my fantasy team relies on your [laughter] I mean it is not something that could happen you know real life\nI'll play that gives you an fantasy drew me why are they are just really don't have to make it up these discussions what\nWould I be shocked that had been certain situations that goes on ... ... absolutely not I Would not be shocked right\nYou know there's jokes about their fantasy team overplay it if the wrong guy you know it's all in good fun you know they know what ... what happens all the field right you know it's a conversation about\nWe got a lot of law and we'll take a break a will take some more of your phone calls\nIn hundreds of ... on one or two five Seventy seven five seven nine to five for\nTough time with a\nLoved one forty will do\nThe guardian below he maybe for magic on his way no monitoring so grave with a robot comes in the opposite [laughter] Roger J. B. what is it possible\nWho is it\nI START I start Jane but that's what I Know I Know what\nI yeah I Know I asked you go on to your head who gives the box a better chance to win right now\nOn Sunday ... okay okay\nYou buy the spike died will start Jamie ... I don't see James means loss instantly like everybody makes I ... I think he could\nWin it based on when I saw um you know at the end of the game or whatever I totally understand people you know I'm and freaking out or whatever but I think ... can win at night if anybody has even looking at in college he has been palate James Winston mentality is such that last this past Monday ask them off\nHe's going to combat guns blazing he's going to come back I Will show this town I Will show them what I can do that his mentality if he goes to the gym I\n... a big if a school's cork online too with a ...\nA lot more to this was Clark [noise] uh I saw at half time [laughter] oh fancy\nSurely started the second half and we'll see it happened [noise] you know a ... a fifth to do was on board with silver spoons in his mouth\nMemphis Patrick I yeah\nI get on my nerves that it's going to have you on line three\nThe middle of a survivor\nWhatever [laughter] I don't know [laughter] why are you always [laughter] he was no less informed than the other callers another topic so somebody can be you knew he\nWas up to no good he's not Clark Mm no I Know are clogging like take a long drawn I didn't need to become a Casey line three go ...\nHey guys how you doing up\nI just want to say you know wanted to keep saying this should be one and franchise quarterback shame which had his face lift off the side of the stadium because if there's all field or you know the ethics and the here's no longer a franchise quarterback Philadelphia but was you have to earn that like to be to be one\nAnd make mistakes and these were given and he's liberal earn that he was making the mistakes you scratch Seventy one turnovers and forty eight starts if he's not doing that job\nYou've got to put the guy in there that the players want to play for\nAnd the thing is what you know you got to win games and you've got to perform and Fitch has performed better in\nThis she's in up to date and yes the part\nThat's legit\nNothing that's just me but nowhere [laughter] Mm Mm pretty ... Roger J. P. what's going on\nAnd you guys are two things one or when you guys are talking about the professional players playing fantasy football it really resonated with me is what because they were doing but we don't want to [laughter]\nWhy do they even need it [laughter]\nExactly I mean it's like okay I mean what is it fair to the league pay\nDon't if you win compared to what these guys are making in a year\nI just didn't think that well I Know I\nWonder if they're all playing one of us all NFL players in a plane is ten thousand ahead is just kind of a burning in hell you want\nIf anybody found out they were playing for ten dollars and that is going to the gambling they will be thrown out of the antibiotic\nOr not yeah [laughter] I'm On a\nJamieson fixing front\nI'm Monica being a bills fan do you remember Frank Reich\nYes I Do and he never started because he was a fantastic back up and I love 'em to death\n... what makes a fantastic backup\nFaith me right you got your congressman and we make ridiculous plays and you get crazy yard and you do you get bring them back to life when you know to be one isn't doing it and and that's when he and I said I asked her does\nSo what this can't be one supposed to do waiting game right absolutely\nAnd if James doing that\nUm I don't we were just talking about that I don't know since he's been back and won any I don't know ... having you tell me\nThe looked like it didn't go well you're the one one he must have one one because they got three wins and they only want to if it's\nBad for brain when one and he and I was Clark and I'll quote unquote Clark and that he that James should have been pulled earlier I absolutely agree with that\nOn and and I think maybe the box probably got a one hopefully on his hat or came in and did what he did at the end of the gang um but you know that that's the powers that be and people have to realize these people you realize it's not going to be just ... you realize that hunters invested a lot\nAnd you know ... ... it's all tied in and if people put a lot into James Winston any if he knows\nHe might not be the only one people you're prepared for that\n... well you have to you also have to look at it and I I have a friend who was made it to the NFL as a quarterback played for Minnesota for four years couldn't cut it and they cut ties um any place here in Florida a Christian Ponder great kid he couldn't he just couldn't cut it and just because you're a great\nCollege player Kim table doesn't mean you're a great professional football player and I think he was a great guy but he just can't cut it is an NFL quarterback wrong with that there's only one thirty\nSix of them in the world that can play starters and sometimes you question whether or not they can all do it\nAll right thanks Jeff you aren't you are right I've been doing\nThis with Frank right now he's going to the Cold War which is the calls exactly I Love that I absolutely love that let me ask you and he was with was on the super bowl winning silly a Philadelphia Eagles I'm Lesley plainly there was also\nOn and how can we predict how calm\nIf he's so good and he's in the ... the man how come no one of the other thirty one team's want him to start how Comey in ours and now\n... well number one who's on the contract and I'm going to hold on he's on\nThe contract so they can't just go grab them of course not but I mean like when they get all of them but what are you saying you know what\nI'm saying so great what they're saying is they feel like he's the best option for the bucks right now that's what they're saying it's a very\nLow when he lives and nobody's comparing the Johnny unite us out Rogers Tom Brady or any of that stuff they're saying right now with what the books have\nThey feel like the fitzpatrick gives them the best shot that's what they're saying and and\nAnd do it and do I don't that's the funniest part too and I want the bucks to when I Do I cheer for the box but I'm not hobbies emotionally invested in the same with the bills so I don't even know why I give a crap like why [laughter] why even bother me with its bad like are tragic or whatever you\nWant to get help because you love him you really do underneath everybody runs a little bit of its magic there's always a percentage you there's got to love the guy for coming in doing it because\nI hate to love them or I Love to hate them or something yes it's one of those deals only hate watch them\nI think I have [laughter] you do that\nThen you have to watch it and it turns of the loved ones rolling you yourself for it\nYeah and you go back and healthy are critical Davis I'd lie to what's up\n[noise] hey how are you guys doing Monica I Love you but you're constantly contradicting yourself your chair to say I'm not a moron and say I'm a bills fan and the same circles\n[laughter] that works well [laughter] so I'm not sure if\nI'm going to call it right now there's day October twenty two thousand maintain Monica your new name is more on it [laughter]\nTo make the day but that is not the first time I've been ... so bad or go all the way back to ... eleven for that I think [laughter] oh I think ...\nIs already [laughter] [laughter] my\nMom was going to tell you my friend's son started Wisconsin this week starting quarterback\nOh good for her now I'm On my kids have been\nAbout five minutes ago when my other guys on radio or father would only got ram oh no no I'm not going to open my now my\nNorth of the Latin northwestern didn't they\nYeah they log on the field he was like a cool to see somebody ... somebody you know ... you know I saw the highlights I was like oh do you started yeah well that out there and more than I ever got more lively but\nIf you guys like me with ...\nIt's like watching someone that you you know\nAnd it turned out really you know what I hear some of the kids I think for me\nI feel like I'd be like don't hurt them you know what I mean I almost like not knowing anybody\nBecause it's too much emotionally\nYou know what I mean I I don't know what what's wrong with that I Would be afraid like don't get hurt\nYour watch them in their pros watch 'em go do their thing of ...\nThat concludes the sport and without the program I don't know if people get a little up if we talk about sports for too long so\nWe shall move on to law\nBut that's alright box and it's very emotional\nRoger J.
