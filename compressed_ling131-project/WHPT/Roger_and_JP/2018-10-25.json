big time after nine eleven I Russian and American lives and if the nine eleven it got popped including tax fraud right but he's got a deadline to White House officials\nAnd B.D might I don't know if I should believe it when he says this looks like an amateurish job maybe like what he said it's just it's so amateur the way it's done you know uh there's a there's a lot of just\nWeird things they do the way the packages mailed a so amateur like if you wanted to be effective back not the way you mail a bomb for example I write it doesn't make a lot of sense the way the sweat so\nI agree with that right does it make it if you were going to send a people a bomb and you wanted it to go off would you just send regular mail and we were talking about using audio plan what they use it gets there yeah how many people are involved in this\nThing on on these little we're running that you can tell and the reason\nPeople that do that want to use that came out because they don't want to come face to face if anybody and they want it\nThen they put like to look for in fact that's how they they don't want to go into how much did this way how much of this call right now they will just kind of touched on it and they can just drop it on land versus having to do in your Patrick an actor and right when he was a mailbox on the corner yeah they can just play that crap kind of hard to China and had it in there without anybody thing there a\nWhile he makes a good boy he did say uh the the extra pressure\nUsed to being Joe said that he said there's no way this person isn't on video it's a matter of finding it\nIf it's like you're talking about ... some random mailbox they have to go through all sorts of ATM machine videos and other videos just to have a random chance of coming across the person that yellow powder level into that mailbox and figure it out if that person but this is why they have the FBI and that's why they have investigators so maybe maybe the fault\nI Would think it would be where\n\nI Would think where it was processed would come into play because they all had Wasserman as attractive the return address right on but when you like if I send something\nFrom the post office by my house it'll have Oakdale I live on ... going to last a stamp or whether they all process at the same place\nDoctors to CNN was not post Marc writer I think I heard a couple of them are not post

GAPP man if you\nGo ahead oh good would HBO ... it's ...\nIt's the best written show ever on television\nIs really isn't a western yeah yeah I'm actually getting western\nMan that's not a west and they combine the most beautiful Victorian English with the most horrible modern profanity that you can imagine\n[laughter]\nHaven't been off the air for like ten years ago and now you're all caught up to my two thousand five after that I talked to her house [laughter]\nStuff kept me alive overseas man you can't there's no TV unless you want to hear you know what I Need\nTo do what you know or and over\nThe Sopranos is probably the last season the last\nShow that I watch from beginning to end that didn't lose me\nI find it right now I'm On billions right now billions hasn't lost me I'm I'm way to get us goods wherever there\nBecause what I find a lot of times is there'll be um shows that I like and I'll be all in like the first season I Love it I Can't wait for the second season and then by the episode three of the second season I'm realizing OK it's the same thing over and over again and I only make three seasons\nThat Deadwood apparently there should have been up or but they didn't it didn't make it or whatever reason it was a big ugly problem than\nThat I knew you left India right now\nI was in I was in the former Soviet Union during your major and so it really gets you on the line\nThat I had a lab that does your little logo don't they know what I mean\nI'm really not good man\nI mean it's funny it's a funny quick line which\nUsed to watch the recall if he's not president it's hysterical but he he needs to have something in check have anything in check check him out\nFor your wreck yourself a wise man wants that\nBest part is river he says that this ... this morning he uh let's see tweeted early this morning hours after another device was discovered it Robert De Niro Z a restaurant\nA very big part of the anger we see today in our society has caused by the purposely falsified an accurate reporting of the mainstream media that I refer to as fake news it has gotten so bad and people that it's beyond description mainstream media most clean up its act fast\n... capital letters exclamation point so he's\nBlaming base with all this stuff on on them that there's a lot of anger today because of them I mean that could be part of it it could be or could not be an all part of this but like that's exactly what you're talking about was behaving and all of us banding together to stop whoever loses and then he goes and so I was saying well it's the media\nAnd then you know Clinton saying that you know it's about the rhetoric about so she's making a Trump's fault and then someone else will make it the Democrats ball and then were\nThen we're not together trying to stop dispersed yeah or people in\nPatently went on it the are the ones to the nearest when [noise] read by his restaurant Quebec and grill I'm surprised you didn't even like Trump didn't have you ever eat and then these are the nearest restaurant grossly overpriced [laughter] [laughter]\nThat grows up here isn't that honestly an explosion would have been an improvement the failings Rebecca restaurant is adopted family\nAnd a ... and celebrate at a you also said so go to the media has a responsibility to set a civil rights away her to have to stop the endless hostility so I mean that was that wasn't horrible and what I mean he's going to let all to get out of\n... and it doesn't do it's not worth it overrated [laughter] good blow it up in a restaurant reviews mixed with what's going on with the bombing he he's not but you know when something he's not totally wrong either you know it was not totally wrong and the media you\nKnow there's a percentage of that that's right but as the wrong time to say it right if there's ever right time you know it it's just like right now we all should be focusing on this like if this was clearly\nA Islamic terrorist came into the country and smell aid package is it about your yeah we're all on America will be together yeah well because like Monica said yesterday now our brain is who did it with the Israeli\nRang he shouldn't have said it was all about each other like the media stuff that he shouldn't say it\nBut it should be said\nYou know he shouldn't say it while he's on the ball would have done it with his Twitter on his hands you know the ... hen reasons that could be going on what he wants to listen now to be just crazy it's not wrong\nThey the media mhm both sides\nWant that division and warn people crazy because that's what gets them to come back so it does need to be said and that rhetoric that hate rhetoric without comparing him to Hitler and and all that other stuff which is you know crazy\n... that does have to stop\nBut it shouldn't come on man that you like if you want Huckabee Sanders to put it out there and and press conference but was she puts the papers down the guys listen here's the deal if you guys think you're innocent and all this with all the hate speech and the and the articles and you know you're wrong that's what it should come from shouldn't come from it\nThen it should come after they catch the guy because right now he's saying why because first of all to media places already had bombs that to them well\nAnd that raises the one CNN one to San Diego Tribune and building or whatever so\nNow he's like listen it's their fault crazy goes you know you're so right I really I got to really accent that more and I mean so so what we send eight bombs down to different TV stations or newspapers at us because of that like that's why you just don't say stuff you don't say anything\nYou you you'd be general general ah statements and you don't you just don't say it that way right now after the guys caught that everybody can talk about why because that's what everyone's going to be asking this guy who doesn't die first or ... or people whoever's doing this right you know a ... and so you just lose weight now's not the right time I mean that's\nA simple that's easy stuff United country don't say that doesn't make any sense so somebody has to come out until it like it is well\nAt the minute you don't and and you were behaving last night and today you're doubled down into just took it to another level you know you did wrong\nYou know Monica is and things which are you know you don't care I don't care\nWhere I've played that these audio and I was literally laughing out loud [laughter] this something cool\nAbout being able to laugh out loud from President [laughter] you know given that you know almost like refreshing because now is like and I get it in the ... and if you want to put them up on a pedestal and I understand that of course\nAll the presidents I think they're all pretty they were all pretty good at making jokes the right time I Wish that Obama was very good at it and I thought that you look I'm behaving is a pretty funny line right there at a time when everybody might be a little tense have you on what's going on but then he took to the wrong place I'm leaving it all of our lives joke here and there was sort of like them to break tension and ... and there are excellent that at all of them\nHave excellent at it and you're one hundred percent right all of that including the Republicans and people are I think I mean but he Trump is not he doesn't

feet doesn't really know what it was a pretty good um deserve to live\n... should have died or did not have a flame thrower handy today die [laughter] I'm Sorry what were you going to say\nSo uh you know this has been a a a topic that headline it's come up a few times in the last few weeks schools on career days or diversity days are exposing kids to\nA more diverse people so in this case in Colorado it's a it's a career day\nI don't know how this works 'cause this was in a career it's definitely a diverse choice of the school district decided to apologize to parents after hosting a drag queen as part of a career day so it's six to eight graders and the dry queen a Jessica ... whore\nCame into Reagan I Swear to God why why wouldn't you tell the parents and a record changer name\nBut what if the for what though ... what was well purpose up to be\nA career oh my gosh people make a lot of money and charming\nThat's true I guess you could I guess it could be a career and here is a of the news story on all\nThe reaction from the parents and the principal and also or you will hear from Jessica Laura\nGoes from students at Rocky Mountain middle school I go through the whole of the building last friday has a drag queen made her way through [noise]\nMedia posted online showed the reactions of six through eighth graders a relative of the student drag queen Jessica will hoard volunteer to be\nKilled I knew that they'll be controversial because that was something I Would never expect to be allowed like when I was growing up in middle school I'm at the same time I took it as an opportunity because I got to talk to a bunch of kids and kind of open up a new door for a conversation\nFor district spokesperson Joe ... who is the school's focus is to have an event that is representative above the diverse backgrounds and careers within their community\nEvery class had one person asked me about how to handle with negativity bullying\nAnd district to apologize for not notifying parent\nWhat does it have to do with Korea I still don't know\nI mean Monica exporting drug lab can make some income\nBy ... at a student who came out to me asking me about diversity and bullying what is it on to do with a career ... and that's what\nWe're talking about science you can be a drag queen as a career and and getting mocked and you know that's not a real career or what what are you doing with your life or what's wrong with your whatever so I can understand both of those\nWhat what does the rear where'd you go to make money is going you libraries parties and yes parties hard if you're going to be hired like Michael ... an advocate people used to do right right right or\nThere you go okay\nIs that really what you want in school for career they all should we be sitting there all along the lines are harder will\nDo what's what if there was a kid in class that is Len during you know questioning himself or herself and not sure about their sexuality or what they want to do or if it's okay to feel the way they're feeling or think and then\nThis person comes up and how inspired you get okay I'm going to be okay this person making a living well what the things I'm questioning right now I think it's amazing\nI don't what is the drug [laughter] one of the drugs were replaced like a dad who was a fireman or a mom who had executive or a ... you know whatever I mean more like career will sort of\nCareers you bring in a well what about that we've had cop to finally come on let's get big outside of the box people about different drag queen or not that far out of the box skip back in the box everybody back in\nThe [laughter] the road that I just I don't know whatever I don't even think and fix the eighth grade and I swear to God I don't think I knew what a drag queen was in the new one day you know\nI feel like you shouldn't I feel like it it it was so hush hush and shameful and that's why nobody talked about it it's okay to get out in the open if not shameful let's not a bad thing nobody\nI knew what gay was like I didn't want to you know you know like I didn't I didn't\nSee it a shameful my ... my sister's best friends with gay was always around the house it was never a problem wasn't an issue with my father like it was never gay was never an issue in my house\nAnd everything that you just said should apply to drag queen as well\nI understand it but I don't either need like an eighth grade I didn't know what a drag queen was a new again was it didn't know what a drag queen was\nI don't know what ...\n... more positive mom did oh\nNo he didn't so to grandma for that matter your grandma was getting down in fourth grade\nLittle John how to make a living will drag queen from corporate gigs decide houses for queens tell us how they work at all read up on this while we listen\nTo the rest of the news [laughter] have you somebody should've known in advance who was going to be freaking then that didn't happen in this particular situation and we'll\nMoving forward one student's parents and CBS for an email saying quote parents are in an outrage and this is so inappropriate on so many levels for Donny told CBS for he felt
