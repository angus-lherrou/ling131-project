I'm going to hold back in time would you want me to I was ... price [laughter]\nWe're we're all three of us are to you I I think the guy said it was the call\nAnd that was his point uh like people who Santa Monica you know and he he gets that we don't have to worry about nuclear weapons and that's not good enough you know what does this guy has to do I think it was the next day so I mean we're not making up\nPretty much I wouldn't want it to me you know\nI don't know why some of you know it's just one of those days [laughter]\nKP I keep it in Raleigh\nWith like a crazy um you know\nI'm old and on your on his on live five drawn\nHey guys no uh no hotdog ... like that\nI'm not yet I just wanted to [laughter] not yet exactly ...\nI just wanted to talk of the fact that you were saying about the divide in the country is for socially goes and uh\nI mean one could argue that essentially that if I had started during the Obama administration and it was just on the other side Monica notice to get out more because she's on the side that's more upset now because currently if it was an office if Hillary had been elected in twenty sixteen I think twenty six Fifteen election point to that divide coming coming to the forefront\nIf Hillary had been elected essentially we'd be in the exact same state that we were when Obama was in there and we probably wouldn't notice it in the mainstream media as much because they would be happy\nWhat's interesting to go to maybe by the\nBy the divide was there I mean the divide was just there on the other you know it was being felt more by the\nConservative Republican far right whatever you know whatever\nGroup showing the name of it but right right through was the one that was more just a franchise under Obama\nHappens there had been a lot of power whatever happened to Martin ... is that exist getting where he was absorb\nIt absorbed by the far right ever been labeled the far right now\nOkay so they just changed the adults got yeah\nI got a call got put under like a big umbrella anybody neo Nazi Tea Party conservative right down to the list goes on and on it's all it's all part right for the\nGuy who who made it all the far right at the far right and so the Tea Party like what do I like but I Would already been saying what's all call ourselves the far right I think it's where do you mean the media labels right yeah see I was gonna end probably\nMSNBC something like that they they might not crazy at our anybody with a with an opinion different that a progressive liberal opinion is French the far right and I hate to say that without being I mean it sounds like I'm not trying to eccentric I Apologize if I Try I said surely centrist or your J. P. U. and I probably agree\nA lot in terms of a liberal leaning a socially but physically you know ... or conservative no but you know whenever you're sitting there and having conversations about people I'm speaking out against uh\nThe idea that a statues and things like that maybe it should be brought up or boat as opposed to just being ripped down by mobs that's now off far right opinion as opposed to a centrist\nWell what about the wall right you know what I mean just just hold on\nI'm sure I'm I'm Down for whatever statues you take it down a new one but up but just people but it's a vote or right now that's\nNot fair minded and do all the way to together for us to look like way too together you guys are also\nLike my favorite show you got the perfect mix so intelligent and she said you know the\n... you know I think clearly yeah well I can actually have\nStuff I think clearly we know who fits into what role in the show a larger got\nWell he wasn't he didn't have the games you know he said James and uh like stories about hot dogs that what you're saying\nYeah I'll go masturbation I Believe and Monica ... paid the\nDebt right on the debate you got one day but we'll see right on the town\nWas coming down Wednesday night will be the Thursday and friday brought it will be the uh show or the punch on hopefully we'll have some other stuff\nPlanted under John ... let's\nI Walk into some customers houses is just unbelievable you know they\nJust immediately hop on one thing you know oh have you seen this and they just want to feed off it and go and go and go and go and go\nYou know you try to stay out of it but that that's what I really think it is\nVery or talked only\nAbout ... oh yeah yeah oh it's unbelievable [noise] is it a little evil you know you see it and uh obviously I'm at work so I'm not going to mention it I'm not going to talk about it but I've even had like I have a way that people tend to all my arm it's a political\nKnow mhm but ah like parents\nFor example they're both uh more left side and I'm more rights I did a ... I went had lunch with my mom went to and she saw the tattoo and even\nShe hopped on a political part you know why would you get that why did you get that you know why do you have to be so political it's a political but pretty much getting ... it's in my opinion that's where the big thing is is nobody really wants to hear anybody out if they're Republican it's only Republican you know what I mean there's no other way if their democratic it's only democratic there's no other way\nThere's no there's no more needy in you know you have those\nAnd also that but also would you agree ban that not ... I understand what you're saying and there's a lot of battling around but not all Democrats are Democrat\nOr nothing and not all Republicans are Republican or nothing now I'd really like to meet in the middle\nI'd agree with that but uh for the majority I'd say it's it's the opposite you know another big thing is the media media is um at least you know it's it's exploded everybody is stuck on one thing so as soon as the media says it they they they hear it out another thing also like I said I'm twenty three result\nPeople my age a lot of them they don't even they want to be political without learning anything about politics so if they\nIf they were around the majority of Democrats and they just assume their democratic and they don't learn anything about it and they just voted Democrat their whole life the same thing for the Republicans you know they don't learn anything about it they just they just kind of flow with the ocean and that's not doing any good as well I think you know everybody everybody should vote if you're able to vote\nBut at the same time learn a tad bit you know don't just go in there and a Democrat Democrat all the way down or Republican or Republican all the way down like I'm In Florida and it kind of ties with a lot of the amendments you know um you hear a lot of people say oh I'm just going to I don't know anything about the amendments shortage is going to vote no on everything\nWell what does that really you know you know like I spent I\nAh I said I'm not joking men like an hour last night like a man and this is that and I'm going to the source and that's the worst and\nI mean it's boggling but at the same time learn which had been about it you know I think that'll help\nYou do is you know what it is though a lot of times they don't want you to learn about it but it's true they would much rather have in in ... uninformed voter politicians would much rather have uninformed voters just vote on party lines\nWant it's right there on our website how's it going to miss and what do you mean they don't want you to do that's right because I wanted you to know they'd put it out there they wouldn't make it a pan and they asked to find it all out ...\nExactly and just like the uh what they call him to legal eagle asked the dawn said uh they put it in such and such\nLegal terms in political terms that a lot of the people that you know they start to reduce the debt and I'm like okay I don't understand the spirit of all your eyes and then yeah\nExactly so they just go right over it but um yeah I mean that's I think that's a huge thing people need to learn more about the politics and tried to find somewhere where you will meet in you know I agree with some of the things that's on the left side say I'm I disagree with a lot of it as well\nI'm somewhat open minded you know\nWhereas men with maybe with 'cause you're right people cannot lake you know in the other side with the anger and the insults legal once you stop calling snowflake or the other people stop calling it you know racist or whatever stop with the name calling and stop with the aim their\nName and get to like the actual point like you said to learn about going to stop and get to the point I think you're right I think that can be a middle ground\nYeah no I agree I agree on\nThat I mean yeah that was pretty much it I'm a I'm Still going to get one of them talk channel called call later [laughter]\nGood luck [laughter] that would be the one guy the money\nTo twenty three year old got together that's perfect\nLike I don't care which side you're on if you say but I'm open minded like us to this whole I mean you could actually talk to each other and be like this one I think well let me wrong but you could actually maybe find a way to fix\nIt let me ask you a question yes that hits home yeah your daughter Kelly yeah do you think she can see\n'em right at all\nOr in some cases yes but I didn't have I talked to her about in so long I have to see him go and she is\n[laughter] yeah by\nGod I mean just seeing one died and she's she's intelligent girl she she should be able to look at both sides whether she has any tolerance for it I don't know right because I have seen only very one sided things from her for a while\nI was born in ... when I ask you specifically in LA 'cause I feel like anything that comes from whenever you talk about Kelly mhm Mm it's that whole hardcore lamb stands yeah yeah she's not a you know that\nI agree I'm I'm lean relax some time and I I Want to see I like people that are on the left I don't think people\nWhat are you saying you lean left sometimes yeah lean learn do not know about you are left\nYou all up and on and then I mainly may dip you into towards the middle every once in a blue moon\nAnd they didn't do it [laughter] you know [laughter]\nI might have in mind that I I Know I I'm an independent I like to look up all is I just had right now in this point in time I'm seeing a lot of laughter is right because you're right it's kind of driving me crazy by\nIf I can be this way and see that I feel like you've got maybe you're on the right don't give the people on the left enough credit to be able to see both sides vice versa\nHonestly who this man and your brother too low right you know ... that's why isn't earlier that the amount of money you'll people whoever China hats is crazy why why he says here in the ...

... that it would they have right I'll find\nOut what I Am at Yale airs\nOn HBO next man so much information are gonna be able to find out I Would assume that we have the video technology and they use it all the time 'cause now they have a space so now the computer search of every video camera that the government can hack into ... at some point of the pie he'll pop up that\nCould be ATM machines can be anything is is we have so much ability to look at everything\nYeah you know it was loving this one if I were to Megan Kelly she couldn't have gotten right unless you're going to\nDo with that she couldn't and then Charlotte a better time [laughter] and I don't know if you're going to\nDo something as your theory goes to get out of the contract was still get paid and then not have to deal to up with too much of an edge storm cause something else comes up\nRight oil was perfect you know walk away\nWith the fifty million that they all her it turns out they were paying are I think twenty five million dollars a year they're going to oh we're roughly fifty million on the last two years ahead deal and like she's going to get all of it she's going to get all of it\nMm every dollar sure it's a yeah she's going to get all of it and as long as she can weather the storm because\nIt wasn't\nListen blackface is bad but the way she said well you know from what I understand what she said was when I did it when we were young it was in ... um what was the word she is I don't want to get this wrong like it wasn't that big a deal or something along those lines are lost their mind\nAnd it wasn't a when she was when she was a can or when she was younger it was not a big deal to kill\nRight um I don't agree with her on that but it's not like she came out and started throwing the end bomb around or whatever it is I I think that some I think that statement is something that she could bounce back from my real she's going to walk away with fifty million and a job somewhere\nAnd whether it's back on Fox News and she had\nBeen wanting wherever she didn't want to do for everything that I had read she had wanted to go back into knew she wasn't happy doing the today show thing and to be honest with you kind of stuff that I actually got no reading she didn't get ratings in she screwed up how many were ... you know happy\nAgain\nNo I Do but he was doing a show with um Ron halls and I had I was like I had some ratings and urban is the big wigs and she comes in and she gets no ratings and he's there were ... like ... we had you know we have something going on at least you can\nGo and do they finally J. P. and laugh at it like college\nYeah oh I think the two of them are on the far right away she socks absolutely clear about her she's\nYou know who she can walk away the another fifty million she's going to get it and she's going to end up with a job she's going to end she was gonna when\nShe's going to win because they they let her go they weren't listening they were looking for a way out they got their way out and she wasn't happy there because she wanted to go back and start doing news again she got out with our money she's going to get out with the money they got out of having a train wreck of the show and she's going to end up\nDoing what she wants to do as a win win per\nYeah let's see if she makes the whole come back though to make no so isolated because back in like a year as a new\nShow on whatever network or no I don't know the cable special yeah I think she'll end up doing news again I think you'll end up doing it probably on fought back and Fox News or something they might open the you know welcome back with open arms after a little while the door gets the dust settles\nShould've been positive where she went head to head with Trump yeah it was her I mean the reasons you rocketed up into people's minds right and be an anti Trump in his face type thing Motown good yeah she's straightening about unless you're going to have a ... but I mean I was reading through what you said\nI yeah I can find the exact one better off I don't know I'd love to watch I watch the watch the whole video but the whole Senate was white and so's Jesus thing as interesting\nShe looked like she said that you know as long as she uses a Mrs [laughter] this is\nIs that for Monica does that just happened because I have another young but did I did okay I don't know if I call he\nWhen he was on ... on Wednesday and and um I don't know and it's only buy\nA new shooter is you'd apology but I didn't know she said anything about than it was white so she\nShe got all tear it up and apologize and in her audience gave her a standing a gag nation and then was like I'm done you know I I did my you know responsibility and then Wednesday at that that was Wednesday and then yesterday they were like\n... like pulling applied they're like no matter\nWhat you'll love this quote by the way for all your kids watching his whole sense of justice white but this person\nIs just arguing that maybe we should also have a black sign up but you know Santa is what he is and just so you know we're just debating this because someone wrote about kids okay wanted to get that straight Jesus was a white man to\nOh my God you know\nThis is very interesting [laughter] so choked like yeah\nBut he said something like that and then you get a new job and people take her seriously does she lose any legitimacy by by saying something like that\nAnd the image of this other she wrong we like Jesus was part of the world's largest rainfall about what was it and I never walked into sort of in your eye level we're going to a church and so Jews with an afro\nBut he got tired of the world where all what he might have had a slight can\nWrite write or say he was ... brown skin or ... or something that you know what I don't know if anybody really knows\nChannel so that's gaveled down that road allegedly been down that road was a senator or whatever yeah magic of doing that are there you go away on rolling with that one had around Santa is whatever you picture a mass exactly right [laughter]\nI was going to do that precedent is wanting to talk about her story goes around as you're talking about like it was just like dynamite stuff like that well because we don't have our include contracts does\nMm isn't that something well as she gets paid the whole thing

you can put it down and knock out the but you know hold on the money I'm like why he's talking these people into going down into getting a mortgage five percent this is what crumble bus\nKills people is typically more humble ... this is what exactly was rumble or how to be left alone like\nYour Hawaii money among here we go again right this guy's absolutely trying to show these people they have the money to put the twenty percent out yeah they have the mansion and keep it he's saying hold onto your money you can get into that house but just five percent down why would you want to give away your carry on ...\nBecause he must be getting more commission on the bigger the nut that he's struggled loaning out ... right\nAnd I'm sitting there going to myself I Hope they don't fall to this ... I Hope they don't vote for this and that what I'm saying well this can be\nThe only people he's telling this new and he can't be the only person who's giving this advice right and I'm saying\nAnybody learn from the collapse of the financial yeah along came from bad mortgages right all of it\nBut that's off what people see like ... interest rates are like three or four you know what I mean it's like everybody will say to you like free free money it's such a low interest rate why would you put all that down in the house when you can have the other money you feel more secure and then you can buy the blood but like I said\nBut then he says and put to rest down after you ... what's going to be left when I left the way down to the house\nWhen I Do and when I bought my house I was I had one of those mortgages that was the reason why everything went\n... 'cause I bought a house that\nYou know that ended up being a lot more than we were prepared to spend at the time because they were able to get me into it and I did it and they're like yeah well you do this and\nYou'll have a mortgage but you also have a home equity line of credit or how long that's going to be interest only so you don't have to worry about getting into the principle that your monthly not will be manageable and blah blah blah blah blah\nAnd I fell for all that right I Love your bags to get an a right and then you know fortunately I guess my income and you know have risen and then I was able to refinance ... and ...\nBecause that home equity loan was that the er at adjustable rate mortgage was along with the whole Michael you know like one of those it's yeah it's you know it's that such and such for a year but then it goes up after that whatever craziness\nAnd I'm saying to myself I didn't know what he learned but nobody wanted to doing it again so what you're telling me is the punishment ... fold that old I mean it wiped out financial institutions that were around for a hundred years or even brought has gone right how many other one's gone right to Bear Stearns got\nWiped them all out and here they are saying that will do it again [laughter] or\nThey're just made a guy that guy wants to make money to the bank wants to make money they all don't care right\nSo that that whole too big to fail thing\nDon't really got the point across to the banks were you know okay they there was some ...\nI don't know dude I was just sitting there shaking my head gum mother I mean I Can't believe that doing it again\nHorrible like the rule or something like\nYou're supposed to put down twenty percent and all your mortgage payments should be like twenty five percent of your take home right and if it's like a third you're gonna feel pressure but if it's more than that you're really going to feel it right like this there's certain like basic things you could do that to understand and so this guy is probably\nPromoting that they put very little down and take on a huge mortgage payments right that is going to be forty or forty five percent of their income\nEither horrible here he doesn't care 'cause maybe they'll come back and look ahead to try and refinance and they'll get paid again\nYeah come back on line one what's up man\nHey hey how're you doing that was going to tell you one of my friends worked for a major banks down here and uh you think that's bad what's coming the buses coming again because\nShe was telling me all about the car loans that she does\nAnd people's that to income ratio right now is worse on average than it was in two thousand and six and two thousand seven\nAre you serious and the whole yeah worse in any way worse far worse yeah\nAnd I mean we're the type to go we have no loans always that every day ourselves\nBut what you're doing is a waterfall it's getting worse than it was an old southern and this is coming from [noise] oh go ahead I'm Sorry\nBut no that's right that's all Carlos you're talking about Rick\nTurtles and mortgages she works in the uh again I Can't say the bank\nRight just Twenty years later and what are we are\nThere she has been pushed so hard to read what they called go deeper which is why loans for people to have horrible credit\nOr you know bought her a lot of credit ... we don't we don't have a credit\nAnd the ... will turn around and the banks will turn around to the federal government say you told a filter out lending money again when London money again and that we're doing is that betting against it they're showing it\nOf course wants to make sure it's true yeah mhm because as to why she's\nRight this two movies to watch that I literally will ...
