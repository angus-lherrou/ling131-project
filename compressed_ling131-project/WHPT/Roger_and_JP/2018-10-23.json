I did me\nSmall yeah it would show [laughter] you know what it was a little bit of teamwork reality you know the audience getting involved in helping us out and\nDoing good work and you know may have to be your uh system yeah you're a new a private eye agency may be may be ... what was his point point he was dreaming of running an Instagram account in place of us like 'cause we don't habits we figured he would just do it\nAnd I just said he was trying to think of what he was saying he was a crap head [laughter] you're a big ... just say crap\nNo [laughter] do you think I Would have said crap [laughter] try the FCC friendly here right so what do we do with it now\nWell oh I'd like to hear his story why I'm interested what he was planning on doing with these go why he's not going to tell you the truth well maybe he doesn't have to live maybe the maybe the truth is something like what I was just saying or whatever\nEven if it was where does he get the ball's\nGonna ...\nWhere did I mean where does he get the balls to\nDo something like to have you noticed a long time and yet at the same thought process is caught to open it up in our name\nWill call but it worked out with that\nWould solve following people and not even he takes me every ... every little thing not even tell me hey\nI I I opened Roger in J. P. one or two five is there if you want to you know or just transferred over like Carl did right you know Carl how that Roger in J. P. and he just said listen I thought it was there I didn't want anybody to take it here it is and made arrangements Breton boom ... ...\nI think we should have a bagel Monaco was right the whole time party\n[laughter] because why Monica rodeo I saw\nHim for this type of\nAction the time no I saw him I called him out I initially and it's funny 'cause I'll see on a my time hops where we got along initially 'cause I didn't really not you know I was like hey what's up or whatever and we got along famously and the beginning and then I saw him more and more for how he acts stuff like this shady and and\nJust wrong and and and entitled and um he acted like he worked here type of thing and the way way way bigger in his head than he is in reality and I didn't like it\nAnd I you know what I think every show has one listener those Early Show as the ones we have a couple even call himself or external producer yeah or I could learn\nOn the line and you talked about our show\nMy window and had all those when we need to be there\nWas All right I mean can you know you're not he's not he is now but in the past he has done it in a more serious way right by far no question I don't understand is that what feels like he's part of our show right\nNow we do and we love 'em ... you know we love 'em and help them out roam out whenever we can but\nBob ... showing signs of this for a very very long time and I get that you guys are you know they're so maybe you don't see it as often or whatever but I I'm frankly not surprised at all\nYeah it's a fine line between being like just a really cool fan of the show and then when you step over the line to other stuff it gets a little weird sometimes and I mean you know\nI for one love the passion people have for both of these shows are loyal as amazing but there's this little grayish line that sometimes people don't know the stuff\nThat's the problem right there that there's a line an hour to explain that some people that that most it's a lot of people I should say on having their head they know not to ... they just know it's it's a it's a as an etiquette thing as a decency thing I don't know it's just a thing\nAnd all the people I run into are amazing I ran into the nature of the wing house on Saturday before the bulls game and he was he was like my God I'm like what [laughter] and I'm like I was hotter than you know I don't I'm shorten loud I don't know\n[laughter] it's\nLike I wasn't here did he ... he loves you guys name is pat good guy and then he let me go [laughter] his name is Pat Pat kind of guy and he let me go about their business and even even the table a little bit later or whatever but\nThat's awesome mhm you do the dishes and it was the only through my kitchen window [laughter]\nThere's not a guy and they're right there in that environment [laughter]\nI don't know I just I I see this I've seen this coming for a long time\nAnd then I wanted a pizza and there was one guy bleeding in my driveway and somebody else delivering pizza\n[laughter]\nWas it was probably got the good guy was just a little blood on his head [laughter] I'm not too long that he's the reason the ... the other guy was bleeding though I Will say oh you can't sue managers maybe like our troops are going to buy a car and he was just picking up pizza to help finished\nThe deliberate like ... the good guys you know teamwork makes a dream work at all [laughter] maybe he didn't originally run over the years ago [laughter]\nMine Paul Hi Pat [laughter] he's like turning off the radio show hope he's listening because he said he listens everyday\nThat's awesome that's really not sure go see about at the White House that's very nice of them yeah and it is and you were in your mentioned things like the law and the maybe balls a crossover whatever you you risk\nUs sound and just like we think we are too but there is a certain feel a certain expectation of a show privacy or something that and Monica you know you I mean you got this most people don't even approach ... of crossing over like that like stick in an Instagram and whatever with it\nEven people who don't like me on at least and and they decided on nearby to like you know I don't like Monica by you know blah blah whatever you know I think has their own opinion on whenever there's nobody ever crosses the line I I really don't know anybody who crosswords ... yeah\nYou can my wife but you still like the show and how to listen I mean nobody agrees with everybody thought I mean a group of friends none of us ... how many of us agree on everything that the immigrant march you know whatever it is we don't all agree on some friends who cares\nEarl adults it's okay we differences of opinion I said it right now I I Know J. P. always says don't make your problems my problems I always say different is OK I'm OK with different you know just do your thing but ... do cross that line now I Know\nFor you okay as different as long as it's okay with me right [laughter]\nYou know yesterday Roger when I agreed with J. P. and ... and then he ... he said I was what did you say oh I did a good job\nI think you can talk to them like to thank you\n[laughter] okay [laughter] that was it yeah I guess it's all it takes\nA much online too has a little ball something ... what are you got there would be good\nFor you good afternoon everybody a bachelor do work for a local company ... and then there was a bar right across the street or cause the plaza from where I work and I met all the global sons in there and he was ... just that overall yeah though\nIs like all my shirt for Roger J. P. and your\nUh your elected as I understand I'm like oh it's going to be off because that's the time of the use of all he's still on that you study it sounds like a really great and then like you know da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da\nDa da ...\nGetting joining sell you a box of rocks that looked like speakers on the outside\n[laughter]\nYeah yeah yeah but you know a girl to go to Mike\nBut I don't know anybody alive or whatever it is\nOne of the structure to the extent that he was in a\nLife like that's what I thought it was like it doesn't sound like you say that a lot of friends out here that are in law enforcement\nSo much that doesn't sound right but at a bar a little conversation\nRight you have any I mean he's he comes from a family that it costs but he was a cop\nRight right yeah figured maybe got up and they're\nAll right uh dies well as far as I listen to so much richer but you know that marijuana\nSo there is I mean there's another example of him what putting yourself out there as a representative of us you know TV you're going to design the T shirt and they got jobs seeing\nHim for what\nYet like when he always a lot and he's always been this way it's a exactly and that's and that's your choice if you if you as long as you realize all that he's done and everything like that and how he actually acting like an act of that that's your choice do for it that's all good but just don't I I go with your eyes open yeah why don't you got to see everything\n... or ... million didn't tell them I guess from the beginning you know I was I was just\nOffer them from the last time he called in and he started he he started coming at me about something um Mm whatever it was and I got pissed off at them and then he sent me a tech he sent me a text message the other day man I haven't heard from you so much that that a lot on the other day I was drunk and blah blah blah blah blah I'm like don't worry about just don't be stopping the deck you know\nI'm really freaky trash you'll do you'll do why you'd be in and day out of all fits balls don't be a problem [laughter]\nMeanwhile she should to all the time what does balls singing a song about any nobody there but you say to all the time well you know\nThen you're going to get it at ... thanks sorry I stepped on the line I was trying\nNot on because if he didn't he would have wanted to get into this conversation if he was listening\nOf the math is mindboggling water every my daughter and\nMy daughter came to me she's struggling with math oh he's doing great and everything else she's having a very difficult time with math and um as did I as a mother I looked I sat both of my kids down and said you probably screwed when it comes to math genetically you\nGot a rap Common Core even is that now I go back and kept me sane\nWhile I take the common core stuff out of it it was just based she's just not grasping the concept through and um she's look come she came to me with it I go I go do you listen I become a few things on the answer the problems that cute [laughter]\nI Wish I could help you I Can't I'm awful lot it while I'm off last specially fractions and she's in chicken fractions in word problems in this that and the other thing I tuned out by the time I got the first picture of a number nope can't do it [laughter]\nI Can't I Can't do that I live over to my friend\nJulie came by friday night and ah I said and Julie Julie Julie nerdy smart ... and uh I enjoy the hobby with math and and that's why we had a rope and Julie sat down and have the math I was like thanks to oh that's awesome\nThat's great I mean maybe get her little mastered or something but I'll\nProbably ... I said I don't know that there are Isabel has had no idea what I said listen if you need math tutor by all means we'll get a ... I go I Know I had um you know I had plenty of mad because I saw that math\nTo so good at everything else why not just go to the ... Michel feel like oh I get to know\nRight they'll show she's running into walls got to go to is just doing the extra help stuff too good figure go that route first before you know\nSo so she had on the one to figure out how many number combinations are the mega millions\nYeah she's not going to she's not going to be a mathematician at MIT that's pretty much gone\nYeah yeah I was a I was reading about like ways you could like help yourself you\nKnow don't like don't lean on the numbers one to thirty one which it all comes down to his otherwise you ought to share with people 'cause they all use birthdays and months so everything's run through thirty one\nPeople you know dollars I Know it's not well I Do\nIs just one point six billion so let's say you went in and you know Thirteen other people have the same numbers ... nobody got a yeah so but maybe you wouldn't even have to split it three ways you know what I mean\nIt's about your structurally pork\nBut then there's then there's other stuff like don't use the last winning numbers were mega millions because if you use just one of them you only have a third of a ... a thirty three percent chance of winning random you only has one and if you used to have the old numbers from the last time you only have a four percent chance so like that's what those are those like some adults I guess just statistic to argue with the statistic\nIs there's no don't take you ten bucks to go to seven eleven give me ten dollars quick and you hope for the best or have your dreams you pray a little bit imagine [laughter] you know\nThere is one do that your number should not be underneath from one hundred and thirty two total of the five numbers it shouldn't be underneath a hundred and thirty two over two hundred thirty three cars that means you've gone too far to one or the other ... if you'd keep it in between\nYou can give them between a Seventy percent chance that you're you're you know Seventy percent of the numbers are between those two and a one thirty two and two\nAlready on board is that correct I Can't do it did give and take a quick\n[laughter]\nThe last one in the in the seventies so sixty oh I don't know actually I don't know I have a new idea\nYeah seventies or the one in the bar to go to remember the one that\nGoes into the seventies the um [noise] what's the one where you sit in the bar and then they'll you know well it's kind of like ... what do they call it you know I Know the ball Shaw closer off of it yeah yeah Hey Mike online sex with men\nAre you guys great shows so indeed the break down this morning about possible whether it would be possible and then when something like a just quick numbers was like six hundred and five million dollars worth of chicken which are to win but then once you win\nA you know suing nobody else can you just went out right it's nine hundred and something million I'm a lump sum payout but then like forty percent tax cheats you'd have five hundred and eighty million so it's a needed ever lose\nEither way you don't have one at this point if you don't have to take the lump sum payout\nWell true the it was just going you know basic that especially like on it if nobody else one what happens when you split that now you split them up right away is right if you you know somebody else without it\nSo it might the thing is if you don't take the lump sum and then you take the payments which means you have to get your six hundred million back which will take Twenty years to get it\nBack I tell you what kudos kudos the Gallagher who's doing that mass job\nYeah it was pretty interesting but you know I I don't know that I have another Twenty years I Need to also\n[laughter] so we don't have or whatever million here's what I pretty much guarantee if I if I took the lump sum Mm I definitely don't have another Twenty years I if I Would like to get over Twenty years or thirty\nYears however long it is I feel like I have something to live for\n... but if I get that kind of money on one shot I'm a dead men walking ...\nI'm a dead man every single a lot of people and how he's single one of my vices will become creeping out from the closet Mm every will do wrong things will get in their life go upside down every every skeleton I've tried to bury will just come in the body [laughter]\nAntonio's uh I live three of donor you got a little math for everybody got\n[noise] um yeah I don't know galvanized the maximum self or not um the way it could get a definite number is ...\nI don't know how there's a New York to Florida if you look at the back of one of the tickets or you're selling your own numbers and actually tells you all the odds of winning that where they\nUm they don't want to ... you know\nYeah I'm I'm a I heard the memory hundred and twenty million yesterday\n... what I look lifestyle from the past and I want to either there we're seeing the Powerball and to make a million are making millions actually has better chances about twenty million better chance those and I believe the number was like one and two hundred and\nSeventy something million was their chances of winning law and for them to tickets cost two dollars each Monica under seeing now\nSo um yeah well I mean\nEven if you bought that many tickets I don't think he's really a profit after the taxes and everything\nOh you're right now we're just we're talking about you know why can't happen products of toenail and here when I was smarter than everybody else [laughter] well I mean there's something a mechanic slope and trying to think about this stuff and Sean five grand showing you got some\nYeah it actually does it matter what the previous numbers work 'cause it's a ... each one's individual sample size so correct it doesn't matter what the past majority of the same odds just saying that playing lower numbers of higher numbers are getting in that range doesn't actually mean innate thing because it's\nAn individual drives so it doesn't have any better or worse thoughts\nRight there's no difference technically but if you look at the history that's how it works that's how they got those numbers is that's what follows you know
