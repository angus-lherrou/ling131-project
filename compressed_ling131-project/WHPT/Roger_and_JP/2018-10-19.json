I went to Fox has one time for an event didn't cash and then or even locally I just I'm just not catching a lot\nA little bit here and there but not a lot and it's kinda like after you win big it happens that you read about all the time\nDo you think this is the happy it'd be dropping twenty five hundred to your own money\nUh yes you do yes because you feel you're brought the breakthrough yes I this is like a tournament made for me so that's good why any by the way it also it's a tax deduction for the year and it helps out why is it made for you or the way it's set up it just made for the way I play it's a I don't play nice long patient\nAnd a and the level will be not a lot of people don't know what they're doing it will be mostly people who know what they're doing which is good\nThat's our that our side as he bought her while I don't know what they're doing\nA because people don't you you can't even begin to predict what someone who doesn't know what they're doing is going to do and it it can be fatal because there's no way to deal with someone like that now they're generally not going to win right but they can make their own cruelty people up on the way on but I don't want it would be the one who you know the steps on the mind right that they set\nNow a bad habit or do you get up and be like you know what you get [laughter] you know I never do that I got a nice getting good luck really yeah all the time I just standard it's like I have my number one I get my\nLike Bush move and knock you out you'd be like you really do that\nYeah the the most ... roll my eyes you good luck [laughter] and the guys who knows like Iran or has a you know what are you going to do so and at at this level generally somebody just doesn't walking which would have already not knowing what they're\nDoing have you ever been at a table where somebody pulled a Bush league move and knock somebody out does the rest at a table pounce on that guy for being a home sometimes yeah\nSometimes it's sometimes it's got quiet for a little bit and then the next day on somebody's play like oh I didn't knock somebody out with six three you know whatever those aren't making comments that a guy right or whatever it is we'll start making a but not nothing like super me that's happened to everybody and everybody's done it solves everybody's been that guy before and had been knocked up so you get it\nHad there been any anti bullying rules that have been added into the poker\nHall now there's plenty of that there's plenty of that people get into screaming about just sometimes sometimes they get separated penalties it happens swimming penalties guys you get like ... you can get a a penalty for all round or were you catch that at the table with your chips you just get them taken away as the cars go round you know a anti some blinds oh really you can get one round penalty and get a three rounds federally you can get\nA level you know whatever depending on how pissed off director of the deal or an finally get a three rounds at all do you use bad language do you go after somebody you know anything physical you're totally I ...\nI dropping F bomb at the table and I can get a one round penalty\nNot always what if it's directed at the dealer and the and the director hears you or whatever and they're like you know or if it was maybe the second or third time and you pop at all like they'll take him to\nGo take a break [laughter] which is a little contentious like that\nOn fire you probably get a penalty I probably could happen you don't see I can I get emotional is a lot of money\nI can sit here and talk about listening to you like to ask questions and talk about poker\nIf I went to go watch it I think that'd be there for three minutes but I I think they were playing this very quiet lawyers holding a chips by people talk about it my friends used to get together all the time that's where I live on\nThat's the way more fun but we'd be plain stupid non Ryan and and right from the money opposites you are absolutely right it was all these things are our guts and and uh\nWhat was the other one's fun and how many guys play on Friday nights with their friends like that but as a whole thing but even that I'm like I Need to take my money get me outta here like I just I get I get I get very bored very quickly yeah\nYeah so I started to tell us when we used to hang around this we have to picture of us like the nineties and it's one kitchen table we'd all get together all the time were playing dime quarter of fifty cent stopping drinking and having a great time who lost forty bucks you know what I mean we've got a great time you know winter blues forty bucks is pretty much what it was maybe\nSocialized World Series that was his biggest which is a lot of fun\nUh what are you doing this week I'm going to go through your I'm\nDoing well you know what they're all sitting down [laughter]\nSaturday is going to be a little bit of soccer Sunday is going to be a little soccer all a little field hockey can try and get a little ... and beyond not sure if I'm going to be able to spend\nIt on to stop this but those who have gotten to be ...\nOut today to clock when I got to be my son's school for his uh his circus right when the uh a little Chinese yo yo routine these are just they're not going to go to the gym that I got to take him to practice and I got to go to the dog to get into all while my wife goes out and has drinks with a friend\nOh lord she has her eye as she's probably going down to a whatever whatever man whatever I don't judge us quite a weekend now we're open at school\nAnd we don't monitor the course of college football tomorrow in an F ...\nHandling of the game to morality hunting for the\nBall all that's rough oh\nLooks like a narrow came through for yeah you bet there's any man on a charmer Sherman on line three what's up man\nYou guys have it out of town and I love the show a picture of what you would think I'm a commercial boat captain and it kind of pretty much ruined recreational outing did it you know the same way you\nPlay poker you get together with a guy like oh I bet you\nKnow a kind of wrote it not so often what it used to be the greatest and I'm like\nWhat you would never you never really got together with friends and play cards before you before you got into\nYou know that's what I was just talking about back in the nineties I pictures most guys oh yeah yeah I Know that my buddy and a lot of those guys who was you know four or five times a year something like that was the guy who do but I I there's just no juice it any more it's like All right All right it's just not fun\nNow if he's not in the basement of a VFW with the threat of multiple arrest\nJust not a good time [laughter] yeah you're totally right out of the savings and rod what's up\nVery much appreciate it very very little room but especially day why can't you just referred me truthfully David on line going negative\nBecause I don't need you another hundred yards they learn to what's up man\nI was going to say on our guts guts works is that everybody gets three cards it's just like records poker you want the best at what you look at your head as it did you decide if you're going to go and the dealer counts well into three drop\nAnd then it right you hold on right they did you if you drop your or out let's say if everybody drops and you stay\nIs that you got to play the top three cards off the debt right teach you you match the plot\nCorrect correct rice and the animals go about what happened was we we'd be playing with like you know sevens and\nTwos while good right now when you got three while although you know you're not supposed to do any kind of wild card when that but\nThat's it because it's on king because what happens is that's the way the path to get up to four or five hundred bucks [noise] everyday life\nWith people what would you what did you lose to win you lose to the ... the deck that's what sucks yeah I Love the show up the\nLate ... and then you would have the it would be you against the dealer and it would be like two hundred and eighty dollars in the pot or whatever it is and that whole room was ruined against job solo era and especially when you're playing with multiple wildcard you never know what the hell happened to you ... you know you lose their like\nYou\nKnow you will to eighty five sixty and everybody's in right right right right\nRight and that's part of the four Monica you ever play like that never play cards like even with your family\nIs not even not even for pennies and how long now in areas that are really\nNervous I don't know how you doing especially like I find interesting Roger is you're still on good with being responsible about your money and what do you mean and making sure you know you're not with the Mars and all that nonsense I don't you like to you know you know keep it nice and even pertain\nTo go into this money and he just could lose it and it can be on because it could be\nAnd I'm Talking about a ton of this at least one Ninety five out of a hundred times at this system\nOf their hand a lot I mean how do you think that we can tell in your uh\nI don't yeah I don't spend I definitely don't spend above my head adult and in this case I just happen to have the money but I Want in July and this is this is a one shot deal there's no other between now and the end of the year so it's just for this year and uh I'm taking a shot\nAnd if you live twenty five hundred dollars correct you're just like well I guess last twenty\nYeah no I'm told me mentally or you know I understand you know I Want a decent amount of money so for that come out of that of course in in real life it's absurd\nWhat ... what do you I mean obviously breaking even you didn't lose anything but like what are you proud and happy when at the end of it if you don't win the entire\nLike this weekend yeah\nI'm a probably anything six seven thousand or more I'd be happy with ... or I'd\nBe really happy with that I mean first I Want to cash which will be ... like five thousand a little bit of change of double what you paid okay so I'd be I'd be okay with that I mean that's not why I'm going to go there to win it you know but to get that did it to witness to be a head is always good\nYou go in
