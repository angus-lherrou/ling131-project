think as a matter of money right off that along those lines I don't know why would you just I don't even think he's Indian or maybe not I remember correctly a kind of feel like we did a story about

you know oh boy [laughter] so it's completely flippant about twelve hours\nOr an article yesterday that was a then I sent it to you\nWhich I'd say Trump may very well be the most honest president we've ever had\nYes you know it's funny I almost Santa Monica uh-huh but I didn't want to piss or off\nWell it'd be interesting to read it from an soup monitor where you're born of you see what you think of it you know I I just I just about to graduate\nOn ... because the guy would start off the article he goes and\nDoes he inflate a lot of truth to that yeah ... ... yeah and I was like oh it was pretty interesting it was an interesting read to whether or not you like them\nAnd even the article whether you like Trump but you don't like Trump does it matter of fact of the matter is he made all these promises\nAnd he went out and get it while he's honest in that way right for example right he was like ... whether it was\nWhether you're on board with the promises that he was making and wanted to keep Israel lately different ball game doesn't matter doesn't matter\nRobbery you know if you want to break I'll I'll uh I'll pull it off you're going I think it's pretty interesting because a lot of ways you can be torn apart of course\nRoger Jay because once you find the bone real raw radio eight hundred seven seven one one to five Seventy five seven nine one or two Bible right back\n\n[noise] he\nI mean you obviously you've heard of some of these but I have no details\nTrump album has historic tax reforms and signed the first major overhaul of the tax code and three decades he about an unprecedented regulatory robot roll back\nStrict policy to eliminate to existing regulations for every new regulations so if you want to bring one in two of them got to go right ahead in his first year he achieved a a point one billion in lifetime regulatory savings and is on track to achieve an additional nine point eight billion this year\nOr during the campaign he told the African American voters quote what do you have to lose [laughter] I'll bring back jobs will bring species that I'll bring jobs back will bring spirit back on his watch African American unemployment reached the lowest level ever recorded\nAnd his tax reform included a little noticed provision creating quote opportunities zones to try to revitalize struggling towns in inner city communities ...\nFantastic ... ... ... there's a fear that you know that it goes on and wow has been a great success [laughter] said he pleaded to it has a right to try legislation and that's the one I guess the right to try to like always sick you know he doesn't\nI Do I like to try really yeah I think it's just so much why not for people who are gonna die and they have a chance to try a drug that is an approved yet\nThey're adults and they can make that decision why not let them try it if it helps them what's wrong with that right so\nThat's what you said only and it says only in a few rare instances as he backtrack on a campaign pledge ... such as when he admitted that he was wrong to promise a complete withdrawal of U.S forces from Afghanistan\nAnd reverse course ... um it says here but whether you want to agree or disagree is is not the point when Trump says he'll do something you could take it to the bank yes he takes liberties with the truth but unlike his predecessor he did not pass his signature a legislative achievement on the basis of a lie\nQuote if your health if you like your health care plan you can keep it\nClearly worst and falsely bragging that tax cut is the biggest that but it was but the fact is in his first two years Trump has compiled a remarkable record of presidential promise keeping he'd probably say it's the best in history which\nMay or may not paying through that's how am I right exactly I mean it's an interesting it was really I was surprised by it today I'm very proud of myself [laughter] and there's the dangerous for us to move to clean up the other pipelines he said it would happen a drive again doesn't matter if you wanted it to have an\nOwner of the big ones you mentioned the ah US embassy a moving in as real as it was the first one you know I mean that was I was very controversial for a couple of days in the weeks before it but then it disappeared All right so I guess it's not that controversial anymore\nThat's the whole thing was that was the only way to do its controversial until they stopped getting attention for that is not going to find [laughter]\nYou know well I mean that's that's interesting that's an interesting record that's how I Would like to vote on politicians show me what you said you would do what you're doing\nSomebody coming up who wants to defeat Trump tell me what you're going to do and how you're going to do it like it it it'd be great to have a list like that of things that it would be so much easier to decide if you like a person or not instead of listening to your parts of twenty seven speeches in little bits of headlines and trying to make a decision I just give it to me like fact\nMy favorite part of the article he told the African American voters quote what do you have to lose [laughter]\nSick nobody ... I mean that's been a a criticism in the past is like it hasn't been a lot of great help for African Americans over forty fifty sixty Seventy years whatever the number is right and so you know but it but it's a habit where it's just traditionally African American vote Democrat so\nI don't feel out of Trump's market for that but right decades and generations to flip\nAnd it says you know obviously he hasn't been able to get the the two things he hasn't been able to do he says on trade he kept his promise to withdraw from the Trans Pacific partnership and impose tariffs on steel and aluminum he also committed to renegotiating NAFTA and the U.S Korea free trade limit\nThe so boring stuff um but he did it you know he said he was going to do it and he did it sure and it says a terrifying as big way he failed to keep his promise or is it such as building the wall or repealing Obamacare it hasn't been for lack of trying only in a few rare instances have you back ... I Wonder\nWhere where is the wall act as far as being allowed to happen or getting money for spending like I feel like a few times they were like I was shut down the government or if you don't give us the wall or will shut down the government have to build them all but then it's kind of disappeared\nWill never see it if they ... your going to pay for the wall oh\nI'm here now so we'll see what you pay for it that's it we're just waiting on you you got to run a child and I don't I Want to buy it has to go first [laughter] All right so get the test will first and then we'll build a wall Monica why should I Do by Tesla build the wall\nYou build a long and then still get that has like a you know both capitals are expensive and you ... parents\nI ever did I understand how they Rogers and as the money they wanted on that one hundred thirty thousand right All right\nSo G. S. L. rabbi they'll they'll indigenous together and get you know that law\nFor awhile and never happen because we're lazy who you and I oh yeah yeah well that's true we're lazy ones that like we do for you when it comes to the show we'll\nPut it in our our efforts no question mhm but any time anything outside his hopped up ... we tried it once we actually did a business together we did um early early on a very early\nUm for for a morning show it was\nWas it ... it was right before it was right before and then the job happened when I started doing mornings\nOh wow wow right we're out in LA right by so you were still do it after news it was pretty mornings\nYou know where to draw a morning thing was I had a friend who programmed a phone systems is is one phone system trust one for us to type things were huge before the Internet got so big and a reader fantasy football over the phone was that we were doing\nNow with all due in school I was not something I Would do to somebody who was to different businesses um one of the hell is going on one I wasn't involved with which was a school you know the robo calling automated robocalls right right 'cause his friend was a program and\nWe had that idea than before I mean you guys ever get called now it's just so easy but back then it was much tougher day other thing we did is we created a\nI'm a football pool that you can put up on line and we were selling it to radio stations oh that's right that's right so I was the sales force [laughter]\nRight right yeah and I was calling rock stations all around the country and we sold a few of 'em yeah\nWe are raw fish them and then I Belong to go and then I Believe that this whole nine or ...\nI didn't know what you're saying that she didn't work out all Monica I don't remember too many years ago\nI I'll tell you what it sounded like nothing now 'cause it's twenty Eighteen but then to have a football pool product that could go on someone's website it was like a big deal\nRight we grossly overpriced that I think we tried to sell for Fifteen grand and then it ended up selling hundreds of surge right and I'm like fifty so we had no because we had there was the websites radio station website a lot of stations didn't have sites yet right so they ... we didn't know what we were charging we would just throw in numbers that the world to see what would happen\nBecause we wanted to get rich if none of us ever wanted to go to work again [laughter] I don't even remember what your role in it was rather than bringing me in a your money with the programmer sales guy I don't remember\nWhat you did before\nYeah before you came in I was calling stations but what did we do 'cause we'll just see Joan over doing other stuff together that's the thing this came out of what we're doing on the side of the phone system things with your audio right so I also don't remember I was over I remember calling stations but before you were there but then with that and I don't know what we were doing\nA weight problem I had I think we ended up having that doesn't that first year we sold it doesn't but it doesn't radio stations and\nGot a cease and desist or the other fellow was pissed Taylor passed us you can use like an F ... names right or a player named ... ...\nWe weren't even trying to you and your name's color the helmets logos I think they\nProbably or you have to pay us two hundred and fifty thousand dollar what I what actually shut us down what I find interesting is now our rock\nStation in New York ... uses something very similar to what we had back then ...\nBut you
