robots front row going for one of\nThe first of all I don't even want to ask that was that that that was actually face value of the tickets was to forty nine and fifty cents for that chicken yeah so that's what the price I wanted to be bought\nPrize with two forty nine and ... and how well I saw but what I'm saying that you'd be surprised how bad some seeds are adult forty nine of gets used to say exactly\nHow we ... we happen to be able to go forward going up with a couple of you have any really good for which is awesome and I mean it was just ... so great to see a pretty cool I've never seen ... while I have I have never seen it a big concert that close one time I stood next to him as he played a ... that was the experience of a lifetime yeah for three songs good enough or they'll tell you that was an experience\nI was that you know as money you know I always break all balls but not appreciating where we're from\nLA last night and the last night in the area you had Elton John at the coliseum and relate you add eagles the eagles at Madison Square garden you had Bruno Mars at the Barclay center and\nYou add slash doing the club on Long Island and that or see pink Floyd show

you can't take your eyes off you know he just come like he's just this president you know what I'm saying like you\nAnd same way I find myself I can go see guns and roses and\nActors run all over the place you you watch slashing 'cause he's just so pretty cool\nWhat if he had a crew cut know sunglasses and no have I don't know the\nOld saying I don't know I Know that part of his persona when I\nFinished thing at the end there is that he's just so cool you know everything about slash is just\nCool yeah mellow liked playing like someone who plays guitar but he doesn't\nEven that when he's playing guitar he doesn't look like he's working hard right exactly right it just looks like so many pop it in his hand ages knows what to do and he just does it\nEnd he's like I don't know it was just a it was cool to watch that did play all day Ben\nJerry's on the line one what's going on jury\nDuty correctly concert absolutely you've never been to want to have you I don't think so\nNo see the thing is he doesn't play candle in the wind for Eighteen songs on the wrong thing it\nDoes truck it outright and they are finding it really really really gives you don't want any really\nHardy and then he throws in some of the early ...\nUp in the rye ended a couple\nTen minute versions of songs with jams and it's where his problem is he used to be in a a blues rock band with long John ... and he does jams that are sick\nAnd loud and he's just dirty slams the top of the piano and stuff like you don't think that because you think of is Brett\nDid play those don't\nThink that show was quote sick of it was really it was it was ... and ... and I it was straight you know our ... off the train that's where it was his way off the ...\nSay on the radio I Would say the fire and he started to show\nIt\nStarted with many of the judge and it just went\nCrazy from there and then little John came out here which I Believe in tiny\nWhat a retirements or right [laughter]\nYeah average age on

I'm outta here [laughter]\nYeah it's um it's a mixed because it just like Billy Joel is a mix of people who want to sit and people don't want to stand\nAnd uh you know every other song is a ballot pretty much do you see it and I want to just absorb the performance because it's the last one and then he throws and Saturday nights alright for finding the place goes nuts and then you play is home to close the tiny dancers\nEverybody says for six minutes and then he plays shooting for ... leading the place goes nuts for ten minutes you know and so it's a real I guess that's the way he does it but it was just starting to make great faces and he's like snarling and it's so Larry has always been in forever when\nHe says hold me closer tiny dancer just in your head you say home is supposed to Tony there's absolutely no sense of my favorite song [laughter]\n[laughter] yeah a medicated at one time to Samantha Mona a\nSnow job then you know although Jonathan ... wage of caution angel is a

is a choose as old as ... runs like a rabbit or\nSharing quipped on a on the talk while discussing what it's like in their bedroom\nThis is a bone of contention in our house she adds that after thirty seven years of marriage she says she's only willing to do the deed on certain dates birthdays Christmas at this point in my life of the mother said special occasions it's Thanksgiving why not and I'm saying to myself you know watching you don't get the bitch when he's banging the hairdresser that's funny\nMember a couple of years ago she got all pissed off because I was caught he was buying a house or whatever it is like if you're not really having sex and birthdays Christmas in an occasional dies giving\nYou honestly you lose your right to bitch that's really if he's tapping their address or three times a year tops unless you come in Russia for I'm sure she uses exaggerating a little man but I feel like\nAnd I and I honestly and I really mean that like if you shut it down and how can you really get past this is a ...\n... back to the basic biological chemical need in the human\nBody was a couple of should work it out I shouldn't be doing her own thing and he's the one of his own thing well if she's not doing water shows not\nDoing anything you can expect him to not do anything back ... if we listen if he's trying to engage in sex with his wife right and you're constantly getting shut down shut down shut down shut down shut down ... except on Christmas [laughter]\nAnd your ... birthday I'm an example I mean he is he really\nWhat we shouldn't be owning other along because Charlotte is one for thirty seven years you are for better or worse your weather and that's why I chose to go either I saw that and you go to other melted might involve another one of\nMy girls got so I got to sit there and watch it because she shut me down maybe but I ... I still love her you know used to love him very much yeah obviously still with her\nYeah I don't know ... a lot of money [laughter]\nWell he knows her a lot of money [laughter] she may be the brains of the operation but here he is the more cautious yes that's right [laughter] you know she makes her own money with this talk and whatever else he does you know but\nYou know running the uh the business of Ozzie Osborne has very lucrative that's right especially when I was he can barely walk in you shove them out on stage and you know you just deal and people's money\nOr isn't she's ... she's one of the ... ah I've told you I did business with a one time I was like she's Bush rude ... ... when she runs or she is nothing to try that woman is a point right\nSo she's going to do I've been hurt all of their relationship and they ... I mean why she was talking about it to everybody else I don't know she should talk about it with Ozzie and maybe fix it so that he doesn't go back to the hairdresser or something\nSo she goes birthdays Christmas at this point in my life the mother of three said special occasions it's Thanksgiving why not Sarah Gilbert chimed in\nA that Sharon one said she preferred the flew over having sex and the ... top no one that he fills other people Sharon chuckles loan shutting as you go to he doesn't he's a good boy yeah no he totally does it does yeah he totally did he had an affair with the hair stylist and you lost your mind and your daughter lost her mind over it\nBut I don't think it makes him a bad person when\nHe wants to have sex when when when he wants to have a sexual relationship with his wife right and she shuts down right\nBut I mean you run out and just find any court in a storm well how do you work\nIt out you or your wife talk with your wife you or I Would I

talked to us gets closer to you and I both did it yeah it's difficult to have kids clothes and have anything else going on because all you try to do I\nI just want to just to survive ... scheduled point you do when you were like mine both of us is not always the sixteen months apart right right you get to a point and even as they're older now you got schedules and whatever it is you get the point by the end of the day yeah you're just trying to survive\nRe ... you're just trying to survive and like if you have the energy to even contemplate having sex it's good for you you had a really good for you because you're you're superhero\nUp his lawyer then it becomes so then what if it becomes like now becomes out of habit of because of weekend thing\nYou know and then if you don't ... if you don't ... the kids get older that I could staged a weekend thing and it becomes less weekends you know and you don't want to get in a rut\n\nMe\nThat your body of your name's Bobby\nUnless you're going to be a home as you'll be able to land\nA lot okay can you hear me yeah sure oh cool\nTalk oh\nAll right man why don't you give me a break down some counties so give me a\nBreak [laughter] how many beers in all your Bobby\n[noise] ah I don't drink beer drinking um right now or Calvert [laughter] what is it all and it was that a risky All right yeah anyway man hours tall 'cause you're all talking about a\nPeople's ... church out while they were and stuff ... dig\nMy first ... bad it was like Thirteen Years old and my dad took me and a bunch of our my little head banging friends [laughter]\nOzzie concert of all make me too and it was that oh Lakeland civic\nCenter yeah man and my dad stuff toilet paper in his ears [laughter] it was so loud and he kept wondering why why does it smell like burning the rope\nSocial science baseball get a friend of mine put up a host but he's hosting two parties called flip the house parties\nThis is where your son note cards to voters this is a political thing where you actually Democrats are trying to flip the house to Democratic majority this part of the blue wave to talking about where so much by buddy mark is that the two house parties where people come over and they write out postcards note cards to voters in battleground states\nReminding them of they should be getting to the polls November eighth and they tell them like don't forget to vote for blank for governor a blank for Congress to ... percent or whatever\nSo what are you telling me as hand write 'em out and see if I Know he'll let me see if I got this figured out\nYou know buddy mark yes\nIt's having postcard parties grown man he is and what we talking about the things that we are ... really heavily against Trump\nLike pissed every day on Facebook I got I just can't read it every day ... um I've got a cousin in law who's that guy married my cousin who was the same way he's in Austin, Texas he is he's more nuts but that so\nI mean just I mean and I don't mean to view I mean the enraged everyday angry thing is\nSo much so I I copy this and I send us a Facebook post from my buddy mark to Kelly my daughter I said are you doing this because it seemed like a big thing it seems like something she would do sure enough\nShe says awesome yes I'm doing it through postcards to voters so she just wrote fifty postcards to Atlanta area of voters to remind them to vote for Stacey Abrams or governor\nTo remind them tell them who to vote for a with no reason\nWhy this is Hi there this is a reminder the Stacey Abrams a party or democratic dream team working families deserve the two hardest working leaders make a plan to vote today election day is November sixth and early voting begins October Fifteen joined her neighbors at the polls are turned Georgia blue your partner inter micro see Kelly\nI'm surprised who doesn't say a that counterpart on the Republican style a PS two Republican counterpart is a pedophile\n[laughter] you know it is obviously to ah everything reading here is all about getting out the vote and vote early and\nA turn Ga blue for the disparate she's ... I mean she's in Maryland is just so nice to Georgia but it's part of a real a grassroots very organized clearly a looks like rush routes what I mean this is big money organize good job\nWhy not why not ... why do postcards because to me who read them who sent them will read them at that stuff comes to my mail I throw every single out true just me I'm not saying everybody does that you know that's what I Do this time of year I throw out\nAnything glossy [laughter] that shows up at my house and the guy I don't even look at it I don't look at it I don't see what it I don't care who it is none of it yeah nothing because there's nothing in that I'm In that down that piece of glossy paper right hell them anything about that\nPerson you know it's going to tell me like\nThe little shiny things that ... that are going to hell marketing right exactly right so\nHe was doing all of Enron and stuff and are you doing this show and I said the colors that this isn't a template where you're like me color copier zeroed wants to be a color copies ... building in silver which is the opposite you know the person for different states different days whatever it's like nope everyone's handwritten you create\nSo she's doing this and this and this weekend she's going canvassing or that and yet she went she went canvassing for someone here when she visited home and she's phone banking this weekend for the same person from Maryland so she's just you go online she she knows where to go and you could just volunteer to do all sorts of things in any state no matter where you live just to help out\nAnd so that's what's going on and so if the Republicans don't have that going on\nAnd then the problem because it just paying people to do [laughter] yeah that's right they just pay a marketing company or ... you need to go do it because maybe they're not as grassroots I mean the Republicans do grassroots up no question but this to see it and I live from two different people I Know\nIt tells me something clearly has bubbling under and going on mhm okay well let's see if it happens exactly right\nHey look here's the thing if they win it back it's fair and square short I'm saying yeah you know people say what they want Trump won fair and square\nRight everything but both Russia thing other than that right [laughter] right you know whatever that ... well he was just whoever cheated better at that point we should say maybe I don't think I don't even know that in order to have you know as blue\nWins the blue one ... and then nothing happens within the next two years it red wins then bread wins\nWhat has to happen is whatever whatever happens with these midterm elections and the other team needs to shut up and deal with it ... shut your mouth and deal with it like it red wins blue shut up and deal with it until the presidential ...\nElections red blue wins and they\nCome in and they take their power back but shut up and deal with it yeah well and try to change it in in\n... yeah but there's no showing up in politics now if if whichever side loses a individual\nYeah but no one was not going to get to the front line has died but you will drives me crazy now that every time somebody loses the other team is crying that there was a ... you know miscalculation and in the in in the ballots and we got to redo and then this law suits and did that did you lose you\nLose and we'll just deal with the loss it's ducks\nLosing sucks is nothing more writing to me there's nothing more than losing the brush yourself off and you get back in the game and you find the next fight but what if they choose whining that goes along with it after running is just a\nMinute is ... I'm going to matter who loses somebody was talking about how somebody was treated you know whatever the version of that is right but it's just how it is right now everybody does\nPoint and cries [laughter]\nThomas outlawed soft\nWithout really loaded up with all the way he handled out like a politician ... eco friendly it does like Thirteen\nPounds of paper money eco friendly actually is\nEarly I Would vote early vote often bowed Irish\n[laughter] oh it's awful [laughter] running out early vote often vote Irish\nA so there's a maybe that's happening on the right to haven't seen you know I haven't seen it on Facebook or anything so who knows\nA ... a a like rice postcard no I Can't know it'll be a buddy by the time it was done it'd be like the dead sea scrolls being fourteen pages long and nobody would read [laughter]\nGreg has been waiting on line to a ... it'd be what's going on\nAnd you guys are you doing good I'm ah\nI'm just kinda curious you know with all this internal chaos in corruption that's been going on for years and continually get worse when some new argue silly it's going to go in with her ... or somebody else and actually take over this thing I think there's a lot of a younger generation that we're tired of looking left with are looking right\nNow it's time for somebody new to come in and take\nOver you know who knows what may happen I mean ... could become a reality as crazy as it may sound in this place the\nPurge could become reality what's that\n\nComplete anarchy within the country\nWow like complete takeover but by who like are you ... there's no way left and right mix I don't care what age you are not don't seem like they could ever mixing get along\nActually to people may take back the country\n... so do you like can be prevented type taking back the country\nSomething back for civil war days\nWow ... who knows I don't know until we couldn't get away apparently we're gonna make cheap\nBut she's blue I mean there's so many people that are split between the middle and there's so much chaos corruption in April day sooner or later there's going to happen to be a new party affiliated actually if you\nCould just use the same old system too so that you know and that's exactly\nIt and something new comes in and it's it's definitely shake monkey tree\nOr I Would love to see if I really would I Would love to see what I\nI Would love to see a a an independent get in there and and when\nYou know I mean are we seeing Trump who's not really a Republican the Republicans didn't like him at all when he got in I mean he was a Republican in in the Republican Party and when I wrote my books were sketchy on him like for a lot of issues and give them\nBecause they couldn't control him yeah that's why they were sketch you couldn't control mode and control he wanted somebody who is in the system gets how it works who knows who gets the envelopes he knows what goes where how everything is Greece and gets and just plays nice in the sand box the only reason they didn't like Trump was because they couldn't control it\nAn avid he doesn't play and sample and not want to and he knows they all took money from him over the years you know he knows all took money from it so now who's the bad guy I remember independent\nI remember it was the um one of the debate and he looked around at like\nBuddy that was that everybody Republicans and Democrats you he was like you took my money [laughter] one guy was like not me like you're the only one everybody\nHave nobody to examine nobody can say a word that was one of the eight medal why you all took money from me right all really rich [laughter] I remember when I was a great example\nGuys because realistically Trump you know if he was either party affiliated\nIt's only going to take another billionaire come in there and then what happens all the ... ... like you said he's\nNot a politician he came out of nowhere no one ever really expect that I don't think he even expect when right well and it's not always the first guy comes out of the woodwork and put it under a hole in order to get fully Asian\nWhile he happened yesterday see news which has happened yesterday Michael Bloomberg um he came out he re registered yes he switched back to a Democrat I Wish it would have stayed as an independent and gotten mix because then it would have been interesting\nMm you can pull that went off now you've got now you've got something behind your thanks for the call Greg yeah but he would back over the Democratic who wants to throw he's been okay you know he wants to throw money around money around I don't want to take a dime I'll go up against anybody and I have actual morals\nWe'll see what happens when an independent who's more polished and ... got the lingo down and there's not a politician comes through\nLet's see how that guy or that woman does you know that will be made the second or the ... type of thing yeah quick he was he picks out right there oh yeah it's one I\nI totally think it could be I think optical woman getting into president is totally the way a lot of the country do you have\nTo watch the didn't want to watch the Joe Rogan special you\nKnow I have not yet I got I got a bunch of his caucus to my phone but I have no listen oh you're talking about comedy what about the new the Netflix about mhm no on the top of my thing\nI really think the woman who will be the president of course she get this thing up as nice as bad as the guy had you know every guy that lit up why couldn't a woman as it up\nAnd or make it better or largely butter on him but he was gone for comic purposes sophomore didn't really work with orange line Steve is on the line three what's up Steve\nHey guys great show as always in a yeah JPEG that Joe Rogan specials on it was very funny wasn't a great\nIt was good stuff and all they did on WWE and all that I was kind of cracking up about doesn't seem like he cares about what wrestler sanctions that fight\nRight exactly [laughter]\nHey I'm I was calling about that last caller about the courage I think that in a great way to get rid of term limits what so many senators we have a twenty four hour perch and whatever happens happens that\nWhat does that mean that means they don't care to since there's horror\nMovies that have been out now that it's called the perch and ... years twenty four first or the gods ... and you can kill anybody you want for twenty four hour only crap\nYeah a great movie really sounds very ten yes like I wouldn't enjoy helped get some people getting ready to stress\n[laughter] how do you get rid of you know [laughter]\nMm oh I see that that's where our cultural probably don't watch a\nWhole game called political all like oh I see\nWow it's a little more intense version of snack upon location and when you kinda like punch a politician and the case\nMay be a little national bunch politician back right has a little more intense than just a little\n... national punch a politician day I still think we can get that off the ground with enough work Mm maybe we can get some people to do um [noise] we can get some people together and have a you know punch a\nPolitician parties all we can [laughter] can write some postcards to people you get well card so I thought just become funky punch a politician postcards\nAnd Lincoln and send them out there and then you know get the word out the tech\nFinally Steve is on to another Steve on line for us to\nPay Roger JPEG Monica it's nothing more wondering bread and be a solidly ... a ... and it just listen did you catch the clip yesterday\nOf a little clip I guess stolen jewelry or on their worlds apology tour ...\nI Know they're not apologizing or anything I Want to know who in the public speaking thing about the bill\nAnd Hillary was still relevant to\n[laughter] I don't know what they do and we talked about that I have no idea why they're doing it mother was a little money was

candidate that she will come up\nWho may highly ... Yankee ... well yeah\nI don't know they're saying now that she stepped down because it was an investigation about her taking private jet flights right about that\nIf she if you knew that the truth was used up or not 'cause they're gonna wherever and run for president wouldn't you float that out there I don't know if it's true or not\n... I think she got an extra day\nSo you think that the Republican Party pulled her out of that post to get her to run against Trump\nI don't I don't know the public in a ... I think she had something to do it and saying you know what this is like ... daily but he's going to\nShut little ... ... I think I was overly\n... who knows who knows why should resign maybe she'll make a little run for maybe she'll be VP about Trump's next four years run and then in four years after that maybe she'll be the candidate for president who knows yeah and ... those are the really strong she could go for Democrats she's really\nThat we'll see what happens you know ... and\nThanks for Republican body is that what you said mommy and Dan online too and I will tell you will get into that guy go ahead then\nOf the five films [noise]\nKnow round you in a piece on one of them do five\nSuffragette guy in the long run a little late with the second Monday Wednesday and friday usually around twelve scene but we got involved with discussions today I've gotten the guy's name on a very Bernie I'm a loving to figure out who he is so here's the clues you have so\nFar ...
