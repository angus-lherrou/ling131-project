did that one time well who who have\nShown that every time [laughter]\nWhen I'm you know what do you have a good time yeah yeah that was [laughter]\nYeah no not ... after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico Donald Trump came to Puerto Rico and all he did live throughout different though\nOh that's where the ... yeah yeah yeah\nWe'll see you know Frank [laughter] hopefully has people come up with something better for him to do in this uh devastation and throw paper topples [laughter]\nBudget they floated Floridians laid the\nOutrage at the fact that if he would do that here and uh yeah but uh I I feel like it was it emphasized and now when it happened in Puerto Rico right that\nWell I I don't know I felt like I saw it everywhere but I mean you know maybe you're right I I feel like I saw him throw up all over the place right [laughter] constantly you will see\nFrank let's see what they do it'll be interesting to see what they haven't doing today you know [laughter] there hopefully something more a\nSubstantial looking I don't know what that means you know shaking hands and talking to people who are the most meaningful thing you can do I can\nSee them like being at a food kitchen just like sporting food into and then just like getting bored and they've taken like this spoonful sweet potatoes white and just putting right somebody's face [laughter] having a good time in

uh\nI watch and listen I always think of what's up I'm just thinking about a ... come and do a you know check out the or the hurricane and on top of the people\nYou know the way I look at like ... ... it's a presidential should do because it shows the passion only now and I I understand that\nOne thing that seems to me that the way I Am not to try to be me about this but the way that the liberal agenda seems to me is that they just changed the call post whenever they want to and a compassionate a very good singers show it's it's an extremely good at\n... did a\nDesigned guitars\nNo nothing related to a singing you to do with his early stuff and then his big occupations are viewed as that didn't relate to that it was totally separate\nFrom that was the occupation did he go into politics\n[noise] no we did not a Bryant on line three hey Brian Rodgers J. P. what's going on\nA much more I guess a trade show\nSorry Mason outlined five animation\n... nobody's just a real jak on line six\nOr yes was his other occupation in the food industry\nNo it was not in the food industry and\nSo it was in food it wasn't an entertainment at all was it in politics it was it in medicine right but yet it and made headlines yes\nIf they were acting in entertainment right when the an actor\nWriter but he was not an actor was he a writer did he literally make headlines\nAh no [laughter] I Know you didn't literally make the headlines\nHe made the headlines are both in his occupation and then when he died and occupation is what made him a super famous um\nHe was accused of crimes but was never charged given that clue accused of crimes but never charged with your wife guy he was not\nNo he wasn't a gangster type ... you know I'm\nPart of his life just get accused of crimes here and there and uh they never just never had enough evidence to prosecute him so he was never brought up on a ...\nAny of those crimes have to do with this career\nUh\nThey happened while he was a in his career they did and and the big screen and all that as it happened over a bunch of years things happened here and there but they never had proof enough\nIs it is it the type of career that would normally bring fame with it\nA big can\nNot always it probably that career there's probably less people that are famous than our but when you're famous your big\nIn the career he was in when you got the fame you could be very big painter\nHe was not a painter know\nYou could be like television big you could be a local\nYou're trying to dig already big didn't zero entertainment and he had worldwide fame\nOr no he had a national thing and it's not it's just that it's not have to take a Hooper on line one where they got over\nIt or a\nNo no no nothing like that up to seven five seven nine one or two five eight hundred seven seven one one or two pop you want to ask us questions tried to guess\nWho did that guy in the ... because I think if we get the Korea we got I got it will definitely help no question if if the if not totally nail Catherine online to\nSay oh first time caller longtime listener right um my guess would be it that they had something to do with computers\nNo now with computers\nOr what his career have put it on our vision\nOr\nIt could have if you got famous enough because you go to maybe gone to the point where he was on TV but I'm really the headlines in the end is the only reason he was on television the headlines about for his death and then what proceeded his death that kind of thing um but he didn't become before that famous on TV but\nHe was well known and a\nPopular your voice out the timing\nYeah you're really like a pro European creepy that's happening voices are sort of a ... three Germany\nWas he in broadcast journalism\nNo he was not sorry Ryan alive for\nLA or did he die of cancer\nNo we didn't [noise] other clue he died of gunshot to their head\nSelf inflicted possibly not sure it's hard to tell\nCould have been self inflicted could have been somebody else it was chaos was you know when I heard all\nOr no you wouldn't describe me my written should stop but he wouldn't describe him as a writer so\nUm it was chaos when he died of gunshot that had a drew was ... that might help you uh what\nWas he in the fashion industry\nNo no no\nIt was chaos when he died so yeah it was a chaotic situation and that's why they don't know if he shot himself\nIf somebody else shot him around him was involved in the political conspiracy\nUh\nIt's not that he was involved in it but\nWhat what he was involved in the whole thing might have become a blue ... became a political or controversial\n... the conspiracy up say or it could have been ... could have been was evolving Kennedy\nWas not no I live in a light on\nHow you doing [noise] [noise] oh yeah I think ... lawyer\nHe was not a lawyer you know\nOh a Jeff on line too I just\nSay well gosh uh issue to lead the branch to videos\nYes he was David Koresh\nDavid garages the guy in the very good very good yeah so obviously he was a preacher a leader or\nCurrently wanted want to call him and uh when he died it was possibly by self inflicted gunshot wound or it was one of his own people or with somebody from\nThe outside in the FBI or they don't

I haven't gotten to a point where smoking we drink drinking but then he started smoking weed and waiting for\nAnd his ah his stock dump yeah\nYeah I assume it's this this podcast worsened which we'd right but I haven't gotten to the point is is happy and I didn't get there either a ... go ahead darn\nHey guys love the show uh yeah you guys were talking about the law not banged up my favorite part and that whole interview with Joe Rogan is where he is like my efforts for a few trial I tried to warn them like yes very alien is\nOn right on artificial intelligence is talking about he had all the governors all the government is in ... in one room and he tried to warn them about an artificial intelligence and he goes they just don't want to hear it they don't they don't get it\nYeah and he's always point was ... they're not going to take over but we're going to hurt our each other with the artificial intelligence is Jose I might be fine on its own\nHe said but what man does what it is what's the problem is going to be and it's already almost too late if we don't like nailed down regulated within the next ten years ago ten years on the outside it's going to run rampant we're going to destroy us\nNot in ten years but it'll start the process crazy\nRich are guys that are going to thank you really and you believe it because he's so darn smart he sounds like he knows exactly what he's talking about he's researched everything he knows what's possible because like flying a car is not going to happen not possible or really\nHow about the ... when he started digging holes that was about the boring company we just started to go home [laughter] because it's so funny like when he made it goes it goes just the whole the whole one of our life [laughter] and then we go\nOh Jay Jay's on the line to judge you heard this bar God\nI Love this this topic is great man Ala mosque is probably the most interesting man on TV Internet however you want to or it might be doing what it is I get off for a traffic Los Angeles all sold mine did you watch that part yet\nI just listen to it on a podcast about how you make tunnels on the ground and you can go ten levels no problem deep you said you go to a thousand feet will get a little warm because I don't recommend anyone to ten thousand people you could write and make tunnels because you can only be a traffic anywhere in the world just by making tunnels underground me now\nI mean what what what it looks like he actually got videos out of the tunnels themselves and he said that they they look like pillars earthquake ... this is just shut yes level stuff\nBut that's what I'm ... and that's a rogue and I said well what if there's an earthquake like at the same as a uh it's the same as they during a hurricane you're safer under the water than than than opposite right at the same thing if there was an earthquake you'd be safer and I don't\nWake surface surface crust of the earth so the tunnels are down below he goes you never even know what's going on earthquakes with the surface just shaking yeah through that all over there\nAnd he's doing he wants to use magnets and then so you have magnets against each other so it just creates the forest is creates a space in this thing just zips along\nOn the other ... that's the underground trains maglev yeah\nTalking about he's talking about that but also that's the type of thing you would have underneath because he said you could put it on wheels but you really want to do something like ball bearings are magnets for the underground tunnels to get rid of all the traffic Los
