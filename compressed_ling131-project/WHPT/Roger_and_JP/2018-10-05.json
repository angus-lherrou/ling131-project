I was a kid and we did some you know freaky stop\nAnd I remember ... that way more than the live about it but how do you know he's the one that I was growing up your mind is not an everybody knows that was trying to combine that with move and with all the other stuff that's in your book and it was the\nMain thing that this is the third telling me on the helm up 'cause we use that as you know when somebody goes like this would be they make like the OK sign you look yeah and that and if they say okay so when we were kids we didn't\n... [laughter] that I don't know what if you look in your book or not if I got to like move\nHe's a art I think anything and you say it's All right yeah yeah\nThat doesn't mean that can be you know what I'm saying I I I don't know I don't know what kind of business you know you have different phrases that kids use when the kids I listen to the here's the thing none of us are there none of us know what the truth\nIt is and what is the truth\nNone of us you know what I'm saying but you can use any of that but you can either believe a monopoly them but just because you don't believe in doesn't mean these lying\nAnd just because people don't believe her doesn't mean she's lying\nRight I understand that so when you you you can take your sides and say okay well I you know I don't I I\nCan't I go to Tony difference with that is someone who has been sexually assaulted\nOn has more in my opinion has more say even if even though none of us know exactly what happened I knew like someone who's been sexually assaulted had more say in it because of how it affects people because of\nThe situation but someone by your started we had an option there's almost sexual assault they go\nAnd and again because I feel like people have the right to believe or not believe even more so if they've been it's actually an out\nAnd I write is correct where are you oh no question if someone has been sexually assaulted I mean that's absolutely look look at the lady who\nCalled us oh my gosh who didn't believe that woman who called us and talked about the different ages she was assaulted first decision that age\nIt didn't have any questions you could feel it right you know what I mean\nThe woman that was yelling at the senator and the elevator mhm yeah you could feel it\nAnd it's it's not about feel though in the ad in the end it's about and if you have a process here and you have to ask questions both people and I may have to decide you know\nAnd that's ... ... is that when you're called or the woman that was you know yelling at ... in an elevator with an elevator\nIf they had to if they had to get in front of\nAn entire hearing of senators yeah and and still there about what happened and I mean there are ... they're already trying to type and they had to do that and then everybody's telling underlined just because you don't remember this and that I mean how do you feel at that one and and the person who did that you just get to watch get everything he's never wanted\nTo put yourself initiates for five ... and it's not directly to me\nBut the only thing that obviously balances that is if there is a ... and ... how do you then\nThat's that's exactly what I'm Me out and you go\nForward and take this woman's word if there is no corroborating evidence or in this process you know what I mean\nIt exactly exactly what I what are you gonna do if there is no proof and that's exactly what I just had so she's got it so if it happened she them and there's no proof she's got to sit there and know that show did all of that guy gets everything you want and it was all for not right that's awful I'm Talking\nLife sucks sometimes but it's horrible I'm not ... ... that's the truth does suck it happens all the time people go to jail that didn't do anything you know what I'm saying I Know but I Am\nSo what if this guy is one of those guys right you know so there's two ways to look at it obviously by the way political dot com as a headline why the FBI should investigate roofing\nSo the whole question of moving and you know ... stuff like right there's no statute of limitations on sexual assault in Maryland the mother McCotter Maryland right so if there's any evidence whatsoever that we'd go after them\nI I don't see why they wouldn't\nRight so that's one thing after us to get it I kind of jumping out of me and the second thing is you know to start okay so move on from all this it\nDoesn't matter whether you believe or believe in whatever it is now they're going they voted today that's going to go to vote\nAll day today\nIs not into tomorrow there's going to be\nHow everything is going to try every legal angle to stop the vote from happening they're going to the injunction and this is nuts and everything else\nOr are they wall because they know who's going to switch their vote from today and tomorrow vote no if you don't see anything really happened and then you know that they're gonna flip out was what Ted was saying they could flip they don't have to vote the same tomorrow that was just to end the debate tomorrow is about if you should be confirmed\nAnd you know I mean so thoughts you know why would you go from yes to no\nYes we should end the debate already made up by by we're done we opened up the debate does not tomorrow let's get this done with and get him out here\nAnd people like that over to like that and say hey you need your vote because if you do then this and this and this is guaranteed ... or so and this is guaranteed\nMe being me is it in poor taste if we start a pool\nFor sort of some of the gambling what the ... on what the votes will be the hundreds as he gets in there and I still I you know I sort of a week ago I I don't think he's going to have the book you want foreigners not for a lot of votes ...\nYou know the interest and this is a Trump is trying to get this guy through because he said the president can't be prosecuted while at office does anybody else was there what you just say okay this guy just come back maybe I should pick somebody else\nOh\nI don't know I ... I think I don't know is that that's ... that's the reason that Trump likes them you think\nOh yeah they did that one but yeah I mean you\nAre making the first couple majors areas he's the one that said\nThe president cannot be prosecuted while at office\nYeah that's not really new right but that's what the isn't that what the ... isn't that what the constitution says\nI don't know if it's constitution but I Know that that's where they do it so that you can't uh bogged down a president lawsuits while he's in office and stop the country like do it with the fairies Boston but I'll tell you what they're trying real hard [laughter] so I mean that's that's nothing new and it's not invented by Calvin also I ... I don't know if that's the thing I I assume he likes him because he\nWhatever his decisions are in the past him and his\nDuty of people decided this guy is the first got which brought up he might not even be the perfect he might be the one they put away because they want number two or three if you write\nWhat it would be perfect if nominated a woman\nShe's next if he doesn't get in a conservative woman is next\nThought that don't say it why not just say okay this guy's got a few things called it you're done reading a book about the next lady up\nBecause they don't necessarily believe that he does have those things in his closet right you gotta realize they did all of a sudden this came out on the day before there was going to vote everything came out before they had all the paperwork for months and months and months and they came out the day before\nSo right but he goes well Daryl ... several skeptical about the whole thing I watch uh the other\nDay who knows you know we we don't know I mean ... you know how would we know we we didn't sit there\nFor I have an idea though you know how yesterday was national taco dang yes and national vodka a day and ... and then there's like national daughters day national Sunday ... every day we have a day now\nNational punch a politician day [laughter]\nSo that might be coming you get one\nAnd go up if you choose to look not everybody they all these days not everybody partake ... but not everybody but I took the national taco day yeah that's right that's true but if you choose to take international punch it politician day ... you can't get arrested by will be longer than Taco Bell yesterday what was\nGoing on now are we doing are we doing I mean as President Clinton there or is it [laughter] and I'm just saying if I'm going to choose Monica is only one day long\n'til the end of the deal about the president though he wasn't a politician I'm Talking about these ... you know well now he's the president doesn't make them a politician and calling\nThanks it's a policy it at the ...\n[laughter] that would be a day you want to be on that line is these are the way I mean\nThat's fine but hunter politician day\nCame out of where does anybody out there and you are\n... bread what all doesn't matter where you punch them oh\nWhat if you're a guy can you punch a female politician yes [laughter] yes wait about a guy on your end of the guy can you not\nPunish them [laughter] no point [laughter] but then I can but then I can see punch to then\nYeah that's ... year old girl how far along are all the time she says it's\nA ... but we can women parts of the guys\nYeah ... week and we were just girls\nNo you're not [laughter] don't lie [laughter]\nYou'll do anything to get on that line [laughter] you even admit while you're on the girl but\nI think you I think you should be able to punch would have a politician you want to whether they're male or female [laughter] me why do you want to beat a lemon ... pie I didn't want to do oh I'm just saying like if Diane Feinstein Feinstein whatever it is if that's your if if that's your mark then you should be able to go punter\nWind punch I Know there's no\nThere's not a beating no no it's not a beating on lunch\nAnd then you are in New York I mean they got to stand there and taking what if she runs\nOr then I get to run in tackled [laughter]\nPunch hand or chocolate moth unofficial national day [laughter] so they have to take it and if you miss you got to wait till next wretched we can just put that uh\nIf we put that up on a on a social or Facebook or Twitter stuff I think we can make something happen\nSo we both sides of Israel will be at your door and like five minutes [laughter]\nYeah I'm going to be on a train in Manhattan a couple of hours I'll be fine they're gonna have to duck they'll have to find me in the middle of all of a million people how many people\nThere that is a very generic thing those like specific threat right now I didn't say kill politician oh there was a horrible\nNight punch them right in the grill [laughter] kick 'em in the grill ... [laughter] that I Want to\nCheck this out Brett set of being a kids in a class in uh in British Columbia in Canada were saying that they wanted to end the glass go round and\nRound they wanted to know what's the difference between right wing or left wing and so the teacher put on a sign that with like Penn things on it and you you know with left center right across the top of the page but then the same questions where a person who believes that convicted murderers should be ... is that right center left\nYou actually it is right or left as really didn't give any centers and so right would be the answer for that because the right tends to be more toward capital punishment the left is more like sick it'd be rehab\nSo no Democrat but no Democrat believes and then the\nDebt no interest in general you know what I mean 'cause yeah any one of these could be someone I mean aside doesn't totally agree with that you know like a person who believes the school\nOf beatings that school building should be abolished what do you mean they're saying anything left like with\nA strap where the rule you know something like that that's more of a left wing issues that are right wing 'cause the right way likes corporal punishment more than a left wing does stereotypical it really isn't that funny\nI think that's one where you got like eighty percent of the people that ... percent like yeah because yeah so that's not exactly a person who was a racist right wing or left wing Monica\n[laughter]\nA lot of course there's fear here it got really burial typically they would say that right wing people are racist is not always true that's for sure nobody asked me\nYou would hope\nAbout a person believes in higher minimum wage that a left wing or right wing\nUsing even though I don't know if I Believe yes yeah center I really do think there should be a center option\nI think we're I honestly I on this show I think we're all in the center on certain things man some on the right ...\nYeah I mean most people aren't there you don't have to be extreme on each thing but if you're right of center somewhere or left of center somewhere you know and you're right a left or do we get\nBack to punch a politician day [laughter] I Can't have people who believe in punching politicians that are rights issue or a letter usually what it is the goal is going\nIn there and they wait to go about your frustration\nNow you know what it is okay see\nI don't know the television shows would you go into a room and you get to just break stuff and get your frustrations out or they give you one of those things and you get to go in there and you and your spouse to get out of you have the whole fight in all of a sudden it's all over and you feel better I feel like after all the nonsense we've gone through over the past however many weeks month whatever it is\nI think if we punched one politician right in the jaw\nI'd be like All right [laughter] it'd be like you know as I got one blast out of a happy\nHour let's go get a drink everything's cool I think it'd be OK afterwards I feel better you would even use the hashtag ... touch a politician you\nWill be so happy that I Do to make it on and say I think we need to use that to get it off the ground Monica always say hey you can make you could change the world with the hash tag if we can get this national poll punch a politician day off the ground it's going to take a hash tag right\nAbsolutely it's going to take care of their ... and we can start with is he a radio show and then there's you know hundred thousand watts of power\nKnow to get it outside of that because they asked to just go somebody\nAlways does want to make it international hashtags way to go what if it wasn't punch a politician 'cause maybe\nYou'd like us are trying to change my dreams what about your own dream what\nAll right what if it's some people would love to do is one of his punch someone who represents the loving someone who represents the life like right\nLike on TALK shows on TV like take a bunch of racial Matt out there and punch Bill O'Reilly out like that\nNo they just they're just doing their job build these other ones among the politicians in lion they lied to get the job they line to keep the jobs\nThat are Rachel Maddow around colder there was a big screen ...\nAnkles makes me laugh though is on the sea so nuts left me less\nPunch tape it sounds it's now when you're talking you're kind of you have someone in mind I don't know\nBut you know what would happen\nMuch like what I'm doing a fantasy football draft I go in and I'll do some research first now what\nI Would actually it would actually get me involved to find out what these people run foreign stand how they voted then I have a little bit you know what you're doing it in\nYour way to get ... and I'm going to punish\nWhy don't you just do that research that you just said you would do to punish someone you can vote for someone that you agree with\nNo incentive nowhere near what would you agree with you\nKnow to be able to punch one of these days right in the face of all worth it\nUh James and James ... to James you like or have this idea\nOh I Love it I mean I Would choose the grand what that southern drawl or that would be old just won't stay God knock it off to say [laughter]\nReally that would make you feel very good Sago\nHim and then what's the uh the real old guy that's talking about how a marijuana is the worst drought on\nEarth I'm one of our attorney general's oh yeah I\nI mean that guy too I mean oh no it's there there's a long list of people that I Love the\nSomething with bacon in Turkey bacon\nYeah you got it almost smells like a good and like a good piece of wood that ham hock smell Mm So I under I think once he opened up whatever you\nGood luck I use all through the radio because it's really\nYou know black tea uh it's grilled chicken [laughter] got a sweet potato fries isn't it a turkey bacon cheddar cheese and a little bit of a ranch dressing\nYou eat healthy brat\nOn war trying ranch dressing cheese ... whose health I\n[laughter] I'm a little tiny bit of that as like a little bit\nNorth of the ... portion doubt graduating Seventy four calories forty grams of protein motor good launch on four grams of fiber ... now what\n[laughter] I'll do it right here you can walk up right next to you and I believe right next to you [laughter]\nPunch DJ on the face day\n[laughter] that's right [laughter] punch a politician ... politicians [laughter]\nOne knows whatever is eating smells heavenly and not paying attention to Roger I Apologize I don't know I thought All right Dr\nNo no it's good you first of all you don't have to follow the ethical you don't have all those you're just eating your food but it was very distracting we\nLive in a world we live in a world now where they can't be too many apologies\nEverybody or just the pollen and everything about five years later this little drove up we'd all be okay\nWe apologize to the age the radio is not good enough for you to smell bread screwed out of your speak\nThat I Apologize for black people [laughter] and not really caring about his plate\nI'm or anything else that goes on in ... in a in in ... well yeah [laughter]\n... yeah so there are there as a step in the right direction they will not be on TV Now but it's been such a long tradition to have a hard time I guess letting go of it I mean you have Santa Claus I've never heard a story of anybody following him down me surely unless we said oh the ... with him but I never heard of chimneys sweeps going with them\nI can see them like following him watching him go down the chimney and they're waiting for him to get back in his late and enroll him and take all the ... the president's office lead [laughter] I can see the story having gotten there at this point to\nThe yells take over something Santa gets rolled yeah but no\nIt looked like an obvious oh so you know a lot of times we look at ourselves as the worst were also and I mean we we have our problems but it it's a human thing I mean it's just it's gotta be if it's Holland I mean they've tulips and shoes and all this up and look and they have like the\nSound a lot of weight and ... and when we'd hookers and they're still like racist hookers and windows so hopefully they will ah corrected very soon and no

the stall doors off and all them by the time I hit middle school I used to if I had a good enough it was a sneak into the teachers' lounge\nOr the middle of a class of ... therapy the cleanest place by the\nTime I hit high school\nTo go that bad I just gave walk out in my car all about ... minutes away come back that was one of those\nProjects right all the kids that used to do in their smoke you know what I mean it was just put the cigarettes out on the toilet seat that just disgusting in general so uh\nDo you ever get in trouble for going home no we can never leave the camp made in high school\nThey didn't care it in there it was either having to take a number two and door going home as big a deal with it I did I did not care you know what I mean it's one of those where you apt to go you opt\nRight I'll take the bus driver with it\nYeah that's all there is to it\nI mean yeah I I did I learned that in the middle school I'd rather do at the teachers' lounge 'cause you know they kept clean\nI wouldn't want to know like I I I Wish I were to ask what the reason for it was like why take doors all what is the purpose of taking the door and I think it was the smoking I really do\nThe smoking yeah it's it's it was always joking I mean and later on drugs or from the inside\nOut and you can't seal flushed down the toilet before you actually smoke cigarettes cost salad oil it they
