I think it opposite situation God front\nHey I just want to say I'm I was actually a sushi chef and and Puerto Rican like\nMake this an Monica is hands just want to hear like I'm not in your food [laughter] and her name is Frank you're not allowed to let him out of here\nAnd not unless you tell me you're making a move fungal role um on our\nHome you know oh I got out of the muscle la ...

I've never I said I don't go in and make assumptions they find something like ... and all of that all everything right but I I Am clearly not colorblind I I've never ever in my life for that not alone in a shell I don't know what I don't see color I don't\nLook at people in a certain way they are all about I don't I don't assume things based on whether they have red hair any ride I don't I don't assume that but I but I rent hair\nYou're not in the past said something to the fact that you do like skin color those are courteous\nAnd I however ... someone who's African American or whatever but yeah but I don't because I don't think of it doesn't I don't count there are three black I don't even look at that it doesn't matter to me I don't mastering in the\nEnd of the yeah right but actually not that good but you can say the U.S that you've never said I don't see color because you've set it on ... million to\n... you you can ever known\nThe thing that you're just assumed that and ... and less I actually hear the words I I I my life I don't say that out loud because I Am not colorblind okay I'm going to the caller's\nRaj has she said I don't see color over the years\nI thought she had to Monica says your house and maybe we're mixing the word spread\nI Believe she has ... that's what I'm saying and that's when I when I hear those and I hear that and I go okay that's impossible so I Will call BS every single time\nSo even if it's not those words like the the Chinese restaurant example walking in to take out like you said you never even think about who's behind the counter or whatever\nIt was a guy on there was a guy and I ... yeah\nIs it going home before I Wish we got to this call it hung up I think his name was Dante he said if I Walk into a soul food place in the white person working I'm leaving you\nDo to stop so [laughter] you know the question about you know\nIt's just I don't know man it's just\nThat you guys want some jerk chicken when eating [laughter] has looked mighty hungry [laughter]\n\nHas a law the collard greens are white guy more [laughter]\nA captain fresh socks sale ready to do it you can carry chicken and the guy [laughter]\n[laughter]\nMy team [laughter] sixteen and\nDirty Santa Marta protector so this is a good that's a good way to go to ...\n... I I had to be ...\nWhat about what we intend to I Hope you felt because I thought you said your point really well but then we went on the phone calls and we were talking or whatever but I I uh ... and in fact we had two calls it back you up we had the Puerto Rican guy who make sushi\nAnd then the other guy who ah what's the Italian place run by Asians who speak Spanish so clearly there are places like you were talking about where you don't even notice it was in there you like the food or you know\nAnd if there's only one Puerto Rican guy named Frank who make sushi than there are ... he's not the only one in the universe you know there are others or some other without having one bite of the things she\nMy refused to make an assumption and that's just me you can do what you want and I refused to assume it's bad sushi I'm Monica hope that you make it somewhere it's good to meet\nYou hate when people take you literally\nRight you do have proven that we went through that one time you don't want to be taken literally yet when I say something you take it literally like I really wouldn't eat the guy Puerto Rican guys who national only well doing a show with trying to entertain were joking we keep it in like removing it along like if you take you know literally on everything I say\nYou know we were going to have a war all the problems\nOnly because you had mentioned that about the red hat and about the evening and about multiple times than if\nIt does we would they want to having some fun and we were rolling with it and we were laughing and having a good time and it was the phone lines are filling up and people wanted to play along with it that's what I'm doing I'm here to entertain people if you take me seriously will\nHave a world the problem of sushi place like magic ... let's just let's just kinda count on there I said I was I'm fine line you're all looking at the beginning of them make you don't need to talk down to me like that I'm not ... but I'm not ... okay I don't\nKnow where all the problems but it was a step too far\nThat's what you're saying like I Know we're in a world of prop ... what does that ... that wasn't again literal but it wasn't meant to be the biggest thing I ...

his daughter\nThe ... and his daughter actually is the person who had two extra explain the phrase triggered because of the mind talking about triggers what does that mean I I didn't\nGet it I Would be able to get up so they could trigger other than the you know I'm going to reflect definitions of what's going on with some hard just to\nBe clear so that when we talk about it we know what to stop is and so I mean that's why I was wondering why are you know you either audio audio was whatever go\nHave you ever heard of her Monica talk have a conversation about differences ethnicities race in a I'm\nIn a way that is not joking around and poking fun and lightening up like we've never done this I should never say never cause who the hell knows but you've never heard us talk with anger towards a race or a um\nEthnicity or anything like that would would you know what I'm saying that's why I don't understand why it makes you cringe\nOr do you watch I've been asked before\nMultiple times you do I do I think you guys are racist right ... ... and and I always and I just that the truth anybody that asked me I always said no I don't think he's race it but I Do believe you have a whole and because of where you grow up and how you grow up\nIn the air you grow up that you have a whole bunch of assumptions and stereotypes in generalities then now I'm just not comfortable with 'em and so I Do I think that you guys wherever he came from a place I have no not right but I also don't there are certain things\nThat and I think it's a combination of\nStuff that and I don't I Can't I don't know end is the word I I'm uncomfortable with some of the things you say\n... and also it's a couple of things that have happened to me and my life and it's and I saw about me and my life and it's like let's say for me at all it's not it's not right now to it's not comfortable and more and I I I Am the way I Am and I speak the way I Do about certain things because I'm hoping it you know there's\nYou know thousands of listeners may be one of them I understand you know where I'm hunting find no nine oh no I'll I'll speak are truly you know what I mean and then you alter your truth that you that's fine but gray how their own truth and it doesn't it's not invalid and it deserves to be heard as well\nBut when we talk about stereotypes number one I didn't make him a number two they're fun [laughter] they are I mean we don't go to the dark side of stereotypes you know ever\nKnow it'll it'll go on there that it's no fun to talk of Andrew\nAbout stereotypes was grim that's where the fun is just talking about right things and laughing about what you see and what you\nCould make no mistake about it Andrews parents or grandparents or somebody as we've had some at some point called the white guy round I support and funny\nAnd I think they're like the different I don't think that it's funny amongst among I guess because I'm I'm at work and and and it's different when you guys are in a different state and I'm here or whatever but I I understand I don't think that their tips are funny but I Will admit I Will say in a ...\nWell safe you know we all are on the same page in all new You're Joking so were all able to\nYou know right now about like I told you guys to one time they do that when I hear that song on the debate brothers on what if all the leaves and my family jokes and

because uh one of the thing in sports which I don't know if you saw the headlines about the as the golfing fan who got his knee high with a golf ball from the record yards and her I exploded kept go right\nYeah Brooks kept it the shot so it's not even ordering we're just talking the other day about when they're in the in the woods or whatever and they got a hit out and there's an hour you have to shoot ... that was in this was this during the ... she went there uh [noise]\nI saw the headlines were the headline yeah that's what the right a couple of us right has not from power that headline that I found I mean it was the most descriptive\nYou don't even need to go back to the story doesn't even need to be written woman loses sight in I after eyeball explodes who's kept his stray right a cup of tea shot yeah I don't even need to raise ... versus the story\nOh yeah she's Egyptian Charles from Egypt to power center are gets hit with a ball from three hundred yards and she has no idea it's coming and it's still from three hundred yards explodes rival one oh my God I think must have been a rock was he gives you\nSomething up for ... [noise] so they don't know what's gonna happen\nLike so she has to get to obviously taken to the hospital she take an interesting character\nAnd apparently she's going to have to sue to get anything taking nobody's really said anything although Brooks kept good mentioned why she's got she's got an America that Iran will not even that no but how about this how about or whoever runs the Ryder Cup will be like listen we'll we're going to help you out here because that's why that is horrible and it doesn't ... I don't even I even if they're not liable\nI didn't read the article she worried about having to pay for this thing is that what the problem is\nYeah I mean it was expensive she lost an odd I ... through ... but at the expense is make it into the story that you know the mounted not know that seems weird to me\nThe thing is ah like ... for example are told the BBC that quote you can yell for but it doesn't matter from three hundred yards you can't hear it right I don't know what that context was he was defending himself or if he was just saying I don't know what you can do about it because as much as you all for three hundred his way nobody\nIs going to even the older must be coming at me everybody as soon as it's not even close to me she\nGoes quote it happened so fast I didn't feel any pain when I was hit Koreans said quote I didn't feel the ball I didn't feel like the ball had struck my eyes and then I felt the blood start to pour scan on friday confirmed the fracture of the right eye socket and the explosion of the eyeball\n... or ... [laughter]\nIt was amazing how much weight and he went through step by step\nFollowed by the dumbest quote from Bruce kept ... abruptly are quote what I say Bruce Bruce by Brooks quote you don't want to hit anybody in the face especially not a woman not a good feeling\nLike the guy with a guy in the face as kind of okay as if you explore the guy's eyeball as it is not so bad I just\nThat's just built in bias that's what that is just suck it up [laughter] [noise] so she has obviously lost her eyes and now they have to figure out what to do but so just got a lawyer but they're gonna sue because clearly she has many medical expenses but what if it says in the back of the ticket\nYou know there are you know you are responsible if you're injured during that nobody really thinks about the same as any sporting event you know if you're gonna be the person who gets to the Y. U. so worried about how she's going to pay for medical bills which she lost and apply well also with us well also well\nHey you're paying for the medical bills and it seems like an easy thing for the Ryder Cup slot you know slashed ... whoever and they do\nAre you sure they will because they haven't like this is what they're saying there's nobody is even like reached out yet it's kind of weird so maybe they're like checking what they should do\nYeah it's not it's not she's not admitted to the emergency room and all over the next day I mean\nThis is that like yeah does it take a long time to deal with insects and adjust to and live with rice sponsor before all of that\nAnd when you go to any sporting event you know hockey is put up ... with the uh pocket across baseball's extended moving down nothing down the line so it's to the end of the dog out I Believe when he\nCame from ESPN quote the spectator hit by a ball at the six whole during friday's play was treated by first responders immediately and taken to the hospital to stay in and said well we've been in communication with the family involved starting with the immediate on course treatment and thereafter to provide support helping with the logistics of\nRip repatriation\nMhm that means a including providing a transfer it for the family from Paris to own a we will continue to offer support for as long as necessary balls strikes or an occasional hazard for spectators but this kind of is it is extremely rare we can confirm that for was shouted several times but also appreciate how hard it could be\nA to know when and where every ball struck if you were in the crowd we as usually sympathetic and will do everything we can to support the spectator or in so far as that ... as possible under very difficult circumstances so it sounds like they're on it\nDoes sound like that yeah that's different from the article uh that are well maybe the state and her lawyer but which that's a whole different thing\nAfraid of any any ... anything like that only had a baseball game for some reason I I get freaked out sitting at a baseball game I just like to what you like I just I'm always ... constantly paranoid about hitting and nowhere else on any in any kind of just baseball it's just scary the\nYeah well if you're right along the baseline as I can see but now they put the ... and you you would have to really keep up with your behind the dog out many seats you got to stay alert like what's your reaction mind well or the nets up on the right now they are yeah now they are when I used to be here that we have a glove\nWhat is it ... it's a and the dugout to end the dugout right ...\nAt this point yeah maybe a little bit past ... ... used to be to the beginning of each dug out now it's all the ... early ...

then he can't you get up without a TV show maybe because maybe it'll run the some hurdles there here when I got away longer\nHere's what I Would say would\nSarah Silverman so he got hired Mel Gibson got hired by Warner Brothers to make this movie ... okay Saturday ... obviously pissed off about everything that Mel Gibson had done and what he there was some horrible things\nWould ... and turn down an offer from Warner Brothers\nBecause they did business with Mel Gibson that's how you shows because you're literally ... right you know that's how you put that fleet put your money where your mouth is until then you know I don't mean Woody Allen married a stepdaughter there's nothing wrong at Hollywood's praises him right\nWell I don't understand me oh they're the most part I always\nHad a successful career since then it's like it didn't have Charlie Sheen went nuts he successful\nWell there you know she and her sitting there trying to negotiate a tax bill ... million dollars and you say\nBut he got plenty of work after that a Mariah Carey had meltdowns ... melt down so I think you know if you go to the sports that right balance strawberry doc good and they do drugs and and things are not supposed to do get suspended in the end when all this talent\nAlways seems to rise right top yet it lets you killed someone well that's where you are in jail because\nAll those examples you game you just gave none of them hurt anybody else\n... what do you just ... she didn't hurt and he didn't hurt any but he got into her his wife he needed our they already divorced and we left it went for\nBut he didn't like physically hurt anybody either ... daughter a stepdaughter yeah\nThey're still married we'll Gibson hurt anybody you know he said we're Lessig know domestic violence against ... that ... she's talking about it it's all that she put all that is in the article\nRight why was that ... as far as just what he says and has a history of controversial behavior ranging from making anti Semitic comments to being convicted of battering his ex girlfriend knock sonic regard Gregory by butter\nAnd if Hollywood didn't want to hire him over there is scared just like ... not even know ... ... didn't technically physically hurt anybody you know a he's not in right now because people don't want to take the chance on him because of what they're afraid of if people were afraid that Mel Gibson is going to\nCause my box office bomb they wouldn't put a minute exactly well that's what I said earlier too I agree with you but I'm not when these people that are complaining about Mel Gibson okay well when the game he go buy\nAccording to the view on that I mean right now like a market it's fair in is that she has every right to be upset and she has every right to say okay I don't and if you're cool with him now that you're deal that right now what what I Want like there's a statute of limitations on what she's saying\nHe shouldn't be able to and I would love to ask Sarah well then went\nWrong never you'd have to be from\nHere at the end Serbia and entertain mostly say yeah always bags Semite and the whole always be an anti Semite and I get so I don't think he should be able to make a work right make a living work because you can just not in Hollywood is probably what you're saying you gotta go elsewhere right and make that money ... who made the ... nobody\nKnows why he's gotten geography mask around anyhow Neal\nYeah and and and your deal or something else and you know he's obviously what if he if someone else is on the opinion is as you are then he'll he'll have a

I Hope for a cause it doesn't help either doesn't disprove it either there's no proof I guess perhaps\nMhm [noise] uh Mike is on a line through what are you going to say about this Mike\nHey I just was here when you go to say um you know got two different opinion was if you can eat a ... ... the first one was the conversation earlier people like sheep dog still have a show\nAnd he says clutter and racist stuff like almost every other word I don't understand how ...\nIs a is a very high powered ... say something like you said when he was you know whether it be good or bad he said it how come some people have a pass to others do ...\n... I I Believe when he when he saying his staff it's it's ... it's not coming ... I Believe in Paris and he's got a show with Martha Stewart and they're the whole time\nBut um yeah the positive things to say about it and\nI guess he was just a real hard nose with a negotiating I'm Canada for example is like we got to make a deal because if we don't deal they're going to put us in a recession because we are so big and they're so small compared with so that really what happened\nOh I'm going on and I said we're not going to ban so we're going to do this or do they tell you what the towers on your\nMhm yup exactly said we would put tariffs on any auto parts that you've sent us auto stuff and apparently that's a big business for them here and\nA very stuff involved too and then\nI think yeah I think there was and they and they said it was a ... foot Canada in a recession you have the power to do that if they saw me that's a very powerful negotiating point so\nOf the U. S. M. C. A. is new NAFTA agreement I guess it still has to get approved for us to go before our own people and our own pop a politician's refer to approve it right but it seems to have some good stuff and it's so he has his press conference about\nIt and of course other things are going to come up like to comment on hearings were just talking about for example a one reporter uh wanted to ask about it and Trump now I mean love 'em or hate him\nUh you you hear something here I think when we were slower kind of like them\nRight or whichever is writing a lot of people have been kind of like um [laughter] but you actually hear like almost a relaxed personality coming out what he's talking\nSerious yeah those are my question is your friends and I I think he did lie about his drinking does that mean you'll pull\nHim I don't think he did I I look here's here's what I'm just saying I'm not a drinker\nI can honestly say I never had a beer in my life okay it's one of my [laughter]\nWhenever they're looking for something that is I never had a glass of alcohol I've never had alcohol I've just you know for whatever reason\nCan you imagine if I had what a mess that they might be the world's worst one I haven't drank I never drank okay but I can tell you I watch that hearing and I watched a man saying that he did have difficulty as a young man\nWhen spring the one question I didn't ask is how about the last Twenty years that'd be a difficult the last Twenty years 'cause nobody said anything bad about him and many many years they go back to high school\nYou know I graduated from high school and and I I while I did not drink I saw a lot of people drink they drink beer and then they'll crazy and you know when I go there were sixteen Seventeen years old and I saw a lot of it\nDoes that mean that they can't do something that they want to do with their life so it's a very tough thing I I really believe that he was very strong on the fact that he drank a lot and so I don't know where there'd be big discrepancy yes go ahead please can you found you know what you really are and I and\nThere it is [laughter] I felt really hung on to Saudi riot and quiet and why and drive drive on a ... so you're just\nTo that point but you you can hear him like he should really like his people as you listen to self deprecating humor thing that's pretty good softens you give it a shot was different like you don't hear that side of him that much right now he says Roger by drink I'd be the worst admitting that he knows that he's got his problems without drinking\nI find that you know he leaves him so I Wonder if he knows but you but you know what happens\nHe says something and he goes I can honestly say I've never had a drink in my life I've never had a beer or a drink in my life you know a ... million\nDrove out there trying to find some one person\nWho will come out and say I had a beer with him behind the you know behind the supermarket in the schoolyard or whatever it is when we were sixteen years old like there is somebody who is not resting on his he had one basic view about\nI don't want to be like that's right and that's where we are man you crazy ...\nIs the easiest thing might be able to get them as I got a black tie affair with champagne toast if he can get one video of him\nHe'll be holding the glass but does he actually sip it put it to his lips and then put that with a call in they'll find that if it exists right eye seems pretty strong on this and I don't know where I don't know where to find the old stuff high school was the one I thought the same thing you did somebody how'd you would have had a he had to have tried it once\nThat's very impressive but that was like the Monica Monica is never once you've never smoked a cigarette right\nNow are tiny Dr ... you'd never smoked pot you ever tried pot you know I you know that's pretty good I I\nI'm very impressed if there is a person that can say that they never even took a sip of beer or sip of alcohol or drink or just to even ... what is it tastes like what is it\nRight just curiosity of your would have tried it\nUnless the only thing I can think of is that maybe a family member was an alcoholic and he seemed so much damage he wanted nothing to ever do with it that's the only thing that my thing is when somebody because you would think at some point curiosity would take over most of your mind\nI Would think that's why I think that's definitely the reason my mom doesn't drink is because her father drank and um I guess her her brother probably got some beatings and you know whenever she saw her like I don't know if you're on TALK about what she did not drink and\nEven eat food is cooked with alcohol because the taste to her so horrible because she never has how come you you know and ask her\n[noise] um I ... I have asked her and she says I just don't like it\nI Know that there's more to it the right so you don't do high making the assumption that has to do with migrants\nYou don't want to do again you don't want to answer you know what the\nWhile I've asked after more than once but that's what she always says is well I just don't like to taste it but that's all I I don't know if I Want to I'm Sorry about it\nI mean I I just used to work at the guy who never has been drunk he's he's had alcoholic I step or you know like a party or champagne tells you may have never been drunk and so I I'm with you ... I got to know why you know what I mean like why don't you\nBecause it goes either way you know people can be around alcohol and all that other stuff and be raised by alcoholics and go I don't want anything to do with that or well it's just what I'm supposed to do within my family and then ...\nMaybe his father fought 'em out from an early age like you're going to be in the business in from twelve you know little Donny Trump is in there yeah learning business and you never drink 'cause you gotta make good decisions and getting\nParents tell you all are the odds of drunk and given your parents tell you a lot of things you don't ... I was listening to all of it right you know but if you but if you grew up seeing your grandfather beating him ... yeah you know follow your grandmother or whatever the hell it is\nRight here like I said listen I Believe very few things and if you can't say I know one hundred percent believe that he's never had a ... I don't think he ever going to find anything on there I don't think that when you don't want to do this you know to be in control and you have is you know the faculties while he's dealing business and stuff and he doesn't want to have cocktail\nAs an adult yes but as a kid you know you're not curious like to me that's very interesting to me to never even had that curiosity I Want to know why\nMaybe his father said you can never have a drink and I'll give you a billion dollars okay\n[laughter] you know I get to you as well and I get that at fifty two you get to Michael aligned forego Michael\nIt gosh man I Love your show about\nNo matter what I Do every day I make sure it was able to turn on the radio wherever I Am\nAn awesome habit and policy for everybody everywhere\n[laughter] if they're not going to see\nThe thing about Trump that I Do believe him when he says he uh had a brother who is a terrible alcoholic\nIs that what it was rather okay yeah and he died in it you know in like forty something forty to forty three something like that he would never he just never did because of that law says that like they're leaving him when he says that sometimes she says she's pretty wild crap that\nLike I like I like I say you have to have seen something yeah yeah so am I don't you go on and so why go ahead say I spend enough time on a psychologist couched understand or you know\nUh but also brother died for do he must have seen his brother doing it from a very young age maybe he was a year or\nTwo older I don't know and it was like yeah this is the most of the bad for him to think that not try it like you said as a teenager right everybody tries to hey Brian online to what's up\nWhat's that guy's doing a great show up on the on the throat worn out there is some research that I did it said I just feel it off but I hear everybody else to say one\nThing I read about a Democratic National committee one of the lead officials\nIt clear that quite a bit of sexual as contractors videos and things like that but I guess is a ex girlfriend took a notch is\nHer psychiatrist or a therapist released statements the things that she was saying I'm and she went to a couple of different doctor visits where she was abused and they told the doctors and whatnot\nBut none of the Democrats want any kind of an investigation into what one of the lead officials is doing but they are held that destroying Kavanaugh's I like about ten years on that and see what they care\nYeah I haven't heard very rare at it as an ironic I Would like to read I Would like to who is it find it and read it what's the guy's name is\nKeith Keith Ellison look it up oh I definitely do you have over the\nMedia you'll you'll see his name and you'll read all about it huh ...\nBut they're destroying one guy's life and they won't even investigate all of their own for worse\nWorse allegations\nMuch yeah in fact when I look him up a domestic abuse allegations against Keith Ellison cannot substantiate substantiated Democrat Larson attorney Ellis interviewers class unsubstantiated\nYes the Democratic call for their own investigation of personal investigation not an FBI investigation why would\nThey want to have a one of the oil ha at the Democrats investigate him like a ... yeah well that's right and it does the FBI does this guy and they don't want", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Roger and JP", "city": "Sarasota", "day": "02"}
