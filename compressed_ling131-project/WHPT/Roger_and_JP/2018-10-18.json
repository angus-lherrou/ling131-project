Monica is finally not arguing with me that while running back and enjoy it I just want to back it was right behind his head and said joy adult Roger lose the modeling and going out of a little while because finally not me and it's about a subject that I have absolutely no care of the world or something I don't care [laughter]\nThere you go they can tell the level I watch it not take it then but that's\nNot going away [laughter] go by I don't know if you stop to spend the whole time the uh you know you're not sure oh a cameras online one God gave you have a female point of view on this or what\nDo I do and and I think what I Believe from Patty and specially Monica is about she was actually very happy that's why she was singing with her little nice friends and her birds she was happy and not horrible life she didn't really it didn't seem to\nHer she was making a ... he wanted to\nAsk me about her life even though it was a well liked because there's\nStepsisters and her mother and her stepmother were so mean to her she was making the best of her life so I think that the temples where he got a little I Try yes eventually she went and ... but it wasn't about him rescuing huh she seemed to be doing okay by herself\nYeah me and I think you're right came in that I feel like apparently and I have no idea that I had and I mean like [laughter]\nI feel like they're really really there's a different\nVersion because when I was a kid with when I watched when I was six\nAnd none of that on any thing that the gentleman said before you or what you're saying I didn't see her being happy I saw her being miserable and crying in the film I thought it was a little you know one of those\nBoats because she was singing with the with the law if she was doing the doors of the time she was crying when the stepsisters remain and bowling or\nYeah they were when they were trying to justice jak stretch yeah crying but that when she\nLives waking up in the morning she must waking up to all this stuff that she knew she had to do it you\nKnow and if that's also a different version there was no ripping of address or garbage you know clock or any of that and the version I look at all no my mother edited the tapes in between Nineteen Seventy six and now and so and that's you\nKnow 'cause I Love people and not so I've only seen the ... so I don't know if you don't remember the ... version I never seen\nAnd I'm like I said it before it's the same version I so I started my daughter who is now in her thirties\nSo yeah I mean it's the same thing maybe you just forgot about\nThis barge no mhm just lied under oath needed to spark up\nAnd then uh your speech\nIt was a beach but they were in power so he remained off as\nAs the U.S Senate will vote in our house\nVoted to him when he was a real Clinton for lying under oath and obstructing justice but the U.S Senate later acquitted him or any remain in office you know the bill Clinton and bill must be like\n\nWhy are you from [laughter] twenty\nWhere there are a large should be done in a however these are\nOwn [laughter] about it too I\nJust saying is that it was a different time and he had how many how many different women saying this happened this happened and it's so much in state troopers\nAre like yeah I mean I Know I Know who I listen to his room I kind of stuff I mean I'm very much being general 'cause there was a long time ago I remember hearing of this stuff but you know and that is you know he he got roasted in front of the country but they didn't have the will to vote him out of office there like the country's been thrown up with this let's move forward and they move forward\nTo see who comes as a record breaking number of women are seeking office this year in direct response to Trump's election and bullied by the hash tag me too movement despite the surge of Kennedy's Clinton said sexism is still front and center in politics\nShe pointed out Brett Kavanaugh is aggressive questioning of Democratic senators are Dianne Feinstein and Amy\nCoby Coby car called which are what are called story a delusion of uh he didn't do that to men she said you know [laughter]\nOh you aggressively one out oh once you watch\nThe way ... made me it was in view with sexism making fun of me for preparing well you know that's the old like oh yeah the girl in the class was always prepared I don't need to be ... like she's a wrong right\n[laughter] or you can spit it however you want to either side you know drunk it's been things you can spend things whatever but I don't know where I don't know if people have Hillary in mind for twenty twenty I don't know what a democratic voters are thinking of ever got Biden like out in front of his mind right\nNow Clinton said she played quote no role in criticizing the character of women who accused her husband of sexual misconduct quote no role Clinton said quote I take responsibility for my life and my actions\nI'm sure a rubber\nThere's again I'm remembering back I think she was in charge of taking care of the situation and that the charges that were coming in and the White House that was one of her first behind the scenes things yeah\nA maybe a Rembrandt wrong but I think they were so many women she was in charge of dealing with and and trying to find out what was true I wasn't all that stuff\nI kinda feel like Bill ...\nProbably when it was all said and done they were out of office and out of politics a little while I kinda like Bill probably said you know what maybe a divorce is a good idea and she was like oh no no no no no no no no you ... you think you're going to get off that easy you embarrass me from you know and some in front of people from around the world\nThat's Raj will manage at any long dry oh gosh [laughter] your life is not to do with ads I feel I own you you break\nAnd then fire spit from right they shoot flame shot out of him when I Do I Know\nYou will stay here just to hit them with do yeah like you know look I you know like the bomb and type ... protect vomiting just got it that kind of thing [laughter] I mean I ... that women have been through so much with them\nOr a failure I Know\nIt's crazy like ... why do the interviews why do this to yourself\nThat well then I'm playing I'm Jamie ... I mean obviously\nI get it but like why is that where you're at in life why continue to subject yourself to the questions and having to deal with it mhm why not just sit back and say you know why\nI have a healthy daughter\nI have healthy grandkids I did the best they could you look yourself in the mirror you know you did you you try to become president you try to change the world in a way that you saw fit it didn't work out that way you know you ... you know you lost twice so you're not going to get in and again like why\nContinue to subject yourself to those to all that stuff I just unless you are oh please and auto megalomaniac which maybe she is I don't know\nMaybe uses while he hasn't gone away you mean he was out in the spotlight he still does lots of ... but\n... I don't know differently like you know he had his big time in in in the ...\nGoing to be an athlete build that keeps going this is what you know this is what you do you think he's still got a low gas locked in the tank yeah but you know why more for twenty twenty\nBut the public will tell you you and your coaching staff and the and the owners will tell you when you've had too much you know nobody's telling that you've had too much oh the the ... will cause she keeps going out and sell tickets they are going to sell tickets you think they're well they're going to sell tickets but I don't know but my question when they ... well you don't need the money\nRight right just you don't need the money so why ... why continue to torture yourself\nI was that's what I don't get\nI was wondering if they were going out to do a tour and try to bring a little green back 'cause you know she lost a couple of times bring a little green back to the name and lay out the future for Chelsea who has a political future possibly that's all I could think of\nBecause they're pretty much will be yet listen I Would like to think Chelsea is like no no no it's\nJust been mentioned in I Believe she of course that ... you know has floated the idea of a future in politics\nBecause they want to put her out because like you know make her the Arab parrot because she's the damn Clinton and the ... the all the Kennedy and his wife couldn't get in so what makes you think that the daughter so maybe the daughter spotless like and I'm not a Hillary hostile and I'm sitting here saying to myself if I'm the daughter but like\nWhy would you even subject to that [laughter]\nWould you leave that you see how ... what it does to you what it's done to you how would you turn the life upside down I was ripped off family apart why would you want your child to then go\nWithout having to worry about it right right as long as the prices are similar in that kind of thing and then and I'm like okay 'cause you're still and then you don't want ethical you had any show up but if you can just dial phone number and have a delivery service\nWill overheat will deliver your fast food with you we were we thinking [laughter]\nYou know yeah ... that's it for them to go yeah Lynn ... and you know what I say good for them I think it's a really cool move\nYeah why not let's see let's see what happens we'll see how it goes I mean but it because in general it seems like it's going pretty well in the states though I did just the headline about my\nDriver crashes are upper stoned drivers and the states that are legal they have like an increase of whatever the percentages so they're watching that right but if you want and Will Stone right but\nIs there a decrease in drunk driving accidents you don't have a question or is it all just really still even doubt\nYeah yeah well I mean if you get some more ... I mean it's something like that I mean it could happen or somebody looking for his dad and putting in a you know you don't know over time we'll find out if that's true and you'll find out if we I mean they're they're starting to his articles coming out now about how it deals with the health\nAnd you know I've been taking the CBD Oil mhm product for two weeks now and you're still find\nMore than a normal size that morning wow\nThat and it's funny because there's a difference because I got one\nI'm from a listener here man then I ran out and it was a little bit pricey and I ran out of All right and my doctor said she's I I can get it for you know so I got it from there and that one sucked did nothing ... nothing for me to have like a low on back and bought the original and again I'm sleeping through the night aches and pains minimized\nWow yeah and that's from but that's just from the kind of is I mean that's all there are ... and that one never trace amounts of teach see like if I took the drug test now even though I haven't smoked pot and God Knows how I\nWould I be positive off so the week when you got didn't have THC\nThey just coincidentally that happened to be loyal to see and I just had did nothing for me the other one I happen to them and they don't help\nMe sleep that number to anything didn't openings IT when I was doing the other one I had I slept through the night I didn't feel anxious I didn't like the old enough to even remember to put the Xanax in my pocket ... you know that kind of thing that really it was so I just went back and bought five bottles with the original one\nDid you do it why not do the work works gives her from pick him yeah I think it wherever you can sleep right ... ... and has been sleep is an issue that's online through what are you going to [noise]\nUh yeah you guys are talking about getting we delivered I just wanted to say you go to Washington DC and that's exactly how you get your weight\nDelivered\nDelivered I I mean like Washington\nD.C and so they legalize it in DC and the funny thing is all the politicians didn't want stores all over the capital of the United states so we'd so\nUm one thing you can actually buy it you have to make a donation to a charity so there's lots of charities and Washington DC so I went online and I made a donation to a veterans charity which I'm sure they got very little while\nAnd then a very nice lady in a car that smelled delicious showed up in front of my hotel and gave me a little brown paper bag\nAnd as a thank you for my donation\nOh so as a out of state out of D.C person you could still get it through that loophole\nAbsolutely if you're in DC it's legal you just have to kind of go through some um you know hoops to get it but ... it's a nice lady drove up to the hotel and go down a window and said you met I surely am and gave me a brown paper bag with a whole bunch of ... of it\nBy and so when you add leftover did you bring it back with you or did you just leave it are you a lot I don't ... I can I have no clue Lee\nA cannot travel with it but they haven't been there for research if you check bags with marijuana and it's found you're in a whole\nBunch of trouble you are\nSo you actually the smart thing to do and this applies if you go to Colorado as well is too carefully package it and not have it in your carry on bag because all because the TSA they even say on our website they\nDo not look for that\nOh if they kind of are forced to find it like you're an idiot and your entire bags and all these like a quarter pound a week then they're going to confiscate\nAnd they'll just confiscated but you won't be arrested or any in huge trouble\nRight well I guess if you have a a a you know I ... a gallon Ziploc bag full\nOf how they got a call the political place but basically\nIf you have a couple of joined set then they're going to confiscate it smoke or in the back room after\nWork [laughter] right [laughter] so they're somewhat understanding if you carry it through and they find it right you\nIt over to your bags yeah wow\nAll right how does that good did you get any ... how does it go for that 'cause ... any smell or anything on\nThat is probably the best way to travel because they come in a vacuum sealed packages\nOh yeah oh leveling unless you're like me and you make your own and decide an hour into the flight they didn't kick in yet and you're like I Need more cookies when it up yet and I was like no worse\nThan going for the second out of all 'cause it it's not affecting yeah\nYeah I've done it yeah I did it on that plane awful did was thrown back in the next it was because I Know what that is give me a cookie and I'll keep my mouth\n[laughter] that's funny [laughter] yeah smart\nI got that ... who was I was sold banged up by the time we landed in Denver\nSo to incidentally going skiing and uh I couldn't even hold my bags [laughter] you know\nI I was skiing and I couldn't find my way down to the bottom of the mountain\n[laughter] in fact you're\nAll right thanks has but\nWhose guys back you love like a little ... drinks are there like be dreams with the DNC or whatever uh some of them I guess I mean what's the difference when it gets it looked like Kennedy that makes sense but it is candy southern ... right but it looks like just regular county so why if there was going through the scanner is nobody would ever say anything right out and pay a hundred ...\nMartin on line one what's up Martin\nA pilot have Charlotte as you're doing All right what's up\nHey um before I ask the question I just wanted to say here in Florida they're already trying to criminalize the usage of um\nCD Baby and all that kind of stuff and the medical marijuana and just by saying you know they they come up with these frayed is if you're high won't fly get grounded\nOh there's just so that they already got the commercials are out there but I'm\nJ. P. I wanted to ask you what milligrams are you using and how are you using it Wendy use it because I my girlfriend and um I recommend it for her to look into CBD Oil\nAnd I would like to know what you know what kind of milligrams are using now which brand but just at least\nI use one milligram in the morning and one at night before bed\nOne night before bed again that's very good okay\nBecause I was in one milligram in the morning ... milligram at night if you want to like a DMV onto it or whatever it is I'll tell you exactly where you can go get it\nNot a problem I greatly appreciate it sir alright\nAlright just adds up but thank you good luck man then you're Martin's\nBecause there's no high I don't think I did know Hi from you took it in the studio that one day mhm right is there an felt toast I focus move right but not at all not high now bugs no nothing\nNo one felt like seriously it was like a low slow are groups move right and there wasn't any great overwhelming feeling was nice yeah so it was good but that was it was a definitely are\nA Patty's on line three ... hot day ragle\nAbout a guy like are you there we are go ahead [noise] um\nYeah so it's just so we'll be talking about I'm tapping candidates delivered\nTo your home or yes ...\nUm well I've been doing it ...\nYears old and that and doing it now for a couple of years old the\nPostal service delivers it like ... and I get it like every two or three weeks\nYou get mailed to you from like an actual we'd mailed from Colorado or somebody you knew the mailman but also to do it\nIt comes it comes from different places Colorado California oh well I ... the dark Web ... different places\nOr just on our Web wherever that find that that's a ... yeah [noise] but I'm told\nThat they'll get smell or the disguised as something else or it's dropped really well right and that's it\nIt's it's like in two or three different boxes and us in the u._s. postal box flexi blackie by and the you know like when you get you that touched off a little post office box as they get in and then in plastic and another ball so often\n[laughter] at how many boxes as a total that would be needed to wrap it safely [noise] um [noise] it is like usually\n[noise] are very late\nFriday [laughter]\nOh no dry number border you try to go for an hour literally yeah oh my goodness [laughter] one soldier Missouri that are now occupied four times are I'm In a minute increments God's not good not only do one\n[laughter] by what Roger J. P. seven to seven five seven nine one one through five eight hundred and Seventy Seventy one what I'll do five during this commercial break we all wish you good luck JV as you make your way through the vents though [laughter] we'll be right\nBut again anybody who's listening to me and they're gonna send me messages or whatever it is number one I'm not making a dime from this is a bone listener who set me up with this thing so I'm just following all you people over to him and if it works out great and if not I don't blame me\nI'm number one number two this stuff the one I'm using does have the AC in it you will pass positive it's got brace amounts on very small amount you will not get high you will not get ... bought mud and you will have positive so if you take a drug that I work this is about to Southfield\nYeah that's my concern\nAlright backstory below them and that's why again if you want to email me and she was on Twitter I'll get the information\nOr earnings on line to what's going on earning\nHey guys how you doing good I Want to talk about that or elderly woman who is getting it and it's from the dark Web\nOtherwise [laughter] yeah\nI I work in criminal investigations and the ... while narcotics is not my wheelhouse I Do have a little insight as to how bad of an idea that it's\nAll right ah just because they yeah just because it's packaged well does not mean she is not going to get busted one once\n[noise] once federal authorities flag a shipping address or shipper which it's very easy to get flagged all it takes a little old lady to get busted with a joint and she's going to give up how she buying it and they're gonna backs backtrack how she got a package\nAnd they're going to flag that ship or and then every shipment that comes out of that that particular\nPerson they're going to start nail in those people that are receiving so just because you buy it off the dark Web but\nAnyway so okay so ... well I\nThink about it and let's just say let's just say it's a half hours a week oh even announced elite Ramona and you're knocking on my door and I get in trouble what can I get a ticket when we do right\nWell you were well you were trafficking interstate traffic and you know it's been rough conduct\nOkay so it is different it's not just like I have a quarter to lead on me or not to wait on me it's the they get me for trafficking\nRight and they're gonna probably do multiple deliveries to your home [noise]\nMm a lot is what they do is check I teach that he delivered right\nIn the lead to packages just keep coming in on the couch just pile up and they look I'm going to you [laughter] okay everybody has all of them are earning that is not something we all get along you know it sounds like you're right yeah they could people so he got in trouble yeah exactly\nYou're right there people are trying to do any harm but they are the interstate trafficking is no joke so good point\nYeah yeah it makes you officer guys yeah for sure\nWhat like a whole discussion\nI mean I mean it's good that he called because you know you need some common sense in the discussion but because when it goes the interstate it's a whole different thing you I mean you nailed it we don't but I mean I have to buy the crosses the line your job\nWe've made an entire career out of having no common ... discussion and weight loss in the amount of normal amount of information right load on line\nThree what's going on I was a boy this is you know I'm good I'm good\nUh I'm always good to know a girl she got to punch out\nPeriod I now I Know I'm\n... period because I remember a larger city I I ramble but all we have today Lloyd receptors in her mind like were meant to do it and to me it's ridiculous that it's still a schedule it's still a schedule and\nLike it's up there with ... but yet and we all know the medical benefits it's it's it's a play what they're trying to do right now in my opinion is that they're trying to figure out how the government get the money how do we do this or they will get the money came like prohibition\nMight they be honest with you know the government is crazy not too crazy not\nTo say oh yeah it's it's just a because you know if it's federal\nFederal it's legal but statewide like California Colorado certain states is legal\nBut there that's the state's seeing if we did it we should really paid off our deficit is we just made it legal general\nOr by ... trillion dollars around you know on or were you know although\nI'm not understand that but [noise] literally talked about ... looking at Colorado did do a show one time the amount of eight children Adolf legalization Kevin this was ridiculous they're given schools money like that right money left over\nThere actually letting someone because I think the tax dollars ended up being over well over a billion dollars really good for them yeah oh yeah so\nImagine that the state wide uh we could really\nMhm which actually when I talk to them as they can figure it out you know depending what there are people that are there are\n... period period and start but um ... another thing is I mean I Know I I got my own issues I got you know I got punched for a living and all that much to me it's\nThe one real matter so like all the pharmaceuticals stuff I've tried everything\nOr not not too good and that messes with your liver and all that this is one thing you can never overdose on there's no one in the history of the world that's over ... ...\nOh well I mean that's the only way to ... to ... falls on a true [laughter]\nMy God ... exclamation I actually\nI cannot wait to meet you at the ... are you fighting army will\nGet along I'm doing much better look I I did a little which\nWill do it's not the work rules here in Florida but what I use a short for medicine you\nKnow fighting right yeah I'm supposed to be fun to guys at once\nI was going to do they know do they know we were never met a guy\nOh yeah my ...\nMy own and you know did he was telling me opponents\nI don't know what they're tricked what der der ... it's funny 'cause I go to the middle of gorilla they're calling\nMy twenties so we'll talk too much so he's trying to get a Indian and the black guy to fight me [laughter]\nFalls to pass a\nReal job which means he goes to have three but especially it's weird because there's\nJust I I like to cook but literally as far as large in\nConversation you guys go ... on the bold I Do appreciate very much say look this is true Lewis I'll let you draw the line from Germany and Harriet [laughter] let alone [noise]\nRibs it could be forgiven played off the book I Can't wait to me and pick on to do to do is be the best policy [laughter] I didn't want them one of those\nAre wrong on Mars you didn't tell a company on line to go to [noise]\n[noise] so um I was just listening to you guys talking about having that ship silver lining\nOvum over you know male and everything and and getting charged for trafficking and I just wanted to point out it's very easy and the state of Florida it prescribes medical marijuana right now um\nIt's it's not hard and you don't have to do anything illegally um I was actually prescribed two months ago and um I was diagnosed with P. T. S. E. I've never been in the military I've never been through anything really extremely traumatic um\nBut I don't know\nI have extreme nightmares um I have really bad nightmares and I'll wake up at two AM and I just\nI Can't go back to sleep I'm afraid to get back into that nightmare and I had last days of sleep over it and because of losing sleep and the sleep deprivation it also kind of makes me delusional from not sleeping so um I was prescribed two months ago\nIt was very easy it was a little expensive I did have to plan for it and save up for it but\nI was approved and no time and now I don't have to worry about\nDoing things illegally medicate myself and it actually does help I sleep every night no problem\nReally know marketers are nightmares or whatever\nTo be honest with you I'm so stone to when I go to sleep I wouldn't remember during by had one\nBut no I have no [laughter] I don't know how to nightmare in my\nUm and I can tell you a CBD Oil that people are buying from head shop this was supposed to be by the doctor\nIt's made from the hemp plant which is a family of candidates but it's not the candidate plant things like that CBD Oil that I'm taking at night it's totally different than the it's from a different planet than what you can buy at a at a regular\nAt some level of more legal or something is what you're saying\n... hemp oil is not a legal uh-huh at all at all or is it legal to grow it I Believe but I mean they make like him why they make a lot of things that have um\nAnd and so they can they can legally make\nCBD Oil out of camp and that's where you see the signs and like Tampa that say you know we have ... for your dog or CBD Oil for your dog that that's from the ... plant that's not from the candidates plan and a lot of people are paying a lot of money\nMaking their eating candidates oil and they're not at all and I didn't even know that until I visited the doctor but it's not\nThat ... you don't have to be terminal any more to get in the state of Florida and I mean you can still get a DUI I'm driving down you know you can't do it in public you can't you can't even really discuss it\nYeah so and I can understand that that's an interesting argument because there's no assumption made on that one side or however the rule talks about\nUm if a fan interferes with a player\nIn a situation where um they have a possibility of making a play like using them bits of making a play so even though fans are there and even though fans are reaching over and that's all okay ah you cannot interfere with a player and so he was interfered with\nAnd so that makes it um it out\nRight but how is he interfere with if nobody leaned over the fence you know is that you well it's a ... so what are they so now all of a sudden the fans are supposed to back away while it's just part of that I mean that's one of the fence steady income or they didn't mean onto the play it was over the wall right well that's supposed to be in overall you know\nWhat they're touching a ball that's actually in play and so that interferes with the players ability to make the play and so that's why they call it about the\nBad so his glove is over the correct he's allowed to ride the fans are allowed to correct their right but they're not allowed to interfere with ... but they didn't the rules and whatever anyway rules three dot once his glove hit the fan the fans didn't hit the glove well that's arguable\nOne of the road I argue one of the rules I saw I was no interference shall be allowed when a player reaches over a fence right that's where he got\nNo interference shall be allowed when you are making little dog had your ... you may not interfere with a player reaches they have\nTo give the play room to make the play because otherwise years which again they're going to start putting up the wall and then there's going to be eight feet and then you're gonna start setting and if they had to so that no fan can ever interfere with something that's possible for the person for a player to catch\nAnd those are seen coming due and those in rows of seats that can make money rush but I have a happy right\nRight so there's a there's a difference you know the easy one is the ball in his rolling down the right field line at a fat reaches over from their seats and almost tumbled out of the seats in picks the ball up before it bounces off the wall and gets to the field that's the easy one\nClearly the player who didn't get to play it and so they're they're going to buy the rules for that whether it's a double or whatever the deal is but in this case or the color so eb ... oh Houston is pissed because now the red Sox are up three one and they happened to win by two runs which is what the whole ... would have been for all to me if it had been a lot\nSo it's very controversial\nAnd ah jade opted not happy but\nAt the time I mean I saw it live and you know Joe ... is a veteran empire was worse has this years of being a veteran and hit it but they all want but I don't even know because George has been around forever and he's awesome you never hear him he's he's not like who's the guy ...
