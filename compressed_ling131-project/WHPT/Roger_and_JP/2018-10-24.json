whatever and then the other side can do the same thing\nBut that's what I'm saying even if even if one side says it and then the other side of Phoenix or whatever they want to make a political then or fitness level whatever then do that to people not have their own brains to feed it so then then it's all just a waste of time it's all it at theatre mhm at that point because\nWe can make their own minds up about everybody is never going to say one thing is always going to be split opinions and in five or seven different\nOpinions or whatever it is\nIt's all it is all a giant game and the American people are pawns\nCattle room ... upon yes I have my brain yet\nBecause right but they wanted to they want the power they don't care about you they just want to be in power so everything that that's what they want so they can get there through and get to take care of their people\nAnd we've gone through a thousand times it's a game to them it's about the ... when it's not about the people it's about the when you've heard me say that what times\nAny thoughts on both sides of fat and Republicans won on depart out playing a game and why does every why are they then they're laughing at a at people that are like a Democrat not lead right and and and then the ... that they're laughing at the Democrats than all horrible or how they're laughing at at we're turning against each other and they're laughing at that match ran against each other\nAnd you know they they just want to turn you in their direction so you go out to the polls and vote their way to put them in power so they can get their envelopes\nI feel like as a way to do that without going against each other\nI got you know what I'll do it all you have a situation like when you have a situation like this it is somebody's job some press person's job to spin it in a direction that helps that cause\nWell or you can look at it this way they they all have their discussions on CNN and MSNBC every channel tonight right they're gonna round table talking discussions and they're all going to start making theories and one's going to say what they think another thing and it's all it's not news it's just people talking like we're doing\nSo that's going to be on the news stations but it's not gonna be news but they're gonna they're gonna do that so they're going to be talking about all this stuff that we just\nYou know what it could be who it could be why it could be how that would sway people our could sway votes advocates where the image of trouble with the image of ... where the image of the Democrats\nWow now I don't know how or when or why it became down if someone thinking with a bright idea ... you know a real bomb or not a real bond that you have any kind of any of that involved in it and then she part\nHow maybe what if it is someone from outside doing this in the country and trying to just create some chaos and they're starting with sending packages to everybody who's a Democrat or our media trying to get that thing going and they um just whatever their goal is and that's how they're starting and another point to listen to all Republican\nOr whatever whatever the situation so you don't know the person's motivation and we don't\nKnow where this has started that that isn't that scary I have someone come out and they were all to the infighting they even know oh that's a scary thought\nAbout stuff like this is what brings you know the the the ... a big disaster you know nine eleven nobody was in fighting everybody was on the same thing it's unfortunate that that's what it took for all we all get on\nThe same yeah exactly you brought up that good point before it's like you know ten years ago however many years ago we don't ...\nAutomatically think it was outside entity trying to do much in our country and now she's up against us first\nThing we talked about his right the right of the left or it could be someone else that could the Russians could be anybody anybody just fomenting chaos whatever the goal the reason is one of the goal is right you know you don't know and it could be just one you know one dude Wilbur from Tennessee\nHappen to get it All right we'll call you know yeah\nWhy not Gene Wilder one\nGuy and he just drove around the Midwestern mailed them and got it All right I'm going to bomb that um [laughter] a little bit once we got 'em on tape [laughter] ...\nYeah first and foremost I just want to see what else you want it or not or that we've got hurt a lot if you get on the Internet by a lot of the tourist in yesterday it was almost like it's been brought up a couple of\nDemocrats trying to sway the election but my main point is is it really surprising that it's gotten to the point okay Roger said just a couple of minutes\nOr so troops will discourse at all anymore I'm nobody's actually generating a productive speech back ... and it seems as though the strengths are being called by whoever enters covers up on both sides\nRepublicans Democrats or whatnot\nAnd I think if Facebook or anywhere in the Internet you're seeing people when he figures all over the place I think there's a desperation and America on just to find out what the truth is\nIt I I think you're going to have more and more situations of crazy ex by crazy people because of that kind of general feel\nMaybe I said that the other day and earlier were at a point where we're going we're at the point now so I don't know if we're at the point now where you have to read if there's a topic you want to read about that in the papers you have to read it from three different sources\nThe same about the same topic you have to read it from three different stories and then trying to do what you think the truth might be because who what where when and why the five questions that with a cornerstone of questions that with a cornerstone of journalism out the window [laughter]\nOut there and it's\nYou know it's becoming a point to where the facts don't mean anything it's if something is repeated enough that becomes the new reality yeah that's where that's where everybody kind of points that you know the\nFake news or the mass media or whatever because they tend to just repeat the same talking points and then that is that is the truth that's the reality and it's it's rewriting are are current history and or or current facts ridiculous\nI took one journalism class when I was at school or college I loved it this guy the guy the teacher was like a like a mean old ... but\nHe was like a stickler it's like you have a job as a journalist your opinion doesn't matter Runyon reports the facts right that's what it should have that dude is still alive you Robert ready to kill them\nSex actually ...
