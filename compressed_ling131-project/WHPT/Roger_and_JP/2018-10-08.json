are the voters are to the original angry women warring called liberal\nOr Democrats only Republican women were women with an asterisk and I found it very interesting\nI found that very interesting and says uh you'd think the election of twenty sixteen would have taught us that women aren't some monolithic block\nAll thinking in voting the same way but the Kavanaugh hearings have once again exposed a less expectation of women all having the same opinions on a given event well they don't when they don't the conservative female's opinion or is the outlier\nWhile that of a woman on the left requires no qualifier\nIn time magazine playwright eve ... wrote a letter to women\nWho supported Kavanaugh she wrote a that the letter was intended not to quote lecture them or quote denigrate them yet it did fall where she compared women who support Kavanaugh to her mother who look the other way as her father sexually abused her\nAnd and this thing goes on and it gets really really dark and places but I found it interesting what I what I did find interesting was the part when you when people were angry at Kavanaugh they were\nImmediately like on the left there was no qualifier but on the right there were um they were listed as Republicans all listed as conservatives and I'm just like\nI don't know I don't know maybe I'm just making something up in the I just read the article I thought it was really\nI'm going to ... you have it my sympathy and all I did not send it to you I did not in the ... you should read it though because it's interesting because it said it said hold they're trying to rally all women but not all women were angry and\nIf you looked at like if you weren't angry about it because it's like you know we need to stick up for a mother is our wives our daughters and then there are other women who are saying yes but we also need to protect our son's father's our husbands\nAnd when accusations alone can tear them down we have a problem and it was that whole back and forth back and forth\nLike the only two different things that you know on Twitter I bus and gotten a bunch of support\nAnd when we discussed this and I my opinion so that once you have and I've also gotten a bunch and you're an idiot on and which is fine [laughter] well yeah but the you're the you're the idiots ones on the ones that I've responded to it and I can get to um\nI where I think it's liberal liberal you know right liberal liberal liberal and I missed the every single person who I responded to and who kept saying that to me I don't I personally don't think of this\nAs a Republican or a liberal Democrat conservative any any of that that you need us into humans right human rights issue like I feel like this woman I it's my opinion I'm allowed to have it just like I'm allowed to have the air's right in my opinion this did happen to this woman and I feel for her I don't care if she's a Republican or Democrat anybody\nWho is put in that situation in my opinion it shouldn't they shouldn't bring politics into it and that's what I mean obviously I Know that the situation is about him and whatever but I it was about politics but we'll at least about politics it was about him getting the job or not and I don't think I don't care if he's a Republican or a Democrat\nRight and given that entire situation it's my opinion after watching all of that ... that he shouldn't have gotten it having said that I don't want to be accused of get over it and want to get help and of course it happened it was done and I thought you know we're all in America all American so I'm excited it I just I don't think that right but would you miss if you hear\nWhat I was talking about what this article is it's what the media is doing the media the way the media covers it the way the media covers it in a whole lot of cases is about if it's a woman who was angry she's just a woman who was angry\nBut if it's if someone who's a if it's a woman who is a Republican or you know conservative whatever it is then she's conservative woman or Republican woman\nFrom they saw that I absolutely if someone in the media did that\nOn ... you know give you an example here yeah did you read\nYour natural ... whoever did that I don't know who they are or whatever but I really I understand what you're saying and I absolutely agree that it shouldn't be that way it should right you shouldn't you shouldn't have to do that I feel like it's such a sensitive issue and I that's my exam that will I feel like when I when people are bringing in liberal or\nAnd so it it shouldn't be that way it's to me it just shouldn't be that way\nAnd that's you know I understand that it was a political issue in but at the same time I don't that's what makes it worse in my opinion if if there are people in the media that are going to do that now than\nIt says are using person in the article goes on to say but using personal trauma to inform opinions on the Supreme Court nominee only seem to work in one direction so this goes back to the woman who said if you supported Kavanaugh than you are no different than my mother who you know supported my father when he was molested me whatever\nIf it was me I'd be flipping over God damn\nTable just having everything do you know how\nI'm going to have everybody told me I did something if I truly know that I'm not guilty and I don't know about Kevin amusing to me if someone's coming in swearing up and down and I'm not guilty I'm going to fight back like a mother\nNow and how old are you going to the table food is going to be table flying over there's going to be chairs you're going to have to restrain me\nYou're also not in a position to be a judge what you're supposed to be on writing but you\nCan't but what I'm saying is you can't lock your guy\nYes I was in Russia is so much\nYou can and I don't know how do you feel all like you just got in and saying if someone's accusing you or something and you know you didn't do it and you you demand justice what about all those houses the people in this world that\nAre in that same situation and they still get found guilty and they go to jail and they have no one to fight for them and they had not a shock because they couldn't afford a good lawyer back to back on getting out in this case happens all the time but you can ...\nYou could barely legal and he and he's on camera those other issues who you don't know what went on behind caught\nBehind closed doors when you don't you don't know about some guy the guy to choose the going killing somebody is going to jail didn't do it you know that we are\nYeah but we cannot let me finish you don't know that he didn't lose his monitor cell flipping tables over to defend themselves you know that he didn't do that\nActually did get anybody who's been wrongly accused you're is going to flip stuff over differences\nIs that these people that a lot of people have had to deal with it their entire lives both legally and not legally just accused of anything on a daily basis because of the color of their skin\nSo you know basically you're pissed off at this guy because he he lived the life ... no\nNot not at all good for him I never begrudge anybody if you had a good good for you but appreciate that and don't take it for granted and don't just assume everything's going to go your way because of who you\nAre but I don't think he lives in the world and back or it why\nIs fighting back and getting upset and getting uptight and and getting animated why does that make him a bad person\nI I never said anybody who just before you just said I never\nSaid he was a bad person I said I didn't I don't expect that out of someone in his position is exactly what I said because in he's are you telling me there's not going to be a case on Supreme Court that he feels emotional about and how do I know he's not going to let his emotions get the best of him in that situation he needs to be a judge he needs to be comical and collected and ... ... yeah ... needs to be that\nI think he needs to be ... like it at all times at least in public you can go home and talked to his wife\nAbout whatever whatever but when you're if\nYou don't often witty mocked is not out of it as long as the bond talk\nTo her but if but if he can't it doesn't have the ability to maintain composure you and I can't we're used to be an emotional this guy should be able\nTo argue that it would be a judge yeah well you know we'd be John J.

on this one and and I'm not a liberal I'm not a Democrat and I'm just an American and I believe that he was on a job interview and there were other highly qualified conservative judges behind him and he failed his job interview and there is no doubt about that\nIf you were on a job interview and acted like that may be in radio they still might give you a chance but probably not right\nIf I acted like that I'd probably get not only way I get the job I'd probably get more money a deal\n[laughter] but you're not a Supreme Court judge though you know what I mean right and and that's where it falls short for me I mean there's other people and he could've healed America a little bit because we're in big trouble if he does it and he could have\nPicked another judge a woman or conservative someone who's very conservative at least you would have put an effort in\nAnd tried to heal the country that's what a president should do\nI I Know I Know just from talking to a special dead who follow this stuff like it's his job um\nThe next one up was a check and he goes if they were worried about Kavanaugh\nYou had no idea what this 'cause there's apparently the woman who was way more conservative than Kavanaugh is so\nIt would have been than it would have been in the whole what are they going to go against that it's just that listen again I'd buy a boil it all down to this again and this will be the last time we talk about on the show I promise\nIt's all about the when\nNeither team cares about\nThe American people they care about the wind and maintaining power and being able to get things done both sides Republicans and the Democrats they don't\nCare agree when you're a hunter they they don't care about you they don't care about me they care about power I don't care I don't care\nAnd and and and if the Democrats were in power the Republicans would have been pulling the same tricks that the Democrats were doing\nAnd vice versa that's a fact that the fact\nIt's higher ground a hundred percent of what you know and what's really scary about\nIt is as bad as it is now I don't know how it gets any better\nI don't know how it doesn't get was just this country we are going to have\nDoes it get better with leadership that's just not start with the president is this not does he not have a an eight and nine to five cents I\nSit down and I don't see because you know I don't\n[noise] I guess he's\nChoking the fire is her name and I mean that's all we don't need I mean I agree with some of those policies but he's spoken to fire and that's going to destroy us all the exact\nUh and I don't disagree with the way his behavior I don't and I do think I Do think he's doing a lot of good that's really not getting a lot of press um but I Do think there's a lot of good that happening you know it's but I don't think he I don't think I don't say my Monica don't say go ahead this I got to hear you told me highest\nPress I buy completely\nStopping with all the unnecessary\nNegative tweets with with all the distractions that he created something you said that you might not that can kill themselves if he takes only all of that\nAnd he can thinking all day long you can eat and laughable any about whatever he can do all of that privately but when he when he shows to the public will get a lot more attention if he doesn't have all this stuff that the media can attack him for ... style\nYou great to just stop\nIdea but it doesn't matter because the reason he's doing it they're not covering the good stuff any of it\nBut if you do now you only have ... like stop\nThe only ... Monica come on come on\nJust looking at what what do you think it's going to happen if they don't want to call the good stuff because they don't want them they want to survive damage them ... treated Ron Mexico which I think that they would have no choice you have to come and the president and there's nothing negative coverage\nYou have to cover what he's doing but even if you are right even if they they don't want to win so they opt out he's still why doesn't he tweet that like he can talk about how he's\nBack all the time and it actually but don't actually want a negative stuff I agree with you on the back this we can't\nThis we can't disagree on I agree that unfortunately in order for him to get the the the good news stuff out there the African American unemployment numbers being so low unemployment being so low jobs being so high um all that stuff doesn't get put out by the media but you know why boring so he does it\nAnd if he would stick to doing that so unfortunately he's got a two does on on if he just did that I'd be totally cool with it I Wish you would stop being a hump\nAnd stop like the like the ... the poking with the stick tweets\nHe's just not doing it you know\nThey're not doing something that's ... but to dig around the\nWorld or what\nAnd why gay guy people come on yeah well they have an animal because we can sit there and keep talking about that till the cows come home and\nYou and I ended on a on the agreement things so we might as well I'm a great success bringing together my thoughts on 'em\nAnd testing led to go with the guy that I have is somebody that you know from the history books you've learned about 'em and\nNo doubt about it\nEvery single one of us has learned about them in school and the un American he is not\nAn American he is not an American ...\nWould you like to play along [noise] or did he die in the past five years or he did not die in the past when a\nNo he did not die in the last five years I mean the guy and they have brown hair\n[noise] um well I'm not [laughter] yeah let's say twenty five years looked like he had around his hair [noise] yes not by the time he died he didn't die young man [noise] yeah All right\nSo he's the guy that you know from the uh you know from the history books you learned about them in school is not an American Columbus or it is not Christopher Columbus um\n[noise] for Mr religion this day and it's not an okay eight hundred Seventy seven one one or two five or Seventy seven five seven I Want it to five Roger shape you want to divide the ball over already I'll throw it back [noise]\nShe\nRuns on one side to side\nStreet when she was like five to Boone your smart\nSpeaker simply telling them to play\nTwo point five the bone one oh two point five the bone get the point lane one or two point five\nTwenty five percent off on new NFL Seventy percent off previously refreshing get really need a better reason a party we don't think south or new court punishment clearance contract with more than nine thousand square feet of new and previously in these furniture and acorn for your home and not so fast time one Ninety nine Ninety nine bedrooms that's some real Ninety nine Ninety nine\nDining out some two Ninety nine Ninety nine animal I presented prizes and find all weekend long at are canceling court franchise clear and start wondering nine for six ...

hurricane Michael's all of a sudden a formed and I know right now it's a category\nOne but at the same category do category three but more\nOf the panhandle\nIs going to the direct to kind of thing but it'll heavier areas the Tampa area is supposed to get a whole bunch of rain from it\nUm you know what's funny is and I you know I really hope that doesn't you know doesn't do any damage in that everybody stay safe but it would be it was so cool out this morning it's been so hot and unknowingly you know Ninety degrees and and write you ready for fall type of weather and so this morning when it wasn't blistering crazy hot\nAnd it was kind of cloudy on like this feels like fall but then I remembered it because of the\nRain that's about to hit us um I guess tropical storm hype conditions so wary and rain and there's a storm surge watching manatee county and they say north of men and the county so that would be a\nForm when I'm when one of those ... your area it\nIt's going to hit on um what they will Wednesday but it'll head before then we'll be getting those as it heads up there you'll be getting a little like today tonight tomorrow next couple of days ago just about any ... any rainy and\nOr ball really what am I going to storm or ...\n...\nA new roof smooth [laughter] All right so shouldn't get that crazy but I don't have any chance John Brennan goes back\nOn a cruise ship for the next couple of days into the Gulf of Mexico or crush if he really cared about the people who take make that kind of sacrifice\nI was talking to people yesterday at at there a lot of the way you have a lot of Roger ... show has a lot of buffalo bill fans 'cause there I was at and have built by yesterday because of me\nNow I'm just saying a lot of people listen to your show and it's pretty cool on the but they did say that a lot of people telling me to tell you to stop wishing AOL and John ... specifically in his father's not is oh it's his fault yeah\nUs not being on the list that I break ... all the time I happen to like him a lot and have a lot of respect for him I really do but I was not being on a cruise is absolutely has will not\nLet me rephrase that the handling of the crews between us and the radio station is one hundred percent on him he invited us and told us we were going this year and then uninvited\nI feel like you must maybe he spoke too soon and maybe it was it on him that he invited you\nLike All right yeah if you like it is\nOne of those right it's on him that's why all my anger is aimed at him\nNow it's not he's not the reason you're not unemployed right now I have all of our meeting or whether you ask them if we're going on a cruise or not\nNo no no no no no\nThat was after we said right exactly yeah\nAnd like are you sure go all through one yeah and that's the last we heard of it right and then ... and then let me Tom\nCruise came up in conversation he would just protect we weren't even speaking\nYeah yeah well they I mean I I feel like

engagement or whatever he just was like yeah your I mean\nWell part of the thing was they wanted us to so they wanted us to sell trips to our morning show audience\nAirs the money I knew there was a money and go somewhere\nAnd when we decided we didn't want to spend a year hawking trips Mm Mm um because you know it's different you guys are in Tampa the boat was I think leaving out of ... with us you got to throw airfare and their ... and now you're talking about\nFor two people sometimes most of the times airfares nowadays around four hundred bucks so it's automatically an extra eight hundred bucks and Roger and I will like and we were crazy about the idea of you know so and and really you got to sell those trips for like a year yeah but you know they'll start selling what are they will take two weeks off in public cruise twelve ... who's Thirteen will\nBe on an even talking about this forever right they talk about it for a long time we didn't want to do it not knocking it was just

you're on a budget\n[laughter] well I mean I didn't realize that you guys have opted not to ... and I understand why any obviously that's a lot of extra work by right maybe it it's kind of its tail and we don't waste it on ... and\nI didn't I never once was John Brennan that never\nWhen I read on the edges ... I wanted him to bleed out of his but for a couple of days and you know\nThe kind of feel like we're in a place in time where we can handle the Ebola virus now so [laughter]\nHe's off the ship so he's probably listening I Know is off the shirt and sending me emails I'm well aware he's a\nHe's off the ship is even at work you\n... I went there in the beginning of the show and he wasn't and it's like eleven thirty and he wasn't there\nAt fire I think I like all the bears any office and he works hard AS Port work ethic Michael over there I think my ... he was like why is my fourth of the ... of course he did\nHe get involved in the politics of it all he's just a good he's just a good man like all of our hooked up for sure what do you need to take it for you must be able to go see\nSomething like ... ... you know like all the you know how I found out my front\nConvict that guy out of a wind up going to be a good chef [noise] because ah [noise]\nTo a total of football comeback show and then you've got your big winner you probably want to talk about I wouldn't mind about my hatred foe debacle junior ...\nOnce\nNot once thrown any member of his team onto the bus offensively\nDefensively none of it in and takes it\nHe puts it on himself that's who you want as a leader on your team he's not as a hall of fame quarterback he's not\nBut he's Eli and if you watch the last drive which I was able to catch that what you got to ... how when you can keep 'em on his feet he's able to get some stuff done now isn't it\nYou just don't want him on the team at all\nI don't want them in the locker on um on on the more I don't I Want to get let them be somebody else's problem I Know we got 'em now we're stuck with them\nIf they would have traded him last year after the the hooker enough cocaine or the\nWeed and the volt level that all the nonsense I Would have been totally cool with the people running a photo was nuts I don't like\nI don't want to but I don't I don't I just don't I don't want it I don't want it any money or do any of the team I don't like\nThe lens will change your mind when only change minds that role\nBut you know what when Lawrence Taylor was doing it he wasn't taking shots of the team he may have been out doing coke tonight before he may have been doing blasting between down I have no one to the bottom\nLine is that guy went out there and and and put a team on his back\nYou know you can't sit there and you're watching the Eli run for his life every ... every snap and you're going to have the balls to say I'm not getting targeted enough if I was trying to keep yourself alive if you had to be in that position and you're constantly getting your head knocked off\nYou know what I'm saying and he never once put anybody puts it on anybody else but um so how do\nThey need to be a better job and how would how does the team that feel like I understand you feel on me but like I used the team like well that's just a ... a teammate that's how it is\nA good listener I caught a little bit of the um\nThe ... the post game conference I caught a little bit of I'm On my way home I'm clearly the head coaches livid um the other players that they interviewed they didn't really delve into any of the adult stuff and I haven't gotten a chance to read all the papers yet to see what the story is but\nYou know I don't know I don't know I just hate it\nI Want to know why ... ... signatures from that interview on ESPN I didn't say this was he really well the interview with the commons was little ... and I don't know why oh I'm sure it was a little ... I had no idea\nI had no idea what made it there there was a good idea [laughter] and where do you want credibility right you know if this is the problem\nIs and then he said he doesn't apologize for the common right and blah blah blah and listen I understand if you're going to say something don't back down and and stick with it but just don't see it in the first place just you know be a team died just for once just be a team guy\nI mean I I don't agree with you know everything he says everything he does but he ... he he's such a game changer when he's right he's an absolute game changer white\nWhen there and keep your eye on the seat back I'm going to be a ... you know how we changed the game yesterday but if an up on special teams and letting the ball touch them\nThat's how we have to be gave you an seem Super Bowl or a ... a touched them to do oh Dell or does those things they had them on ... returns right right so he wasn't going to get there he tried to block somebody from Caroline out of the way the ball hit him right away from both touch them\nRight that's what I should have been right but he had a great place to of course it would have done better than a call ... right I get it I get it you will you learned is is if you keep you up you can be a factor if you don't you're not going to catch him either way shut your mouth own your mistakes\nTake responsibility for stuff that might not even be your fault but take responsibility for it anyway because I realized that in the leader\nYou want to come up you got paid the highest amount of money if anyone receiving the week we'd like to think you can be a leader in the locker room right no need to not a Dick\n... some players are just six of them do and not for him it's like there's none\nZero zero and you don't have to however he makes the boys exist on these on your team he's got the capability of being a game changer there's no question about it I just like I said\nYou don't have to like I mean I feel like you have to like if he's on the team that you like you don't have to like some of his ashes did you have to stand by hand until he's not you have to\nHave to stand by whoa whoa whoa I don't understand why anybody\nI feel like if that is he plays on your team you have to you have to be on his side\nIf I'm playing alongside of him but his being somebody who was a fan of the team and a fan of the globe and all the all the stuff you act like a ... I'm going to tell you act like a douche seen okay\nThat's why I have so much respect for the lie because he's not a hall of fame quarterback but he's got two Super Bowl MVPs and when the game was on the line and you can keep them on his feet yeah he's a difference maker\nAnd he's never ever think about it again I I feel like I'm repeating myself the guy's constantly running for his life he's doing interviews and radio after\nEvery single game and he's never once said well if my God damn offensive line to keep me on my roof a little while we can get some points\nBut that's not him and he's very boring ... as a a he has he has a sense of humor I was when he acted was paid in direct TV commercials on Saturday Night live right a little bit of that but it was when it comes on I own video you just bored\nRight but if anybody has the ability to say something even one Tommy kind of wanted him to consult calling us all kinds of one out a little bit right but then it's like okay if he calls out as often as one that was going to really be a train the you know a a complete train wreck who's gonna get killed David on line one good David\nAgency love the show us over ... ...\nA man I don't care what kind of player you or I don't care which position you play you don't go into the knock them down or you're only allowed to do it all you don't you don't do that to your team\nRight I wouldn't know\nPart of the game but you are you're lucky you I was wondering is that a Lebanese\nYou go to other labs are doing is constantly running for his life even when he's got time he doesn't think he's got time he was going to get killed 'cause you have is always going to go to you know here's the thing you know I Do not seem to\nKnow a one hundred percent one hundred percent you just don't do it and here's the thing like [noise] every one of the show is later but\nEvery once in a while I get is doing interviews I'm Roger get us to do interviews for local or whatever it is I'm happy hour somebody's podcast whatever it is good for you\n[laughter] this part of the gig right if I didn't think Roger was holding up his then or if I didn't think Brett withhold and others then you let everybody know I Would never [laughter] ever let it out of these four walls ever\nI don't ever I find that extremely tough to believe I\nI'm In an interview I was in an interview again when you land on ... on air to us\nYeah like right now like on air right now\nOn air to us all of us in the room with the conversation comes up and I didn't feel like somebody was owed them on the hold on yet but I Would do to them\nAn on air is what we do but I Would never do it too into the press or to um an interview somebody who's podcast or say I'm Better than them or I did it ever and if you think that you do not know who I Am\nNow I Know and I I didn't realize that you were saying that interview I understand the interview part but you do realize ... I Know that you would say something on air here like if they were if you had an issue with someone and it it it was off air but we went on there and show started falling out on air Monica ...\nWe kept we had a three day blackout with you for three days correct\nI Am ... years around a track I Want I Want well hold on I wanted\nTo I wanted to have it out on the air every single day and I chose not to have you on a ... and when we finally famous at all we did it off the air we had a phone call and we got everything taken care of right\nWhat do you call the ... the beforehand before all of that that was on your you had a problem with me you set it on air and that's what that was the catalyst\nIt was a problem because it was we were in the middle of a conversation and then you just disappeared regardless\nHad a million and want opportunities to go food blessed and it wasn't the right thing to do so we didn't do it\nI I just feel like there's been a lot of times where you've called me out specifically but once in awhile Roger I'm In and very rarely brat where something might have happened on the air and then you bring out and saying okay here's what happened and you you leave\nIt on right but the thing this stuff between you and I was on there so I had to be dealt with on it and that but that's my point is I don't I've never brought anything from or any off the air stuff between me and Raj on the air ever\nKnown it hasn't had there been a lot you told me like maybe two fights or something\nExactly my point I I've never had any issues at any time ... ... I just feel like ... or anything off there doesn't come on they're\nJust not know that I've lived through you calling me out on air\nFor suffer the stuff that's going on on the air\nOr when you Sarah manning remember what the incident was our ... our I don't even remember the the occasion I should say\nWell I'm ... I'm going to tell me I saw that I hate you work or they learn whatever yeah your work now and all the fare and then you\nBrought it on there I'm not I'm not that's not what not my point is is I feel like you would say it on air and maybe not in an\nInterview doing it on our is our job okay I mean it could be our job what I'm saying is he's doing is or the press if he wants to get up in the

back tomorrow sort of shows that for a\nOne shot and others have done one one was your father's a number of some two seven five seven nine five is the number\nAt Roger and Jay pee on Twitter or we were just talking about the whole giants ... can be in the ... bag and\nMe not wanting them on the team and the one I didn't want them to son to the big money contract because I knew the older cancer behavior was just going to be a it was just going to get worse when he had money and so far I'm not exactly all that wrong uh and then\nWe got into some other Tom comments about\nI don't like having um I don't like people talking about the teammates or press that bothers me that in a hotel was you know making comments that maybe some of the offensive was what you ... and I was just like I just thought it was horrible I'm Becky online for what's up backing\nHey I Love your show to start with you I couldn't understand quite a ... point of view because I'm a woman just because I was listening to the story and it's like he has his team should consider you guy hurricane roll it only gets race between\nYou and not football player as you have the access to be on the area ... stuff he doesn't so he just disgusted and the press and he made a comment\nThat that kind of stuff going on with your team\nWhatever your team maybe ... or ... or the should be held behind closed doors those discussions Monica field there is an issue with you guys on her team right shape seals probably like it should be discussed not on the air\nWell there was a couple of things but it shows on it is it bends on was talking about the last one that happened broke out on the air there was no having it off the air it happened on the air\nRight the time we were on that we were at the I was the nuts alive gig or whatever it is a monitor was running around telling people how much you hated me and she was drunk and just on the other thing\nIs right it can actually happened I wasn't running around telling people\nAre [noise] are you made it a wedding country if he was in the\nArea yeah I was running around listener\n'em and you at the same time you know I hate this guy's now that is that is on the air to in the past you said that\nWith me so you had that situation on to the air that\n... that one I did yeah ... ... yeah\nSave that for me that would be on the ferry to bring it on the air\nBut you'll be like you would have gone out to a lab you or your child is learning that old thing on their\nWhat I Do remember was we won the first ones to bring it on the air counter was\nOh I didn't hear that I have around about ... talked about the\nDay so you just so you just carried it on that we can do that all the way to to get bad ... right\nWhen I was ... when I was trying to say earlier wasn't maybe I didn't get the point outright um if I felt like Roger wasn't holding up his and or if I felt like Brett weren't holding up their rent and doing the job well Monica for that matter\nOf doing the job to the best of their ability whether it was doing show prep or whether it was um being lazy or whatever it is that stuff would not be handled by mayor right\nRight when I get all give me ... all sort of every situation\nThat may go on with our team they should just be dealt with\nNot on the air [laughter]\nWell I mean I agree with that of course what went on a business though\nWell I mean I wouldn't want that either as a human being I just want somebody you whether it be my work partner or my friends to just blast might be a hero what may have done it out to the public\nI mean we we don't know me\nRight we and honestly the monitors stuff they got went out on the air is stuff that happened either at in work circumstances in front of other people there's nothing there's no conversation that Monica and I have ever had off the air just the two of us where\nI felt like she was misbehaving missed not misbehaving but saying something wrong and then I brought it out and out of the people I've never done that I never would have a way\nWhere it happened and I just I just don't feel like I needed to be perpetuated any longer than it already Mike helpless I just saw it gets blown out of proportion\nLBJ [laughter] why [laughter] and your fault it's someone else's fault\n[laughter] anyway I Love you guys always\nRight on it was an I'll jump on my own sword all the time I Do\nI'm very self deprecating if I'm not holding up my end or if if we did a segment and I think it went flat bread it might not the first one is say sorry man screw that went up sure I'll do it all the time I don't I don't ever and Roger or of Roger had an idea and it's not working\nWe will hang up the Mike and I'll be like what happened there I'm afraid we're not going to talk about it we're gonna have a conversation but it doesn't need to go on the air we always need to know who screwed up when our own business\nGetting back to the adult stuff and the man used of listen I don't want to talk about it anymore either but it's happened to work it happened the less what happened on the air\nDoesn't know yeah\nI listen I don't even I'm not even slightly I just think you're not this time obviously today I was just making the comparison but other than today it with me making a comparison all the other times it would be re brought up by you and I know that you have issues with letting stuff though and ... and all of that\nI don't so once we had that on the conversation\nOn nobody telling you they have to do\nI tell people I hate them\nAll the time like I ... that is why I think that you took that still seriously that that more than ... and I didn't hire incident that was more shocking to me how seriously you took\nWhat but I don't have people telling me they hate me all the time shocking\nI'm actually yeah actually I'm a little surprised you don't have more people telling you that but I had people tell me they Amy I tell people I hate you\nAll the time and you know I didn't really have been taking so personally are so seriously and I would've never Senate if I would've known that I just assumed you would if it would have been a light hearted\nSituation but I guess not and that's cool and I learned not see the difference is I guess maybe the reason I don't hold grudges or I can let it go 'cause I I learned I learned from that and I now learned you know how you know your guy says brains work in regards to the lack of tuition and I\nAnd then I moved on and then you can't bring and stuff on you always keep bringing it up and that's what's weird to me\nWhile I thought that ... a lot of second no no don't give me that nonsense and this this thing that came up again because you made the comparison doby jets and I said that early at the start of this I buy more All right let's move on shall we get a meal on line one day Neal\nYeah I I tell you I may here either served but we'll quarterback or do do veterans you're used to be shut down for the rest of the year\n... you know they just guarantee them ... ... what was the guaranteed money was eighty million he got guaranteed ... that are still but they're not going to send them down where you're the",
