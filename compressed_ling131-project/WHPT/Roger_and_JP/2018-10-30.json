Pentagon just said yesterday there spending fifty two hundred troops to the southwest border so let's see what this looks like they would on let's see what holding looks like without agility\nStructures for hundreds of millions of dollars will have ten set up and then go much further than that they cut them off right there and I\nWant to let him finish that sentence right let me know where he's a let me know where he's going\nYeah so you'll see seven thousand troops down there and you know they're gonna make it look impressive and intimidating 'cause you're using your saying nobody's coming across right so the idea is to turn the carbon around before it gets there so I just wonder how they I mean they're not they're apparently weeks away so that over six but they're not going to be on our border\nBut they said on the news before was um they won't even get to the border and until early December yeah if they ever get there at all so that made it sound like okay so there is a full court press to get this thing turned around\nOr something I saw on the news with Mexico worth trying to work something out goes I'm trying to get asylum but a lot of the ... people in the government don't want asylum from I just go no they don't want to or not they want to come here let's\nMexico's a step sideways not a step forward yeah and their world and their eyes maybe\nSo I just wonder if in the long run this is going to help Trump or hurt Trump will be good or bad for once you see all the troops on the border and there'll be tanks and trucks and all sorts of things and barbed wire\nDefenses and stuff like that will be stuff just to keep people away so it doesn't become chaos and you know how's it going to end is he gonna look\nYou can look horrible as it and are people going to be afraid to our troops are going to shoot people in the caravans outdoor afraid of well you know and it's always a good I Love fear will it hurt\nI think that when I think that's what some people want to happen\nI don't I I Want some shot they just don't come and do not supposed\nBy saying I think there are people that run stuff on the left that would\nThat would ... that would paint Trump in a horrible life course right he's a poor defenseless people just looking out alive and you know so if something like that busted out\nAnd they would when they would win that media war in a heartbeat and he's got to make this like he has to keep this non violent hatched do absolutely right past or they'll crucified right\n'cause there's ... ... as you said they're all a lot of some of those people are armed and then that becomes just an isolated situation but\nYou hope you really that's not the way the media will ... will show it\nWas the opposite almost opposite effect so I just wonder how it's going to affect like will everybody change I bought a guy who was the other day she said it's just really gonna change how people vote November six I mean it may be far enough away of being not right it may not change if it were at the border and the military was reacting and they were reacting and\nIf they showed up in November fifth week I'm In a\nNovember ... it might change some people and how they think\nThey need to do something today now that that he's looking to get rid of the or even if you're if you're an illegal\nImmigrants here and you have a child the child gets automatic I forgot what the\nA ... a birthright citizenship I figure I citizen ship something like that\nSo are you saying that even though it it can be done by executive order which I guess the courts will have to confirm or deny I guess but by executive order which is way quicker than asking Congress to act on it which right but they may never do\nBut I think is a fourteenth amendment where it says that if you were born here or or live here you are a citizen and you're on the protections of and so you would want to change that through executive order so you can't just walk across the border\nHave a child and then the child becomes a he said that\nHe goes we are the only country in the world now I don't know if this is true I'm just it might be ... who's the world we are the only country in the world that does this\nWow so you can really generate gross you sneak across our border you have a child that child is automatically an American citizen for the next eighty five years with all the benefits that goes along with it because it's not right it's got us die\nHe just not right I Want I like you know he has reason to lie it's not right and I'd also like to know that I like the only nation we're the only country in the world that is America so I don't mind me I don't want to be lines in America\nHey mark guy but there's a reason we're America well and the ... because people\nLike one ... citizen\nYes let him run really had it for a while ago but where we are running out of\nThe reason we're good as I mean we're a nation of laws melting pot\nWe are we are but we're a nation of melting pot that are created with laws so instead of coming across and\nAnd and doing that it illegally and and just popping a child into our system like it shouldn't people come across legally and then you both can become citizens or how perfect does I mean I Know you support that\nI I like that but I if there is a baby born in this country it's just an idea that line which and I don't understand why anybody would be anti that maybe being a better than having said that don't you think that there are bigger and better\nThings that are happening in this world right now that he needs to focus on then I'd be immigration immigration is a big deal it is and there's a there's a caring people that he's apparently sending ships or whatever and you're that's a big ordeal and a baby being born in the country\nOr what can you talk about what would you make it sound like it's one day it's like it's one kid that's born it\nRight and if and if you had a ... game why wouldn't you suffer system from being game being\nHere [laughter]\n[laughter]\nThat's what you were here [laughter]\nNot with that and you don't like you know maybe they don't know it shouldn't be taken out on them I'm Sorry but I didn't hear it\nWhat was that\nAge men [laughter]\n\nCatapult\nBut don't you put on a responsibility on the parents like why bring them into the country why come in and have a baby on the line when you know because when you're already illegal and now what if you get separated whose fault that's horrible you're the\nParent security could\nIt's a big business for particularly uh people from China to come over and stay and specially equipped hotels and apartment buildings just so they can give birth and then go back to China and then have a citizenship\nSir China no way to do now I Am is I call I got to do it it's it\nYeah LA LA Times or it's a big big business in California\nSo they time it right they can come here on a visa for three some\nYou know you you well you never know if the baby is going to be premature so they typically come over a month or two prior to the delivery date and they stay in these an entire apartment\nBuildings are set up for this and hotel\nWow oh yeah yeah I go to Google and LA Times ...\nYep yep CBS News yeah wow the number of Chinese women giving birth and the U.S more than doubled to ten thousand that was back in two thousand twelve like this rolling in the early ... yeah\nIt's a small sliver oh boy [laughter]\nI didn't know that hotel set up I mean how do we do that to ourselves I mean you know doesn't make any sense I I\nI I'd also say there's I I Believe in immigration I'm the child of an immigrant from Scotland\nCorn I don't really all that good for you [laughter] I I think the focus\nNeeds to be on you know why or why do people from Latin America have preference there are literally billions of people that are in poverty and in desperate situations around the world that would love to come here I mean go to Cambodia go to Thailand and on and on Indonesia\nYeah 'cause there are border with us I mean it makes it you know it's just the most is situation\nExactly I just think that the sympathies are sometimes are a ... miss a place I think are helping people is wonderful but I'm not sure that one group should have preference over another\nWell with birth tourism apparently the Chinese have nothing on the Russians birth tourism brings Russian baby boom to Miami and this is from this year\nSo there's a growing number of Russian Women drawn to the sunny beaches of Miami and the newborn children wow so it's happening all over voters pictures of pregnant Russian mom's on the beach in my own no\nIt's really common and said hey Katrina ... over\nWhen I was taking the plane that come here it was not only me it was four or five women on one plane\nWow and all this when I don't even know birth tourism was the thing this heard of this phrase\nI heard the phrase but I never really gave much thought about it\nMike is a online one day my\nBig I had written or a big back in the nineties with the German oh\nThat was like a different sort of ... um what I call a birthright citizenship is like\nLeaving here for about a block you get home and there's somebody in your apartment now you take care of that person for the rest of your life\nSo\nThat that's exactly that that that analogy for me is what birthright citizenship is\nNow they have rights to your apartment or they have now you have to feed and clothe 'em to educate them\nUm for the rest of their lives is that Saturday ... give us\nA little bit yeah\nAnd you're talking about one person to one person I mean we're talking about it I Know we have three hundred million people now wrestling with our millions you know they're saying\nWhat Seventy eight million illegal in the country right now so uh in Florida a anger babies in Florida is a huge huge problem huge it's flooded are ... uh\nOne of the local elementary schools in Clearwater ah it Spanish speaking because of that\nSo uh Spanish either first language and clear water out of that in elementary school so I mean it it happened that it it really really been hard on state of Florida are infrastructure can't handle it a\nHospital's uh jails\nSchool and those are the hardest hit and own\nEmergency though if I Do I write argued about thanks a chat line five guys and\nGuys thanks for taking my call 'em it's just sad for the guy talking about Italy before the last break and I wanted to set a little light on it my wife is a\nItalian American her a great grandfather came over here a little over a hundred years ago and died in the flu pandemic so they're they don't have birthright but they have it I think it's called ... which is a bloodline so\nShe has dual citizenship because she was able to prove that are great grandfather died before a naturalized and was able through marriage records birth and death certificates to prove that that Italian citizenship ship was never denounced so she's entitled to Italian citizenship and now through marriage I get it to\nGet you to sell you know you're in a citizen and you can live and work there without one no one in Italy is going to hear the name chat and think you were telling you [laughter]\nOh no no and I certainly don't look Italian [laughter] going anywhere I find that when I lost my luggage and uh yeah no we're different [laughter] very [laughter]\nBut um you know I think the whole birthright thing here too a little bit and they understand also that guy talking about it they don't take your passport and if it if you move your pass over to somebody you're out of your mind but um [noise] you know that that benefitted you know her ancestors at the time because\nYou know her grandparents were American citizens even though they had a naturalized yet so it's one of those things I think it was beneficial at the time and it's just\nBeing oversimplified now like you know kind of an issue\nAlright right Becky ... if you're telling you can get sciences and shit thank you\nAnd bill is on line three but I got to be a bit for the government for a couple of the rules a bill

times\nYeah we all want to want to get\nThe get go online and I'll take my seats and it kept only just the package I'm like I don't want this and so it's clear it I cleared out\nAnd they just keep stone and army kept ... three times I deleted it and then sure enough at the end of the thing it threw it back on their age ... he like three thousand\nDollar [laughter] that's all you could buy today barely know the early and yeah that could not but there's arms tomorrow attorney also all you can buy all day as\n... meet and greet that's wise to regret\nJak charging three grand those Fifteen hundred at peace with three thousand each\nFifteen hundred a person and on the season I I tried to call take about ... like hey I don't want their their all there's nothing we can do a\n[laughter] yeah I Know that guy ... eyes out there right\nThere and that's all right can you imagine ... all the money they have and you know we had to fall on this morning on the other show and it was every other word out of his mouth was\nThe fans the fans the fans the fans the than the fat off of the other hand fans but why would we sell something\nThat people wouldn't want to buy right what he said\nRight but Fifteen now you're going to tell me you know you you love the fan so much you appreciate the fans so much that you want a bang hundred dollars a hundred dollars to take a picture with you and shake hands\nYou say why are we saying why not [laughter]\nBall it's good to do today with me for a thousand dollars\n[laughter] oh okay [laughter] [noise]\nAnd they make an extra thirty forty grand new split up between the two of 'em every night of the whole tour how they have enough money compared to here you don't you don't think they give the other guys that anything you know\nThose guys are like flat fee weren't\nEven in the last tour\nAnd it's just I was going to but the ah I read the the list of every how they go on sale this week and if it's the same nationwide today is meet and greet day tomorrow attendance gives army and then there's a bunch of others throughout the week right to like Fridays when regular people can get regular ticket and there'll be nothing left\nMaybe you know there's a city car deal at all I says you got to look up online wherever you're buying tickets one hundred dollars right\nI Can't I mean maybe the huge kiss fans I mean I just can't see\nYeah last chance to meet these two guys I just\nWrite but I Can't see it being worth the Fifteen hundred dollars like I don't see it being\nMore than a um you'll get a great scene to show that I Know they do when you buy them only get really good seats to the show\nBut I Can't see it more being more than a photo and a handshake\nUh-huh right you know going to hang out and have a guy off you know right\nI just can't seem to be more than Fifteen hundred dollars but what I Would pay Fifteen hundred dollars for him but somebody else's garage hundred dollar\nJackets you know [laughter] the high end\nBut it's good high end stuff or have you really think about someone like we're close to the business we're very lucky that way but people who are sitting at their home and I grew up and they'd been in a house or forty years it'll it's just all time during the middle of\nIndiana they're hardly there two hours from the nearest place to go see a concert I mean they'll never have contact with or be anywhere close to anybody of a star like that and that's their star I think they're the ones who pay that's the only way they'll ever get to shake ahead of someone who is just a picture of video to them\nOr God didn't you know that's a big difference from you know we get to meet\nPeople like that you know some of us are Russia and brushing elbows with sports players go to spring training or something like that right these guys can't do that and I think they pay\nBecause I'm thinking like you know I Love Led Zeppelin right if they were doing a a last hurrah kind of thing mhm and there was an opportunity to meet him for that kind of money\nI mean me Robert when Jimmy Page in one place one I Would do in mid may but I mean that's\nProbably the only one I Would do mhm the only one I Would even consider doing right right right\nAround the jobs that were made them in your lap and I guess for some people kiss yeah I bet you don't want but I Know there was a I Know me I'd be I'd be like that was not where I just wasted a lot of money ... told me that a lot of money for a\nMeeting yesterday I was getting ready to sit down and have\nEven a ten minute conversation of five men you know ... down to me that kind of ... you know because maybe there's a question I have about a song or a question you have about an artist or their personal\nWhatever it is at least is something yeah but you know this you know with kids it's gonna be like a ... it's going to just be like okay next next\nYeah well good luck at the tickets all this week if you want to go see them\nYou looking forward to play and I'm only ball [laughter]\n... we read that's probably the best to read in the world\n[laughter] she thinks of why\nI got another radio do right now with ... [laughter] you know the ... is probably my favorite readers in the world\n[laughter] a ball you like an open book joy [laughter]\nFall down from his good every other show Seventy seven five seven nine one one through five eight hundred and Seventy Seventy one model to five top ten list coming up after one thirty\nDo or he so bad as what he learned that people want to know like you just you don't understand they and by the way we just even for the bills alone ... and I'm just kinda goes along with like you said the thing is they had not chat\nAnd so they're going to be they have someone showing that players on the ... on the way to the game you only need or walking into you know new era last night and like you know what I mean like ... ... ... ...\nOh God yeah if he does that on any of these ... was you know he wanted to be like\nThe one picture he's got his his him laying on the yoga mat in the gym and I'm looking at the gym in his house and Michael can number one that's a lot of members\n[laughter] you know and I look at it and it's just sitting there on the yoga mat with and I'm like how how many uh housing for the uh it was\nA hundred nine hundred and Seventy nine hundred Ninety seven thousand likes [laughter] Seventeen thousand comments is just a small\nPercentage of the movies I don't even care about that one third of the members that's all the picture [laughter] oh that's it like it's like if he just put a picture of Gatorade right next door yeah but he'll never do that and take it you're trying to get a couple of million dollars from Gatorade me favorite take the same picture just put a bottle that she liked to drink and if\nYou go straight to the money yeah oh it's more than a couple right I mean imagine if he has any deal with them what that would\nBe right you know I don't know just you see but what he can do as he can do it covertly like if you do like a quick one shot deal with them mhm and with this one and when that when people wouldn't even know until you've gotten paid from a hundred and fifty different companies people would even be able to tie it together since it was\nA you know your gp you should do and it's super even like you said you just in a gym you didn't have to put any for any extra he was there any way he just took a picture of it and that leads to all of that\nHere's the thing if I had to guess he probably has somebody doing a foreign\nFilm and maybe taking the picture but he has to be in and he has to make the time to\nHang out of it is now he's probably got some twenty something that handles his social media life you know like I just laid around ... million dollar deal yeah you've got\nTo be doing him at a hundred and forty in a congressional hundred and twelve months or a hundred and twenty by gather they're very international that was like who is in like a Taylor Swift she's big here but she's probably a little bigger but she's not as international I fell to run all the western twelve million followers on ... alone right so I mean there's just there's just dry and people just killing you\nKnow whatever it is they are international no matter what\nNow they're international and their old multi gazillion is so none of them need the money grab but I guarantee you his representatives are getting phone calls every single day ... with offers\nJust puts his ball Gatorade and actually I said oh you did you take that picture in his bathroom next to America just put a piece of you know a ... a kennel right God by the window by them or is this going to put it they're\nGoing to look at the Taylor Swift she gives advice look backstage but then it's also ... I Know from Kelly follows her and I know a lot of it is about what she's wearing and a lot of ... it was just be a picture of she won't even say she doesn't have to but whatever she whereas\nOther people walked yeah you know that kind of thing and the shoes are posing it's just like maybe she was onstage maybe just hanging out with their mom maybe she's walking in the woods but you know she has a it's a pretty good luck in her life without giving away anything\nSheep\n[laughter] well people love her you know and at the same would crush on her own although there's wanna see anything to do within like Monica says in his life wherever it is just a picture like looking through the whole\nPeople or why\nWere you many there you can either be outside of that or you can take advantage of their sheep ... and ...\n... that's what I'm saying I wouldn't blame him if he if he wants mommy and a half I really wouldn't [laughter]\nMm\nAt all [laughter] at all I Would do is I'm or\nTotal whore yeah\nHers red tell us we're censoring the shot so well to the ... by other people but not too many by her ... no but she took by herself as a few most of them in like a picture book screw\nA Derek online to what's going on\n[noise] hey how are you guys doing rather than just the guys are talking about taking care of it but I was trying to get a couple of weeks ago\nAnd they had the tickets are

trying to figure out the new ways I think that it's only you\nKnow I'm not trying to figure out the new ways I understand it I just don't see it as\nA marketing ploy and it should have been a social you know just you know\nThe one that was a ... bullets marketing what are you saying they're using there is the game grand poll they are doing that and I know what I'm taking\nShape the learning as a gram and like you know you know last week you know try to you know there's a little subtle things saying oh you know we're gonna do this and then the guy called animal [noise]\nYeah yeah you're given the way too much credit for that [laughter]\nSo you're saying this whole discussion about him not liking rooms really a plug for his extra\n[laughter] well I feel like I've never once plugged on the air by the way\nWell now I feel like it's more like you know the the state of entertainment now is worse you know reality t._v. which is more staged than reality and I feel like a lot of the you know\nA plug the or you know teach nailed that new tricks I think\nYeah well that's cool you think that sorry 'cause that's what I wrote it for them to teach old guy nutritional products [laughter]
