I put in Banksy and Google image such an older comes up his his art work\nAnd they said that does somebody shot a video at the uh auction and they believe he was in the background because there's a guy who Robin ... odd gunning ham who apparently is ... what's the rise to ... and he's in the background of the video at the auction so they're pretty sure that I see him and he was there a thing\nBut they don't know nobody knows\nYou dropped a strong him he was behind the shredding up his iconic artwork he says the urge to destroy is also a creative urge\n[laughter] you're after the far from devaluing the art experts believe that the stunt may have actually doubled the price of the work because of the huge interested generated\nDumber price of the work the work is done taught the done\nLike I said he was shredded in a nice way where you know nice straight long vertical line will say but so it's not like it's going side of the ... year my soul might get together so to speak and so am I going to frame taped together now he's been at one point whatever for something that gets paid back together again you know while I'm a news story so it's become\nAnd check this out bigger than it does matter what the condition is at this point from a guy who was a disagree course it does an art guy a co founder of an art site my art broker says the lucky BYOR will see a great return on the one point zero for a million pounds they paid last night\nMhm so I guess they bought it and owner shredded and now they're saying minimum fifty percent increase to its value immediately possibly as high as two million pounds means what am I made a million\nWhat am I missing is became an intern and we're talking about it became an international news story that this how so that's all you need you got that painting [laughter] you know\nI Know shredded it right through the frame to the bottom of the shredded it within the frame but now they're showing it ran the bottom\nWas was the shredder [laughter] Romeo\nMaybe I'm just like I'm brought up to think like my father you bought that they were you a moron but we just read it at least like lasagna strips [laughter] what do you do it wow\nThe person wears you out a person who bought her was surprised they they should we got banks feed that's what he got it so that they said we've talked with a successful purchaser who ... were in discussion about next steps so the frame hangs on the wall the shutters inside and the girl with the balloon halfway hangs on the bottom shredded only thing was left\nLike is the heart balloon was Iran so great I mean I really I\nI Love the creativity that went into not even the painting the painting doesn't look all that overwhelming although I don't know or\nYou know it seems like what do we know what I'm\nI like the creativity that went into the idea of shredding it at the auction right live more than I like the greatest phone call on line one what's up\n\nCall you there I Am here and you hear me yeah gotcha what's up\nA a band scheme will put on his social media sites and Web pages are pictures of his artwork to verify that it was done by help\nOh I've been going on Banksy advance loans Banksy no it's banned ski he's right it's Banksy now with the ban ski idea yeah there's a ... A N K yeah that's what I see oh yeah I don't actually read was banks you just sort of wrong you know\nHe he doesn't want his artwork to be paid for so that's why he is shredded it so a lot of his artwork split up inside a building so that way they can't take it out\nRight again doing All right so if he doesn't want it to be bought if he doesn't want to have a monetary value for it then why is the putting it up for auction you didn't somebody also he didn't\nPut somebody else put up for auction option that I Know there's a great I Believe it's on Netflix there's a great I think it's about an hour long a documentary about his artwork and how he puts it up on walls and location where he doesn't want it to be sold off\nSo then he had this one piece that he just made he just\nPainted in and put it in the frame and it was ... I was runner so this was done years ago this wasn't\nDone for this prank this was done in case this happened\nIn case and went up for auction yet it says was a wire ... under in two thousand six and I guess that vendor modest\nSold it to somebody else who them put it up for auction it's hard to tell how many people have been through it and then when he found out about it are are thrown into\nA lot of his art work if you'll see are more ... than they are actual like came\nWell one person on Twitter said he was making a statement about any one of the things you could actually owned his art uses ... saying art is free and isn't meant to\nBe owned [laughter] man that's some dedication to your craft so how does he made all your money why does he hide how did he make his money\nHe doesn't try to make money that's the well he's got a lot of it's on donation\nOr keep his small circle of friends not a lot of people even know who he is right it's very very small circle of friends and that's it\n\n[laughter] in two thousand seven so there'd be sold three of bankers works He wrote on his website I Can't believe you more on actually by this this like huge ... point lead down selling

and so you look at the comments right away like my wife tremendously well\nOne of the first guys to stay safe patriots God will be looking over your God Bless America\nI wasn't talking about me mark I was talking about him around [laughter] ...\nAnd then someone immediately puts a cartoon of Trump going up you know when he had the piece of like a napkin stuck to see all the steps to have a ... or they have a cartoon of him going up the steps of the plane with the American flags tucked was people who doesn't matter what he puts it was all going to be something\nThat even that harsh and that\nAnd then there's you know positive great job Mr President you could do amazing I'm ... and then actually I says would be a great time for you to take Airforce one for a job the Bermuda Triangle\nHe call I really like you know but I mean just get together but you don't need to watch\nThe um what's the story with a new guys yeah\nSpeaking of storm surges there's a storm surge watch on basically if you're on the couch and all you know obviously you just know it's going to be pretty bad but they're saying that that's the way it's only be like two to four feet\nOkay so you know I I mean I Know Tampa Bay area wasn't going to get it had on by any ... don't get how much rain was coming along it's happening\nIt's happening at night and have it in overnight and basically right all of its coming down and there there's actually a tropical storm watch it just means that conditions it's gotta be windy and rainy and got through like wow we're going to be ... from\nAbout water\nAnd hopefully it isn't there a thing about if you get a good storm of my check the red tide out of there\nIs it possible with this\nOr this awhile ago when I was there like yeah we usually get a big storm in there you know hurt him take the red died out red tide right at the rally I Know now you're on the east coast went the Miami Fort Lauderdale area around\nCould this actually take it out of at least the Gulf I don't know if that's you know mix and take it out of you know I don't even know if that's why they got hit Florida so money but when you do\nNot saying it's in our own over here and they came back on the way I bought over I mean I get that it's still technically hurricane season but I mean it knocked over ... just be done with it nine\nWill just be almost is isn't it isn't it August September October in July the ... yeah\nMan because Michael\n[laughter] right so we're thinking\nAbout how it's going to hit the pan handle on tomorrow and basically we're just going to get all the wind and rain\nLike Tallahassee about to get happening daily use was Florida playing a Florida is in a\nTall as you write University of uh that's why I say Florida State wherever they are what are they ... as we go to a good\nQuestion I'm going to happen with you again I don't know I don't know and it's\nGot what's right Florida Gainesville my bed I'm yes we'll get a lot of but it could be a lot of teams that that whole area there\nWill be I mean it'll be gone it's it's hit and Wednesday and then we'll go north right or you know by the weekend\nRight show at the two things always have it on the weekend I wasn't even realize it was also\nFrom what I understand is it a three already I Know this morning it with him\nToo little too it was this little Hama three other gets deeper and up into the Gulf tours to become a three three\nI mean it's going to sound ridiculous and I really hope everybody stay safe and everything of course but I feel like Florida with the ... they know how to handle it you know what I mean\nDoes so casual about everybody knows what to do yeah\n'cause you don't have so many time yeah you know when you're supposed last\nYear Monica didn't know she could pay off the power guys to get a power turned on the show I did ... ... ... you know I've got to be honest we told a lot of people that\n'cause I don't think there were a lot of people just like you could really give them guys fifty bucks and that put me on for yeah\nI mean yeah and that's getting this quality information that needs to be no I won't get a power outage that you know like bad for a long haired time have any pets for a couple of days and they got ... pain and and get things they cleaned up and we're going to go right\nSo last time it was a of a big one you had some flooding and all this stuff by you but you didn't leave your place right\nOh I ended up well I had to deal with mandatory on the back yard men into right on the water yeah so they were like well you see do\nYou want to come close to that now yeah it shouldn't be close\nYou know I just going to be a hunker down and think you want to catch on the news and the time and have a little party\nIsn't every storm of jazz to get some boos and Dennis on line two good Dennis\n... Monica no that hurricane season does it as a soldier and these\nAre the real stuff up all I surely halfway and maybe you know we have nearly half way through the alphabet so yeah I think the new start up in a lot to do or die from that I'm over it either way\nA Michael's I live on a micro do you do what he got\nThey got all that you don't you could have you back [noise] ah yeah that's right [noise] I mean as far away from the although\nShe's listening to the number thirty a number one number two red tide yeah it could clean it up but it could actually make it worse\nOh so it all depends 'cause it's\n... every time every time\nSomebody knocks on the door and fellow walks up to the door yeah that was just going\nOut may [laughter] she might be [laughter] be probably very possible Morse code really nice [laughter] she mall\n[laughter] God [laughter] [noise]\nYeah it's a horrible thing I [noise]\nReally ah [laughter] you know without a doubt her that's\nThe audio rendition of the puppy suicide rate that goes up when I was put outfits on you know\nYeah uh let's see that's one of a sudden you're Monica I mean this is she's put your costumes on your cats right\nNow I got a caller I like cats I don't know the right thing\nWould they sit there and let you put anything on your own power outages including way right now they\nGot time for that I don't want to do that to them in any trying to feel that now not in\nMy wife's done in the past is on it every year tradition but she's but like some sort of\nSomething\nOr you know she didn't have my wife has right here she put like ... feet long stocking like [laughter] like a pig tails one year [laughter] I just you know cats face in general are just miserable looking out for me to lay out in the face of jihad with the door as\nI did it was a mini somewhere else and when the following day tiny Mays and Barry I tried tried to put on our chance had and that was happening but if I got like a really quick pack and right now but it's just not worth all the embarrassment and\nDo you think this is a straight guy yeah that buys\nOut that like okay a single straight guy you know you do you think there are straight guys that by costumes for their dogs\nYou know let me go walk on them and try to get girl ... St Pete and you will find straight male that yes absolutely\n[laughter] I thought who carries as small as your dog through a mall like for attention and but there's not as approachable\nThere's not a straight married guy that\nComes home as we got a dog and outfit you think so I don't\nKnow probably is around me though I I I feel so bad for her oldest one's funny even for your dog where you can get a lion's mane and just put it around his head like your size dog when you're awesome\nHe was right with that I just filled out the application from the adoption company that we got let me from ... to possibly get another puppy\nIsn't that little brown dog that you sent pictures\nIn the ... there's a ... a few of them my well my daughter said we shouldn't get that one because it looks a little special ed that's\nThat's about all of your daughter's part of the bullying problem [laughter]\nOut of the dog look a little special ed I don't\nI don't know I think the dog was beautiful but anyway so I go on go on the website to fill out the application that we have already adopted through them so I don't think it's going to be that big a deal\nMm I don't I think I filled out less to buy a house oh boy [laughter] is that they don't want\nTo make a mistake like late and they don't have yet to anybody to get this dog who's on line one Monica I'm Bonnie Hi Bobby what's going on\n...\nJust talking about the people putting us it was on a cat that was just as soon as my next door neighbor he always put every year but starts is on it and it'll last just because they look like those little toll toll\nOh yeah\nThe door and those tests are just really look miserable they're\nWalking around [laughter] ...\nLee miserable and the ladies oh you know at looks like the ...\nLike me back probably say me [laughter]\nIt's so\n[laughter] until the ... the chocolate [laughter]\nBelieve me [laughter]\n[laughter] they're all doing the same thing\n[laughter] you know if if the the chicken and egg thing because okay so you're right you know dressing them up that it is what it is but then they wouldn't do that if people didn't say oh look it up you know we get the cat is it that didn't happen then nobody would dress up oh definitely more animal I\nWish I bought that getting isn't as for every chair but learning one million shares yes thirty one million that's not what it's all around thirty one thirty one million people will put their dogs and their their pets and and I just find a picture of what you want to impress me put it cost him on your fish\nIf you could what caused him on your fish off [laughter] and I got my attention [laughter] and how I feel like you deserve some sort of reward or something\nBelly once you're one there was a pirate which I'm not just\nChill a pirate out with a scholar cross hold on her head and then it was in the ... the body was like a little like dress thing was really an so she'll be like a short dress I just said if he bought it is if you don't have to repeat what Larry asleep horrible because her face like or\nYou don't think the dog's pub plots like summer then so you don't think the dull rubs it says on your pillow and [laughter]\nShe knows it's not my fault [laughter] is she knows\nA little on line one go ahead\nGo look I'm a regular\nGuy that's my dog or say up to or O'Brian will say that because there\nAre big puppies day that only does it does a cash prize right\nYeah\nI think it might just like I don't know if it's cash for the stuff that give away for each but I think the first three winners\nRyan says it makes for certainly did you\nKnow it wasn't elaborate not like it's\nA well ... I got to know what was the costume\nSet like a love love those ear that looked like clover city had like a like a green light thing around it a little like eight\nDid your dog with a miserable uh yeah\nBut they always do they hated it lasted about twenty minutes I took it off\nOr out in the rye rye and you're going to do something to your pets you say what I Want this done to me and at the end you know and don't do exactly\nAnd so we wait like thirty bucks for this dumb costume that you may be snap a couple of pictures in and then they take all take it off and it's over and everybody knows thirty one million people a lot of people\nTake it a little things on the edge\nYou so I just got to picture that you sent Roger which by the way which won the ... the both the rams that UNC mascot or whatever and have tried to whatever anyway are no I guess you and say anyway around on\nI feel like two things one look at those poor eyes that I knew arena shows the odds are like oh well you know mommy how do you get your dog just sit there like that has ... billion to take them off and run around you know what I mean he does have\nActually she immediately shakes do horns in the case of the round the horns offer ahead because\nJust like Roger beating so\nYou know I don't look at his wife who say well like I I can fight this it's inevitable no matter what I Do she'll give me when I'm no matter what of losing [laughter]\nI mean I'll give her her picture it is you could just like that that\nDog wearing on road is like Roger having to clean the garage about cleaning\nThe dry cleaners same eyes shot long [laughter]\nI'm going to cost them get shut up put on a guy that was his name thing\nIf any of the fat and take the ... the pits hurry up getting out of these yeah now\nI'm sure at one point she was going to scooter bought across the rug\nIn ... having them\nDressed as a family dog including you know and they\nKnow ... or no probably when the girls were home a trick or treating when they're younger they're probably held Bello who was in a costume with two of them but that's probably ... yeah no I I'm going to cost them in a long time maybe since a like a bosses Halloween party a long time ago\nI had school outfit while you were in the city now that I\nKnow no school girl out for a while I was you know Jay loaning mine a guy who got picked\nA man hey how's it going guys All right so\nEvery Halloween we dress our great Dane up a sheet of blue\nWith uh the uh what is it the at at all the star wars you know that for like a robot they have and she loves it\nIt's it's it's funny ... everybody like makes comments on that yeah that's where we left our kids up a one lives you're the one year wellness Los ... it just hilarious\nJames yeah doesn't love it\n[laughter] you should all year I bet you change your mind\nYou know I saw a great day and the other day I was at the skinny little girl the great Dane had to like drag her around um\nIt was in in in New York City\nAnd there's great Dane was it was a beautiful dog but the amount of ... that was hanging from the dog is jowls like you know like you're back part of their mouth where their jaws connects this bit that was hanging down as much as beautiful as that dog was I was like oh hell no\nSee ours\nOurs doesn't do that are doesn't drawl or anything like that I mean after she drinks of course she does but a normal just walk around like on the things she does it um it's real funny because my wife uh she's actually my wife's a hundred like three pounds\nAnd our dog weighs a hundred and sixty five so she kinda just\nYeah ... it it's so funny she has a pool which may but you\nKnow I'm ... you know to city and she is you know one of five so but uh yeah it's funny to go on walks I always have to control or because my wife will actually get pulled by the old\nAnd the tickets for sixty five minute show you know sixteen songs and there's a whole orchestra it's all full length stuff\nHe's sixteen songs yeah yeah [laughter] and people were amazed by is there an opening act\nIt does not say it doesn't say\nBut as a technology evolves it becomes easier to create three dimensional when your wife like visuals of the artist so it's only going to get better as they go\nWhen you when I think about this the first thing that pops in my head is some kid who isn't going to be born for ten years mhm\nIsn't going to go see kiss and like two thousand fifty shades of course [laughter] yeah of course they've already got this on their minds they're going to go see this they'll live forever\nYou know the original version good tour forever\nWow you know and I and I've just maybe a backing rock band for only right it's good news for classic rock stations Mm\nIt does keep a lot of it alive there although the same company that did ... talking about doing one for a classical music singer\nUh there's also been stuff done of jazz singer Billie Holiday uh Michael Jackson's been done I can only adding to be improved on better as you go\nFor I can see it being a solo artist mhm I have a hard time\nWanting like I'm trying to figure okay who is the first band that's going to sell their souls\nAnd like queen I Would rather see\nI never got to see queen yeah one of the bands I Wish I would've gotten to see but he passed away in Nineteen Ninety One um and he was already sick in the morning I\nI'd rather than be on the road road is Adam Lambert guy than to seek queen go out with friday and a hologram I think I think I think she has to ... is it I I don't know\nOr I don't really cool to actually feel what it might have been like Freddy Mercury in front of the\n... who's going to forget okay so that was not going to go get a hologram of bonds are behind the drums so you know that's not going to happen uh McCartney and Ringo I'm sure ... going to be like a ball I've got an idea\nBut Paul never going to do it doesn't have to hold never going to do it you imagine though if he did with two holograms somebody who is ... you know death lap is not going to go out and tore men redo the um hysteria thing with a hologram Steve clock on guitar\nUnnecessary it's probably just got to be a front man my moment\nThere are there are only going to get better at it as they go pretty soon I Wonder how they would have been what a what will happen is it will be a whole band ... once the holy land is dead and some kid is in charge\nWhether to bring the Grateful Dead around the family isn't that ...\nThat actually makes sense [laughter] you could still but I you know somebody in there still at least one for an average of the crowd that was the touch a great video remember that well as like skeletons help it's oh\nI'll somebody around it's interesting I like I again I the first time I saw it I was like oh that's awful I Would never pay as part of the\nFestival day what the deal thing I was like oh okay I get it and the the two boxing at Coachella okay that's pretty cool yeah and then when they went after the deal thing and the word was that they were going to tour of this thing and we're like okay well what's it going to draw but now how many how many cities did you say this thing that this royal\nXenon Europe thirty eight thousand people tickets sold\nSo they're doing much sold out and all these rebels either to thousands ... no matter what\nThey did in LA same result and they're gonna keep coming around us and royal ricin\nHow his fans of ought to be in their seventies yeah ice yes absolutely because he was big in the sixties sailed playing\nA Fort Myers November seventeenth or women do under sixteen whatever Dale the Eighteenth and clear water on the nineteenth of November\nAbout that wow will be able to see\nHis son helped create this was a good year to do and the family approved all the songs and everything the families wait we can get paid again ...\n[laughter] and I had the opening act or right after sending shadow puppets I'm [laughter] shut up [laughter] around\nThe moon dogs wind more on with them and then it makes it rough sounds with his mouth [laughter] hey man I\nWould not like they're cashing in on the around any longer\nTrue and there's definitely legal fights that are going to happen about it but like in this case the orbit since worked with the company for the ... thing so not so much a fight that must have come to an agreement but other places the topic is they're trying it already with people that are licensed to do\nAnd families of ... I mean you're going to Delaware and you're going to see what you mean ... ... oh my God families have made money on that than celebrities forever how many of them want us to ... put out twenty out more albums when he's dead than alive thirty one album something like that since you too [laughter] I don't know\nWhat they want more cashing in on it every\nDay at ... opposite exposed to more people write the family doesn't care if they don't do it it would disappear\nRight they'll go they'll look at it as well just trying to keep his legacy alive yeah [noise]\nYou know you want to say you only have ... and you only have a certain amount of time left because ... going to be dead right the ones who remember him yeah that literally thanks loans Tom on line two\nGuys hey job a real quick Scott Mayfield ...\n[laughter] that's weird that's a Islander thing from other show but that's all right thank you for listening to both of those are although you're completely irrelevant right now\nYeah Michael I saw the Michael Jackson show one in Vegas and they had a Holiday Inn and it was it's a pretty incredible I mean it's it looks legit\nHow long ago did you see it\nLike a week ago oh that close so it's the latest technology\nOh so they didn't even know they had Michael Jackson going already invading so it's all it's all Michael Jackson's show like a whole performance just Michael\nYeah it's like they have like dance like dancers and everything and he comes out at towards the end and it was like two songs like it's really like a whole show and then he comes out at the end of dust you sounded like if you if you were drinking enough you're thinking there\nIs the rest of the show like an impersonator with the dancers and then the real thing comes out of the end or because you know it always does it make I had these\nLittle kids it's stories about a little kid like it's like a story about a little kid dancing and stuff\nAnd it's like a sure to Vegas show really what what's the name of the show and what hotel that Michael Jackson won a Mandalay Bay is that men do I\nYeah well there it is already in Vegas and it's just gonna keep growing well see\nI don't know man wait till Elvis hits ... boy you know queen has been like that's a good one to hey yeah yeah well they did in Alice hologram on American Idol like ten years ago\nI she ... song with Celine Dion I think oh yeah yeah\nSee it's been around there messing with it but a lot of times I said I live in the technology they have now and that was also on T. V. so they try and make it look Mm a hundred times better ...\nMentioned before to waste our Brad Paisley like five years ago and I saw him he doesn't Carrie Underwood and all of a sudden she starts straighten out oh yeah your data yeah and it was\nAn edgy fades away as the light goes off I think\nThat Mike that's a hologram [laughter] should I say I don't people any person just fade away over like goes off on that was really nervous and he actually turns into like sparkles like ... or something it'd be disappearing took her daughter\nDid you notice that she walked on did walk off Liberace families going because you know Bob Marley body so many\nOf your friends or just perjury ...\nHegemony offering her office all of the things that he didn't do for instance\nThe Superbowl this last year was in Minnesota is in Minneapolis and he didn't they do like a little prince hologram things are leaving leaving a purple symbol ...\nThat's where it was that what it was a I mean I was doing with the guitar machine that looks like a pianist and all that I Know for the for me to have to experience something to give my opinion but I kinda think identity that first\nYeah the reviews are pretty good for South people so far and I only gonna grow and then we'll get to see\nIf I find myself tailgating for hot before often deal hologram show\n[laughter] problem I have a problem\n[laughter] maybe you've got to get ... you said\nMaybe [laughter] for Roger GAAP just wanted to find as well real raw radio after one thirty the top ten list suicide drew ...\n\nWay [laughter]\n\nRoger is on one of two by\nMr my county show download the window to find a bone ass power by\nFiber optics move crazy amounts of data at even crazier speed and ... is the one hundred percent fiber optic network with ... connection you'll get the fastest Internet available download speeds up to nine hundred and forty makes TV phone and a two year price guarantee over Seventy nine Ninety nine per month on line with a two year agreement\nSo they've announced all the city's like David knows everything\nStarts in Vegas since ghosts arrived to Montreal sugar land Texas ... New York city Detroit Philadelphia Connecticut Washington DC Boston back to Canada in Vancouver Seattle in LA so that's all areas of this thing at a red states clearly\nYeah I mean they're not going anywhere near Florida no outside well outside of tech well Texas is yeah that's resident homes\nYeah yeah and they call it an international surging city speaking to allow the cross the border to Canada right I I really thought the ruin a major cities around the\nWorld really around the world but I guess not I mean the thing is to isn't he going to go to hammer it on the ... hour because of where we're at that's\nWhat it is bill and Hillary I'm not again this is from the Fox news when I'm sure I can find a different headline all over the place I'm Bill and Hillary Clinton to embark on speaking tour amid has to take me to backlash\nTickets topping seven hundred and forty five bucks um whereas it here and that's\nInteresting too I mean Bill Clinton and obviously the original so to speak me too as far as uh you know scandals go and\nWell no no no she was willing I don't know if I Want to include that in the meat you know we're All right is that where you can\nEither way yeah but there were plenty of when the White House um cheated on his wife Hillary was going on tour with\nBy a it was an intern right there are also plenty of women who have made allegations\nRight some as all that and yet\nEverybody yeah I had been Lenny allegations\nAgain all of them when I'm it says here the Clintons doing I'm Sorry but the\n... house how some people survive ... those big controversy and especially now when the me too movement and all kinds of like why is\nI tell you how much backward looking styles yeah get crushed they have people act\nThat's what they do [laughter] ...\nAt the Clintons doing public appearances and elsewhere or have also come under extensive fire from the me too movement in recent weeks not only for past transgressions but also for what critics have called their efforts to a paper over them dismissive plea\nSo all those allegations that have come out and bill they just don't pay attention to it don't pay attention to it don't pay attention to it\nAs a little ... and going out but also there are also like last year's Democrats there are like the last ... there'll be for Obama Obama's the new and everything's moving forward the Clintons are I think in their minds\nAre classics that money could they possibly and I'm a I mean could they be out of money no why would you water under what\nWhat's the number ... there's all there's tens of millions of dollars they're made and I think he's made and just speaking for\nThat's fine okay so then what is it I mean how power hungry could you want to be there in their watch he's got to be in his late sixties early seventies right yeah oh he's got to be\nSeventy two he Seventy two when she was sixty Seventy she she's Seventy\nWould you want to stay in the public eye why not just go enjoy yourselves enjoy your grandchildren enjoy your life why the hell is you're up to something\nIsn't at at at tiny thing maybe an alternate for people who aren't exactly Trump supported\n... why they would be able to have this as that and that law and alternate not it's something that's not Trump I mean that's mhm so we're not ... I don't know I have no idea why they're doing and listen I ain't\nNo but I don't I don't I don't know I'm not I'm not really willing it I'm trying to understand I don't understand the point you were trying to make\nGoing and seeing it yeah I Know but I don't I didn't understand it\nIf if everybody is all inundated and we all are you know everybody voted farmer you didn't everybody is inundated with ... news on a regular guy making our basic right with Bill and Hillary Clinton obviously on the other side of the aisle\nRight when they were in holiday so whenever this would be of a relief of sorts from that maybe I don't know something that maybe maybe like look forward to that is not Trump related I don't know I'm ... I'm not going I'm not trying to go I'm just saying that now turning\nRight Jamie if you're a heavy metal fan are you going to go to a country mega concert or are you going to go to ... I'm going on there going ... Monica I think what she's trying to say it yeah those are on the left hand or Clinton supporters are going to a place where there's like minded people say\nBut they have that they have that space it's CNBC I'm\n... I'm going through an event that it has like minded it but there's plenty of 'em there's plenty of democratic rallies and everything else to go to this is clearly them going out charging people and making money\nIn that I'm not it's not a protest if not a not at all yeah that's what I'm saying so I think it's a place to go that's not anger and protest and there were anti and nothing to do with Tom really this is\nThe model almost think about it just like um a lot of times when Trump is doing a rally and or they're trying to and those open to the Republican free and yet you have enough people from the left that will go in there and make noise and trying and trying to hijack it\nMake no mistake about it if you think you're going to go see bill and Hillary and it's going to be a hundred percent bill and Hillary fans in there and you don't think that Trump supporters are going to buy the tickets and going there you crazy\nWhen a Trump supporter one ... my\nWhy would a ripple why would a Democrat go into a Trump rally radical could to try to piss people off\nLine and get their point out when\nWe when we won't be individuals will be paid for groups just like a lot of democratic groups will buy chunks suggests pay for Republican groups might too and there'll\nBe quickly escorted out of the arena is the first time build starts talking and somebody screamed the word rapists or Monica or cigar or whatever they're going to be\nTaken out of there I'm just for the life of me trying to figure out like what\nThe hell would make these to want to go out and do this why not just enjoy your life at that age you got your money you're good you got your grandkids your good\nShe I mean that's she's Seventy now right so she wouldn't sell running for office again if she wanted to dip into the Democrats have got to be at this point say okay she's poison\n... or they would they look at it be like you know what she did win the popular vote\nThe way I think that the world does what they're doing those testing everything out to see how they do but I make a totally have a failure on there hasn't been there just paid off into the distance\nBut you know the whole thing out 'cause what Monica talk I don't know quite what I think it's going to sell things oh the Oh absolutely\nYeah I don't think it's going to be a financial flop by any stretch but like you said this is going to be groups buying blocks tickets and everything else\nPart of the payback Monica part of the pay back\nBut my my question is and you know you see here the Clintons are politically savvy enough to not allow themselves to be anybody's pawns\nRight right right but there's older so they're not going to let anybody but what I'm up to be made to look stupid ...\n... what the well worn out of power hungry maniac could you possibly be if you're Hillary to want to do it again yeah she's not ready to give up your one more shot over three you want to go over three you want to be more willing to adults who want to go through all of that you know especially when you already have\nYou know you're you're already very powerful\nWoman with a powerful husband\nAnd upon the mission and that's just power hungry I don't think that the Clintons are the only people no that's not the only thing\nThat I don't know I'm I'm saying I'm saying of course in every every one's in who's in politics has been for power and the ones who\nSay they really want to do it for change that might be for the for a year or two until they figure out how it all works\nSo maybe I shouldn't be such a surprise that this is what they're doing it that the reason why they're doing it and just to play right along with politics\nRight but I'm saying to myself when does it end how much do you need I guess what I'm saying I I guess it I mean you don't\nGet that I just saw a thing she doesn't ... doesn't stop she's been making speeches a two hundred thousand a pop for a while I understand last few
