and you know definitely will be will be pen pals and we'll keep in touch\nFor sure and I want to do a ... one of those little fact that he will do oh I Love the dealing with the Supreme Court justices and all these judges for the last year's not some sort of ... and if it's not just the Supreme Court that is the lead position that the federal system every federal judge is is there a lifestyle that they get something that they need to change you know\nYeah yeah because of the times change and so are are these people are changing with it you know that's that's what they are kind of set in a way so uh definitely something that will I'm sure we'll we'll change now that this is a happened with Kevin on and forward so maybe maybe it'll be a change for the better but king thank you so much for listening and calling and take care of yourself\nSo sure that you for all to try to give me a voice on here my love yard\nLet me tell a king\nThat ... tear yeah not a teardrop had to know no natural terrorist attack here [laughter] we were talking a cabinet before king and on the phone is Jay and Jay has a question for us which I feel is pretty self explanatory about we're going to go ahead and answer it anyway go ahead Jay [noise]\nOh just curious about um the difference between ... for ... and Bill Cosby carriers oh maybe maybe there's something that I'm missing but I I thought that Bill Cosby accusers were\nUh years ago for decades ago\nThere was over like the course of like four or five decades I mean there are accusations dating as far back as probably like the seventies\nAnd I know for a fact that he would openly talk about like the Spanish fly and talk about things like that with people that he was close to\nWhich was like you know giving women drugs and putting a little mixture and they're and they're cocktail and then they would fall asleep I don't know if he openly raped people or if he drugged and raped them I'm sure he did a a bunch of different sort of combination\nBut I mean you had sixty women come forward saying that he did this sort of thing and kind of manipulated them because he was in a position of\nPower well and also um I have let go because it was a little bit loud and I wanted him to be able to hear him answers but I think the\n... one of the biggest things to well first of all Bill Cosby was sometimes from a woman of of recent past two thousand and four right correct all the other ones were out of the statute of limitations correct [noise] which would technically be which is what's confusing about Kavanaugh's that\nOh he's not being tried criminally investigation if he if he should get this job essentially right right which I guess if his record has been clean since this you know a\nAccusation right now or alleged incident that you know and nothing has happened the thing with Bill Cosby as there was there was proof there was there\nNot more and more evidence right now for like you know forty years ago but for more recent years and and more women saying and agreeing with the same you know situation he invited me into his room he drug to me he did this and you know I left and I you know felt whatever the case may be you know and it was it was a promise of\nBy default I mean yeah he's a Republican anything I didn't do it so obviously he's going to support people who support him back into doubt about that and there was a Democrat who voted to confirm it correct so I mean it it shouldn't be party lines but it is that\nIt is and I think that's where it got dirty because I think we've now seen how dirty our system really is because I don't know if he can have a democratic lawyer up on the stand and him being partial I don't think that's even possible it and if you're watching a boxing match\nAnd you want a may whether to win and McGregor it's fighting you're going to see all the good things may weather's doing not McGregor shared your your cat ... he's a one sided judge that scares me because I think our government is that way\nA whole governments mentality\nIs one sided because as you guys and there's that side and those are the two sides are looking at each other like the completely wrong so it's all about power and right now it's just a one sided power and that's what this was about this a lot about him touching a woman thirty five years ago it was about retaining power\nAnd that was that was that's all it was about and that is what politics is always about right but ah but it's just filthy I'm thirty and\nI mean every and now we just know too much I mean now now we're watching things live\nIn these ... you know I mean they didn't have that forty fifty years ago well deaf went down and they handled it and then you just heard the end result now we're watching the whole like we have an almost have a say in it so to speak oh yeah absolutely crazy it's it's too it's too much and I and I always say that I just we know too much we have exposure to too much\nAt its it's overwhelming and then\nThis is the kind of stuff that happened absolutely and if we would have had the technology we have now back in the eighties when this happened absolutely we would have known what happened or at least more people would have had their cell phones on them to probably would've been tax exchange somebody would have been a a right and yeah so um you just you just don't know\nWhat I'm saying you know if that's the ... just real which I just do because it's like with the NCAA when a team says oh you're going to investigate what happened you're not really trying to find anything because I think once this went down everybody knew what they were going to vote\nWhich way or another right you could investigate it all you want uh-huh couldn't change any minds were made you couldn't have changed like maybe one person change their mind that this whole thing yeah everybody else voted with the laws so we really wasted a lot of blame when what do you think should have happened then or what do you think it should be whole thing is a joke okay so you're ...\nThe what do you what would be if you were able to handle the situation what would you have\nDonald ... which I Would throw a bomb on all of politics that's what I was okay and being serious like last week when I was on the cat in the most showing inducted they were ... they said if he did this city's still get the job but I agree yes because\nThe next person that comes in may be worse than that one guy that did that thirty five years ago he may be worse because of who I ... I just don't trust\nPoliticians and judges and because\nThere are ... they can get away with what they want they've been getting away with what they wanted their whole lives you never hear judges get arrested for anything\nWho are the rest of the judge yeah nobody knocked me yeah I'm just told the judge them [laughter]\nI mean I think you're I think there's that there's truth in that and they

yeah actually I had called ... where it's hard to do now is yeah that's for ... all the way it's Ringo at either [laughter] real doctors aren't\nActually I went to new label cantina which used to be loves artifacts and they had heart tacos really and they were some of the better talk on the rat really like hell they ... the ... and ... get out and talk about it was one they fry it and I had a surfing turf taco that had steak\nAnd shrimp and the bus and there was one of the better chocolate sounds\nPretty good I I always turn right there [laughter] before I get over to the loves then I'll have to go straight and go there when the weather can I already know\nWhen I'm nine to ... okay so the pork belly talk as nice and the snow park ... hands down ... yeah I'm a ... year into\nThe trees

tacos\nI saw that one um I don't think you get off on those that's yeah that's just a joke [laughter] yeah that's real funny enough for fun it fell out a little ...\nQuestion are you going to be the the the machine don't worry about that\nToo ... worried about a tiny knowing that in wind and stuff that'd be the guy who's coming later we have a chef coming yeah chef Anthony Masters so will you got me who's going to be doing all this kind of stuff you've got Lee\nDesperate when we've had in here leaders are pit master came from ... market in Texas and Anthony Masters just we we needed a guy to be the chef and run the ...\nAnd and the guy just showed up one day Anthony Masters I Am the I have some mutual friends from the barbecue circuit restaurants circuit in New York City of all places I worked a hill country which is a well run well established barbecue restaurant in Manhattan he worked at our place called the um fatty cue\nAnd we have a bunch of regional friends up there but he's been here in town for a couple of years they'll tell us the story and was last working at on just one\nResult you know perfect big time chef when you got money barbecue guy who need somebody to\nTo be the chef and Anthony just kind of a period I didn't know where right at the right time so you've got top notch smokers and top notch chefs yelling man we got a team over there really fun fun team no doubt can I got a satellite we've got another guy in the kitchen Eric that is a huge bone fan that just from the coast guard\nAnd so you can imagine what kind of organized dude he is no doubt we got a strong team over there right now I Love it\nCan you explain the difference between a chef I'm a pit master and like all their heads so I Know like the ... the chef all that but can you explain that\nWell [laughter] no I couldn't help everyone kind of making it up as one of the one of the issues with a barbecue restaurant is the pit master isn't necessarily a accomplished chef\nAnd the chef isn't necessarily an accomplished pit master so a lot of crossover certainly a good thing um\nBut in our case we really needed both because of the extensive menu and and so much more than barbecue I mean Lee Lee is going to have his hands full cooking all the barbecue and keeping his eye on that um and so we need somebody to also run the kitchen I mean it's a big busy restaurant where we assume busy\nSo I the hierarchy the oh I don't know they're probably the same level um but so far everybody's getting along really good so we don't have any issues with ... very very early life an open yet my wire now have\nYou thought of them with what was it came down the hill can help people\nI didn't see it I knew that if you have to fill it up loving keep\nCatching like the four of us are four of us standing around looking at the smoker\nLike if you let them eat or something they ... they had the king of the you know music\nOr we got a phone call and we have David David you're a you're on flavor of Tampa Bay how you doing brother\nHey listen I've been going uh smoking Asia's ever since you guys are talking about it to grow return them over that way and I pick up pick up to go you know maybe two thousand pulled pork and last time I got\nSome of the first ... um well my question is uh by bringing home and then there's a the part of this slow products to have a longer life span like
