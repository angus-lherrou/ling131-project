I don't know ... bad medicine and now now my opinion on this uh as far as ah Orange County is maybe not Disney gives I've been on a Disney cruise and they don't have gambling ... by universal could open up a a an adult area\nAnd I like the planet Hollywood and do they have like a ... casino out and\nYeah but even if they if they put one or two properties on one or two places on their property that we're gambling establishments oh man that would be fantastic\nYeah but you let me tell you the state of Florida her's things up\nRemember for years when it came to expanded gambling and this was before Charlie Crist made the dug a very good deal right state of Florida with assemble Indians and keep in mind at that time the symbol Indians were holding us hostage they said look we are we going to commit eighty billion dollars in tax revenue to the state of Florida if we get this contract Chris sign that people were pissed\nYou know the Indians could have said OK screw you were going to the department of Indian affairs in Washington and cut a deal with them\nWill give Washington eighty one billion dollars and not the state of Florida Charlie Crist is hands were tied he had to make that

mutual the dog tracks horse tracts they're constantly losing money so that gives a slot machines give us slot machines in the states said no and then the state finally said I'll tell you what do it on

Jacksonville Orange Park up in Panama City borough is that track all voted for slot machines overwhelmingly right when I said yeah we kind of changed her mind on that can't have it now or in a Supreme

I mean that's a good question how do you even enforce it if everybody on the campus agrees which is hard to get everybody to agree but say they do now they have an event the other team shows up\nNow what happens now you got guys score a goal ...\nCan you ... if you're on the field maybe they just play with himself\nIn a stadium where they put it on the big you know an ounce variety thing or whatever why no clapping and people might not take it seriously but like I said the first two or three or a handful of people that whenever I get asked all get out and they like Oakland ...\nI'm going to protest and I'm not yell out or anything you I'm going away my hands and judge has you I protest on ... I mean it's it's ridiculous you can't like you can't talk loud\nCan you jazz hands around her mother's ...\n[laughter] I'm like I go to ... but it could work I don't know\nAnd I mean no I'm not a fan of that I Would I don't like that I'd heard but I mean I respect everybody's if that's what they want to do with that school and that's what ended up happening that ball that's our call I going to be not about it\nI respect that they wanted\nI don't respect that they have the gym that everybody throughout I don't like I don't like the whole\n... the the many have been for the fields\nAnd don't get down and that's the whole that's today's culture you you asked earlier when did we start having to many to benefit if it was because for ... for this entire existence\nIt's all been the majority of and I'm Sorry to say an average white men are between the ages of twenty five fifty for get everything you know they're the majority they get everything they never wanted now there are a minority groups happened back and able to maybe have right there in there for a lot of it makes me uncomfortable\nAnd as long as there are about color but thought about minority color wise it's about handicapping how long way less handicapped people to know\nHow about this because their own race for about a ... if it's about crowd noise in the noises and the triggering of kids with anxiety or whatever it is\nBuild sky boxes\nWhere it can be closed off and those kids have access to those seats right and then the only ones and this way I can still go and enjoy my game ... of one quite a sky box right now I Can't go and do something that I Love right because a handful of people can handle make lap and\nYou can still watch your team you just no no no I didn't go to the game that I Love you can I'm sure are clap and cheer that's nuts and it's not right it's wrong\nIt's wrong and I don't have issues\nListen I have friends who have close friends who have kids with autism and I get it we do a big event on a on a road show it's called a touchy truck when we bring in all different kinds of trucks\nInto a big giant parking lot helicopters everything Ken's could go around they can climb in the truck to be the ones who all the other stuff right\nFor an hour beforehand we open it up it's it's silent it's quiet all horn no nothing so kids would sensory issues can go and enjoy it and have a great time\nTotally cool because I think the sky box cost money and I think that jazz hands are free\nWell I understand but it's a free ... is it really free though it's at my it's my\nIt's so expensive while the team has fallen entertainment nobody will show up anymore\nIt's just saying no far let's just say like you know what is it in Manchester University of Maryland and okay so you just soccer for you know ... obviously huge there\nUnless you say it draws like college football does he him right\nIf they are losing money\nYou watch how quick it goes away you know what I'm saying like\nSilent crowd would be the most secure you've ever seen in the ... it shouldn't make change\nIt to different something different and you don't have to run against different like it's different and like you were you might be right about the money thing in which case when nobody knows how they let them do their thing they're going to discover it's not profitable and they're going to go back and all this well but there's no need to you know ... because someone's trying something different let them be then I don't want to go to a game like that and I thought\nWell that's what I'm saying so I Love going to these games but now I Can't do anything that I enjoy I Can't do what I Love to do anymore because a handful of people have issues with clapping\nAnd therein lies and every time I think if it's the bills and I loved them that much and like a fan of his whole jak nope I guess what if I live in Buffalo and I love the bill's I'm going any land you in the world like I I Love my team that much\nI don't know why the silent football game\nYou have a couple of weeks you might just got to come on I Will\nNot like and I think it's a horrible idea but like I said if I'm On a die hard fan I when you go to that game I'm not letting little anything stopped me know when you're ...\nCheerleader fan and you're you're ... yeah\nAnyway we actually go to a bar and I'll have I'll be as long as they want to be\n... I Lived through jak you you've dealt with this thing before God\nYes how ya doing shirts I take my call no problem\nA ... there's nothing louder than a lightning game in ... doors and we'd take a four year old grandson who had yes tubes in his ears and whatnot and all we do is we put the ear protection air muscle\nAnd happy and older screams ladder to me [laughter] I\nDon't have to worry about screaming clapping booms love music loud noise whatever\nNo it would cost like twelve bucks with the lightning ...\nOh that's awesome\nYeah [laughter] and there's a lot of children there at at the arena that have 'em all\n... they do the same thing at the a ... a monster jam and stuff like that yeah the yeah the construction the mosques and everything else everything's all\nRight so ... ... it was all guys you best thank you\nJoe is on line for not good enough to go on a cruise [laughter] Hey Joe [laughter]\nA a ... is is this was also ... about that guy though you're not going anywhere this week right um\n[noise] no I was gonna say shaky we gotta look at the long term on the band they got to carry this over to every ... every\nElementary school graduation so that your kid gets up there and you're just clap and you get kicked out immediately\nKnow more than ... any of that you're clap you get kicked out stomach it right now I have\n[laughter] how about this do we really don't want they will not let this rule go through once nobody's clapping of the kids play and there's twenty seven second graders crying other stage do like uh yeah we talked about it you can pull up\nThen you don't know what ... is titled or anybody that\nWill recitals our old friend you got to go into a sporting event role and not being a little\nClapping and whooping cheer is like going to a comedy club go see a comic and not being able to laugh\nYeah working at work like a strip or not if you're up a dollar bill\nThey jump shot at all of us really the same way that you know what I'm saying like it just doesn't make any sense\nThat if we're going to rule out then what else are going to rule out ... car motorcycle you can't I mean how many\nThings are loud and loyalty how they have laws on that's all right so the certain right but there for some of the century has probably still too loud so where are they going to\nThem so we'll see if it spreads maybe it doesn't have a shot here I don't tell me what to do but some college you're I think it's going to do it I don't see why they wouldn't think they're already and communication you know\nYeah it'll be the Mormons\n[laughter] Mormons or you know sometimes a very loud people may not want to do it all started BYU\nChina China for life as a point how you get home field advantage with jazz hands\nYou know knocking on what they're doing to January ... was that\nThe announcers have to be quiet to like a lightning game or something like stem coast to heaven shoots and scores that was amazing\nAnd Jack ... and you can't see and hear more to shop lightning or one nothing right in the five all what about you watching the world cup go ooh\nOoh ooh\nI don't know I think you got it leave it to the ...\nWell it's crazy we live in this guy is doubling is minimum wage Mm doubling if for their cause said more goods said it was just going from eight to Fifteen he's almost doubling is minimum wage and people get a bitch about that\nWell [laughter] you know what we'll do it about fast food was a different McDonald's is huge\nNow what am I going to be said it's not enough oh yeah of course that's what I'm saying\nFrom eight to Fifteen dollars an hour and people going to bitch that that's not enough shut up well\nThen we'll go for the job of wants to the living wage law can you live on per hour why what's the number but if you're working full time you can ... dollars an hour but not great you know six hundred dollars or thirty thousand a year that's running around\nThis and the guy that does all the fries at McDonald's though ever meant to be a career is the highest in high school job that's what it was meant to be you know and now a\nBook about the Amazon job is probably not\nThat I don't know where you're paying Fifteen dollars an hour and ... and warehouse workers or celebrating about isn't\nJust warehouse worker no but there are some of them they're always over working it's all it's all time part of our what it is reasonable minimum\nWage is Fifteen dollars for a fact two hundred fifty thousand employees in a hundred thousand seasonal workers okay in a good way right so the ones that anybody bits in about ask about a Spanish I don't know [laughter]\nWell yeah the I mean they're they're they're encouraging other companies to do it like I said well I Know it all you're doing what they can afford it targets\nDoing it I Believe in twenty Nineteen they're going to Fifteen dollars\nAn hour I'm right Walmart is going to I think from eight to eleven\nWas only making five fifty or whatever the numbers and that's a jump right that's good I mean it it doesn't mean the rich but if it's a nice jump the you know when you make money now everything relates I mean that's that's what I was raised I don't want to force Fifteen is great but so it was twenty five and you and go what\nNo I don't know how it's going to work at Amazon I have no idea on my I Would imagine that ... stuff like that works and we've seen in the past and some companies who decided to give them ... employs a little bit more money there hours were reduced\nSo it's it it evens out so are you leaving in even make I don't know if that's what's gonna happen and Amazon or not but not in line at the same concept is when everybody had to have\n'em an awful time employees had to have health insurance and all of a sudden nobody can be full time everybody has to be under\nAnd that was the one that was the way the business has got around\nThat time thing and there's always a way you can pay Fifteen dollars an hour later you only have ten hours a week\nRight but what I Would say is and this is well disagree with you uh what was your what you're saying is true he's doing it voluntarily nobody\nPutting a gun to his until I got her raises minimum wage so I doubt he's raising it to then screw them\nNo that's true now you're right and now with the health insurance it was mandatory you're right\nBecause what you want to do now is and that's the biggest thing in business is you want to keep the best and the brightest you know you want to keep the best so when you take care of those people they did not want to leave really\nThat's a great theory oh yeah oh yeah the theory that's great what am I missing all that I say something wrong or you know and embarrassingly you make sense that does make sense to you or not even being sarcastic he's you know there's a lot of their jobs which they felt you know it\nSounds to me like someone who might be taking a soldier but management\nI just agree with everything you said a lot of them\nYou know the people who are you don't want to be more jobs you agree with\nMe and the world still spin\nThat and which you know that means it could work the other way around on rent ... mother way no because the other way round is wrong I disagree with everything you just said [laughter]\nWhat are the poverty line with us for one person single person working his twelve thousand four hundred eighty dollars [noise]\nYou know and these have you worked Fifteen dollar an hour fulltime you make thirty thousand that's for five person household that's above rely so\nIf you're making this money your way above what's considered the poverty line you know where it's really really bad right\nSo I mean as things go back to their what they pay people I mean that's pretty good I mean we all know day to day life it's a little tough to live on Fifteen dollars an hour but a lot of people do it no problem you know they do it every day so\nFamiliar on line three of them are are you\nI'm good how are you OK welcome to the program thank you well I\nJust wanted to say I'm a nurse and you know had to go to school for that I'm actually charge the salad I only make Seventeen dollars an hour\nWow my husband is a chef at a very high end restaurant we live in Panama City beach and he only makes Thirteen an hour he had to go to school for that too we both all my with it\nSo he started off at the gym with McDonalds he did that for twelve years and they came a chef ... and we barely make more he makes less than Fifteen an hour I barely make more than Fifteen an hour so I don't understand and\nIt's basically a high school kids that are demanding Fifteen what I keep people alive all day long and I barely make over Fifteen an hour\nOr there's that many nurses that you can only get Fifteen bucks an hour there's so many nurses that you have to take it because there's people waiting to lined up for your job\nNo the problem is trying to find a job that isn't going to crush are still there are many job opportunity that okay you Nineteen twenty dollars an hour in our area\nBut no job that you're going to be working at a nursing home watching an old people die all day and not ... yeah every day you're going oh my God those aren't jobs that I personally can emotionally handles I took it Seventeen dollars an hour church nurse gate which holds the odd\n... high school and they made over Fifteen an hour right\nWow and your husband probably made more as a manager at McDonald's than he does now as a sous chef yes right to work its way up\nWell\nAs a manager at McDonalds he had really good benefits he needed the money now but that was a soul crushing job because he worked at McDonalds\nSo he'd invited I'm going to become a chef he went through colon airy arts program at all that fun stuff we are still paying off it all out for it and he makes an hour and a very fine dining restaurant\nBut you also know he knew that going in\nAnytime you watch any of these shows and the chefs and you've heard them talk or read the book or whatever it is that job is a grind it is a seven day week grind with ours that make almost no money\nUh until you're able to get your own thing you know we're going in your your your husband knack a new it going in I'm sure the Jim ... a McDonald's you making fifty grand\n[noise] no no and learning about thirty six okay much as a gym mhm yeah I work a lot of what he had\nHe had a lot of hours he didn't get paid overtime salary and he had really good that benefit though like our insurance was very very cheap like that but he when they're open and close almost every day and he didn't make over thank you ...\nYou know is that when I arrived nurse needs to be a private chef and it looks a lot of things you can break up and go wow you know [laughter]\nNot as simple as qualified and as skilled as she isn't she's right just like save lives every day I was even work but those are the businesses that like they're like well if I was I was Fifteen I don't know why am I not getting twenty five in the business is going to support it because of the margins I guess\n... Brooklyn Mike is on line to open your own business and what it is probably right\nWell you know the funny thing is everybody's talking about the employees but nobody's ever considering the small business owner I Wish that I rely basically I Would say eighty percent of my income that comes in is said to the government to the state of Florida\nNow the state of Florida is demanding that all of my employees of the train and highly trade and all that stuff and then the employees are demanding a higher salary because they have all this training but then the state of Florida\nNot increase to pay me to show us to subsidize\nThis income and you know it's a it's a catch twenty two I feel bad for the employees but as a small business shoulder they start ... increase the minimum wage you know you take the small guy\nPocket that's providing income for people and they wind up shutting his doors because you can't keep up you\nKnow you can I get up\nPaying people twelve dollars or eleven dollars or ten dollars an hour or whatever it is and you're forced to go to Fifteen will that shut you down\n... it it would bring me pretty close to it because you know it it's\nLike yeah yeah because the thing is that the Ninety nine percent of the damage I mean you know they take each ...\n... they get their started vacations but a ... it's really not something that show why that I Will say okay well let me say somebody Fifteen or twenty dollars an hour to ship down to do the job that they're doing and the government has not giving us an increase\nOf payments for almost twelve years they're still very much but it does take him out at minimum wage keeps going up but what the government and everything will not increase arch she'll she'll she'll port ...\nIs it are they going to do away with the other cat or innocent in any I don't know I\nMentioned I bet you they keep all the way with everything that doesn't have his voice on it\n[laughter] that's a tough it's going to uh the the tax will say this is a test of the national wireless emergency alert system no action is needed so that's what it's going to text you and it will come right out there and there's\nThe agency advise that right now for this one you can opt out but there's people who are opposed to it and say it infringes on the first Amendment rights\nI guess so they're going to they just want the option\nTo opt out on something a ... face\nThis hopefully we'll never have to happen you know you always hope there's no easy I guess those are the big alerts to happen with big storms on the radio and TV have it on our phones do you do is get your ... right now I don't know what the presidential alert level is but I Would think it's really bad\nIt's getting ... now it's going to say this is the ... tax you've ever had any thoughts on our skin we're in a tremendous alert down\nIt's like um when the when it wasn't like I don't know three years ago four years ago when a apple every people woke up one morning and had a brand new you two album on their on their iPhones ... people in like that and everybody based about right I'm not ...

bounty processed and one of them from the bone Rosh Hashanah to reflect to grab a lot [noise] so you guys know what all forest or the meal wildfires\nHave been going on or a west but there's one that happened in Arizona looks like it was back in April okay so here's how what happened a border patrol agent his wife a pregnant and wanted to\nDo a gender revealed party a\nBorder patrol agent and his wife I write\nSo he has his idea like All right we're going to do is I'm going to shoot a target and the flu or paying powders going to come out\nBut you know if you just shoot the regular old target it'll just make holes and then like dribble out and won't be anything like any good okay so he gets a explosive by legal substance called Tanner rice and he put some in the target itself so when he shoots it goes boom and then all the pink or blue whatever powder comes out\nSo they have the party issues to target the ensuing explosion there in Arizona sparks of fire that spreads Dr Raasch spurred on by unusually high winds and lower than average rainfall by\nTime the fire that was started with this gender reveal party was contained over a week later fired than eight million dollars worth\nOf damage to for forty seven thousand acres\nCrazy [noise]\nHe admitted to it immediately went running trying to get help because the fire started and spread so quickly and of course he's been charged with a causing a fire without a\nPermit is what they charge him with and now it happened uh just over a year ago now he is going to court and pled guilty and the finest come forward he's got to pay a hundred thousand dollars and then you've got to pay five hundred a month for Twenty years so he's going to end up paying somewhere close to two hundred thousand\nTwo hundred and twenty thousand total five hundred a month for twenty Twenty years plus a hundred thousand dollar initial payment but anyhow\nUm Brelo policy that covers and for all I don't know if I don't know if your insurance would ever cover a crime [laughter] 'cause that's what they're calling for starting a fire without it's ... it's got a funny way he\nWas he's saying what he was doing ...\nWas it was not a legal\nRight call results have been right but ... you know what I'm saying like so I guess there's algae could have anticipated Uighur are\nLegal mhm the explosives the explosives legal target shooting we go to\nThe ... problem mhm\nPills are covered in mosquito and it was apparently obviously just super dry tinder\nAnd so that I live in people's homes are apparently not apparently it was a hills and um you know hillsides of of this mosquito stuff but eight hundred people did have to evacuate but they didn't lose their homes so they definitely ...\nAll right so then what burnt to it's going to cost him a few hundred thousand\nDollars forty three thousand acres of property to maybe some of the property operate whore is like Brian somebody owns\n... mosquito and trees in Russian you know it's a mix it's in the foothills of the Santa Rita mountains so I mean somebody's property and they said it cost ... million to put it out I guess is the point\nAnd and damage equity because a million dollars to put the fire and and the damages ensuing so Jesus it's almost like the unions got their hands on the ... [laughter] I didn't want them to pay for restitution buddy can't have million dollar so what did he lose his job\nIt doesn't say if he lost his border patrol job they happened to the border patrol hasn't\nCommented so I ... as of June he's still employed but they haven't commented so that saying that maybe the waiting for this to be over and then we'll decide\nBut I mean it's just the gender reveal thing I guess you could say it's getting a little out of hand out when it's just unfortunate the way it went you know it it didn't have to be that bad but it was to have a couple of examples in Europe people who do gender reveal parties or because of her ... I've never been to one that\nThat sound that Brett plays all the time the baseball bat hitting the chicken and fish or the guy in the face whatever was that was the gender revealed our own\nBall was supposed to go for ... attorney the pink or blue [laughter] didn't go to a face single poof\nOught to be a A R examples that here was a grandfather to be getting smacked in the face with a powder field baseball the habit of California that's several and it just ended up with his hair all blue so it was almost like a movie I think pretty funny\nBut there's another one guy had a watermelon that he filled with the right color\nWhen he made the inside of the watermelons are full of whatever the pink or blue stuff was what's it back together and then had a live alligator put the watermelon in the alligators mouth and so of course the ... I Would go to snap it's jaws on it watermelon explodes out it's blue jello all over the grass\nPlumber ... not bad nothing went wrong with that one but people maybe going a little too far with the gender of building ... think that cause I got two hundred twenty thousand dollars that's supposed to be how much it costs you to raise a kid\nTo Eighteenth all gender or whatever and I guess what are you kidding me\nNo to raise a kid you know you don't have that kind of money it's more like three hundred thousand well over Eighteen years he'd\nBe like to watch [laughter] it's just one it's going to cost to to raise a kid\nYou know like what what's\nHappened and I believe that a number of Eighteen to twenty two so far out um icon right so he was booed I asked you know they figure it out to come up with a number like almost every or how do people\nHere that number and say yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna get Patty I'm ... I'm going to be so happy about all of that knowing full well that never seen over your head howdy eye on who's\nThere is one of the kids that plays out my son's hockey team this six of them the six\n... normally there from like ... fan too I think the oldest is ten so they're all and that has like six of them that are in there\nThose that husband and wife that is NASCAR pit crew you want to talk about a well oiled machine we were at a tournament I just sat back and watch them go because we all had me down in the lobby for breakfast and everything else and they were like\nThere was nothing something it was great I dropped a napkin from across the room the father sort out before I got all the\nCrap out of that you can have six kids if you want them by hand all you're bending you know and yeah and that's cool if you if you can afford it and you can you know keep that crowd at night and knowing everything else in the entire around because you decided had six kids your tank I had a dream last night and it's just so weird\nYou realize is a welfare conversation to be hadn't here right right\n... oh you have tons of people who have kids who can't afford it well that's true and you and Irish and for ...\nIf if society I don't know if that's the thing and I said it's a far case by case basis\nI don't know what each individual second can't ed ... signed how everybody because I I I don't I thought it was early ... you're right I Am right absolutely knowledge but some people need that and use it or anything that I Would rather have nothing's perfect that comes up in a perfect system\nI Would rather ... or something that would help the people who truly okay\nYou want it in stock adapt and whom I\nKnow I don't want I don't I don't want to starve to death but I wouldn't mind seeing them drug tested before you keep getting more having more babies and getting benefits\nI mean you you have your ...
