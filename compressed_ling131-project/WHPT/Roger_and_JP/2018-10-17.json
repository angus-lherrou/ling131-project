[laughter] yeah it's so\nGreat it makes me laugh though in a kind of expected of a mad dog Russo right kind of expect that personnel\nOn the baseball on the sports thing real quick did you see the thing I guess I guess\nThere was some allegations that the Astros cheated in game one of the ALCOA\nThan somebody um they had somebody apparently allegedly they had somebody standing outside the dug out of the red Sox ... ... you know it was all\nAlong credential person or something but yeah it was not graduate person outside and the\nConcern that they were listening in and this and the other thing\nRight and I'm like okay let's just say they caught him right handed ... how do you ... what happens\nYeah I don't know what baseball would do because they don't want to affect the series the way it is right so I Want to work it out between the team's ... if you find out one team is cheating ...\nOkay what is the penalty those baseball even know what the penalty is or should be\nCase by case basis I think completely I really don't think that you know because high around Mr to hiring some worker\nDoesn't change the fact that you just cheated in the L. C. S. maybe gave you and and could have given yourself an unfair advantage so far and that guy is nothing to do it now that team goes on a Wednesday say they did cheat and the Astros go on and when the Arabs see as the red Sox the aft\nNot that I mind that all that much but Dr Sachs rapid they don't deserve it\nYeah and the other thing is in the red Sox had a situation where there are pictures had some sort of shiny substance on their arm and the picture you would see would go to his arm like this all the time and they were saying it was pointed out to actually get a better grip on the ball and make the ball move on their ...\nI Know I think I saw it on the game they were mentioning oh look the way he's going to his arm and I didn't really hear anything so maybe those two things are gonna wash each other\nRight and well no you know okay so let's just take the Astros asked how do you let them a pint are their arms ...\nThe ... if they have it you throw the player out mhm this fines and everything else I got it but if somebody is standing outside the dug out you know what I'm saying like now you got outside other employees it's not just happening on the field\nWho said he was doing anything wrong though because it's so we all your astro staffer was right there I was like this guy does that credential but he's OK I'm just\nSaying what if they were caught cheating mhm gave themselves an advantage what right could derive major league baseball do write what could what what can they can take I don't think they can do anything ... who\nCould be fine so I I don't know what they would do if they're not going to mess with the game because this is the best series by far what's going on here I understand that when I was now you got many metabolism that you see that person [laughter] man for the ... you\nMiss it up here you know to ... I guess yesterday in the papers it was Yankees need to go all in on many Machado\nRight today it's Yankee should stay\nClear of many Machado and many Machado and all his antics only been twenty four I always in the locker yes\nThe same paper by the way same paper New York Yankees should go all in today should steer\nClear poison these poison but did you see what he did that's nice yeah what a prank or something like that you read the headline was running running out a ground ball\nAnd he's running to first base any kicks the first baseman so the first baseman Mike is on the bag you know because of an effect on any kind of exercise now you read the headline you think you make it think like he stopped short of first base lined up like it was kicking a field goal the shot at his apple [laughter] that's not what happened\nBut it is blatant it is blatantly\nBenches cleared and everything else and he does need to get his teeth knocked out\nBut [laughter] and he said something about that you know I don't hostile yes but he doesn't run a business is not what I Do I don't like to run down the line rifle or something and and ah who ... who was the guy the brewers are you all those things last name\nYeah that's a pitcher got in trouble for Twitter for having a heat tweets from like ten years ago\nRight when he was Eighteen oh is that what was wrong yeah he said after mother Africa [laughter] talking about ... like there's all sorts of really good stuff going on in the background is making that series a little more interesting\nHe's gotta know they're gonna throw it is that he's got to know that it would be the right situation I was in the tenth inning so chances are he wasn't going to get up again Mm but he's got to know that\nYeah the ... like really clunk I'm really hard look into me like trade off for the ankle something like that it might happen if it can get a little little pesky Jesus makes it more interesting though\nI just think it's funny that this no I Would love to be able to go like go into the rule book show me the rule book where I can see what the penalty is like I guarantee they don't have it like it's not ownership loses you know you

what it means\nRight that I had a home run matched with Billy Martin comes out because that's how I mean he was smart like that or are you a certain manages like why did they replay a whole game because what we know they replayed from the point of the home run\nSo they go where they send everybody home that day what happened was the game ended they said ... home run of the couch with the
