I mean where's the bill was he's smoking I saw him no\nI did not heating I look around me I did not see him on it I mean if you were talking or something not even and then on why locked away because the listener came up I Want to take a picture with me and he felt awkward so he he walked away\nOh I mean you guys never followed each\nOther on a map of that no the game started I went inside I don't know where he went on and then but I Know he started smoking after we broke up I Know that I'm\nRight all of a wild or anything could happen since well that's true you're right who knows what\nAre they all that does bother me though that he would walk away like if you had any intention why women to hang out what you took a picture looks like five star yet but they weren't there together right why wouldn't hang ups talk a little more and\nMore you know I'm not the way I just know argue that you know I'm just look at our behavior yeah\nWhy would I wrote him talk to a little more if it was going well and you're like you and you're supposed to you I Would just walk away and not have to say\nGoodbye or number you want to Facebook or Twitter or something because we're goes what are they\nDated they weren't Monica wasn't if I'm wrong you please correct me as high profile as you are now\n[noise] um and I worked at CBS at the time we did um I mean\nI read what other\nSports that the nation it was on his now to find so probably you're probably right okay\nSo maybe he was used to you having a public persona loving\n'em he no that's not true\nWell you don't even know where I was I'm I'm trying to figure it out\nNow he would do a bunch of radio things that he lived I was on the radio and listen to me and he you know he he met on my radio people and\nYeah yeah who knows you might have to listen to talk about what he's ...\nHe's not listen and he's he's I don't know what's his name I don't want to say now now there are a little less than he can't let me know course not no you might not know why would a God about race you know we get good ratings right [laughter]\nAny kind of ... percent of the guys who listen to show you know between a loving into everyday ... will support he wasn't going to get hurt his chances are but\nI think you're making a mistake not even if you were if you could say that love was there I think you're making a mistake not just saying hey what's up ... you came up to give up my mind that I just want to reach out and say hello\n... going on here five years ago or sick right now right now that I'm not that changed in the ... of\nCourse

willing to try and test the waters and then when all of a sudden they get the death penalty the next person probably not going to try and get their score on a plane\nYou know come to understand she let them know in advance he had and support animal yeah well not squirrels in which you can have one but not a squirrel and if they don't say that that she can bring the rules\nShe got there and then they they told us she had to leave with the squirrel she wouldn't get off the plane and they said well we're going to have to get everybody else off this plane and she says go ahead you're not taking

longer now they have to pay the fines and all that other stuff\nIt's you know in advance that it can't be a squirrel specifically because if she didn't then that's not her fault\nThey study how they're going to ... I didn't know my bag was Seventy five miles are going to be fifty and I got to pay extra for a while\nI tell you what are you going to be too bad you know you don't tell you an advance it can only be fifty pounds and you bring on and you know that in advance and you bring on Seventy five and ...\nGone rodents ... like the cops come on the cops come on now the cops come on the plane\nAnd she's refusing to leave now the cops and know\nThat you know a\nCouple of months ago maybe you take her off the plane kicking and screaming and you bounce a face off every role on the way out the door\nBut now now\nNow they can't do that anymore so what are the cops say because like All right you stay right here everybody else off the plane now that woman knows that every camera phone is now off the plane\nMeaning that could have gone on cars one because when the when when one once the cops cleared the plane off all of a sudden she was like okay I'll go [laughter]\nYeah but do you think she knew she was leaving the under the threat of all these police officers beating her on the plane they still have to walk her off in front of a crowd okay no no the other ones do\nYou think that maybe she ... she things if she gets it maybe she can sue somebody because what I Would like to do for you know if you exhibit day the um the news piece\nYes and listen to the whole thing but hey but pay specific attention to the very end\nRight and here is this starts with a lady who brought this world on the plane your shoes\nTo share that taking a squirrel sorry\nBut then he was coming to visit family in Cleveland and she ... she got her squirrel named daisy to help with severe anxiety\nShe'll sit in the palm of my hand I can cover up the ladder and she gives a kiss us\nShe says she went to the checking desk with daisy but when she got her seat there was a problem\nAnd she said are you getting off the plane if you don't then we have to the board everybody okay Dave ward them but I've taken my score with\nEveryone on the plane had to get off\nWe didn't when we were like ready to go up just for us who have a ... as a hat\nAnd police came to take Cindy and the squirrel off skew\nIt's true what they did to me\nAnd he said not have been able to get past\nThe essay if the soil was an animal\nWhy did she get as far as\nThat is a good question I was at the vigil went through security with no problem\nHe says you can hold her so she doesn't have to go through ...\nAnd he said told us in an email this girl was screen the same way someone's cat would be great a container with and through the X ray machine\nAnd the passenger carry this world through the walk through metal detector they say it's up to the airline to determine if an animal may fly right Cindy says she understands why daisy might not be welcome on a plane\nOf somebody brought a rat or a snake or spider transfer onto the plane I wouldn't feel a little crazy I can sympathize with people that don't want her to their shoes and to carry today's\nFriend here says it wasn't clear Cindy the animal was a squirrel but they still refunded her money and gave her ... her weight has that's not an I of course I Will\nOwn up big portion of this airline\nOngoing for blood\nAll the way I Am contacting in attorney and take it from there\nYou know me know Monica would you like store just to go for\nThe best you can get it that way too\nEarly refund her or money you know a guy by now I go back to the police were geniuses bike\nClearing everybody off the plane because that woman once you realized that nobody was going to have a camera video footage of this whole thing of her being mistreated all of a sudden she fell right in line and got harassed off the plane\nGreat work by the cops ... are not out as much fun as I think they should have\nA I don't think they were going to have older but I think that\nYou're right because of the video would have been hers now she wraps it I'm like oh it's all whatever and she makes something out of it and they already been hurting her and she can make it look like this poor old ladies get mistreated and you're right that's a great move by the cop\nI'm not saying that everybody should behave the way I behave but I Will say that if I'm travelling\nWith a pet or a an emotional support animal is on me to contact the airline and find out if my animal\nWill be allowed to vote you on that plane before I buy my ticket horses okay who actually she didn't want the answer\nSo she didn't tell anybody that it was ... she was bringing a squirrel she just wanted to get pass everybody and hope nobody asked any questions for me now those new ways you can either ask permission or beg forgiveness Mm\nShe does she wanted to try the banks were getting his route and it didn't work out and now she thinks she's entitled to half the airline that\nSo that's a bit much their lady oh\nNow I'm going to own a big percentage of the word ... not not even a lawsuit\nYou were treated perfectly they gave me your money back you're lucky you got your money back you inconvenienced a plane and they took on that causes shape you mentioned and all those people to ours and you've got your money back\nYou should shut up and walk home with your score all you're lucky you got out of there are stupid and then by the way when she came out off the gang way they pushed around the wheelchair and all the crowd is out there waiting for to get off the clock 'cause she's getting off the plane so they can finally fly under taking video and she gives everybody the finger\nRight no she ... right\nI Know you guys don't think I Know I I now have like a man crush on Joe Rogan but this kind of a reason so yes it means weeds out a picture of a squirrel\nOr leaping with a with a ... mouth they go some crazy a whole tried to bring an emotional support square on a plane\nYou know I mean when you're walking around you and then the rest of your life with one hand everybody's like\nPeople have not guy he just took your soul of bread was when he was eight no hands poor guy hung his hand from a lie posed to remind everybody that they'll do that but it all fix everything you [laughter] away which only makes everything\nWhat country do you think it has more crimes us or Iran\nYeah everything's horrible in Iran now I bet you\nListen I'm and I'm not saying I'm not pro Iran by and I'm just talking about like you know we were a little bit harsher on stuff\nMaybe people will do it in a sense no matter what their number humans are gonna what crimes about where you are so there's that but I don't know it's it's tough to tell that's a tough one number off of these you know many crimes were capital I got look that up brackets me\n[laughter] you know why they when they ... what do you do something wrong and you your crime is\nI won't commit a crime ...\nYou're all the shady I haven't committed a crime and an envelope and getting your electricity ... whenever I that's just bribery ... run over by ... ... ... and the whole bribery\nDoes not inconvenience a hundred and thirty some people that are just trying to get to where they\nAll but it does bribery with the ah elect our oil or you know I'm I'm delayed my power because you got a head of the line 'cause you gave them fifty bucks and now I have to wait to get that doesn't mean\nI shouldn't be the one penalized the one who took her bra you know what I'm saying and now he's making the laws John on line three what's going on John\nHey guys how to write\nUs I'm Still a real fact that's what I say I've
