B. you can as you think about it um one they've already made their game and\nThen another kid that at the end of Jay v.'s gonna have to get kicked\nOff because you can only write but I'm surprised usually you can have twenty three on a soccer team I played all through college and so ... as well but you can usually have plenty of Eighteen twenty three players on route\nBut JV is used to feed your varsity program\nYeah no I understand that it's just you know they can they can hold on\nThere telling this kid who played JV it was good enough to play JV but didn't make velocity why not if he's a junior why not let them similar one more year on JV\nOr beyond well I the only thing I can say is that the team has been made on the J beach to already so they'd have to kick a kid up the Jamie

take\nYeah you don't have the right no that's all remember too but then I mean we met again when we were there like if we had a ninth grade and that was the start and I had ninth graders playing up on varsity and I had eleventh grade is playing right in the right\nThe thing is he made a good point and it's true if if those guys they change the rules so the parts of the guys would do it but just missed the team slide down to the JV now the kids who would have made the back of the JV team now begun knocked out now they're sort of\nLike how do you\nYou know you can't keep everybody happy in

we all know what the ... the truth is on both sides that would be right back to the ultimate thing that's how it should be no matter which way it goes I just want to know what the truth\nOr not what happens is so now let's just say it's all done by friday they vote friday because they have the amount of votes ... unless something crazy comes out that has absolute proof that had happened he gets voted to go through and then it goes to the Senate floor right and then once it gets to the center for the vote him through because Republican\nOr that route could go as long ago and go but the only way to go as long as the quite as long as it gets done by the or hide I don't know if it's going to the folks I don't know you know what I'm saying I don't know I I was thinking not I'm Still thinking about\nWhose plan B plan B is a woman right apparently the next person on the list apparently I mean they could change you know put on anybody to walk but apparently a conservative female judge\nNext thing you know some guys going to come out she grabbed my ass at a party you know you know I don't know how are they going to like ... you gotta wonder okay if they know that the woman is a next went up what's the game plan for that one\nWell as the female judges up before who have been a knocked out of the box you know for whatever reason I mean ... well the most famous I think was her name but she had um an illegal immigrant as a husky\nSo that that was a long time ago none at all to do that no something tells me if you investigated half of the senators ... they don't get popped for that mhm I feel like you're with after like there were two all of them so but you know and what about asking\nThe question is owed all of them are Davis recording a library when he got there it was\nGood afternoon guys show um I read something today are about\n... ... it's just a judge on laws in a case where old and they lost the house\n... vote on it and she was on the show she was a judge at the time um so I think there's a bit solves a you know we want to get his own dark\nWhat well I don't know I mean I Know his mom was a judge no question about it are still is what are you are but I don't know what the what the ...\nAnd they lost the house so\n... parents yes\nOh I didn't okay not too\nMany years ago and obviously what he was on was the jokes\nAre yeah I I you know losing it said it could be you know do you want to get their own but\nYou know I don't know what to believe because they saw a headline that a doctor for it also works or consult or make money from some company that makes an abortion drugs so I you know I don't know if that even matters or if you've been true you know I have no\nRights ... says one thing after another go to the ... well you're right in fact it OK guys other Greg want\nYou to I just want it all the stump yeah let's get this done correctly because like today you have a little longer though I mean\nYou have the thing that came out today the or\nWhat they call on the U.S em a a U.S MCA yeah yeah United States Mexico Canada\nAgreement the new agreement and everybody's all happy and play nice in the sand box in the dairy farmers in the money's going to come back and it's more even down\nAnd then and I'm looking at them like that's all great if they win the [laughter] if they win the midterms in the midterms all men but not because it'll never get through\n... that's what sucks it's just like everybody was real funny\nThey called us MCI him and maybe you know Trump but history will come up with a number of the thing if you look at the the first thing that comes up as us motorcycle coaching association and the second thing is us minority contractors oh yeah and the third thing of the news headlines about what is the U.S MCA Trump's new trade deals and here's kind of the ...\nI hate that we live in in the play in a time where\nThe east side like this could be the greatest trade deal ever between the two between the three
