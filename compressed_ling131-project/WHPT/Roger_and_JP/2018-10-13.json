{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WHPT", "content": "And that's another good question and once again I firmly believe that uh every woman should have access to and they do in state of Florida they do have access to health care screening including a mammogram including those that don't have any health insurance coverage\nSo even though that might be a perceived barrier it's not a real barrier if you have an issue than you're concerned about your breast then if you have no insurance if you don't have health care provider than you can reach out to many local organizations I mean we have people that will come and see us it started off going to the health department\nUm there's also um so you can reach that you look at health department but then also you can reach out to\nCommunity um health clinics that are very well established throughout the state of Florida and they will see anybody they receive a lot of government grants and funding to make sure patients get the care they need and these patients if there's an issue going on you'll be seen by health care provider if you need a mammogram and you will get your mammogram\nAnd that's a privilege and it is that just in Florida or is that in other states as well\nWell ... if it's a national it's a national effort the community health clinics there throughout the entire country obviously it depends\nA geographically or whether or not they're they're in a lesser a populated area you may not have as readily access to that that's why I mentioned health departments because all communities do have health problems and they could even point you in the right direction if they can help you out [noise]\nSo uh it just depends on where you live geographically where in Florida where such a pop dense populated state that uh we do have love community health clinics\nSo you would advise just search community health clinics in Tampa Bay area or wherever you are living geography wise and then just call them and see if they'll see that day or\nCorrect that's one option and if you don't have any of those clinics next to you than you can always start up a gun to your health department there are places you can go for help\nI Love it out we actually have a couple callers who have some more questions they have ... has a question about breast cancer\nA Frankie\nHello ...\nYes man you're on the show you're talking to Dr\nCase I was talking to the screener thought that I just wanted to say I was listening to you and I'm not going to disagree with you but at the same time yes I had just got a treated for breast cancer had surgery on it but I had to get insurance they didn't have insurance at the time and not even\nDiagnostic centers would take me because they didn't have anywhere to set an x-ray\nSo I had to go and get insurance that was only out of insurance for a couple of months to get divorced\nBut nobody would take me without having ... ... to a doctor and then to have the biopsy did not take my insurance so that was nine hundred dollars off of that so you're telling me that there are people out there that actually help you with the stuff I was very confused\nYeah let me clarify that a little bit so correct you just can't go to any type of radiology facility to get the mammograms done you have to be referred by provider and that can be done at the local health department that can be done through the community um health clinics\n'em and they are the ones that usually helps ... get this process rolling because there are grants and organizations\nDefinitely in Florida and I'm sure there are in other states but help pay for these services for women that needed various how\nWell why would that I'm going to keep listening to the show because I haven't found any and luckily I had money in the bank cause I'm about twenty to thirty thousand dollars into it right now yeah I had in the hospital eight thousand dollars just to go in I mean it's just crazy\nI I agree with you a hundred percent I don't know your unique situation I'm sure that you had to do that I'm thinking\nI'm cancer free now they they they took everything out congratulate I'm cancer free\nSo that's why I don't understand why I'm Still paying for stuff they want to put me out of medical drug for five years have you ever heard of that yes I Am um but yeah I've never heard of it before but I guess I got a couple of questions after they give a listen to\nContinue your journey Frankie we appreciate your calling unfortunately that is all the time that we have today Dr Diaz one of the ANC you for your time is has been extremely insightful um I Hope everybody else out there got as much out of it as I did\nAnd I want to thank our sponsors voted cancer specialist where I Hope it's powered by science does it F.
