what this guy did which was so smart is I Would not want to you fill the guy in\nAh the kid and there was another story of a woman who tried to what you want to do is form in El al see right okay signed the ticket in the name of the yellow sea and I think what this woman did that was a mistake was she signed the ticket personally so if you win\nAnd don't quote me on this or do some research 'cause I'm not giving our tax base or anything like that I didn't you know I'm not a CPA and I did not stay at a holiday and express last night but\nIs is that you form they'll see and then you sign the ticket in in what she did was she signed the name personally right she had no see but she had science you already signed the ticket so then she had to come out even if you didn't want to it's part of the you know agreement I guess you read the\nThe ... that's what I thought like you had to come forward I Try to buy print I think the fine print settings that whoever scientist ticket because they want to put you know they want they want to use the capital\nRight and you know so but what what the reasoning that there's this quote unquote lotto curves I think it's because people don't have\nA

give them more than ... idea yet for doing nothing or doing nothing except for typing in the computer that he didn't have any number he didn't pick okay\nI think you take care I think you know at some point now and again tax you consult your tax guy yeah and you come up with some of my way of getting him the money but you know I think it's at least for the million bucks okay\nI mean he you know he he him in and letting he was like OK ... take me my numbers and they were the when I Would give them you know ten million if he picked the winning numbers\nRight right but but there could be something

white thirty one to start a that was Jay's football number at USF America that's what we'll be the key and\nWe're very just thinking about thirty one yeah all high and now that he's coaching fide football game by now already one already one okay there you go now that he's not here because correlation he just sent us a tax them calling you out dude\nThat he would it would always be here for us was in the tax write he says I'm old\nSaying what capacity so technically if you call them he might answer and always be\nOkay but except for when he has to go coaches is like being a little ... year they're always there for us or you're not but we were happy that Blake here in in is a sad yeah\nUm what are you going on yeah so uh Irish thirty one a in a group of our pillar partners uh came up with cheers to public service and for us it was a a way to honor those in our community that have an undeniable impact and argue with 'em and speaking of youth and the flag football game you hope that\nUh people that are going their flight football games right now uh can log in and sign up but it's all ideas or are given twenty thousand dollars away oh twenty youth coaches speaking about hitting a lot of talk about the lottery or anything we started this program in January a it'd be gay twenty thousand dollars a way to teachers or it's\nWhich I had nominated a girlfriend of mine a ... it's just an amazing thing and it's life change I mean for them as they pay for a lot of the equipment or the supplies or whatever it is so this makes an amazing to a thousand dollars you're going to go here you\nGo I Want them to use the outside in the classroom or outside of the field or the whatever they want them to go on vacation go on a shopping spree just do something for yourself because\nObviously they spent all their time worrying about other people right uh so this is our way of thinking them for what they do a and trying to find again we think we found\nOut of the three hundred and fifty nominations have you got for teachers or earlier this year we found that twenty most deserving a\nAnd we had this check presentations and and now we're doing the same thing for youth coaches I'm Sorry for uh how many teachers are ah nominate we had over three hundred and thirty three fifty nominated for the teachers are back in April\nA right now we're accepting nominations for the youth coaches are we started\nAbout the middle of August or ever accept the nomination sued November fourteenth and again that's we're accepting them at Irish thirty one dot com slash she years or so here's the public service and again we're looking for anybody and everybody\nA and actually pass go in Hillsborough County which are locations are fires thirty one\nOr but again if if you have someone that coaches your son or daughter that you feel deserves a thousand dollars to do whatever they want with ... ... it's a two minute process and and we'll announce the winters\nAre really was a super easy just to write a little vial about them why they should be a nominated what they get back to their to their kids to the community or whatever the case may be and why they're so deserving um\nI I Love the acronym you guys came up with writer Irish ... tell tell\nPeople what that is yeah so we wanted to again find our in our community or the Irish and those that have it on ... ... undeniable impact on our youth and influential reliable and passion selfless and humble a so when you think of\nAgain teachers and coaches that's the acronym ... pretty much describes the best ones and again it's not about\nInside or outside the classroom or the gym it's probably the impact that they have on the lives of the children for years and yet again I was actually talking to a couple of friends about this and and they immediately think of the coach that they had when they were ... years old and talk about the impact of the impact of hat and\nAnd so for us it's it's our way to honor that group and in our counties and\nIt's like you said Joe Joe it's very easy to sign up and we're just looking for the best of the buttons and we want to honor those that hopefully they continue to do what they do\nAnd again obviously there are there all selfless than they all spend money on gas and and the weekends and they're\nNow yeah and don't get anything in return so we're just trying to do our small part that's great that's great public and uh we're going to talk more about that and you're going to stick around for the whole show absolutely and new chime in and help us out I'm I'm
