Monday right around twelve Fifteen Jesse of of course I'm sure everybody to see the headlines about Kanye West being in the White House yesterday yeah\nThat that was a definitely a different type of headline but I kind of\nThe White House as busy as today because before ... ... before ... right well there was one press conference that was going on about I think the hurricane and then around the same time before ... and um [noise]\nUh what Jim ... Jim Brown kid rock and John Rich from begging rich we're there to watch the president signed some new music law saying that they were around but they didn't get invited to the launch a con you won\nThe ... separate from a very busy day the White House yesterday\nI Know a kind of getting a little over a lot hammered on Twitter into the ... and it was a while you're meeting crazy things he said\nUh you should get back on his meds whatever who kind yeah yeah um no actually ... is actually a book on you but I watch like a seven minute run and you did there and there were a couple of things that you know if it especially ripple out of context are crazy\nAre crazy but some of the stuff he said he was like it was I felt it was really heartfelt and he was expressing it in different ways but I don't jump around his point you're okay and you and you know he was ah I don't know I mean I just felt like why are we just he's a smarter guys and I thought\nThey interviewed J uh Jim Brown afterwards and he was\nVery happy about the way the lunch went and he was very complimentary at the president and how well they were treated while they were there and everything else and you know going in for like prison reform reforming definitely a big thing which a branch of violence going on in Chicago and stuff like that I Do too yeah\nYou're calling you win a gold member compassionate going in about prison reform backwards you've got to a person really was a lady released I Believe yeah I Know a so called ... and for the same thing with John Brown and here's here's a little bit of a\n... really what seven minutes of Trump's out there and nodded his head and listened and holding and he wasn't making fun of the guys that I mean they seemed like bugs sitting there across from the president's desk here to\nMan you need another thing I can get you might have all the black\nIt was a\nAnd they laugh Superman made a\nFamous superhero and you know for for me like I said you\nAn Arab guy now who\nKnows what's going on at least want to say it's all a call and you\nKnow he likes he likes businessmen and bonds and\nKills a care about party he goes well people were getting things done he he was talking about how he went to a ... and then he did his usually thing at a Davis they're Eighteen billion dollar company losing like two billion a year or something and now it's only a few years later and now there are thirty eight billion dollar company making money or the other guy the shore Adidas\nWas losing two billion a year\nI Know I don't know if those numbers are right yeah I don't think so maybe this is why haven't Trump get along\nBut does that easy line I Know is big time\nRight and he had had other examples where he went to visit different people in different places I mean he seems like he's go go go\nBut then I saw an article about his family saying a year he goes he's renting is not on his meds I don't even know if this is true\nBut apparently at home they're wishing he was on his meds because he ... he starts going they say and he starts say like crazy things which is what they thought he said in the meeting that's according to the family in in general quotes not a family source not came crashing and said All right you know gender set you know nothing like that\nSo he he had his time and then he also wanted to show the press the picture of this amazing like hydrogen plane or something the president should be flying in\nAnd so yeah the ... own all the high plane right to do the work of apple on it and he tried to get his phone so he puts it as password to show that picture everybody and his password is zero zero zero zero zero zero [laughter] and of course it's like ... everybody couches and the Internet went nuts\nAbout that it's like they had seen lazy ... baseball's yes exactly [laughter] just in combination with my luggage [laughter]\nSo he had that going against them as well but it seemed like he he ... he was like I Love this man and as you get in\nThere are slated from our standpoint this was just set up to be a lunch of two people that I like and I guess they like me and we're going to have lunch with her to talk [laughter]\nYou know I Love it I don't want to say I don't want to forget that spot [laughter]\nLove this guy here let me get this [laughter]\nYeah [laughter]\nI saw the heart I didn't want to put you in that position [laughter]\nFrom the heart special guy had an out\n[laughter] and others have obviously there's other words [laughter] I was very touching moment I'm like I Need to invent how we in in twenty teens and we can invent a way to have cameras be silent\nProfessional ... or ... ... because it completely brutally soundbites [laughter] [noise] ... put it on the list of things bread hate noisy cameras yeah\nI mean\nThat's funny [laughter] it's a good point though you can hardly hear God yet I can turn off the sound I Know it's the actual little it's a it's a physical shutter yeah on the camera but by writing take pictures with\nOur cell phone and not have a kind da ... taking a beating you money for his a Trump support\nYeah yeah it definitely does buddy you know he's ... he's I'll tell you what do you stand by it\nHasn't faded since he first supported Trump has been a while but he's mentioned to like somebody who supports ideas but I don't think he really cares I don't think he cares at all what political party anybody's ... of everybody wants to get people to get things done right ways with this guy and so I think that's how he looks at it\nAs I understand trying if you you know if I'm In fact take a step back on the same way I just want somebody who's going to get stuff done ... like I said some of my ... right ... lean to the left on a lot of the social issues but not all of them you're\nNot even for all of them penalty for what was it yesterday for the woman I bought the squirrel All right right right yeah it's a little to the right I think that's on that I sort of right of Saudi Arabia you know where that is that's just right [laughter] it's not a little right it's just writing a squirrel wanna blame it on ... million

no ... for anybody at this point that's the way it goes right there was no warning for a doctor policy for ... for ... no one in four you couldn't power point out so many examples no warning for
