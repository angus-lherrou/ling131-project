into a seated position the ... and everything kind of catch do you have to trust yourself to sit down with a hundred and Seventy feet of nothing behind you so it's a little you know it's\nA little crazy when you would if you if you can't take yourself out of it and but I did and because we did the little training session so I knew what it felt like I said I sat there and I'm ready and okay he's like an okay\nNo push off and go and so I started going down now the switch picture like the number six turn it\nUh uh the right with pictures number sex and the top part of the Sixers your lover and you have to move that down with your left hand\nAs little as you want as much as you want if you go to fast that can lock up and you have to reset it's a little bit of a process and especially when you're in that situation so I'm doing that I'm kind of feeding the road with my right hand pushing that up into a ...\n[laughter] [laughter] so [laughter] [laughter] so\nI'm doing it and going down\nWe're okay we're going a little by little were good and like like a ... a couple of minutes and I could feel myself like almost panic a packing a little bit like I got my [noise] really [noise]\nLike okay I got a and you're only hit you already halfway down on behalf wait I when I was just a minute or so and okay and\nMy view that as long as you thought it would be done well I Know I I I'm\nI'm Still toward the top portion of it and I'm like okay and and the winds picking up a little bit okay All right we're good All right because it's the control is not as easy as not as easy as probably should be and I guess they make it that way so you don't go sliding all the way down for us far put a great picture of you are from friday by\nIt said that when he was there apparently is that\nThere are a check it out I think there is I don't know you were wearing tights but that's cool oh cool [laughter] so um so I'm going\nDown and and then like midway through the wind picks up for a second and in that video uh I I I got spun around a little bit\nI saw that and say yeah and then but then you got back into that I got ... on on John back in the army range oppose yeah I got to go down I pushed off\nAnd we start going back then it and then my left arm which I've been using for the ... the switch to release which let me down\nStarts getting like like it's falling asleep almost like you're you're you don't realize how much how ... how many muscles you are using to do this you're using every muscle possible and so now my left arm is is falling asleep and then it falls asleep and I'm like OK\nI allow my thirty feet down and got like thirty the last ... and I started going with the right hand on the switch me I'm not supposed to but that's what I was doing because that's all I had at that moment and then my right arm falls asleep so now I'm thirty feet in the air I Can't move my arms\nOut in front of me and if they fall asleep you can still moving North African grip I've never had my own fall asleep or I couldn't move it I just can't I could have barely move and you need to grip too yeah that will that you know [laughter] I\nCouldn't get any ... like a break you know sometimes it might fall asleep and then it seemed like a brick ... felt like I was\nWe had the ventilating just a little bit at the top because what will happen is if you anybody who's ever suffered from a panic attack if view hyperventilating\nThe hype of ventilation is we can call can trigger those same feelings of of a panic attack so we're all of a sudden you've got to put his lack of oxygen and you get that you'll get that tingling feeling in your extremities\nOr maybe that that was part of it like I said I was a twelve hour I'm not making excuses wanted to finish this finishes how'd you get them while they cut you they they said in the training if you are and help make the letter T with your arms can't move now [laughter]\nAnd make the letter T and just kinda hold that they're that way they'll know that you're in trouble and you have some sort of assistance and I couldn't even I couldn't even do that a saw luckily I was close enough to the ground so I'd rather hanging back and like\nScreaming [laughter] are you\nSerious video I Want to say well it might be in the ... [laughter] [laughter] really get it\nSo you won't see me doing it by then it's a it's the the\nThe audio will be there I saw how do they wrestle and I don't know how they did it but I guess there's a guy to bottom is the guy the top so they kind of got me down in the last twenty five thirty feet ... probably work in the rose from the top ...\nAnd you know how they got me down right wow\nSo I'm feeling of not being able to wow why's my arms when I absolutely one hundred percent needed to so I was a little scary so I don't know if it was an I asked the guys that doesn't make I make is that normal as anyone done it before you\nKnow I don't think so I'm just like well\nWhat what do you do for a living in my work and work in radio\nRight that makes sense and it's just a matter of our strength I guess and now you're not going to get on the arm strength during that I'm like okay like I Know not in shape [laughter] All right\nWell let me ask you a question that has it put a thought process and did that maybe it's time to start doing a little exercising\nWell I mean I you know what you're eating but I I mean as far as lifting weights I haven't uh haven't done that but definitely I guess I Need to do some saying as far as that or maybe even a push up here or there may be to maybe ten I don't know a little thing helps\nYou're not going to be with you again how when you know but I mean\nIn telling you something your body is your body sends you messages and if you don't listen to it it can cause issues\nRight so I mean obviously this was an extreme events right I was walking down the street and and uh all of a sudden couldn't feel my arms you know we're we're going down the side of the building so\nBut what you want to be able to do it of course I did I was pissed it's almost like it's like she has to do it again I don't think so because the ice age lighting I say this is like one of those things where\nIt wasn't don't you did the hard part the hard part is getting over the ledge\nOnce you get over the ledge everything you know let me like you can't control you know you you try to control your breathing when I listen if there was a way for me to beat you up about this and make fun of your expense I Would exploited in a heartbeat but at least you you did the hard part you when you did the gig he went over the ledge you know you you did all that stuff you got to within thirty feet\nOr did you can't blame yourself for like hyperventilating getting all nervous of getting tired 'cause you're not in shape\nRight you know you did Raj ... married him and he found him he'll never do it he come up with a million cars they'll just come up with a ... because he doesn't want to\nYou and they do intend cleaning special cat who gets out of everything you know what I mean he has an ex you have done it three times out of the reason why she likes wrong I really feel like Roger needs to do adjust to complete the show situation you know tell them\nYou know when when we have this conversation tomorrow it should honestly stem from you okay\nI Know probably gross he'll look at us\nAnd he he just doesn't care if he doesn't care if he\nDoesn't care if you guys get him a hard time you mean\nHere's the thing the the radio station screw this up as bad as they possibly could allow station because\nWe first of all we should have known about it more than three days before he was going over and we should raise some money there should have been a crew down there if if you want the DJ's and the people on the air to take time out of their day to go do this well then they should support that\nRight and be there and documented and photograph it and put it up on the website because they're always looking for content for the ride and content for social media and all this other stuff but yet it's important enough for you to take the time out of your day and away from your family right it wasn't a born and all of a radio station to get behind it\nSo I can see an Raj will definitely use that as I Am I going to go to if I'm gonna take time away and and nobody gets behind it nobody supports it but he'll um\nI don't you just isn't into it you know I think he's definitely got a fear of heights that he um please\nOff as not as bad as it really you know my that's my feeling\nWell you gotta call nine and then you know what I mean ... and ... it's it's a safe environment all y'all have done it\nYeah I don't disagree we're just all one producer or old producer wolf he he's the only one who got up to the top of the ... that I Would read it if the experience ever comes into the area or anywhere in you know listening area and you have the opportunity to do it and raise money for charity that you give a rat's ass about or whatever it is it's a very very\nCool experience seems like it it's a very very cool experience it's not do that\nYou didn't get I get like never should have at least ... came with you know for something for\n... to a person with a camera in your arsenal camera Asian style that's all I wanted\nAnd that will come up at a meeting but when we sit together that we have a meeting tomorrow or whatever it is when it will come up to be like how could you ask us to take time when you\nPicture I mean I Would do like him and I don't I just I don't know or I Will I don't know I don't know what the answer is because I Know what if that's what's going to be expected I don't think to do it I just don't think to do it I don't not post often because they don't want to I don't not posed often because it just doesn't cross my mind\nAnd she and that is so bizarre to me because I'll see something in the first thing I think that needs to be like I I Want you to over by Michael ... office the other day and there was a sign on the wall and I first thought was I got to take a picture of that in Palestine like that's my initial thought so I stopped right when I'm only ... you know\nAnd I'm sitting there and I was at its something from my kids' school on friday and that'll leave ... they do like a circus kind of thing that my son was like she was juggling doing Chinese Yo Yo's whatever it is and everybody there were sitting there in their phones and I'm just like you're not in it\nYou're not you know what I'm saying you're not paying attention you're not in it and like whenever a lotta times like especially a concert and I'll take a little bit of video whatever was like I tried when I went to go see made and I try to preserve because I had you in my head saying okay you got to do what you got to do it you gotta do it and then I but I did most of it in the first five minutes of the show\nAnd then I put it down and then the Facebook Live stuff that I did I did between bans\nI think you're right like it's different for contracts like I'm Talking about everyday stuff like that people want to see for Roger in J. P. Instagram like your next morning show what you do in the morning for your ... whatever what you're doing on the brakes and stuff like that and what's happening behind the scenes or whatever but\nIn a concert I'm One hundred percent with you um you know get some action and I mean that's cool whatever but then you're going to get into like you got it and you're there for a reason you know get a little bit for just so you can have memories and look at it later but\nLike I was at the U.S Afghan on Saturday and I was I was not chatting\nA lot of it and that was like I was done snap chatting\nOn that I was honestly I was gonna say something to do about that because I saw all the tweets and all that stuff and what do you watch the game\nI Know I Know I Know and I did and we and that's that's when I was like okay that's enough and and oh I Wish that I saw that she was a lot of a lot of and her daughter is flipping fantastic it was a good time it was a really good time and that was her daughter's first support life a ball game ever and\nShe started out a little like ... you know not nervous or anything but it's kind of like sitting there and then she was all up with the horns and seeing in the U.S that's you know solid and he was really cool at the end so yeah it was a good time\nUh I just want to I don't I don't think to do it doesn't even cross my mind I have to really really focus on it and remember okay I have to do that like I was I did this last show was it last week of the week before whatever was\nAnd I put that stuff out on my way home I think\nBecause remember because you were having a good like to me I\nLike watching the show a minute I'm trying to like you know I I Try to stay\nIn the moment\nAs best I can because I used to be really really bad at it and my mind\nWould always just be somewhere down the line especially when I was going through the dark stuff like my mind would just never beat on what was happening\nRight now trying to share that yeah right so now but now I'm trying more and more to just stay president and and staying president\nDoes not involve me thinking about taking a picture and putting it on Instagram some other people can have my moments you know what I was like I don't I don't I don't mean to sound horrible like I didn't mean that if it came off cricket but do you notice that like\nOil you or a concert I one hundred percent agree for a concert you're there for the experience a little nap in the end but like for everyday life like I was saying like with your ship the show's show gets an Instagram on you know you start looking at things around like when you're there and stuff it cool things that people like\nThat is not so much in in the moment you're missing anything out in life or anything like that it's just sharing what's happening with that people don't see it you know what I mean all your life\nAnd Raj you know Raj makes more of an effort to do it and then I Do I give them a lot of credit for but make no mistake about it too had his opposition to if if he um because we both just were very different but there's like certain things we're lazy\n[noise] when when you went on the show the other day and I was laughing because I was cutting up something for that feature cut or something and I part of the audio you just drink and I share it we don't want to put an effort and we are just lazy we're\nThe lazy and the fact that we do to shows and we prep two shows really really diligently I Would like to think\nUm and once that's done neither one of us wants to think about every other aspect none of it just somebody just\nAnd it happened in that though and that's and that's I think it's good and\nBad language would look at a ... because he's organized not organized at all\nSo we used to doing your show that way for as long as you've been with Roger and it's just been easy but so much has changed from when you try harder now and then now what you do as ... as a man you might send crazy not to prep two shows craze in it but then\nThere is now more to do than just that and I know you know I Know it's a lot but there is definitely part of the show now is social media like it's just the way it is\nMuch smaller you handle the Instagram page\nAnd I'm not that you guys you don't have to be the whole point of it is not done we'll be Brad taking little videos or take\nA look shards of skirts stuff like that and we ended up with Roger in shaping the adult [laughter] well there's day orgy big\n[laughter] done [laughter]\nWhatever it might be your village where somebody's\nOr Tampa Bay you know ... done\nMore than three days live in a two time [laughter]\nAnd now you're not in charge you know\nBut you know it's funny what you just said has been said to us from every single manager that's crossed ...\nI mean it's kind of true\nI Know it's true I Know it's true I just think I'm and I am forty six and my thought process it just isn't there I don't think that way I guess I have to force myself to begin to\nI don't think age has to do with and I just think I think it and I get really helped\nA lot of credit 'cause my ... he puts his kid up kids out there a while and then you know I'm not really willing to do that so much I mean I Do it on ... you know on occasion if something's going on with the kids I'll put it out there um\nIs different I mean if you're not comfortable you're not comfortable on that you know that everybody's different and not as far as they can do but he he does keep up with a lot what does he like a year younger than you are he's your exact age\nAnd you might be a year old with him and\nHis much not it's like nothing to do with age 'cause his first thought is you know he he posed a lot of stuff he does a lot of he's very active on social media yup\nYeah on an end it so that had that his reaction I don't think it's an age thing and as you reminded me yesterday screw off by the way I'm rhyme yeah just fantastic I was all how he was real happy\nI Would like owning happy I'm like what he does that young lady this guy passed me by at the bar was standing there and you got to excuse me young lady was like you just call me young lady I was all happy\nAnd so we did it like a fool because GB comes along and says ...\nHome with a tweet was before you give up after stories that we was\nSo I just got young lady I'm gonna ride batch all week and I am I was ... and\nThen I saw that I come along like All right I'll fix this ah [laughter] that's a good way to you'll be forty eight in three weeks [laughter] he's not\nAnd I said tire effectively flat and so you get job I'm a people liked it yeah ... ... this person and I wish I wish you luck sorry [laughter]\nYou know it never mind I came in I don't get the media doesn't like to hear Mr I'm not on social media I'm I'm just on there to flatten tires though\nNo but I'm sitting home and I'm killing time and I'm floating through it like if I'm okay that's how I usually for media are more amenable you're no I'm more of a warrior when it comes to social media are more of a boy you're\nThe content provider yeah because when I'm ... usually I'm either home sitting around doing nothing or I Am\nOn the bowl or whatever the hell it is if I'm Out at all but if I'm Out and I'm living on them or a matter of my kids' game or I'm Out of the showroom out to dinner or um or whatever it is\nThe phones on out yeah and you just ... ...\nYou have a lot of that going on but don't you do don't you do that for your family and stuff like Palestine answer and pictures of all you know kids to be on there that you know\nSo I Try not to do and I'm again I'm not going to say I've never done it because I have um but I I'm not very comfortable\nWith my kids being on social media I've\nNever seen your cats I've no idea what either of your kids look like\nAnd it's out there you know it's out there you ... you know all of them a couple of weeks ago my son soccer tournament and then this one\nBut I don't do it often and it just for their own safety I think we live ... you know it is funny is the ... temple audience obviously I'm worried about and I'm not that I'm worried\nI just and you're being you know I've said things on the radio that have gotten me death threats\nDay maybe not so well you know you just\nYou're in you're doing a show you're doing what you do you try to entertain people people doing the things the wrong way and the things get out of control so I just very early on decided once the whole social media has been kind of took off I was just like I'm just not really going to put the kids out there I could probably revisited now it's probably not that big a deal\nOne eight eight BSS once you for two three B.

I understand what you're saying and it's not fun conditions but at the same time don't you think she learned did she clean anything from that experience maybe you know she\nYeah she learned that sometimes adults will take advantage of little kids that's not the lesson that we learned a lesson from that I don't it's\nNot the right left not laughing at me it's it's to a you know it sounds like what\nDo you remember the ... my father wouldn't let me deliver newspapers because you only major tips\nOh so you can only do you get in the newspaper didn't pay you when you only got tips\nI listen I deliver money layer which is the same thing it's like it's like it's free you know what I mean nobody pays right you know so I there every single house caught fire and I mean I had to deliver on hills and everything and you know I'm smaller than I Am now and it was a big old thing or whatever and then but then I got a check at the end\nUp but it was like I mean at the time and it was like maybe ten dollars or something which\nYou know I was happy with but really we as a lot of money\nAnd I did it with the ... there were a little while and they paid you but I wanted to get a paper out because the paper route you may you know you could make a lot of money in tips of your household and my father flood I Would not let me do it 'cause he was not going to ... and that was a pay a newspaper that was a newspaper and\nMy father was not going to let it up because he was not going to allow anybody to take advantage of us are not it's\nIt's a job and we're all going to join now new jobs pay you were hoping inning hanging advantage though J.

chunks in there and with the ball a chili that's the only time I'll eat peanut butter I have a variety of forgotten hat I Can't\nEven deal with this trip [laughter] [laughter]\nThat's another sense I've never heard the only time I really want to revisit my chili my legs were ever ever ever heard anybody else on the planet but you know and traveling with your other people the friend that you put in the ... to go to the man does it yeah yeah but they never said the only ...\nI don't have ... or any what's what what else do you do with peanut butter really what else what other sauce\nOh now all it is is a lean protein it's mixed with um it's mixed with beef and you make chili the school they follow you to do\nWhat made him go for about why we that's not within the on it doesn't see that in the article that Roger give you this article no no no windows details I don't know it's\nUm it's a local Nebraska news outlet what it's called ...\nOne on one point one now dot com it's\nDown where you have no more\nMore more money so we're we're going to listen to this\nAnd Roger I mean we've done a wild game party where we've had kangaroo and everything I write it says here says I'm\nA assumed that the junior and senior high school in Nebraska Panhandle worst served chili with kangaroo meat mixed with beef according to release from Potter Dix public schools head coach Kevin fry a said he added the kangaroo me because of his nutritional value as a very lean meat\nHe shared the nutritional information would superintendent Mike Williams after it was revealed the ingredient was added to the schools chili quote if a family wants to eat exotic foods they can do so on their own time not at school superintendent said\nA quote if we were to have food or ingredients that are out of the ordinary they should be listed on the menu so that students and families are well aware\nOf what would be served so the guy but the guy in the last ... he lost his ... he got fired or giving healthy food\nWhile you're serving you're not you didn't serve a lean over to ...\nI get it in Chile it's not like it hopped in he slit his throat how do you know there are you in the kitchen I wasn't there but I'm pretty sure that idea how this went down\nI Want to know what made him choose that it's not you know and he's right instead of beef how can use chicken instead of\nA pork its its kangaroo\nFor this quote on behalf of\nPot addicts school public schools I Apologize for the anxiety and any harm this has caused individual students and also it didn't cause any harm you know what causes on take a look at my son's\nThe calendar there for the school lunches you know what his options were on Thursday my last one I wanted to these days yeah lay\nFrench toast sticks ... bought the French so it's like you know the whole grain bread sure of course is zero protein sugar free Syria zero protein that\nThey gave him French does the French toast sticks and syrup to dip it now is probably diet syrup and ride sugar free okay but honestly how about a little no protein nothing\nAnd then suddenly it's I don't know if I said you're not going to go with that\nIf if you told me that they gave my son Chilean and I can't groom me I Know what to lean meat it's a protein if you got my kids to eat that\nIt's one thing if it's on the last it's one thing if it's on the menu this where did this guy get it from you don't know where he got it and it's not it's not like oh we ran out of chicken and and use pork it's he got kangaroo from somewhere and served at the students [laughter] where did you get it\nFound out his backyard or like I said\nThere were also alive I don't know I didn't think it was like maybe I should have looked at it that way I don't know where I'm\nSays Potter site is taking the situation very seriously school officials do not believe kangaroo meat is unhealthy dangerous it's not uh it does mean USDA standards in order for it to 'em but companies to sell it um but it would not be part of the bill program which is fine because the kids would never buy it and they'd be sitting on a bunch of kangaroo me\nI mean we see stories all the time about getting salmonella from raw chicken something I read every single day but it's cooked he made it in Chile guided but I'm saying is like we get stuff from stuff we can eat every single day we there's always this the spinach recalls and\nAll that kind of some ... so stuff that we don't normally eat didn't you know we don't know where you got the well the cat that we have is great right and we knew we knew was kangaroo\nOkay and it was caught in a way where everybody knew kangaroo was going to be served you think there's ... who got fired for this\nYes really fired\nThis is you're always I don't know disciplinary action no suspension know from talking to not go right to fire I don't know your exact hitting kill a kid well who knows what if it was ...\nIt wasn't but what if it was you know you're in what is now you're playing with different facts the facts are here in fact he served he served kangaroo right he had to get from a vendor\nWhy huh maybe it was cheaper and how do you know you got it from a vendor either way you're putting\nPeople's lives in danger of isn't offering anybody's live and they were not eating kangaroo\nYeah not allergic our own kind of reaction I mean since our bodies aren't used a kangaroo me you know I don't know what happened I\nI ate it ready to write ... what it was and so how do they find out it was kangaroo like who told that towards not here and it's driving me crazy I Wish I had that information\nIt doesn't say unless he got it served it and then went to the he rabid himself out maybe\nIn like ... and probably I mean I Would imagine not fearing for his job and casual handout like we ran out of hamburger I was ...\nIt's a it's good that you learned about him\nSomebody around that meaning\nYou know this is the cook admitted to putting kangaroo meat inside the meal it was contained the just the one meal um it just doesn't\nWhere they were there any reactions physical reactions by the catch anybody they none none well I mean no harm no foul I don't think he should lose his job and Sandy but on by\nBut why though who's to say not taking risk rather things\nHe should be he shouldn't be reprimanded Avi any should be maybe on looked at further exactly like to see what else is kind of cutting corners on or whatever but I mean this guy's got bills to pay and stuffy I don't know if you lean needs to lose his job over it\nTom on line to go to Tom\nYeah to a particular they didn't say it like at a meeting all the fair share of the war they were and yet [laughter]\nOh [laughter]\n\nI like that [laughter] the kangaroo cold Brett said [laughter] take calls ... [laughter]\n\nJames on line or ... or ...\nYeah this actually happened last week guys and actually some of the kids get sick it kinda like ... and independents asked what caused that they had was in the village from school and then when they hired that's when it all came out\nOkay but Chile has been known regular beef Chile or build Chile or medicine Julie has been known to have that exact same effect on people the beans do it's\nTrue right they okay you know\nIt happened it happened to several of the kids that day so that's kind of put the flag what\nBy a lot of them happened to everybody [noise] you know what I'm saying\nIf if two wandered bowls of Chile were so was served right and three people God's got ... runs from Chile the odds are it was just normal chilly\n[noise] and I haven't looked like yeah right so\nDo you get like twenty or thirty of them that\nWay as you give me a favor the article words as twenty or thirty 'cause I think you're making stuff up\nActually hit hit calculus or he drew 'cause they covered it last week both of them are still\n... smallest and for us because I didn't hear anything about that and there's nothing in this article but anything about that react the same banks look older than\nMean I can understand if you listened ... parents know that Chile causes issues tiny issue sometimes but you know it's the beans or whatever people parents know that they're not going to panic over something that ridiculous something must have been completely different in order for them to say something and other parents did to where it wasn't just cats\nGuys are you doing what's up hey well she like uh how small not like a mom of the family but maybe like a door mom dorm mom\nYeah\nIs it Charlotte raise some facts wise or is\nHere in the world\nToday [laughter] [noise] so how how how I'm\nLucky [laughter]\nWhy don't why I don't think I mean that\nEvery once in a while I feel like there's cameras behind me because the only way you're going to possibly know what it is if you saw on my computer screen\n[noise] nope I'm driving home for lunch and her the house or heard that that she was a you know TV actress popular movies nearly TV shows a sitcom in the eighties and just try to maybe guess\nBlew up and my face that's only happened one of a whatever a life in LA questions let's just say the fact that gets\nTo the comedy get down at the app Saturday November seventeenth George Lopez says if the ... and\nEddie Griffin hold on to win [noise]\nLet's say you know one [noise]\n[noise] yeah but the goal is to not have an end to one

their in their car they're in the office that playing along what was\nThat was yelling at the radio I normally in a magazine a dashboard I Want\nTo know what I Can't get through son of a bitch from afar all that stuff that's supposed to happen when somebody gets hurt in the first shot as\nReally get the chance to have that kind of bill [noise]\n... just ruined it for everybody and he sure did\nHold the show sucks just show they weren't tickets so yeah\nThat's all [laughter] everybody they have\nRuined everybody [laughter] and everyone you know it's his fault that this show is the fact that they're adding he had nothing to do with it [laughter] as there at that comedy show they're not laughing they're blaming that guy they heard on the radio on when that guy you know all over and it got to Jeremy Jeremy fault like\n[noise] um did you guys play the uh the the numbers the one the one point six of the well be did you play it before it was one point six\nOutside of the work pool here no I didn't know\nYou did not even that I that I but I'm going to play this one point six thing I just didn't do it because I forgot about\nMy friend did say send me a taxi lives\nUh on Long Island with us and he sent a group text me another Long Island friend and a friend that mutual friend we have in Texas and then mutual friend that we have in Florida and said how about we kinda increase our odds by by multiple tickets in different states\nAnd we're like yeah that's cool let's do it and then nothing nothing was confirmed since I don't know if anybody bought tickets I don't know if we're still doing it I don't know should we still do it I feel like it's like on the surface it seems easy enough\nBut I also feel like if we won something significant there'd be a problem with making sure everybody gets their cut I don't know what's making me feel that but it's not a bad idea it seems like it's a great idea and it seems like it's easy enough where are you just take the picture of the ticket exactly but then made what they can actually buy an extra ticket on the side\nAnd that ticket when when they we didn't buy for [laughter] I don't know it was just so many different scenario here's\nThe deal is a great you all put in say five bucks a piece of writing bucks apiece you take those tickets that you buy you take a picture you send it now if those numbers hit you will know but if I play if I buy myself if I'm part of that five and I buy more tickets on my own\nYou can't hate on me because I bought more tickets on my own I posted the tickets to sound like they have fake so fraud you can see the date you can see everything else right\nBut you can't get pissed off that was at a time Roger I got really mad at Raj he went it was one of the times where he was going to play poker in Vegas\nAnd I didn't really understand how the whole thing work did the first you know it was the first time he was going to play in the world series of poker\nAnd I bought it and I guess I bought and for a few hundred dollars or whatever it was and he got knocked out of the tournament but then went and played side tournaments and one\n[laughter] that's exactly what I'm Talking about I don't want that happening\nAnd one and I was passed because I was like All right well what is our bases like well no that's not what you pay for that I might well why didn't you suck on your own tournament\nThat well in the real you know I'm now years later I've seen him go through it I kinda understand more and more how it works and I get it I bought into that and that he failed that put over there you want to\n[noise] yeah I Believe is that right well and that's what I'm worried about half\nAn hour we were you know I don't know that\nBecause like I was mad and I wasn't the only one\nI wasn't the only one because like I said it was the first time he ever came to us for money for this thing and we backed them we were all excited seeing our farm him\nSee his mistake was telling us that he won money another tournament right Roger who plays things very close to the vest there are a million times with something has gone on in his life and then we'll find out about it weeks a month later and I'm like how did you not talk about that [laughter] well how do we not know about it or how did you not tell me or whatever that\nBut this one he openly came out and took our money for something loss\nBut one somewhere else and then 'cause yeah I just want other tournaments on one side to hundred like\nMaybe he thought we would feel better because we didn't back a complete loser\nI don't know I don't know what the thought process is with that it's one thing is like yeah we didn't win the poll returns by did win money I'm slots it's one thing we want it playing something different but you lose the tournament that everybody is backing an and having to win\nLike how to even know if he won or not ... how we legitimately going to go that way to ... how do you know whether he won\nIt's not like the world series of poker I think was it was a warning where it was broadcast everywhere though where you could find the results that\nWhen we backed him ... yes that was the world okay I was the world series we're worlds that it was a poker yeah so\nWhat would you do now but still it is kinda crappy [laughter] why would why would have told us that say you wanted on crops or even ... did you say last when nothing to say you lost in the last young out by the pool are you going up and down the price of it 'cause he felt guilty hey Terry online too good to\nBe a few of the show man my man you\nShould talk to Mr ... if the guy gets into a box on the first one you believe it was ... story last June ... there's something there is in her that just take I guess you know you lose when he gets ... variety that was funny as hell\nNo [laughter] I ... it may be funny or your spot but it's not funny [laughter]\nI Know fed radio but you know because we don't usually go into debt guy the of low prepared to have some really ride after that's for sure I have a great great day guys ... on line one was a you know what's going on thank you\nHey Ryan how to bring it up but yeah that guy in the envelope and it was chicken meat shouldn't really area change it at first thing in an envelope\nOh well I said not no one was Okay Steve thanks for the ... I Can't [laughter]\nI got you got to be honest we are probably getting to a point\nWhere we're going to be asked to change it to a dead person\nWhy no if you write it and then you know they weren't in\nRight and we read it as a debt but the name of the game is dead guy right\nSo usually deck like if you write about the the the state that we're in\nWhere everything's got to be under a neutral if we're at the punch out right and it's me you Raj Monica Joe Joe Weber and we're going to go somewhere else any one of us who say hey guys let's go cars a year or whatever it is God's girls anyway I'm not changing the gun the uncle\n... no I totally agree and not in a group of people have called guys and I'm not even slightly offended by that the\nShock the ah no I mean it's just a group of people who cares people pay people whatever but you if you guys called today that guy in the envelope and he proceeded with Charlotte re I would've said something like I'm Alone wrong but you know dead woman from the from the get it right\nI Know people just want to try and pick pick it up and I'm not going to live on the big ... not in the day to day [laughter] ... not\nThe day that ain't going to happen today ah hopefully when we do a top gun was around one forty does the gum and and my second ... uh uh uh Roger Jay ... real radio\n[laughter]\n\nOn one of them do far [noise]\n\nOne of those two point five the bone and Bud Light resent the TV stars Halloween hub for all righty up over ... downtown they be under threat is your favorite TV star before\nAre there are a lot of June fifteenth game I don't know maybe a quarter but maybe maybe it was a reason not to do that maybe he what'd you call them\nEither take head [laughter] lives that were allowed to do you have to dump you know he's he's Richard ...

lot of sacrifices in some right and wrong choices now it's the the place that it is so I don't understand why they don't try and fix it from within rather than just ...\nYeah it's easy to come in and what happened here cell phones it's easy to come here it's safer to come here or try to come here than it is the fight for what you believe in will fight for your\nClimbing in we don't really

freedom you can do what you are and you can make something of yourself there's opportunities\nThe streets aren't physically tape and goal so these people called us from Guadalajara bottle of all they can come up here get across their life not really got to be much better how you have to have an education you have to be able to get a job so you have to do with the right way correct\nYou still have Social Security card or you can get a fix\nYeah or you would either way but it is what I say one other thing I Would say is if I was trying to leave America and I went a little pond or whatever I needed to do you think I could just walk into China\nNot without that we know we can we get out it was the substance yeah no it was really talked about it they just don't show that\nYeah he does Trump was trying to do [laughter] so I always try and do I get no but you know and he's right I think we do need to get tougher on the on the laws and the the problem is is the Democrats don't want it to get tougher because\nImmigrants especially the illegal immigrants tend to vote democratic and you know if I was them I probably wouldn't want to change the laws either\nI think down for me anyway as more of a well people who are here\nYou know that whole thing with when what originally when when Tom started saying about you know getting you know ice and getting you know making people\nWhat does

some of us have a nine to five of the phone numbers that Roger ...\nUm we were talking about the whole caravan those coming off of the ... and I noticed um\nThose [laughter] right from over there and then you know El Salvador and all that stuff and\nYou know we all pretty much kind of in agreement about\n... you know immigration is well built this country but um do it legally and everything's cool you come in just expecting to be able to walk in and now we've got problems and a buddy of mine sent me a text message um useless and on Fort Myers area and he said\nHere's a question how do these ... because they're saying that this five thousand people upwards of five thousand people in this caravan that a walking towards the U.S or you know through Mexico now [noise] and um how did these five thousand people get organized to all much up here at the same time\nSo maybe that's the question that needs to be asked\nBut ... that's what it was maybe how do we know and I just hear me out here how do we know that five ten twenty however many people do the gym and they got their craft together and legally had their staff and started to say OK I'm making that had that track\nTo America and I found out and said well if they're going legally maybe I can sneak in with then and then someone else state and the next you know there's a caravan and some of them are like legit so that's what I'm saying go through because\nI'm not saying it amounts to 'em again yes you do if you have to go through everybody of the process everybody but unless\nYou you got the paperwork congratulations welcome to America you're not ... you shouldn't come in but he made a very good question I'm not saying the numbers started out of five thousand\nYeah but it started out with more than five you know and it takes it reminds me a little bit of ... do you remember the whole um\nOh what would they would ... what was that ... that sit down they were they weren't Occupy Wall street mhm\nAnd then we all found out all these kids were getting handed laptops they were getting into the apples and sorrows was the one who financed the whole thing\nAnd then all of a sudden they would they weren't leaving until there was changing I shouldn't have to pay my student loans or maybe you shouldn't went to an Ivy League school to be social worker right and all this craziness was going on and it was one of the parts of New York city and they were protesting the one percent\nRight now we're not leaving leaving and then went to a game [laughter] and make the government that was never to be heard from again um we spent says but it turned out it was all being financed by the Soros guy and\nI find it very hard to believe that someone is not pulling the strings on this whole thing I find it very hard to believe I don't know I don't know why\nYou know I also find it very interesting that this whole thing happened right before the midterm election year things Joe just happen\nAll willy nilly again now you're now you're not uh they just uh but they don't it doesn't belong in the ... because it's a I got it\nBecause it doesn't it I think you reach I think that the I'm not saying it's impossible of course anything's possible but I think\nThat I don't know that that's happening if that is that the case but I don't buy it then\nWhat are Republicans or Democrats or whomever so scared of that they have to create a caravan ... Democrats think it's going to push push him over the edge to win a to get some sort of power that's what you think it is that's going to happen\nUh I think it could be part of it could be a game plan I don't know if it will work ...\nI like I said before I think let's just say that it was the Democrats and some guy like Soros financing this whole thing right and\nThe Democrats come and say look he's a leader he doesn't want them the immigration blah blah blah blah blah he wants to keep people out here that whole thing and it will rally the blue\nRight but I also think you could you know if Trump is from the can rally the ... I think\nHe's right needed he rallied at this point it hasn't been rallying around this entire time while he and his numbers are allegedly according to USA Today this morning\nUm I listen I don't know why it would happen I I I I think I have an idea why do I do I know whether or not it'll work I don't know for work I Know when they tried this with Occupy Wall street it backfired to blow up\nGot cold at my old hippies went away\nIt was discussing we spent suppose special that he came back with stories people doing heroin right in front of them are happening in the family may people having sex when like that but there were thousands of people who never left they just got intense and just stood there no job no nothing in the shanty town would literally the departures called Zuccotti Park\nAnd it literally turned into a shanty town\nRidiculous and then I got called them they all left that was the best part when\nI leave there was one woman on the news\nThat demanded that she shouldn't have to pay her student loans and the guy was like well what did you go to school she goes to Colombia eagles okay you're educated what did you what\nDid you go to school would you go to school for social work and I'm like\nRich you went to two hundred and fifty thousand dollar school to be a social worker to make thirty four thousand dollars you deserve everything you've got you can't you ditch [laughter] everything you can do that stupid\nThat's simple math and I suck at math but I Know if I'm going to a two hundred and if a school it's fifty thousand dollars a year right\nAnd what was your question and when it hits you in London nothing to do with\nWhat he shouldn't have to pay off student loans because schools should be free education can be free you could've went somewhere for a lot less money but you wanted to go to an Ivy League school should she should and then the parents are saying I'm going to pay\nFor an Ivy League education how are you going to be a social worker for such a community college but I\nCan't tell people that I Can't but I really just because they want to be a social worker that's a little\nWhile I can tell you it's a bad investment\nI listen I understand but I feel like those are two separate issues like I I think you should like college being free\nYeah but you heard it on the news demanding that your student loans be taking care of because you're owed that\nEnergy rich let's let's\nLet's let's not do people ... ... people bananas\nPeople bananas it's that whole I'm entitled thing that's going on it I mean you're right we are talking about I've gotten off off topic of the cap and think that I'm just like it just for whatever reason that trick popped in my head and I remember sitting around the studio looking at each other like what the hell\n[laughter] we've got local a hunter line for the other\nEight eight yeah ...
