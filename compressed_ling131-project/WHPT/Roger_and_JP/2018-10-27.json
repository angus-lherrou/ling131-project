I'm not one to tell you you can't feel\nA hundred right and I'm not saying that people shouldn't feel away but my thing is I Want there to be an understanding that there is a difference there is a difference between somebody dressing up as Diana Ross and this is what I think Megan Kelly and whoever has failed to articulate it it's amazing she got to where she is but\nThat there's a difference between black face and being hateful and disrespectful and making fun of a culture and a and a time in history that we should not be proud of as as white people and dressing up as a character to represent that\nBut and that's what I don't think people understand that's\nThe ... and again that is I think the issue and the one of the main problems as a society is that we did we can't separate uh\nThe exactly that thing right that was that you were just taught me what black that that to me I'd never really made a distinction when you said when when they said about black face I was just thinking that I mean I'm almost celebrating a character like I wouldn't go as Black Panther\nAnd be white or I Would just not be able to goes Black Panther because it wouldn't make sense and that's the sad thing about it is you can't\nI couldn't even celebrate\nThe ... I couldn't celebrate Black Panther because it would be seen as an insult instead of a celebration\nI think it's important that people just going to do a little research about black face involve the here and and history behind it speaks to where we are it's just I mean where we were in society and to bring that up and to to bring it back in the conversation not understanding\nWhat to say that so many things than I think that that's so many people hearing one thing and assuming it transcends across the board for everything related to that particular topic instead of knowing that there's variations of things and explanations you know what I mean ...\nAnd for NBC to like I I almost think that they wanted her to step in a oh here's the thing because you said right if you're found do sir right or a of that show and you know you're going to talk about it and you know you have ... main Kelly like Megan what are you going to talk\nAbout like right this is a black face this is the history of it in case you didn't know right I'd like to pardon me one was like a plane that yet nobody articulated it might be different do you ever like Megan\nKelly that that ... whoever the executive that thought she would be a good fit for NBC\nYou know it is probably work and it should be working McDonalds right now but you know that the almost wanted her to walk him so they had ... ... and ... and I are just going to get rid of or they're gonna have to write her a very big jak highest paid I think there was sixty\nNine million on her contract less crazy though I think she's she asked for fifty yeah and and I I Know why people are interested in this conversation says I don't know\nThat yeah yeah well it's much had that and then like we said we have Justin day we're going to talk a amendments you know we want everybody to get out to the polls and be well educated I Know things are very confusing with the wording on the eighth amendment so he's going to help\nA dumb down for us and explain to us the meaning behind them so if you want to participate in any conversation eight hundred seven seven one went up to five or seven to seven five seven nine to five this isn't making such so I wanted to find the bumpy ride that\n[noise] [noise]\nIt's life out\nSo amendment one um this is an amendment that would increase the amount of your homes or your home of value exemption so\nIf you were a Florida Florida and and you live and you have your primary residence you'd probably have the homestead on your primary residence and if you don't you need if you don't you need when you definitely need to go in and get your homes that are currently\nUh the the homestead as at fifty the or the the exemption is fifty thousand dollars a that was increased a couple of years ago from a from twenty five to fifty\nAnd a ... one would increase that homestead exemption to Seventy five thousand dollars\nSo in other words if your house is worth a hundred thousand dollars you use the only path to pay tax on Seventy five thousand and now it's the flip flop to Seventy five percent of your home value don't have to pay tax on which sounds great which sounds I mean\nWe don't we have to pay ... on twenty five per cent of twenty five twenty five\nThousand dollars of his men to pass which sounds gray right way you know cause it saves money side but there are consequences\nThere there are nobody I went and looked to find supporters of this amendment and I could not find any yes on one uh campaigns and the reason is it sounds really nice if you're a homeowner in Florida and yet your primary residence you're going to save a lot of money um however um ... that that money has to come from someplace\nAnd so you the right as you can have you take her out someplace so you're the cities and counties are going to lose a lot of revenue\nUm if this amendment passes and so not certainly not I'm telling you to vote one way or another but um you know the opposition to this is the Florida legal cities the association of counties I Know the city of Tampa the mayor as opposed to this uh the county's opposed to it\nIs it true that the this month the homestead money tax goes to school system\nBut that I mean some of it does the money can be spread around to various route to various sources of decides that the legislature would decide that um but I mean at temple alone if this were to pass a minute one were to pass about six million dollars would be lost\nAnd the budget for the city of Tampa I Believe Hillsborough County was around thirty million dollars I could be wrong there but it was much not much larger\nYeah I think the uh the number I read for us the state of Florida is about seven hundred and fifty million of lost revenue\nAttract right so it's um it's a an amendment on the surface looks really good and certainly if you want to save money you probably should vote for this but I also think that if if the tax revenues being lost it's probably going to come from someplace\nElse so can I ask a question why why why nothing last line of like well who who champions for that suit is has always had written that way where why can't it be written because they were trying to trick people into voting\nActed nobody supports this is enough to tell you that this bill stands on some because basically it just saying the same people money right which which sounds like I said sounds great\nBut at some point I was taught at what cost because Florida ranks and I and I'll be the part of the New York but if some at some point Florida ranks forty fifth I think in school a public school uh will that teacher pay teacher pay 'em\nWho benefits like why is this an eye on the\nSo the you know the real terrain benefit right if you're a if you're a somebody's selling houses are now more and sell more houses because uh event selling point right now you're and\nI ... okay um and and and so that at the you know limit to was also kind of tied into a man that wanted to would um would put the have a permanent cap\nOn the increase at a non homestead house could increase so in other words the second home or a second home so if you had an ... rental property Florida\nBefore two thousand eight or that the increase of that home could increase a twenty percent thirty percent if that's what the tax assessed rub your county decided that your house is worth\nAnd two dozen eight we were seeing these housing prices climb and so they there was a minute one and two thousand eight that limited to or are we at ten percent increase on your a vacation homes or rental properties and Florida\nI'm a ... year or year per year you could only increase up to ten percent\nThat was that his two sons that a January first two thousand Nineteen\nSeventy four sunsets a this was put on the ballot to make this permanent so for for the attorney\nOr a rental property or a um a vacation home would only be able to increase by ten percent who supports us so again this is the Florida realtors association a Florida chamber a support this groups like the league of women voters do not support this and you might\nAsk why a group like the league of women voters doesn't why does the women's vote or not so you know just kind of goes back to the might ask you might it might ask that this goes back and we just talked about which is they believe that having you know tax language and our Constitution's probably not the right way right place to hang up I'm Debbie legislatures should should take care of this and she legislated\nUh and so that is their rationale behind you know why they're\n... and we're going to come back and go through more of a judge or to answer your question why this is on the ballot because here here's the reality is it takes two thirds of both houses I think to the to amend the constitution that's correct and we can agree on anything\nSo it's easier to put it to the people to get an amendment passed than having two thirds of the uh the legislative agree that the sky is\nBlue right Amos the third to change the constitution it only takes a you know a majority simple majority just to change the wall right and we can't even get sometimes is simple majority manage changed the ... they could put this into a law each year oh so this is a lot this would be simple majority not two thirds if if they if the legislature one of the past\nIs that the law it would just instead of a mammoth\nThat and I got ya so Georgia\nGot average guy so many more questions yes we're talking amendments anything while most things politics up in

people who are having across the state right now whether or not I support this or oppose it by um and and you know it really comes down\nUm you know do you believe that you once you've served your time that um that that you should automatically have your your rights like voting a restored or or and that's a valid concern I mean if you're going to repeat a\nYeah so the so the other thing is um what I found most interesting about this when we get to talking about going to be following the money\nThe Koch brothers who are you know it gets a libertarian but really they called cola no the co cocoa there are others are ... ... ... okay uh have had a history of supporting Republican candidates putting a lot of money into campaign but\nThey support this the ... which I thought was shock\nYeah except I feel like for them there's a there's a reason that's my problem with all of this respectfully is when you follow the money it's you can tell can wag the dog all day long and there's got to be some reason when I see that they're involved in like well where's the money\n... for that but the but the interesting thing is an injustice I don't know if this is correct but it ... and correct me if I'm wrong but Republicans pretty much up and down the ticket and across the ... uh as state do not want this and opposed for typically would not be a good thing\nIt look there's there's over a million of voters after that would come on to the polls tomorrow I'm and probably a lot of those voters would be maybe democratic voters so certainly a lot of Republicans are posted this I can tell you\nThe entire ah all the Republicans were running for cabinet are opposed to this right now all of the Democrats were running for cabinet supportive\nBut there are Republicans who do ripe or notice a Senator Jeff Rand is who's right here in St Pete is a supporter of a of a\nChanging the criminal justice system like this um you know again the Koch brothers this was one of those issues where the American civil liberties union um and the Koch brothers are together on this are the ones who are supporting\nI Know we have to go ... quick question about that though just the governor had the same rights as the president's first part and could he ... it let's say ... did he go into office and restore voting rights to everybody the non mode of NATO\nThe cabinet could make you saw a couple of years ago the cabinet did that with Charlie Crist was governor and Alex sequel CFO they both voted to allow uh the automatic restoration of rights and so the candidate can do that when when the new cabinet Kamen Governor Scott AG bonding and others they changed it back to this way\nUm I unfortunately I think we're at a time but there are a lot of callers on the uh on the phone
