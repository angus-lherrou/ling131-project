tell you I don't think the buck Seventy thing to be ashamed of\n[laughter] right I mean\nWell first of all we came up a little short on the opposite side of the board when we put up two points\nAnd then we came up kind of short on the defensive side where Chicago with a forty eight points on six TD pass is from Mitch ... who ah\nLit up Florida State a couple of years ago mhm we knew he was capable of something like this oh yeah but no one was expecting any Chicago's bears team to put a forty eight point I don't even know they can't they hatch cargo yeah we can\nOh I've got you from Chicago too and most from Chicago and being it was [laughter]\nIt was every day when it's convenient and neither one of the name any players from Chicago Bears wall to the refrigerator Perry\n... if I ever made five lines and nobody's talking about eighty five best about\nWell I mean they're okay anybody to play yesterday which would be easy to\nBut in some from eighty five right [laughter] anybody [laughter] yeah yeah Mr Bean the I'm getting that school can you look at me when you\nSay that I have no she noticed you know the quarterback I just said he thought it was sixty that will Matt I Am now everybody knows that got a you know you don't have\nA lot man no you don't know the team is cool man it's too I was I'm not even I wasn't even Google and I'm not even try okay well I'm not even trying to talk about Chicago line what I'm trying to talk about right now\nIs bucks fans I Know you guys are hurting right now because you thought this magic this fits magic was going to last all season and you were hoping that the bucks you know I was gonna say no one love the bus you know in hate we're going to show up\nAnd now not only was it ugliest today now James is coming back after they put him in the game when\nIt was a just a parent that you might as well get the guy who's getting ready to take over the him the reins of the team again you might as well let him get some live action real time experience\nBut here's what's gonna happen now Moe and this is going to be difficult because the bucks friends on line they're not being honest the bugs can win next week there on a by\nI don't know who they play when they come off the bat they could come up is by and when with James Winston mow and let me tell you what they're going to tell you because I Know to books than they are going to say yeah we won but it would match you\nBecause you're not ready for the bus route for ... fits magic and since none of you played football you just I Want I Love how can you be above\nSpan and have lived in the city for years and the first thing you're putting up on your social media this morning is a fucking years [laughter] I mean 'cause there there are probably ... how can you post pictures that you would a bag on your head fans are posted in real time Kevin we don't\nHave fans in this city\nYou know this is one of the team needs your support the most and people are like well what's wrong I don't understand is that the coach in is it the players it's a culture and it takes a while though that culture looks like this\nThat magic where everybody's plan harder 'cause fits magic is even if some excitement in the air the fans you can help create that excitement every Sunday win or lose it's how you show up and you support your team and you let them see that you're still supporting them even though\nThey're not doing so well right now 'cause I'm doing great the first couple of games we breaking records\nBut now James is back we got destroyed by Chicago of all teams right\nNow we've got to figure out what we want to do now you say Chicago ball teams they're playing pretty good though rye Chicago traditionally would not be a team that most people would be a correct crap but now that they have their defense coming together now that they have a hot quarterback it only takes a little bit\nAnd I was just takes a little spark mope right to get it going and what I'm saying is that you need to support Jane was like you supported\nFitzpatrick but I think you are done with James I think you'd rather lose with fitzpatrick than when with James is that right let's go to the poll on that one at S. B. Kevin show for real bucks fans not just you fly by night wacky tell the difference I just don't know what a real bucks fan is\nYou don't give up on the team after one loss you don't give I Would put fitzpatrick back in there again why tools to last Kevin to losses forgot I forgot had come on now yeah we keep the numbers just deal with this Neal allows that allows the forgotten about that because I've spoken to yeah I understand but still is lost actually\n[noise] I mean you know they showed some heart there can I ask ... let me tell you what else happened semi you ever heard the expression you could fool anybody in the short run but the long run you can't fool anybody\nOkay you can it's easy to do three games let me tell you what can happen in three games\nWell let's do it in three games any NFL defensive coordinator who who who is in this league and has the right to be in this league\nCan pick a part of fitzpatrick can watch enough place to go okay yeah\nYou got us on the first game because we didn't know what the hell you is going to do you got us on the second game 'cause we didn't know but by the third game to steal it figured it out and we turned four touchdown and we added the ... with it right and then by the time you get to the fourth game man\nWe know everything you gonna do we know you're cheats we know where you're coming up short we know what you're doing to make this thing happened and we can shut it down and that's what you saw this Patrick still great the officers still good we got beat we also got beat yesterday to\nYou you can't just got the other team beaten I. S. right that happens to it can happen on any given Sunday\nOkay it's only two games they sat right out here all I'm\nSaying is you should not be given up on your team just yet why are you given up on the bucks John you're on the bone\nHi guys what's up they try to record into games well one guide it right for quarterback [noise] [noise] now the only record they're setting as they've given up a hundred and thirty nine points or games\nWell hold on there was a record setting a third game as well\nWhat was that\nI thought I thought fitzpatrick three game record what he accomplished in those three games was a record as well [noise]\nOh yeah 'cause he went over three hundred yards passing that that's what I meant yes in the third game correct okay\nDid you notice how happy people whenever he broke a record I'm like I Would have preferred to victory\n[laughter] well you know they ... they have no defense they have no running game and then\nThey just they just suck I knew that already I didn't know bulletin\nMhm so I don't know that's all I have to say well how did they win the first couple of games they scored more points than the other two\nTiered at it [laughter] oh man was right here and he made no one Alison [laughter] he called for nothing\nThe this is is just I I'm just not maybe\nIt's because I've been a Steeler fan all my life we have some lean years I've never given up on my team when they lose I don't give them I don't give up on myself when I'm Down so I don't I just can't see it but I never give up the Steelers\nReally never had a ... the run a band like the buccaneers have\nWe haven't been like that right but we have failed come up short we've come up short a lot which I guess it's sometimes it's harder to come up short didn't know you don't even have a chance right I mean there were stances there was times were ... bucks a fans just they were just going 'cause it was something to do\nRight you know what I mean they had already purchased picked or somebody gave it to him they needed somebody gave them to think it will needles so many people that come sit in the stands so to the stadium when a\n... [laughter] yeah so much waiting and all that I Know right now there's like a limit yeah when\nWhen the brief side we catches that whip off the skyway the trouble trouble right and you're on the bone what's up", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Billy Madison Show", "city": "Sarasota", "day": "01"}
