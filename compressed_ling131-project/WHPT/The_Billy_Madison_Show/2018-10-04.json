or collect bones\nAs well it it has to come from somewhere to companies trying to do right by they can't do it all I bought\nIt come from the massive profits that Amazon's making well are you going to get with one hand and take what the\nAmazon is currently\nThe number one employer in the country okay okay so they are leading the fault fight to get Fifteen dollars an hour across the board for all workers I just want to point out\nThat if you work forty hours a week or Fifteen dollars an hour that equals thirty one thirty one thousand two hundred dollars a year before taxes [noise]\nA study released last June from the national low income Housing Coalition found that renders in Orlando metro need to make at least sixteen thirty three an hour\nTo afford even a basic studio apartment and not be what is considered rent burden so rent burden is when you spend most of your check on rent rather than food health care transportation daycares savings and except\nRight and so they're saying that they need to make at least six team now\nYou need to make sixteen so sixteen dollars and thirty three cents an hour we will take you from thirty one thousand two hundred dollars a year to thirty three thousand nine hundred and sixty dollars yeah that was anybody\nDoing his own seven and ten dollars an eleven they weren't but\nI'm going to say this this may sound I'm okay [noise]\n[noise] they say that that's not a livable wage Fifteen dollars an hour is not a little boy I don't think so okay I ... but I don't think that um doesn't depend on weight like for a teenager and might be it yeah but that's grown men fighting for those jobs now that's a strip and that's what I'm saying I I think those jobs or for teenagers\nUnfortunately now people have to I mean they're more PHD's that are

this as a stepping stone to get somewhere else right right you'll never the minimum wage is never going to be your answer\nBut what if what if you're one of those cats and say All right outcome in on the ground floor at Fifteen dollars an hour and I work my way up to management that's fine if you're Eighteen but if you bought it fast yeah\nAnd I think it's a lot of older people that that what else are they going to do they're going to say I want more money [noise]\nI don't know it's it's tough I'm not trying to hate on people that want more money but I think if your expectation is to put these companies they're not don't give you anything right I I just about taking some\nYeah my butt but again Amazon could Amazon makes enough money to weigh whether they don't\nDo you know how much the CEO makes a day not enough to do the sudden I'm speaking from Amazon Iran here to make an Amazon to they're not going to just look you up well apparently got extra walking around money\nThat's what they
