millennials that Lewinsky became a verb\nIran Iraq [laughter] you know what I'm saying like I said that's why they were when you when you hear the name Monica Lewinsky what do you think they are\nAh well\nIn my generation or when I was growing up I knew that she was a an intern for the White House and I know she has essentially did some deeds with a with the president\nOh she did the deed yeah do you think you know that what Monica Lewinsky did in the oval office with the president normalize the certain\nBehavior for generation that didn't experience that when it came up on like going from there on now you're living in a world where the president did have some sort of relations with a woman in the oval office\nAnd now that's kind of I'm not saying it's acceptable but it happened so it's not the\nCraziest thing you've ever heard at this point\nI just assumed that it went on coming up and I have no knowledge of it right anything of that but I had always heard stories at JFK was
