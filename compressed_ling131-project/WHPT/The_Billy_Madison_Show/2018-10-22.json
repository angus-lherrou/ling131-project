I found funny I thought our show was funny I thought you herself was hers was there are still in the show was on for years it was hilarious and he yeah it was it was like based off of her and her sister had\nIt was real real funny show okay All right but you have to like her 'cause it's like\nWhen probably why I didn't even know that it exists I Know that the time but just said past\nYeah and that's the only got ... ... or ... I was [laughter] it was ridiculous as Louis decay\nWhipped out of junk in front of Sarah\nSilverman and math and did what he did in front of her but she was totally cool with it most of the time yeah we just said that there are made the pretty solidly reveal Monday and I heard this on the Howard Stern show telling how what about her early days in comedy with Louis she said he has to be good blank and she told him F yeah I Want to see that\nShe down the party or the early ...\nIs it well yeah if you get a chance to do with what you're going to go back and ask again get away in in in in he when he gets out of it he gets up on her own somebody watching him is that that has to be what it is I think he's not getting any said well yeah well I mean it's got to figure out you don't you want somebody to watch\nRight and you consider them friends they consider\nOf those friends but not in a sexual romantic way yeah you do that I don't understand that man well some people are natural\nWarrior but I just want to they want to be able to say you know that's a story to tell yeah Louis whip it out and did that come from her perspective on it is well I wouldn't want anybody telling that story first of all I don't\nThink he cares it's the reason why he's not doing comedy right now you know he cares about bad news or saw me to know you don't want to I I I did you did yeah\nThat was an I don't know when I was going to ever get fed up with being treated the way they've been treated for years in this country not really something that's just ridiculous it was like you know I'm sick and tired of spacing golfing\nTo be able to tell you I I certainly understood understood\nThat people that that that\nActually is like that would have to diminish I didn't foresee what I didn't foresee was the rest of the meat to move\nTo happiness quickly and it was all encompassing as it did I think a lot of us got taken surprised by the by the fact that every\nWoman has been trying to do it's been trying to help them since they were ...\nNo no I was surprised by now surprised when I say I know what you say you're not surprised that surprised by an accusation alone being able to wipe\nOut oh Ellen surprise okay some over correction there and you look at it but as we feed into social media were feeding it to the the court of public opinion however little wrong or not and then

that was like all the time or how about this like when I was uh when I was in college I used to have a friend who's a female friend and we just massage each other but\nI mean what we want\nTo let me read looted and there was one of those are the way we're going to you and you you wouldn't\nGuys used a massage no no no no female no no the other hand in hand [laughter] as he wouldn't besides these others but without how your tone like you're on a stomach ... just like yeah yeah yeah and just kind of like just like you never has it yeah no no no funny bit no for that it has never had funny business never\nEver made I'd never kids we just rub you tell them by the time no it's not because like you want to sometimes like you know like I'm coming over there so we can do that we're saying we do I mean I feel I Belong to drink and she was like hey look you know I just kind of why my massage I'm like yeah you know you could bum most times my button and we just\nThose are now looking into the way I used to look at it [laughter] or you know what if it was going to get out of my life I don't get it\nYou see what I mean you\nIt was good man I mean have you ever got about ... later on by the rub it on my book so you will rub her\nAs and then just go out right now with George her\nWho just got to switch off like everybody imagine that you\n... and you and your ... and it's every ten minutes was button besides what\nMassage buttons highs but when you don't want to get along we just do both cheeks and you just returned and he chose you can ... you\nI mean but you know we're just friends I mean you just gotta keep it that way you'll never know\nAccidentally turnovers lab or in the face na na na na I never can\nTell you may never messed with any of that kind of weird I don't I don't know the head of humor you never had a female friend ever in your life that you just like you you just hung out and you sometimes like\nI had a female friend that I hung out with and may be given a back massager do what I Know what what type thing exactly no no no guys is ridiculous I ... back what side you're not sexual I've\nNever had a yes it is it's it can be you know you catch it in a scanner through the shirt to start or oh that's just being ...\n[laughter]\nI don't pay the price of oil is a\nLot of them [laughter] no I I'm always say there's nothing inherently sexual\nAbout what you're doing it I'm not judging it but I'm just saying no I've never had a female friend that I was not involved with where we did not lead to become involved that I did inherently sexual stuff with\nServices I'm happy people go to jail\nBecause I get to charge you ... booty rather yeah really yeah yeah oh ... oh I think you touched me inappropriately there's no clear signs that that was supposed to happen in your scenario yes what do you say to her though how you want to come over and hang out now it's just usually sometimes after like a loan to drink or whatever she's like you know the gum and my partner\nOkay well it All right let me ask you know it's not the let me ask you something I mean well it was was she put it out\nSigns that you may be and you're drunk and super missed probably I I mean I Would imagine and I'm this is conjecture but I Would imagine she saying you know make a move JR make a move probably never take a pet is a no no she had a hung on every time\nMean
