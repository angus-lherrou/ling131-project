Love the show was not the like\nAnd I always wonder why it didn't work out what the first on this and I thought they did her real breezy when they got rid of her and how they explained\nThe new art do you remember how they did I Do oh I Do and I've heard conflicting ... about why she was even let go but I'm a I'm going to give me that I might give you that way\nBut um do you remember how they did and it was very clever very slick how they do are you talking about on the only when they when they when they first showed the new ... in how no you know you know I say about it I think I remember it was like I'm\nOakville after something oh yeah yeah yeah she was like she was like yeah\nI'm a change some okay there there was this something like that are a uncle Phil walked through the kitchen she was talking to Jeffrey she turned around and he goes oh there's different about you as she goes I changed my hair and then she smiled\nAnd walked out yup that's what that's all they do on man that's called yeah it'd be very thought she was a classically trained actress she was the original originally\nSo I don't know what happened her name is Janet Janet Hubert\nBut she made a a very\nWell the videos of say what she tweeted\nBut she made a very uh kinda weird a series of statements on social media that sparked these new rumors\nAnd the rumors are what she said when she got separated from the fresh prince that Will Smith left her unemployed with a child oh wait\nA minute we yes it was it was well maybe that is what they are safe and you\nDid you did get out of here so see weight so we're saying she was if you do the timeline she has a kid that matches up\nI Need to see the DNA work within the beginning because she fit these cryptic kind of a sweet that people don't really know and when they go are you saying we'll get is the father of your child she hasn't come back to confirm or deny but she started this and now you know Jay to\nThat next episode of after we'll said he failed her she cried for forty five\nDays oh no no I don't know what's going on with me because you can't be that happy or you can't be that happy a squeaky clean that right there on that you write about what we say my mom [laughter]\nI probably all the time I think you know there's lots of happy guy right in our art and art art for having um I'm trying to which was real [laughter] I'm trying to look\nFor a photo of her kids and uh there there's a there is not well you know cause Will Smith\nOr pay Google to get it off of it or whatever so so gee why didn't they say she got let go from the fresh prince they said it wasn't working out she became something she became\nDisgruntled because she was eight based around it will with season actors correct but we'll was in charge will was the star it was his show and she felt like\nSome of the things like the mandatory dance before the show I'm a I'm a train that's oh I'll be it'll be I'm here to do the job I'm not here to dance to do I live right I Know my lines I Know when you write I'm not here for that yeah I'm I'm not a loner yeah\nBut well is trying to we're trying to create an environment you know he's a young kid had a number one show at such right and this is all a positive thing to\nHave in the fall and he's in charge that you're going to get I get it I get it but she left after three seasons she had been but I'm ... Will Smith and it's only three she was there for three oh yeah that seemed longer mhm and and there you go and\nShe has been do she's been going after Will Smith since Ninety three\nThat's about more than money you got to let it go no you can't and I actually got to pay somebody you know the baby rapidly like hey mama [laughter]\nI Need to see the emails I Need to see the email you got to see it and you know you can thank me when we bring down Will Smith are we going to bring that oh I don't know it just felt like the best that we already brought down because I Know because it is that's all I got [laughter]\n... that's not going to cut it right there in a court of law they are that blurry picture us [laughter]\nHave no idea who that is that's horrible with their with their baby yeah do you think it's a possibility\nAt least shore you use it up and people are actors on sets you know do things like that all the time I'm much older was she a firm Will Smith a you\nKnow that ... yeah it doesn't matter man you know he had jak be attracted to that maturity I'm just I'm just curious will will\nThinking it could be anything to ... them flip it like I don't know\nWhere I mean it you know listen you you have to let the facts come out I Would say initially though it seems odd as you say that two women two women two women would both be to draw and he\nGets them both they're saying and they're at his house and there's\nText afterwards that have you know a Modi's and and calm conversation that wants to do at all and walking out straight my question is only two\nWomen had to talk to each other be like are we have to\nCorroborate yeah you have ... or ... what happened to you what happened to me because also there was another guy that was in the apartment from what I understand and he wasn't charged with anything\nAnd he wasn't in a part of it but so there is a witness to something you might have saw how things were when they were coming and going out and ... I think he does have a witness that saw something happening\nI yeah and I think they are they have to corroborate I think it would be hard to for one to say she was sexually assaulted and the other one that go no I was it\nNot to play devil's advocate let's say one of them let's say they weren't sexually assaulted right I find it hard that one of them wouldn't cave in and say\nUh we come which I Can't go through this we didn't do well let's not ruin this guy we didn't do this right into this right so we don't know if they best to use though man sometimes best these when it comes down to falsely accused and some do with race can fall out I understand that if you if you fall out\nYeah yeah but then you know it's just like you know everybody best ... goes down yeah\nOoh wow maybe one maybe one girl\nHad to talk to other girl into it right mhm right and maybe she didn't have as good of a time as the other girl right so the other girl goes uh and I really enjoyed it so I'm just going to say right so the the the ... [laughter] what about you if you go you don't do that I had a good time I Know you wouldn't let me getting on\nThe question is of consent they're not saying he they're not saying he held them against their will and and sexually assaulted them they're saying that at the end of it they realize that they were not so bright enough to say yes to it that's what this was coming down to\nYes that's what

people\nIt has really kind of become this thing really that model [laughter] no no but I've never seen it to this degree with all of the pools and all of the line\nIs this I don't know [noise]\nI don't know why is it just to me this is this that this is sad to house who say these poor people just people are so obsessed were so obsessed with money 'cause there's no other option in this society we when we can't change that ever\nWere obsessed with it we stand in line the chance to win all of this money that you think's going to be the answer to all your problems it's not\nGoing to be one of my way out or you say Ninety nine hundred and Seventy million dollars will be scientific if it'll be the worst thing\nUp until you Scientifically Proven that after Seventy five thousand dollars a year right the um\nThe increases in income after that you don't significantly increase your happiness\nI'm coming from a happy base anyway so I I don't need that significant increase I'll tell you to write whatever problems having nine hundred and Seventy million dollars gives me right I'll gladly trade over the problems I have an idea\nI think he was true I think you say that because you're so upset when I say the country right now we're so obsessed with the money that that seems like if you don't take that money route that that's just ridiculous [noise] but you won't have any more friends now I don't know if that happened last problem I I don't I don't know if that means anything to you know you'll never\nYou can buy for that's what you might not you'll never be able to trust no one will be genuine you will be second guessing everybody and everything you tell different from now on now\nYou may still love that you bought your traveling the world I got private jets\nYeah I mean that's Shane kid looks like he's having a blast yeah well maybe is just what to do you have to surround yourself with the rangers now with the three or four people you can trust and when you got to pay for them to do everything now yes or no no you\nDon't and what you you got nine hundred million dollar they work in an RV [laughter] like what seriously say like like what you would have to do is immediately started hanging out with people and you're going to find out that that crowd to get that money that way\nNot only do they they don't want you they got their whole fortune hey no you can actually understand at that level do I know I Know I sound ridiculous telling you that I Would probably take the money to try to figure it out\n'cause I think are smart enough to not be one of the people are talking about whether or not yeah yeah\nI'd be dead in a year [noise] and you'd be there [noise]\nA positive effect on your phone would kill you [laughter] friday's\nMega million jak bothers me is the record nine hundred and Seventy million it'll probably be more before the draw but what the winner will actually take home depends on picking the annuity or the lump sum payment anybody that took me a new when it come on and of course taxes or the\nBetween whether to take the lump sum or the new the new ideas intense although most winners do opt for the lump sum\nIf anybody when's it let's just listen to me right now I Hope you just walk in with your ticket and say give me money\nYeah yeah well the ... uh at after the twenty four percent federal take the average annuity payment comes up to twenty four\nTwenty four twenty four million a year\nTwenty four million per year for Thirty years and that's a bad deal [laughter] well it's a bad deal if you die\nNo it's not but you're you're you're gonna die anyway [laughter] no money for your family in other words you can't really I I think it's kind of difficult to a lot who gets the winning no it's not it's not like they're if they're not out plus if\nYou get the annuity you know you can go to a ... where I Am the money right now yeah\nFor a while I think you can afford to see you take the lump sum for a hundred and sixteen million dollars so they basically able to take half\nYeah yeah pretty much yeah if you're an idiot you know how they're going to take half of your money that's the government may know you're going to tell them they can you tell them they can they're going to take more no they're not yeah when you in jail they are in the military I hear ya\nI think I should ask was last night so Al Capone how are you going to end up in jail setting you up right now I Am yeah I feel the curse of all if you win the lotto\nYou claim the money as a corporation and you get taxed like a corporation
