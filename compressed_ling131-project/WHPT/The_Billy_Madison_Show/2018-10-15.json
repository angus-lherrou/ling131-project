Pinkett Smith podcast which he does with their mother and a daughter willow and will slip as the gas and he talks about\nThe\nLike he he talks about the worst parts of their marriage and it's really quick and I think what he says he says a lot and it just leaves me a lot of questions about the squeaky clean Will Smith\nHere we go to where it would go\nAnd there was a period\nWhere mommy woke up and\nCry daughter forty five days straight I started keeping a diary\nYou miss some day [laughter]\nEvery morning I think that's the worst I've ever felt in our marriage wow\nI was failing miserably oh\nHow was Will Smith what was he doing\nHis wife wakes up in the morning and cries for forty five days straight she said it's long do you miss some days right and he said I was failing miserably right what was Will Smith failing that\nIt can be many things right like what he ... they I mean I can have an ... ... in in in my head since Will Smith as well as Mitt though I Would say he was probably either not paying attention or ... or probably cheating on her step and now are probably not coming home\nI oh Jay ... is the kind of woman that was sit back and kind of not say nothing about anything that\nWas on a diet sometimes when a woman sped up that's all they could do that that's probably the ... that's ... that's\nProbably all she had but jaded or raw raw type but she yeah she only been like food [laughter] he doesn't really you've never heard an interview about jaded or she said I don't like food I don't get pleasure out of it oh yeah I Would really find listening\nOn ... on maintenance\nNo he's not I mean she said that when she grew up her mom couldn't cook right so she said her mom stressed that food was for energy not pleasure so jaded says the reason why she's in good shape is because she eats really healthy 'cause she doesn't care what she eats though she doesn't care what she eats she eat healthy\nI understand that I Will tell you this I couldn't be with a chick that didn't find pleasure in food I think that's I couldn't do it\nWhat shame putting shame putting your food at home I I Know I Know hey but she can do whatever I don't mind my girl do the same food you know but you derive pleasure from it though man whatever that saw her I don't care but that's why she says she looks good\nWell you have a chick crying for forty five days straight and you don't know what the root problem of it is by let's say they Fifteen Fifteen yeah I think he got his issue\nLike why are you waiting Fifteen day well because Ryan every morning at any\nChicken at any given point can cry for a week with no calls\n[laughter] so I I bet you ride out that say we Kevin in ... you know what some might be wrong I've never experienced that but I'm not going to say that it's not the lives not tell you this and I'm going to be real talk I can cry for a week without any calls\nThat's a whole another thing that has a whole nother down there is no doubt yeah look at my house [laughter]\nI don't know if it were a little survey you'll face they'll make Christmas right now\nThere's another show your face [laughter] never met her I write Black Friday down on your

crying for a Fifteen day\nI'm not I'm not a crime for fifty dead or that you could crop all week and I get cry for a week it's just a sad world right now man it's just really is he wound up in the morning\nRight but it wasn't about to mind if we all do this\nMean when you do you feel like well as men right now [laughter]\nI don't know what what what let's say give me a hypothetical\nOf where he needed to go yeah give me I Will Smith a realistic hypothetical where we'll Smith could have left it had to leave his wife and his situation\nOr the or at least you had to go to movies you\nHow long would it be go as long as the ... who months three months as long as it takes you already to let your wife sitting in for four to six days cry you wasn't making no money selling you'll be back with a couple by coach bag [laughter] yeah does that with the latest like\n... but but I think sometimes I and it's not just that it's not a gender thing I just think sometimes that significant other needs to feel in\nPort okay well see there ... there you go flip it in reverse they'll get the money that's what I Would tell them\nI mean I Would too [laughter]\nOkay so it's a different gender wise men and women\nMight want men ultimately and it's probably to their detriment can sweep promotion under the rug\nAnd not given that I think it's harder for women to do that right yeah a lot harder if I'm if I'm not happy but\nYou know I got jak money and I go to who to you know you don't get what they got what makes me happy so simple yeah we're simple creates a very simple\nSometimes it's like a path

[noise] he can get in the room with ... if you get in a room with a you got a chance to kick it right and you never know what's gonna happen\nBecause you never know what people's energy energies match up different ways in person will never get on line\nYou millennials no no you click a button and police\nCan wrap that could do like a pizza why don't you know you have to work law you know word for it yeah it was the day we can get drunk [laughter]\nYou know you had to buy drinks well let me ... ... let me you know we have a law\nSaying okay you can give them drinks [noise]\nOkay purchased maternal money by drinking you violate your drink rye I never knew that I'm Wondering you know we still had to work even though there was talking about yeah [laughter] okay\nSo yeah that he's not a list but he's got access\nTo get in the room you had asked the silver he got he got act I think kitten shot a shot you never know when you're going to make a shot when you shoot at random things happen to have you are and it landed wedding one was the golden ticket to a rat [noise]\nAnd that ... had no matter how great it is it's not ups and downs and ... he goes right it's gone [noise]\nAnd that's what happened his rat into it was never an extended right\nI don't think anybody thought this was going to go the distance my question including him yeah my question did he was oh why did it in so quickly and I think it's because\nHe acted like he hadn't been to the dance I think\nEverybody at her circle was like there's no no\nI don't think that's what it was I think he was confident enough what did he was he actually he felt like he was out of his league and she felt like a coyote polar he bought a\nYeah but that's the first step when you pull our so when you're talking to a woman and you pull the woman you don't you're not thinking that but when you're with a woman that's going to be a whole different situation right you know so I think at the at that moment he's like oh I I I I took a bigger bite that I expected that you know he he he he knew at that moment when you're dating her really deal with her and her being a ... international celebrities like well I'm probably\nA little bit out of my all yes he knew he never had or the\nYeah so you're saying that he's out at a bar is out at a party or whatever kicking it whether he's got the confidence now we get ten days he moves into her place and he looks at the police all the states and the money you have and the and the means and he goes\nOh I don't know about work this yeah this is way out of my league I'm ... I don't know if I don't get used to I don't know the touching that she's getting 'cause sure as hell between ... and ... Davis and I'm going to look at her first I mean I don't even know who he is\nYeah but he has nothing to offer her [noise] so what is it what what is the upper south I Know the cast members of\n[laughter]\nThose workout [laughter] [laughter] I've got to be called out to be told even talk to\nI got it right now Kevin how you Arianna ... who's making them laugh what would you take them crew member he's making allow\nDoes matter lie get into it spend a lot of the great dancer\nAnd and he got moved and it's a good God do you watch them on the whatever show he was on oh do you come away won't have a beer with Kevin federal ... Davis who may not like Kevin ... H O clock is\nKevin Kevin ... he's like smooth but he is move I Would say this\nAh ... Davis and offered Ariana Grande they beat the she made him feel he made her feel like she was norm\n'cause he was a normal guy he was he was a celebrity too yeah it's about you know really yesterday as much as I\nKnow but in her in her or bit [noise] who's Pi Day she needed she probably would feel better having a guy that was a little bit of celebrity understands what I'm into but not bigoted me so he can kinda played back\nRight let me ask you this because this is my second theory I think who was a kid who was the rapper to kill themselves or that she was gay pride and Miller Matt Miller Matt Miller killed himself to break them up [noise]\nOoh that's my theory I didn't I knew that she would have the skill [noise] up his death hanging over my head and say I can no longer in good conscience they just got even if I Love now that's interesting because that's going to hang over the higher relationship\nI don't know what the status was between Matt Miller an Ariana Grande day if there was any back and forth or any known\nHim being upset that she date ... David I Believe that's how I killed him\nSo well I I I Would accept that maybe\nThe tough getting calls so you take a she was kind of distraught about the whole situation and my ... she was like you know what can we just put some different that goes along the my theory is\nYo what does it say when your girlfriend breaks that we use because see because her eggs that I thought you were over at but see this is the thing I have to take one thank you for opening this up right this is the theory ... Davidson was never meant\nTo be anything other than a rebound and I think that's the amount that you didn't even know\nWhat they look and see if there was any back and forth with Matt ... day and not necessarily the pits the mall but all it was ever really going to be and she probably would have ended up back with Matt Miller he kills himself she saw destroy actually caused this to happen\nWell well you get if you can never if\nYou can never look at ... Davidson without thinking that a love that you had with someone is no longer there because of this PR wasn't necessarily tainted\nIf that's the case we don't know that there was ever that was the case they all say it's not the case she break up with ... with with with with Matt Miller that Matt Miller break up with her I don't if I'm not mistaken I Believe she broke up with Matt Miller album out right before he died so is there anything about the breakup on the average sea we would have to investigate the [noise]\nI think ... David said was I mean she wrote that song about on my\nUh you know the song on the album ... David ... I think ... was never going to be anything more than a rebound and he had he rightfully so okay try to try to lock it I'm going to read to you what the Davis said about ... area of the ground they breaking up with him he said this months before they broke up\nI'm Still convinced she's blind or hit her head really hard he told that variety magazine or something is going to\nHappen and she's going to be like what the EPA's this thing doing around for right now it's rock and\nI got something for you and I just said this before you say what you got mhm don't ever release a statement like that and they say it is already well are going to bite you in the headlines from the news it said that he joked they predicted that break up before it happened\nBut something that everybody else yeah we really we looking at him too much like he's the loser was her deal [noise] she's not a\nLady to divert I understand yeah yeah yeah and that's and let's do understand this before you go on they are [noise]\nHe didn't lose like you say lay the guy if I don't know the level was the you know he's like\nHe's like he's like a winner or right now oh his stock went up ... all of the women that beneath our that is all and now they want to sue that broken heart now and yeah if if he was smart\nHe would immediately [noise]\nProbably try to pet team up with re J.\nAnd pick a fight [laughter]\nRight and make us um but\nOn the ground they got a strong body count yeah he case they hid it first they hit it thirty first\nThirty first of All right Jay how would you want to say oh my God I uh according to TMZ ah there's actually a lot of sources saying that ah every underground day was in an incredibly dark place following the death of her ex wife and mother yeah we didn't know that she didn't know she felt like she did everything she could but she was in the ... the emotional wreck or between the the death and now so she's\nShe blames Pete Davis's jokey jokes for killing Mac Miller really as she had to let them go\nNah nah I don't think he goes to the the funny guy always\nTakes the fall Kevin but it also said that she wants to Louisiana [laughter]\nAnd those who actually says that she couldn't be fully invested in the relationship with Pete David than so that's why the uh the engagement was uh was broken off I mean I get this I get why he wanted to lock it down quick\nWhat he liked it down too quick I heard he didn't know what to do was going to have I heard that he gave her father he gave her his dad fathers bad\nYes you you can't do that that's a ... but he had to do that what was said that's actually we have had to put an end attached to that is to have it ... it looks Thursday that habit yeah\nI Want to put it on his face\n[laughter] now your faith is my thing [laughter] I Love you\nI got an hour I ...
