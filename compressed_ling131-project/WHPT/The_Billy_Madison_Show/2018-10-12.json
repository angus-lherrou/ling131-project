polls are ... in in in in in the ... was it yeah I think that was one of the question there oh okay like I said I don't remember the polls yeah but yeah we'll get back to obey yeah that's a yeah yeah you guys watch first take on ESPN\nAsked me if I watch ESPN [laughter]\nTo be an easier question for you can\nDo you know the name Steven they Smith no yes yeah yeah well do you do know Steve Smith you don't know what that is okay so here's the but I spent some of the show his face okay you don't know this guy\nI Know okay now you know if anybody knows what he looked like they are in there and I and I have seen you know obviously if you had a far right you you see and he's one of the best man here at\nAs far as necessarily know that he's right he's kinda like me I'm not always right I Want to clarify that to my mom said that my dad said that I always think I'm right I I my mom said if I think I'm right she told me not the fact that you see what was\nGoing on there and actually what your dad said All right well I talked to them more than one yesterday [laughter] on the air though and that was it was a situation that he did he not yeah yeah he didn't notice you always disagree you can never agree with some of the you know that's not what are the use of the things that we don't agree on what he said that right now which ended up I\nHere's what other I'm not going to tell you that I think I'm always right I I well I Do I I Believe I Believe in my opinion and what usually happens is that most people aren't in the in invested in their opinion is I Am so they buckled because my opinion strikes not right it's I'm just\nLouder than you if you don't think I think that you're right because I understand what you're you don't think your opinion is right\nAnd why give it up but here's the other thing will mope if I'm going to go hard on something is usually because I already know 'em right see that's the thing I'm a I'm not going to engage on your own so maybe might be right I'm going to engage on you when I got ... and I got the receipts so just notice I'm always said you\nAre you talking about me or you just everybody ... everybody\nAll right here is Stephen Smith on first take talking about James Winston he doesn't necessarily think that James should just be welcomed back with open arms oh I won't players but you guys he tells me what you think All right Steven they Smith\nLet's put him in the lion's den let's put him in the eyes of stone let's sit up there and said and James Winston we believe in you know here's the football\nAnd and the marquee you're all of it for us the Tampa Bay buccaneers we ride and die with you this is your future on the line right here here at all is reading\nAnd what you're going to do with it I have no problem with that I don't\nExercise enough in the world of business\nOn so many occasions people want you to prove and then after that they want you to prove to more than after that they want you to prove some more so than just delaying and waiting for you to mess up and ultimately it becomes an exhaustive process we isn't indicative of youth touching on the potential that you may have\nBecause you're just exhausted from constantly constantly running in the road blocks when you really really want somebody to succeed\nIf they showed you they are worthy of trust obviously you should trust them if they don't show you you're worthy of trust you either\nCut them or if you have to rely upon them you put them in a position where they're most exposed so you can find out it's not a round about way All right\nSo really the conversation is breaking down to this James Winston is back ... when he was on suspension he had been removed from Tampa Bay buccaneers promotions it's almost like I didn't exist\nYeah they did a WWF\nSo they're putting him back as a starting quarterback do you put him back in the promotions there was a new promotional video released this week\nThat had him that featured him and that would give you the impression hey so I guess what I'm saying is is he back one hundred percent or does he have to earn his way back or did he pay the price by sitting out for three games\nHow much are you willing to support James that's what I'm trying to figure out the give it all back\nHe's the face of the franchise and starting quarterback or do you want to just kinda like okay you start this Sunday but as far as you being the leader and I'm putting out full faith then you got to show us the better a little track record he still does have to prove himself he is on the field and on and off the field\nI don't care what it was the image in in the promotions stuff is about the image of the team like this is the one of the existing dollar guy\nSo on and off the field he has to prove himself absolutely spill he is still one prove it I Know everybody likes to be this big picture back up on the front of the stadium as the ... have you as well give us a little asterisk by [laughter]\n[laughter] out everybody that we we want to [laughter] or does eyes the mood you know the [laughter]\nYeah well you know on is that they want they don't want him to fail\nDo that yeah I mean if they wanted him to fail they would they would have just traded with they didn't want anything to do with it do you support James Cody you're on the bone what's up\n[noise] also I just wanted to say um you know I support Seamus appreciate everything that the U.S support and then when he was in there\nBut it's nice to have games but um I think real differences you you you said something about he has different weapons is are there more or less right but he really he really has the same level and it's just that you really have to show the ... the chemistry of can you know the ... and\n... out of all you can't underestimate a team having a couple of years to jail as well I mean everybody I Know you and I think the I don't think you've seen what James can really do with those weapons now that they've ... better\nI I really you know and I I'm really hoping that you can hook up with the Sean a little bit better this year I'm Sean Jackson Cody you sound like a bucks fan so\nUm how\nHow long are you willing to give Jay ms to show you that he's the quarterback you thought he was when we drafted him\nOh really yeah well this also promised Sean those okay you know they were offering them I mean I support him along with your quota but you know what I mean but you gotta show song alright good you're going to send it over to much more but that's what I got to say\nAll right man thanks a lot man go bucks there you go Cody just talked to John John you're on the boat what's up man\nA dog leg yeah when I bet it is the one that does though but anyway\n[laughter] I can go into that as I Want to know what it does have doggie you're always right anyway [laughter] I Want to know it really did it for three years\nAnd you remember about what are you now three years yeah\nOK what really has he done but the thing is I I ... no I don't know I Know like a whole and the other guy got kicked the wall and do the way the way back about really want to know what really at the end of the day I I haven't seen anything but the\nThing that hasn't done anything for the team you say I really think that anything nothing at all I mean\nWhat what are you OK namely thing he did\nMan wrecked Iraq [laughter] records have been better last through again a lot about hey man I tell\nYou don't just bringing up the top and you say my team I'm feeling fine [laughter] I don't know

Smith because all the ... with staff neat but he was in it but he took A L and the last one he still had Iran they dumped the no but the people were still like subtle ... I'm not you lost [laughter]\nI tell ya\nQuarterback is the least of the Tampa Bay buccaneers problems they've got no one game for three years and they live what are the worst defenses consistently out of the entire NFL football\nMm Mm that's a fact Jane as always plays from behind always\nDelivery plays little league that is right now I'm not disagreeing with you\nI mean it's it is what it is that's just the fact that is what happens anyway that's watched the buccaneers for more than I Do know the three days of the ... Patrick started with no that that's not the case\nThat now is it true that a lot of sports fans again believe that a great quarterback\nRises the level of the team what I'm asking I'm not saying that that's a I don't ... isn't there the perception fall says it may be that if you're a really strong quarterback you bring up a weekday you make the defense playoff right [laughter]\nAnd James does that we're ... we used to\nBe lucky if if not for the same as this team what are the worst would last for years and look when you're putting a sweet crappy crappy bucking ... that's a\n... I don't know\nAll the pieces are in place they all sorts of one is getting great I'm telling you it's going to be great to James just last year as a pro and at the end of the the buccaneers will open the doors and they will pay him he'll be one of the highest paid quarterbacks literally\nAlright geo so what happened Sunday what do you see what type of performance do you expect\nI think God's Amos will row for at least three touchdowns bought the book to his defense is horrible as they are will give up a ton of points to Matty Ice Julio Jones\nYeah and uh the new receiver originally on the falcons buccaneers losing a close\nGame yeah Julio Jones is going to light 'em up I did Vegas has the point at fifty eight and I think it's going to I Would take the over on that\nYou take the overall fifty eight yeah I mean somebody points yeah right right right okay I might I Believe it\nI Believe it's fifty eight maybe fifty four last time I attract and I think that it's going to be a ton of poison that game a ton of scores because you've got to horrible horrible defenses play\n... right when you go hey well gee oh um [noise] you are you see you left the number one show\n[laughter] I Know I I Know what to\nJoin the number one yeah so you know you guys should be taken me [laughter]\nI live in the numbers with the real uh and I don't\nAbout that do really yeah we uh\nWe miss your man
