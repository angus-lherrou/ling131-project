a habit yeah as a habit yeah 'cause after the last hurricane I was kind of a\nI was kind of um had him up short came up a little show yeah when I came back after you know being that my parents um I have a lot of rice I have like a lot of stuff that you could um if you didn't have fire or anything like that that you could actually or like you know electric stove or anything like that that you could or you can make\nNow without yeah man would I had to do is um I have plenty\nOf propane\nI learned that from the last little hurricane thing we had last year yeah because when it when it came down to it I was able to cook all of my food on my grill like gas I have three things I used to have one tank\nAnd then had the old backup pack now I have three full takes Mm So I can go I go a long time on three things okay and with that I mean I can put a skill that on my on my thing I can cook eggs I can boil water long have you can boil water you're good uh well you're you're you're you're so used to like\nGrilling and stuff like that on a consistent basis so I think your your your mindset and that's already on your radar for me I didn't even think about that for me I just know how to make a fire I got Flint ah so I just stop you know like I I have stuff that you could camp with okay I utilize my survival skills in terms of camping you know what I learned in camping\nI think maybe if you had enough supplies for two weeks mhm you should be good yeah\nAfter hurricane incident maybe in St Pete Tampa area ... think about last time I mean I don't know about a direct hit like and for my cat three or a cat for something ridiculous like that\nBut I'm Talking about just basic services electricity to waters questionable so you've got to boil water and and all of that so um I think if you have enough for about two weeks because I have a ten day cooler\nThat'll keep things ice cold for ten days\nAs fast as a piece of equipment I have and now trying to turn everything else I have in the solar\nI have a solar light deal going where I can put lights in my house and have lights in every room and they run purely off a solar that was relatively easy so I don't need the solar lanterns in a battery charge during the day and it'll give me enough to have lights on in my house all night and I'm also in the process of building a cooler\nOnly like a just a cooler that's an AC mhm and it's a it has to ... and everything and it will be able to run off of a car battery car charger batteries\nOr solar it's all about the solar ... and so I'll be able to have a seat to probably cool a small\nBedroom not a small bit below my bedroom and I could lock the bedroom down I can make the bedroom cold I can have the AC AC in the bedroom window unit if I needed small refrigerator\nInternet and TV in one room a you wouldn't know that you didn't have anything I'm ah can I ask you this question what's that is the size of this whole legal it's\nLegal you have to remember 'cause I Know 'cause I Know I remember when you were leaving the Puerto Rico that shows you that thing yes I'm Still doing that a lot of bite but I'm building it out of power in my entire house that's amazing\n'cause I Know in Florida it's illegal to uh to be off the grid ... well hey if if if the grid is down there were all off the grid but I'm I'm specifically saying I have something they're not going to roll out of my shed yeah in a hurricane situation\nAnd I can power all of the things I Need to power in my house indefinitely and that's not illegal at all because it was not working mhm you don't have to suffer yeah that's true yes surviving I'm just surviving when maybe when the grid comes back up and they're just keeping are like that\n[laughter] it's like I'm not going to matter [laughter] oh man you know what I thought about this when I looked up at the calendar and I saw was national indigenous people day and I was like man I Hope we get a call from my main man Cherokee Cherokee what's going on\nWhat was going on is ...\nI'm doing good man I'm I'm celebrating I'm celebrating the day for all of my indigenous brothers and sisters\nAnd an indigenous indigenous yes [laughter] yes what did I say okay now you said indigenous I wasn't really you\nKnow um what was kind of got me a little red hot\nAnd the ... the collard right now neither one and the Redskins should Wednesday night hopefully you know there's you know in this day you support that\nI support the name Redskins for sure I mean you bury it all who's been remember\nOkay go on so [noise] um no I\nJust wanted to comment that indigenous day is fine we can celebrate that but\nThere is there is no I'm\nNative American months holiday anything celebrated that I can remember a recall somebody please proven wrong but I don't\nYou think that uh\nYou might be right um I don't know of any day where we officially acknowledge anything when it comes to Native Americans\nRight so I mean if they want to bury the atrocities that they did that's up to them but a a in my native brother ran out their stand up be proud lips or do something about this\nOkay I'll tell you what Cherokee the day that we meet and we have that drink that we're going to have one day soon I sure hope you are native\nAmerican yeah heard Yes sir I Will be very ... right yeah yeah\nYeah I Will be my eyes or a blue is a wolf but uh I'm Still Native American\nAnd his skin is really light you believe you know they know that [laughter] are you believe in I feel like he's a I feel like she has Indian blood and I'm a Native American Native American Native American ah\nBut yeah you know we'll see we'll see we'll see I don't I don't want to say like you know he's like one of those people it's like I don't want Eighteenth ... you know Cherokee but his name's Cherokee I mean that's half the battle right there yeah yeah he's he's almost there yeah a Cherokee we appreciate it man and ah we salute you\nKeep doing what you guys are doing man I appreciate the show\nAll right thank you you know up here is the weird thing about today and it's a weird thing that's happening I guess I wouldn't say it's weird\nBut Columbus Day mhm for Christopher Columbus for the first time\nIt won't be celebrated in Columbus it's the namesake the city was named after Columbus yeah and they won't be celebrating there are a lot of cities that are no longer calling this Columbus\nDay and then that's been like uh I've heard it called the ... just people day for years but just by people who were just kind of in tune with that kind of thing it's a trend if the Titanic had been trying\nBut it's it's kind of mainstream now yeah and I wonder how I Wonder what people think about that I mean they probably\nThat ah [noise] the how they feel a lot of the fact that Christopher Columbus is almost being ... out of our history books but if he is he rightfully be an ex now it was the history incorrect\nAnd that is what the debate is the debate is I mean what did Christopher Columbus discover a lot of people say he did not discover what we now know as America also how can you discover something that's already there and that's been there and they're already people their heads indigenous\nPeople I don't know man I'm it's just something I'll tell you what I Know about Columbus Day they took it\nPretty serious on that one episode of the Sopranos and they went down there to fight when they could have been doing some gangs the stuff that would further their cause but they wanted to go down and fight for their\nFor their heritage and um I think as time goes on and\nPeople start investigating and thinking outside of the boxes you know I was taught a certain thing I always talk Columbus Day you know what I mean I wasn't taught anything differently but now apparently they're teaching different things out there and and the the culture shifting to cultures moving\nLet's talk to Stephanie Stephanie thanks for all the average Joe hello\nHey Kevin how are you doing great\nGood good so I heard you guys talking about there's no holidays or Native American but technically Thanksgiving is to celebrate that first Neal that the

don't believe that fairy tale did you\n... I yeah I Do I'm from New England and I said I Know the criminal rafts there were a sign that he hasn't really way they lead but I've been to all their site where they they\nA native New England is not not the Native Americans that they need to set up there I'm Holly said they they teach us about how they think they do that to me oh and then how Native Americans brought me in there\nYeah but that part of that yeah um I think but I I just I\nI think that maybe if you heard the Native Americans take on that holiday I don't think it's the same as the fairy tale we were told like they were all buddies and friends and you know there was some other stuff in there with you know the whole uh smallpox blankets and all that costs though\nFrom primary to specialty care find reinsurance and a great

about\nWhat they're known story about Christopher Columbus but I think it's pretty unique in it you know it's so bad it is pretty bad okay go ahead of me All right so back in the early Fifteen hundred Christopher Columbus was you know you're still in around Jamaica\nShip went down due to like worms that is a ship just went down okay so what if what this tried for about Fifteen week and they were you know they're really nice there helping them out eventually after Fifteen week of failing occurred and they\nYou'd have to go to a\nSeries can now uh discreetly record police encounters when the cops pull people over weight weight so necessary knows when the police pull you over a ... all you have to do us a all you have to do or an iPhone users that has to say hey Syria I'm getting pulled over in one of the latest I asked to ...\nUm the new uh the iPhone update and after you say he's theory I'm getting pulled over the app actually start to according or the interaction between the cop and the other person that's been below that is crazy I hum\nWow mhm [noise]\nI don't know if I if it was up to me to get live action footage of things on my phone\n... there would be nothing on the Internet I'm always amazed at how people have a phone ready to go what stuff's happening yeah they're like they're anticipating it they got the settings right so they can pull it out hit a button man of falling around\nWait a minute maybe\nI Would never be able to get anything\nI don't know that I use is that you don't take them why they were here I'm going to explain\nHow how you use it a once a once Syria's worried about the traffic stop the program springs in the action the pause any music or anything that's playing I turn down your screen brightness and put your opponent or do not disturb mode\nAnd then the recent attacks to a designated emergency contact to be a little over yeah after you get pulled over 'cause you never know what's going to and then the front camera turns into a video record and um it's going to start recording the incident and it's going to take audio from it to All right\nAnd and and that's what I'm saying I let me give you like this I think it might help it might help a lot of ... it might help a lot of cases because there's a there's a lot of cases are um you know where the body came footage just turned off while a police pull somebody over and it was like a lot of discrepancy and then the police report or the ... it's been a little bit fabricated right to make the police officer look better I mean it\nMight help I mean what if you're in your car right mhm\nWith a woman that it's not your way OK mhm and she said [noise]\nSorry I'm being pulled over mhm [noise]\nAnd then it sends a text your wife [noise]\nOn the flight or you can listen to me I mean ... ... in art so [noise]\nTo send the video to the parts of the two\nI doesn't stay on the story of a sense from the videos just alerts I mean all of a sudden it just it just to learn to\nFeel I feel like that's that's ridiculous that I got to have an app like who gets pulled over that much where they need to have the ... it so they can go Syria\nGet pulled over but there is that there's so many cases how about this there's ... there's actually a case I think it was in Baltimore where a cop was planning police evidence or he was planning drugs or when he was from these people are used planting drugs are you going to stop that with a cell phone and my ... my there there might want to curse word where the the the videos recording the whole situation\nAnd you could see the actual police officer planting evidence on the person in my in my hoping I Want us to do that every instance is going to be the\nSame have you ever recorded a police officer when he pulled you may yeah have you ever put your phone off hit record and like holding it up like I ask you a no okay yeah see that to me that would escalate the situation I feel like\nThese people whenever they start recording they're going to be a little bit more discreet about it they're not going to be like oh I'm recorded they're probably going to have it and you know like the ... or something like that in the ...\nI wouldn't want to be all pitching in around ...\nAs the officers pulling me Albany hasn't walked up to the car yet and I'm\nTrying to ... you know [laughter] it's going to be on the news yeah exactly [laughter] I\nEver agreed news during the first national ... ah during the national anthem before the first game with the Panthers\nI was surprised they're not surprised or why is that\nWell Aaron Reid was the the team made a colon Kaepernick who initially kneeled with him and they both were out of the leagues so to speak with a path to this is his first starting game yet and he took me he's looking like he always has done any war shirt before the game and said I stand with cap yes here's the thing\nCan you believe they never asked him about any of the ... or any of his views on anything before they hired him and signed into a contract I think they're going to ask\nI think there are more they're not concerned with that I think the Panthers I'm more concerned about his ah his ability to play on the field oh he can do that yeah you know here's a phenomenal safety yeah he's good\nYeah that's why but I but I think it's refreshing that that was the biggest thing in the lead for three years mhm and they didn't even ask it was right next to Cam Newton to\nDo yeah yeah yeah he was right next to ... he said quote I'm not I'm not saying I'm going to stop being NAFTA because I won't I'm just going to get set of different ways to be active different ways to bring awareness to the issues of this country and improve the issue is happening in this country I saw\nA headline that says ... ever read read to the need for the national anthem and the world kept turning\nNobody even though I Do you know who bet the the most is Betsy devolved yeah that's your education commissioner you have the education\nSecretary I could hear yeah I Do you know she's the only cabinet member that's being protected by the U.S marshals help\nRight she was getting a lot of heat it some of the parents as early on in the process yeah oh yeah she needs to have the uh yeah she she needs protection they all do I think all cabinet members you\nRoll do low yeah by her she's a I don't want to say she was a little extreme but she wants to she wants to change the way the er an education\nI mean is is is formulated she wants to change everything off course or she wants to yeah so uh the cost of providing U.S Marshals to protect the education sector that secretary Betsy DeVos is expected to rise to seven point seven million dollars annually oh she is good for you think you'd go for it she got put in money\nAnd we we need to protect her I mean I mean that goes without question she as the secretary so I mean if she needs protection she needs protection I don't have a\nProblem with it I mean it it's up there though she's it's\nThat's I mean that's a lot of money for it costs\nMoney to run a government man yeah even more money to educate these little ... dad passed [laughter]\nSpeaking of that speaking about as kids cat Williams was arrested for assault in the driver in Portland\nCat I don't think I don't think that's going to be here much longer\nYou don't take some man there's just too much drama remember like when they slap in somebody and target not too long ago\nHe's left somebody of targeting lego yeah and then like he like many like ran off in a school like one of those scooters like bad the basking in the ...\nYeah yeah he was the other issue ... what I heard was that he was on the way to build a taping of mechanic wild and out they do a tour yes so he was going to that and he was in it over with his dog\nYes uh so what happened was Williams was arrested for suspicion of a assaulting a hired driver picked him up at the comedian Portland or at the airport the Portland international ... uh as multiple outlets are reporting a fire broke out after an argument between uh the town car driver and Williams over transporting his dog\nThe guy didn't want the dog in his car exactly the dog was probably be a Snoopy [laughter] yeah and their cat was like what did you say come on down [laughter] I don't appreciate that don't do that to my dial had been anything I\nSo after and then a an an argument with an suit and then uh I'm actually uh they said that he assaulted ah the driver and he was arrested\nUm you would think I Would like get Williams stand up I like cat Williams but\nMaybe I Would really have never watch to stand up you have you ever watch no I like him do a\nYard so his his stand up his older stand up like the ... and stuff I thought they were funny it's just the ... when he started going crazy you could see the craziness come out of\nBloody evolved into crazy he evolved into credit stuff he like became that [noise]\nI remember he was a it was a ... a Friday after next 'cause I Know but I mean that's kind of him do you think that he was playing that it that was him I think I think before he got that role on Friday after next he was a really bad but then he just kind of like circle after he will be ... yeah yeah and then after after that role in that movie he just kind of took it and ran\nYeah and then that's what kind of uh that that will it will blow up his career and drugs and drugs to yeah you can never forget about the drug's a ... Williams though I think he's he's really talented waves adopted like ten kids they didn't really\nThat see that's what that's what makes sense at all it is like I hear things about\nHim like he adopted ticket [laughter] thank you for this guy yeah I mean I I feel\nLike a lot of the the stories that we hear about how will this be your voice like folklore almost it's like\n... Williams uh you know are you okay he got beat up by eighth grader yeah oh yeah you got like a pick up basketball game it was it was something ridiculous like he was wrestling when I was a wrestler last week it was a hole in the news like we don't [laughter]\nI Know caught on tape for you like a fifty years old getting beat up by eight year old I don't know an eight year old was bigger than he was I don't even get it yeah\nOh wow not long man he's out here you think is out of here who do you think is going to who's who's gonna who's going to go before him or ah\nNah never mind I was going to the economy but I'll tell you the right to tell you talk right yeah he just how crazy yeah but I thought he had like a drug you should do not ... not like that now I Know\nHe had a pain pill issues when he got the life oh yeah I got laid off but yeah I got like ...

pictures like um you know oh on the bone instrument paid and okay what is on the page then it's not really a and then some private ones on my people's private Instagram that's posted in you know those

know I mean they come back to like that yes yes yes but you have to show six am good if not\nYou are Mike\n... oh [laughter] hey do you use Google Plus\nA Google Plus a ... that's the that the social media is a Google social media thing I never knew what\nGoogle Plus was but yeah I think it was kind of their answer to social media was\nKind of lame though but it was Google yeah it was like there is ... it was like there is sort of Facebook almost it was like a Facebook kind of a that this is the thing I had a Google Plus but I never used ... to once and it was it was last October stop using it is done they got rid of it oh really yeah 'cause there's so many other social media platforms I think Google can compete with that platform they also had like\nA data breach oh really that exposed a lot of people's information so if you use Google Plus I Hope you have a replacement 'cause this\nAt all wow yet and I'm a Google Plus my window I mean it wasn't really that there wasn't really that great anyway I was getting ready to start ... was that I mean I just thought that because I like Google I'm a Google yeah use every single I feel I feel like a Google Plus like its fan base or the the amount of users that they had was minimal that it\nIt really it really didn't do anything it really didn't do much ...\nIt's a it's not like baseball baseball is is it's such a dominant factor in\nAnd and the social media game that I think you know Google has never had a chance I hate Facebook man you'd think Facebook is still effective I feel like Facebook is it's still affect them in a sense where is it more good than bad I feel like it's the way it's being used on the most part is it is simply for the majority of\nPeople to use it is it simply oh wow here's what I'm doing here's what I care about ... let me share things with the people like I Know and love or\nIs it a free for all I can be a [noise] I think it's free for all I think what whenever people with people sometimes people post things and it's like almost like a a journal entry you know they showcase their lives they pour their heart and\nSoul out and everything like that and opposed or sometimes they they share pictures of of their vacations and and and what they you know what they're doing\nI mean Facebook could be good it could be it can be very beneficial or but at the end of the day too it's if you're consistently on Facebook and exposing yourself to all those factors in exposing yourself to like false information sometimes they have their own on Facebook they have like those fake news stories I mean if you're always consistently exposing yourself to those kinds of things than\nI mean I don't know what's real anymore yeah exactly and yeah it's just it's just a an over abundance of like of of information almost yeah there's something else going on with Facebook was that they got a data breach to ...\nProbably have some sort of ... ... and and the thing about Facebook\nThey always had so many issues on my tracking your information and what you like and what you know making them selling it to like make big companies\nHow do you feel about the smart speakers like to echo in the Amazon what's the one Amazon Amazon has to echo elements like yeah like they are the echoes the smaller version of it and then you have the Google One they have the Google Home ... which is hey go go do this or alleged are hooked up to the Amazon snow sure are you\nWhere the the the ... the Mike is listening is list is alive Mike in your house connected to the Internet mhm\nI don't know when it's listening maybe it's listening for key words but when you say hey Alexa you know you can change the likes his name is something else oh yeah yeah yeah you can call it whatever you want a car like Tiffany ... yeah whatever you want like most people just keep it how it comes out of the box okay to make it a man you can make a Snoop Dogg oh now you're going to get ... you can do\nWhatever you want [laughter] hey mom [laughter] what you want to know what it is [laughter] it was ... it would be like it would give you what you wanted a little bit more [laughter] they got nothing to do and then if you ask for music but I Want that moved there but\n[laughter]\nWant to try to stay [laughter] usually like\nUm what is the weather right now and it would be like\nOh it's nice to have you got chicken [laughter]\nThat's not like most of it now but it's close to ... uh you know when I'm doing it I'm doing most smart speakers a lot of people hate him a lot of people love I'm\nI'm In between I tend to think that if you worry about people listening on the government the government has or you may have you\nAlready have they don't want you you're doing weird stuff but it ain't hurting nobody and that's why they let you continue to do it cause you a really doing nothing you're just talking crazy or in terms of what those whatever you say in your house most people are out of control when they're at home and nobody's listening how about if\nYou're I'm All right so are you at your house and this is just you know just and I'm not saying like are so you're\nDoing like some sort of illegal activity like say smoking marijuana in into legal in in Montana so to speak right okay and you smoke a week\nAnd you talk about it and you're talking about it and in a in a lecture picks it up and it really that information to the government okay if you're going straight from elects a straight to the government like I mean I have it has to happen\nI don't think\nThe government and the people that know and all they know you're smoking we uh-huh because everybody smoking it they know you're watching porn laws everybody's they know it all broke they know your Google searches [noise]\nBut I don't want you but but but eventually they're going to watch you know they felt like I feel like after like overtime they grab one every now and then make you go oh my God it's not safe to smoke a joint in my living room to make an example of making one example and you can keep people\nThey miss always keeping tabs on and so they kinda know where we where we are ... you know what I mean ...\n... but that doesn't make it right though oh is that right but then you can do to stop it why do you think we're here we're distraction yeah yeah a distraction away huh\nWhat's really going on or what's really going to say it is a stretch and you can say oh you can say no I'm here to be a distraction\nOr destruction of what though what the what what what what what are what are we destruction ... what is what is going on and we part of the machine broke and what's the what's the machine the machine is what's keeping us divided oh okay now I get what you saw the\nSmoke and mirrors Mm yeah All right you know who's running it who one percent\n... percent oh the millionaires and billionaires millionaires can't even get at the table oh so it's like the billionaires people might be serving nice people okay I've got to talk about anything\nFacebook is coming up with a new smart speaker are you ready for the portal is that what it is a portal is Facebook's new smart speaker it as a asked this the camera and sell it for three hundred and forty nine dollars okay so you're not\nBeing on Facebook is not enough now you're going to have\nAn interactive camera mhm as a part of a stand alone it looks like a little it looks like a little tablet mhm it looks like a bigger version of the original ... are part with a little screen in like a little thing underneath the ...\nAnd I'm trying to figure out where this fits in I don't think I Want to be connected with a camera on my Facebook Like\nThat so it's got to be almost one big or a face time almost\nSo almost like that but the the the camera that they have it has a a artificial intelligence to follow the user around the room during video calls so it's almost like you're going to get some motion with mhm\nThat's kinda scary I mean I I mean that's cool that's cool what Facebook is doing in terms of uh trying to get into like that game oh now but what is it like is it how's it going to\nBe any better than than than elects that's always going to be the same thing as a light up when they made a lot\nYou're not hooked up to Facebook they'll see if you go unless you opt in to Amazon you know what I mean if you're if you're using the Google Home you opt in and the Google but if you use this\nFacebook Porto now they say that it's going to allow video calls to your friends via Facebook Messenger in the high end I'm Sorry a high def smart camera and it was going to\nFollow you around the room is going to be a game changer for video chat\nRather than you just happen to sit in front of a laptop or tablet during the video call Facebook's says it's cameras will adjust to follow the action whether you're moving around the kitchen or chasing the kids through the living room the camera also widens it's focused as more people into the room because Facebook want to make sure\nThey have you and everything you doing oh I don't know about this one man because it's the ... 'cause I don't really like Facebook Like that and I don't need Facebook having an open Porto in my house\nAnd I don't eat Facebook being able to turn on a ... it looked as if I put something on Twitter and it's like on Facebook mhm 'cause your mom on Facebook man\nMessed it up yeah my grandma's officers or she was on Facebook and it was weird but like it's like man", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Billy Madison Show", "city": "Sarasota", "day": "08"}
