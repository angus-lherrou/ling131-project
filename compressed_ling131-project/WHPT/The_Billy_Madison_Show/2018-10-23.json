one oh two five four Facebook Instagram or Twitter at ... beef Kevin show [noise]\n\nAnd right now orange widowed [noise] I'm going to give you a first poll of the evening\nBecause we're going to talk about the thousands of immigrants that are heading north toward the U.S border the U.S Mexico border\nI'm from Honduras they're scraping this is a very violent place\nAnd I'm I'm going to tell you\nIf that many people are willing to walk that ball you got to take a gander at the map currently there about I'd heard ten thousand was the latest number I heard\nA years because after after they travel from country to country more than we are joined get out of their lives you know yeah well it's better picking up I'm just saying how is the ball and it's like numbers ten thousand now that's more than two thousand and started with it's like a cello but well yeah it's like a coach I'll Try to work a lot on the longer it goes all the bigger the crowds will go\n[noise] I tend to think does this look yeah it's it's ridiculous easier to make sure it is like the million Man March there really is um I tend to think that people don't walk that far but nothing [laughter] I Know that sounds simple but I'm going to play some of this audio and then we'll get to\nWhat I Want to talk about is what happens when they get to the U.S border\nAnd I am they're eleven thousand miles away eleven hundred miles away from the U.S border right now I'm Wondering at this rate how long does it take them to get there when does this all go down does it go down before the midterms\nI think this is a lose lose politically for President Trump but let me just give you a little update this is from CNN do judge make\nThinks that you were an invading\nBand of criminals possibly terrorists yeah it is threatening to your soldiers do to keep you out or separate families what would you say to him\nOr some of that we are an honorable people where workers\nWhat do you call a group of kids terrorists or group of women who need out we're asking for his support but of course we know he has no conscience he's crazy they started off as low as volunteer with an organization called ...\nSingh from pat us or towns Without Borders for to help protect migrants [noise] and now it's harder to conspiracy theorists who refuse to believe that this caravan as few only vice aspirations [noise]\nThere are some believe that you're being organized for political reasons are being paid to do this and we have a lot of people so they couldn't be somewhat bad intentions\nOkay so that's bill we're from CNN he is actually traveling with it's amazing how\nIt's weird notion that all of these journalists are in bed with these people and\nThen they just kind of up and just go home with me like this I Am walking with them now man that walking is on All right let\nMe go ahead and they take their lunch break [laughter] yeah [laughter] they learn the dirty Mike I'm getting a shirt [laughter]\nI'm ... oh\nYes sir\nWhat happens when ten thousand and I'm just going to just throw in an extra two or three okay because it'll be about twelve or Fifteen or yeah because the word is spreading quick that down to it and everything and what happens when they get to the border dude outlet a man that's it\nAnd we you know we process and what ... what\nWas what I suppose [laughter] yeah I just remember yeah I did not a process and I don't I don't like that process and\nMope okay we can't put the military on our border and say yeah I Can't come in Mexico's very strict they're strict didn't and we are when it comes to ... they said\nGo all through your ... we'll let you all go right on prey saying stay well we're about to be stopped somewhere about going to stop all yeah they are telling these people to turn around and go home well Mexico realizes what a bad looking would be so Mexico don't want to take the ill so there are still the taking them to get to the left the United states take them\nAll right they get to the border and once they get to the border there kind of I guess it will they'll dispersed to try to everybody I go to a certain way and I know I don't think you open the borders and say All right if they open and I'm coming they're coming to go there and they're going to but that crowds not don't just stop\nEither to their women and children in in a in that primarily make up this\n... and that's the ... hoard whether or not or my loving Columbine hoard oh yeah yeah I\nI sat for me a core group of um what do you call them a call them uh I don't know what I call the ... right and what did you call them I I called him a group is their tear refuse [laughter]\nI [laughter] I think there\nDo you think there are terrorists in this group I Know we can't be absolute on anything\nI think there are terrorists here now and I'm Talking about Americans so but there's terrorists didn't could there be terrorists in that group short or do I think that they are they are made up holy of terrorists or primarily of terrorists or this is some big terrorist plot ... because you're not\nJust going to walk into the country and be an checked so\nWhat was going to happen when they were going to process I mean they put them where where do they go ten thousand people might be twelve thousand about Thirteen pounds ... how much this ten thousand going a fifty\nFifty states do we put them out do we put them in an auditorium how I don't even understand how this begins to happen or do we have some like clothes that what what about the jail where they film\nShawshank Redemption is that so that would be but I Want to put them enough to try and do we how we how long how long how long it takes care of it I'll Try to be nice and you're trying to let them say\nWhat about all the people that are here going through the immigration process legally who still can't catch a break\nI Would say this and and I and I don't have the answer let me just ... say that I Am empathetic you have a I admit pathetic to uh people\nThat will walk thousands of miles when we live in the country where we have lazy asked us that won't drive to the own McDonald's on the corner and instead call ... ... ... that's why you know ... to\n... because they went to McDonalds [laughter] it's not always Katy claimed it's still it's not close up\nBy my point is the human spirit is alive in these people that are in during this journey to keep their children safe where we get fatter by not even walk into the McDonald's or driving ourselves in having the food\nYou're not making the argument for why we need to let these people in the\nCar I what I'm saying is turning out because there are people who try out because it because they have the term the guy\nSaid to their workers may have determination they have spirit they are they are fleeing oppression okay I think our nation was founded upon people fleeing oppression certain groups of people ... well\nYeah it's not everybody can't believe this is All right here's\nPresident Trump on what a what he his opinion on what's going on right now\nGood relationship with border patrol and I ... and they said it happens all the time from the middle east but assigned\nTo save their those are the what's the real bad one [noise] but there will be interesting to have surgery and they could very well be there's [noise] there's no proof\nThere's no proof of anything they could very well\nWhen I was there was no proof of it even not not anything that it was written you\n[laughter] yeah oh yeah there's proved to be killed you that you're Saudi Saudi oh come on\nWe were with that position is evolving on that yeah that was a bad deal there isn't that that's going to be a movie\nCalled the stewardess man and one was\nLike hey yo eating ... he didn't get him so he didn't kill themselves they look like he would say I understand this [laughter]\nYou know they didn't get in there they would have got him somewhere else because they wanted to give you don't walk into your murder is how\nI well I don't know man but it yet but different but\nI'm just mad today was when it's close to do that a fake beards when his ... man [laughter] at that next\nLevel [laughter] that levels but how did they do now we've got a a Trump can't you're on the ball with the [laughter]\nBut uh uh so I Want to say when it comes to the care where it's kinda like it's like not the first one of them they don't like the idea of what\nYou understand what happens all the time but it's it's it's a the timing now with what's going on in the country and that's not having a and I was having issues with immigrants that are already here I think the timing of it makes it a more of a frontline story right now", "show_name": "The Billy Madison Show", "year": "2018",
