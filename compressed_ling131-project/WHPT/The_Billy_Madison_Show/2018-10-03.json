Eighteen this is happening and we knew nothing about it we all talked about it and just like you know those are the most annoying thing about it was people kept on replying all in the you know that was that was terrible\nYeah that's the that's that's about it that's worse than the alert picketing it's worse than missile man\nBut not worse than a missile know nuns weren't you [laughter]\nI can tell you that there were videos up I found this interesting they show Times Square when the alert went off right in times square everybody's already into their phone but you can tell when it hit it was like whoa because it was in my pocket I was listening to a pod cast it was in my pocket in spite of vibrate like I've never seen the phones ... ...\nI was laying on the couch trying to sleep in Miami now to learn was yeah I was like damn you big leap [laughter]\nBut you know you can send your demand a right way to manage well see\nThat's the thing the that's what I'm saying cats I understand that there's not probably a physical list well no I Can't say that every everybody's number is long list somewhere there's only one way for your phone to be called right\nOr the numbers have to be I mean I Do is they're All right no\nI mean I one would have one would assume unless each individual carrier\nKen has a system by which they can send out an alert this thing overrode average everything linked up what they ought to be I mean their income on of course Scott who can I say go to the mall and go\nYou know they could not live with each other they all look good who's with the government

water really and that's good if you're out in the water [laughter]\nHow does that how does that translate because a lot of people say it doesn't even work on land that would that's the joke or would you like a murder man\nA war or is it that the people that are doing that a subscriber in the metro PCS are the ones that need to take care of business out on the water oh yeah\n... ... and now you profiled ... follow the money Kevin ... that got out of the people on their health care that you might feel about what do you feel about Iraq I run by the resume and went to sprint you trust that\nMean they would have been nice man\nHe's confused or Steve Steve is that a straight Steve you're on the bottom what's up man\nThe hey guys great show as ... and ... hey I'm well but I worry when\nThey're going to say they're doing the test for space force and they have a space for solar because to me that's when things are going down you know something's coming come up up top that that's the alert we want the second thing is not joking um they're doing a test for everybody\nCell phones for urgency stuff for FEMA and all that nobody cell phone works when there's an emergency [laughter] so I'd like to know how that system to go to work okay I Know the answer is that you got anything else for Steve\nAre you know just keep up what you're doing most more black or every day\nEven though he likes white women that you go yeah you want to hear you but now there are cameras the ... we didn't say what he was supposed to say I was trying to get in to say I like what Steve has a clear line [laughter] I think I Know Steve John you're on the bone\nEight years while it you know I ... I think if the uh the alert\nYou didn't get the alert oh man that's no that's uh that's that's pretty bad for you may you're going to have to report to the center man\nWell why wouldn't he wants to that I got two fold I'm One of those two phone kind of do you cheat and lie [laughter] you to come up with one holdout due to you to plug [noise] nah lovers I Walk\nOld school of law at a base when we saw University of Miami [noise] down\nThe hall rather murky [laughter] I just I Need to do All right I'm promotions a manager to promotions wizard what do you feel by my\nDon't know they give me a different title every week actor\nDirector after ... director of marketing for marketing speaking of marketing promotions I next big event is my cap to punch out number four oh yeah are you ready so ready for that or not you know I'm your biggest critics yeah I Know that you read and read it yet but I got a little bit more you're gonna watch the fight this year\nI Need to get you a prescription to check\nMy I'm fine alright of fun so a big hobbies right the midget and that's all I Need to know and you know was split on that fight\nI'm team hobby I Know your team happy the way to say about Garrett I mean he he's gonna be easier for him to punch at his level that copy ducks is gonna hit him on the top of that he was at the girl the back of the head last year so you know he's going to get on the topic is hobby has been training harder than he's ever trained for anybody I Know this book bag and Garrett is under estimating hot\nAnd that's the worst thing you can do I think that is the worst thing you could do but still he's probably got to speed on hobbies very slow alright what connects though it's going to be up like they have no shocked the world I Do would you ever go into a fight thinking you could win if you knew you couldn't hear the guy's face like physically it's not possible I've been in a few places like that\nThat physically was a possible but it wound up happening\nNow the only problem happy would have if it's he leaves down if he tries to lean down he can get hit in the face but now as far as the rules go Gareth wouldn't be able to his feet can't leave the ground right\nAway to punch them in the face why not\nI didn't know you could leave the brown it'll ... like a legal sanctioned fight you know what I mean they know it is a legal sanctioned fight I mean there's no there's legitimate ... some years where there is legit rules but it's not like you know the Strait of professional like what are you ... you can't do around\nHouse I mean they do Random House this year we can do around roundhouse punch or no no can't do that yeah but right now [laughter]\nMacho Camacho he's jump up at the airports\nAre up there you go\nOkay let's get down to business here so I'm you're going on the cruise in and I'm not going I didn't know it was going to end up that way but I Would say I was looking forward to Saturday Night on the cruise where everybody gathers in sports allows the watch Florida State versus the Miami\nThe first thing that sucks about that was that three thirty kick off three we're going to be in Mexico we're going to be in uh where where we go next ... ... ... ... [noise] what ... what do you think about the game [noise]\nEverytime I place FSU unless it's the years that my name is going on probation it's always going to be\nA good game it's always gonna be one of those come down the line in Miami got watched by forty seven nothing a one year when they had like thirty scholarships wrapped up\nIn all of the Miami noise right now\nAnd the ... out the window when they play each other\nOr you do I I was telling somebody that they were like a lot of states lows and will is don't do that out\nYeah I think the U.S they finally got their stuff together one last week against Louisville\nAll right well I'm a little not really doesn't matter who wins when a wins away especially I mean it's a one of the top five ... not top five but you know the power five a conference so they're part of that so you beat little of all I think that's confidence going it's the Miami okay sometimes and here's Miami's problem in this happening as LSU LSU they weren't prepared for right\nThey waxed or North Carolina last week on a Thursday night forty seven to ten yeah he's out of hand and the other\nProblem with that is long rest so they don't have the moment I mean it's great that they did that but when you you got to be you know football just like any especially that sport you have to be in a rhythm and the rhythm getting the reps the week and a half off not good long time especially I mean look I think because he probably had a great game mhm I think he settled down and he was doing some stuff that middle acreage year couldn't do\nA wide receivers we're getting hit in stride which is great the difference was making great place\nBut I still think that we can half lay off even though the games at home that week and a half just like it gives you an extra data huh All right you're going to be a little bit of rhythm in my opinion\nSo so how are you feeling because the I Would like to make a little ways you're with you [laughter] so we can raise your way of speaking about the wages are you ah what was your be too much is off the last two ages ... and that's the problem\n[laughter] on that are the problem no we did all the little dog in such a quadruple a nothing triple a nothing like\nYour likeness you like know how long and I like it a lot now what was the first and then the second and now this will be what's the first the first one was uh the warriors against Cleveland and I want to know your last oh\nYeah yeah and then went out on the next time the next day was Miami FSU last year and what happened to me one finally we got robbed a oh sure you're doing okay Maria dad victory for you guys that victory up a tally\nAnd and now I think we can break even\nAnd we both of them that's kind of cheap how's that cheap I mean look bailed out beyond brisket you're supposed to be brisket numerous actually I'm I'm not the brisket get ends this brisket guy\nTalking to you know alright brisket right Kennedy gigs I get your ... oh yeah yeah yeah\nI I Am more gigs I can afford to pay off his bed [laughter]\nNow that I guess we should we have a double up at over Charlie Bird let's do that and they say okay I'll tell you what what are we went what what do you want to do you want to do what do you what restaurant you want to go to\n... to ...

commander and chief here's your here's my our commander in chief\nAs well and um that's the way that is and so I just want to do this because the story of the day is the Trump\nThat President Trump was um mocking Christine forward and uh if you don't know who she is you know we have a Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh through his confirmation there's some allegations of some uh\nI don't want to call them ... indiscretions ah [laughter] well I'm realizing\nHow dismissive certain things down but what I Want to do really quick I Want to go back to September twenty eight when President Trump made his first comments about Christine Blasey Ford's\nTestimony very uncharacteristically restrained comments Kevin I thought the\nComments speak for themselves what ... that's a lost they fight song that would be wrong about played that under because I Know Trump is not a Florida State saying he must be a gator All right let us play a little bit of this is President Trump making comments about forwards testimony on September twenty eight together\nI feel it her testimony was very compelling and she looks like a very fine woman from a very fine woman and I thought that [noise] it's testimony likewise was [noise] really something\nThat I haven't seen before it was incredible it was an incredible moment I think in the history of our country [noise]\nBut certainly she was a a very credible with this she was very good in many respects and I think that [noise]\nAlready went okay well I don't know how I feel\nAbout all of that moment I Want to know what people think eight hundred seven someone one or two five seven to seven five seven nine one or two five\nThe alert is a presidential alert and um hold on\nI almost fell for trick oh did you know I had an audio recording\nOf it you know what would happen if I played it for people that misfits ... when when we go to jail in an emergency message\nYou can't plan hell no you know how do you think about it that's right yeah and that's all it really it it will all the alphabet\nBoys yeah let's talk to Margaret Margaret ... over the Kevin show\nYeah hey I'm ... remember man I call it a show before on the one that I Would go
