Hillsborough it's really about Salt Lake county reaching coming together\nUm I Know that they're for instance you're president of the plant city D.C your colleague is a number of our ways one hundred hundreds of business leaders ... ended up coming together to help the effort and it's been a tremendous over the past year we've got tremendous\n... you probably saw about two months ago that weighs a day out that it's on yes of course I ...\nNo doubt or those reasons and a lot more I can kind of continue to go on we believe just based on analysis factor then and also is that the news side is going to draw a lot more people than than the ... side would\nBegin to question you want to yeah Ron we've we've had a couple of different groups in talking about potential\nA sales tax increases referendum ... um you know I think a lot of listeners might might be asking you know what's what's this going to cause them to or are we going to be asked to pay for taxpayers questioning answer that Ron\nIt's a great question and I can I can tell you my perspective on it I'm not the ultimate decision maker I I heard on the eyes I was listening to you that you have to act in the park and Charlie Hudson all talked about transportation to great people who are doing a fantastic job on that transportation is\nAnd I know Chafee ... personally I Know I I've got three kids in the public school system very supportive of what our public schools are doing I think both of those initiatives that are important\nThis ballpark initiative is not really competitive with those is complimentary to them I'll I'll talk and the second about how the ballpark will be paid for but it's important to understand and I know that too if you clearly understand that because what you do\nIn your volunteerism is economic development what a ballpark does brings money to the community and and brings 'em people recognition revenue into our economy which will help sayings like transportation educational how fun that was the other thing absolutely more people\nThe more people that come into Hillsborough who buy something and the more that passed that goes to education and the more that\nWants that goes to transportation the better transportation will have the better education while you're\nWe're not talking about for the ballparks night there's little a sales tax contemplated at all as I understand it no government official I go to Canada the city\nAs ever told me that to the contrary what they're talking about it's not that or that race talking about that and I do think in the dialogue that's been a little bit of a kind of a a miscommunication or a mess a\nCharacterization is probably the better work maybe unintentionally by the community and by the press and and that's\nIn the sense that the press has been done to talk about things says how much of the race is going to put at\nHow much is government got up to that and I think that's the wrong lens to look at the U.S this is really a project and the question really is cannot project\nLong term generate enough revenue to sustain itself no one really wants to city or the county to pay a long term to put more money and all the turnout than their return on investment and frankly what NASA raised you that it's a business we understand that\nWe're not asking them to put in hundreds of millions of dollars with no return on investment for them either\nQuestion really becomes Ken this project generate enough revenue long term to pay for itself I Would expect that the city in the county are going to do things like\nHook up utilities and build player to do what governments do but by ... project I think that the rates are already made it clear that you know if again a matter\nOf their own capital and it's the project and the rest of it I think it's gonna comes from things like see our eight dollars and Shiites ... dollars and potentially bad tax dollars and again I I'm not a decision maker ... my understanding as but these are dollars that are generated in the area and the district where the ballpark you just\nBy people who are freak winning or that ballpark or businesses in that region that are that are benefiting from the ballpark being there so as as a campaign can set in the newspaper if someone comes in the district ... was a hot topic percentage of that ad sales tax but the percentage to live this C. R. A.\nWhat go toward funding the stadium\nOf course ticket sales and things like that from the numbers that I've seen I Believe it's very viable that we can fund this this project itself and become self funding there might be some\nUh issues about how we pay for it today and build up to that revenue because obviously the development in that region is going to follow the ballpark it's not already built out as a region right\nUp at that gap funding is um it's just a a financial issue that the funding it starts all working on it will figure out and I will mentioned one thing that really\nMakes this project is much more viable then it ... it began with an out\nIn the new tax to a yawn maybe later with the the provision in the new tax code that permitted the governor to designate were caught off but she ... them\nIn an Arab county in our city offered up several regions in our county\nThat could and in Hillsboro that could be a qualifies opportunities in homes and one of those that was picked by our governor and ultimately desk you get caught by the president as an opportunity and is this ballpark sight not just the exact footprint of the ballpark but the each surround you know\nWhat that means is that that are significant advantages for investors to invest capital and that what you those investors facing a capital gains tax for instance\nAnd they reinvest uh dollars in them and opportunities like the ballpark so they can bake that capital gains tax for seven years I don't have to pay for seven years and when they do ... they pay Fifteen Percent laugh\nAnd they would have paid initially sure if they invest money in the in the in the ballpark region and hold it there for ten years again between your on your tan is zero it out\nSo there's a significant advantage for people with capital to invest that capital in the ... and we're seeing tremendous response to that loss of activity and lots of individuals who are interested in it\nI think national ... yeah I'm Sorry to interrupt run I think that's important but I really took to really talk about because people need to hear those kinds of things because it just\nSeems obvious but but people or you know they're concerned about having to like you said that they make sure these aren't competing projects and that that the taxpayers aren't paying\nFor a sports team\nYou know it's not coming out of the taxpayers back pocket to pay for something that is going to benefit or an owner of a sports team I mean they view it very simplistic way I think sometimes because there's a lot more you've really articulate and a lot of areas that I hadn't even really thought about that but uh I think it's important to get the word out for them you know in with those kinds of issues\nIt is an analogy indicate it's it's a cop it's a complicated set of issues that intertwined but the reality is any kind of large projects like the\nThat is going to benefit the community it's going to drive economic development that's going to bring more jobs for the community\nIs gonna be a public private partnership and I think we've got to look at it that way as my colleague Chuck site says some clients get that and there's bad that many of us have borrowed money to buy a house and we buy it at a bar that money at what we think is a good keep patio venture straight\nWe pay it off and we own a house Sunday without that debt we may not ever getting homeownership that's a good dad actually manage it properly in this instance if we\nIf we think about that as a public private partnership it's going to have a return on investment is going to drive our money and the transportation dollars drive more money into schools dollars\nCreate more jobs for a more businesses community get us on the national scene or even more than we are we've got got our sports teams already doing that a great thing I Will tell you all went much checking I had an occasion that sit down with baseball commissioner man for you\nAnd I will certainly not hold him to anything but I did already beginning to make pets that when you start getting into the Tampa Bay and it's so\nBoring on now is ballpark you here [noise]\n[noise] yeah that that's exciting I mean that's an important element but I I I I liked the idea and the sound of we get this ballpark build up not the opportunity and the benefits of these local businesses and its\nInfrastructure the wrong word but it's it's it's economic support if you will around the stadium is going to enhance the experience of those visiting and coming to downtown Tampa and the residents in the in the local general area of West central Florida\nComing to the downtown ... area it's going to make theory cleaner nicer newer more activity more to do and it really all those things bring in economic dollars to the to the region and to the area and and they are positive\nIf you if you think about um the significant amount of money and resources and energy and and credibility that Jeff and it has already contributed and continues to contribute to that region mhm west out what your water street\nJust really ready to explode if you think about the prospect of bright line on November seventh as I understand that the E R S P\nBut the Florida ... transportation is a sheep closes right on a ... now do you have to post built rail that will be stopped a hundred percent industry fun it's they'll start rail\nFrom Orlando to downtown to you have to have the connectivity between those two regions\nWith stops along the way I don't know whether it be but the whole likely be in places like Plant City in lake and and so on and so forth along a great tool that can activity there what are fantastic Tempe international airport has done over the past five years and she used to do with\nThe ... method evidently national ... ... how\nWe really as a region as an ada county region I can go on about\nThe development and places like Plant City in in ... county and what's happening in downtown St Petersburg what's gonna happen to the trough site but ... said I'll be ready to go out to be fantastic combining all of those things\nAnd we're about at the end Jake I tell you what four hours goes by fast for me having fun and sure gotta Compton let's talk about and uh yeah it's been fun appreciate ma let me come in and uh that was good a good conversation with\nRon it each state he went on a little bit longer and because because of that we didn't want to interrupt it when he was on a roll so we're going to just be a few minutes and then we're going to be out um\nBut ah one thing I we could comment that you ask them about how to to pay for it and they're saying no taxes are going to pay for that state no sales tax is going to pay for that stadium ... other than he kind of talked about the other ways it will be paid right so\nThere'll be some tax but it's more specific to the areas that how you took it yeah\nIt seems like it's all a little up in the air right now but some of the um I think that they're talking about is like an opportunity zone but the uh the governor you know establish but there's you know\nUm the um what's the local tax those DRA dollars are basically the zone around the ballpark itself is expected to maybe see look\nBut at least at least for the talking about now it's not like what we're talking about with ... cells check on education or it doesn't seem that way I Want one since sales tax for transportation is not going to be like to have you know there's all park\nIt doesn't seem like that's been a\nWhile and he ... he confirmed that the concern that I had about the corporate seats because you have so many more companies and\nOpportunities for a two thirds corporate seed ownership and it sound like that but from what he said that was exactly the case you were spread on yeah we we have only a third right now and that doesn't that don't care to mail it does not work for a professional sports team to have a third corporate seats we flip that go to their corporate seats now you're closer to Plant City you're closer to\nApollo beach rushed can you're closer to a you know Wesley chapel knew Tampa luge you know are all the downtown\nAnd Lakeland just winter haven ... all those areas there's so much quicker even like you said there was a big fan base in Orlando to come right down I for so\nYou know I get it if if if you're not for the the stadium because you think it's going to be just like it is in attendance in St Pete but I honestly don't think that's going to be the case and if we don't have to pay for it with sales tax kinda sheds new light on it\nYeah I think it's um I think it's a big possibility what he said twenty twenty three season what is what they're even\nTwenty twenty three what you think about that it's twenty Eighteen now that's basically the start of the season for years from this April so that's probably a realistic goal I Would think\nYeah so the coach interesting few months ahead of us\nDo you they will be we've got a lot lot going on in your ... a month from today we've got a big big vote coming up in an duck you believe we went for hours and didn't even talk about Kevin all getting getting nominated Jared is making a face Emmy so he wants to talk\nAbout it well I Do I think you want to talk about you know we don't have any time a young man and it's only

month and that is the month of October so we'll be talking more about ah October fest more about the history but loads and loads of beer in fact sixty six thousand barrels\nOn average are served in October fest there's food amusement rise games it's like a giant state fair essentially in huge and we'll celebrate cigar October fest the entire month but first it is imperative that we discuss the war on men we need to\nMake sure our battle fatigues or on we need to make sure that we have our proper military gear on because the\nEnemy fire is coming at us fast and furious and nowhere do we have to find the war on men\nIn the last few weeks we've seen the attacks on judge Brett Kavanaugh we have seen the feminist send the Democrats and are women all over the country\nWe believe her never mind if they even get the facts of the story we believe her that's like saying Ted Bundy mass murder\nUh that's like saying uh Charles Manson\nAnother mass murder we believe we believe he's innocent we believe him or we believe he said before even\nKnow the facts I mean there's just like women saying are men would be saying I Believe Ted Bundy is innocent he is innocent never mind\nAbout looking at the facts never mind about looking at the case in this country we have a justice system that you are presumed innocent until proven guilty that's what makes us different than other countries around the world especially dictatorships four former Soviet Union look at China\nOh you have to do is say yep you you're guilty you're going in the Clinton Gore and the former Soviet Union you're guilty you're going to Siberia for forty years of hard labor doesn't work that way we're all of a sudden if you don't like someone or like something you say he's guilty throw them and put them in Leavenworth and we'll take throw away the key\nWhat has happened this hash tag me too movement has gone and transcended into hash tag every man is now guilty to movement\nAnd what we saw over the last a week ten days going on with the Senate Judiciary committee\nEspecially the Democrats going after capital I don't want to make this political but the fact of the matter is it has become political it has transcended now the feminist movement into politics and do unabated attacks on men\nInto this nonsensical term toxic masculinity every way we look as alpha males as men as a as boys\nWe're all under attack\nBy a relatively small percentage of women in this country is feminists\nAnd what we've witnessed this week where people stopping up and down and crying and marching and and and and and walking into restaurants in elevators look at me when I'm Talking look at me I suffered I was sexually abused well my answer is I feel badly that your work\nBut this has no your case has no bearing on what we're discussing\nJust because you are sexually abused or you were in some way shape or form attacked that doesn't mean that every man is guilty we must look at it as a case by case basis that was you know\nI mean for most of the forty an alpha male pleasure maneuvers and of course says the alpha male and chief I make sure that our voices are collective alpha male voices are heard I stand up for men I stand up for males\nAnd what I've seen the last couple of weeks is just ludicrous people women have lost their minds even men I'm seeing the results of the feminist movement on these what's defied Nablus boys and men boys that\nStart off his was the five boys and become were supplied adult men and we're seeing them jumping up and\nDown and rallying and re most believer and leave us with this is a tragedy we must believe her\nWhy do we have to believe someone let us look at the evidence and the evidence that has been presented and my feeling was that I stayed at this I think last week of the week before let's hear what Christine Blasey Ford has to say she's making this accusation great she also stated that she had witnesses let's hear what they had to say\nBy the same token Brett Kavanaugh has the right to defend themselves to stand up for himself to refute the chargers are the allegations being made against them\nAnd it's very simple fact is that the for people that Christine Blasey Ford bossy Ford however you want to\nTalk to me ... I'm ... I have four witnesses but I mean maybe maybe they forgot thing were there\nWitnesses all said no we don't remember Brett Kavanaugh we weren't\nThe party did not happen but that's not good enough for the feminine is not good enough for the Democrats because this isn't just about toxic masculinity that nonsensical statement this isn't just about the fact that\nThey want to go after cabinet this is about they disagree with the fact that President Trump has the right to nominate the Supreme Court selection of his choice and they the Senate Republican controlled Senate\nCan go ahead and approve that could provide their consent and vote on allowing Kavanaugh to become a Supreme Court justice they don't want the court tilt to shift period that's what it boils down to\nWhat we're seeing now is an owner baited\nOutrageous attack on men when the feminist movement began fifty\nYears ago what did they say the first thing they said as\nWe don't need a man we don't need a man we want equal rights now granted here we are fifty years later can anyone really say that women are being discriminated against let's look at the empirical evidence the majority of college graduates are women\nThe majority of graduates in post a a post undergraduate degrees master's degrees PHD's doctoral degrees attorneys lawyers\nAre women women today you know companies become CEOs there's no limit on what they can achieve nobody's keeping them down nobody saying you have to stay around them in the white picket fence in the house you can't leave the house nobody saying that\nThere are more opportunities for women today in the broadcasting industry in which I'm involved I Will tell you there are more women today that are running radio and television\nStations and in major executive positions\nThan ever before probably more than men\nI mean there are two major broadcasts companies that I can think of too of what struck a broadcast companies measly broadcasting and cumulus media\nWe have affiliates on both of those both those groups both run by women CEOs are women no problem\nNobody saying oh we have to put a limit on how many women can that can service she goes nobody says that nobody says I'm not going to vote for a woman because ah she's a woman nobody says I'm not going to go see that position or go to that story because she's a woman that's nonsense\nAnd it's complete utter ridiculous nonsense women today are the best position they've ever been in\nThere are no limits there is no glass ceiling that is nothing more than a fabricated term that the feminist need to continue their their crusade which is exactly what it is against men\nSo they've gone from we don't need a man to now we must have straight men we must do a mass delayed men\nThey've gone from we wanted equal rights do we want superior rights and that's really what it boils down to today I always get a kick out of out of a ... ... especially feminist they all are ... we want equal rights we want to be treated the same\nYou take a woman out I've never I don't take off a nut case feminist\nThat I don't do but I've got friends of mine said oh yeah I took this woman out you proclaim for the whole dinner she was a radical feminist blah blah blah blah blah and I'm like well why don't you just end the date right there\nHe said well but when the check came all of a sudden they weren't feminist anymore they wanted me to pick up the ... no more equal rights no no no no I had to pick up the check meaning they had to pick up the check so what the feminist movement has gone from we don't need a man to\nBasically we must cash great man\nWe want equal rights too we want superior rights and what they want to do is essentially now they want to ... and ... every American male that has borne period and every male ... adult male\nThis is transcended it has gone from an equal rights moving down with the politics of the justice system and now all of a sudden when you see these people that are jumping up and down and these protesters there was a protester earlier this week in the capital and she was wearing a shirt T shirt with the slogan men are\nTrash now think about that for men are trash\nThat's a blanket statement all men are track this is how radical how ludicrous how nuts they are\nAnd packaging with an earthy Sumatra rapper ... is a is a bold well balanced medium
