was so the the bulldog that\nYou met the other day right there were ten more just like that well behaved just people were loving it as a curious looking dog here's the thing I was only black person they're most right and that's not a problem because I was somewhere I Want it to be somewhere where I was invited to be so I wasn't out of place\nBut I've noticed that lately that I'm I'm\nThe only black person a lot of places I go running including the trader Joe's right here on fourth in St Pete and just walking around and I looked up it's not something I think about all the time it hits me sometimes when I go\nOut here all the time\nEvery time mhm well I'm a middle school class well if I got my high school is like that so what I say to people\nWho don't have that experience just imagine if you were the only white person or you were the only person of your particular race in the majority of places that you go\nAnd you live your life where you have to live within another culture and that culture's different if it's in a corporate setting it's different if you're working for small business it's just different cultures everywhere and you may find yourself being the only person of your you might be the only white dude on the job site you might be the only white dude on Spanish jobs like\nLike whatever that's not\nBad as the exception for most people I have found it to be predominantly my entire life and what I say is what if you had to spend what if everything you saw\nWas black if you are white person you see my I don't think a lot of people understand being in that situation where if you're the only person of color in the situation\nYou're having a different experience and so it's important it's important in everything in arts and culture is important to see representations of yourself or absolutely and that's the only important to those people who are underrepresented if everybody else is like why you wrote my movie up right and we're like well\nLook at what you got from the story of any move this lady so much why wouldn't you want someone else to be able to relate to that story that brought you so much joy\nLike I think there's just lessons that we

would um it's also why have a a great love of a Greek mythology also she taught Greek mythology I was all caught up in the odyssey and all of that a shot up to the ... um so\nThat we went to lose the hose we talked about the wizard of Oz and then she says All right we're getting ready to go back to the movies I was like we don't see it again she goes yeah but this time it's a little different she held me anything about the whiz we go in\nAnd then I see the ways and it is because I'm like wait a minute what what is it that are often Michael Jackson and\nThat's what they're singing and it's like so full and right right and\nThere's so many things like many explosions happening in my brain their states connecting and I saw myself in the whiz but I didn't see myself in the wizard of Oz and I saw\nI Love the wizard of Oz less than two hours ago right but the wiz made me walk out of that theater feeling empowered like I could do something like I could do something magical that I could create something magical\nAnd I wouldn't give that away for any and I want every kid to have that I don't care how you get it but if if it wasn't for people making stories mow your ... your film maker
