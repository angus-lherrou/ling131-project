raiders and there'd be one of the better teams in the late so there is this a score holds up that you're talking about\nThey have confidence coming into into London against the raiders of Maine right now raiders aren't really anything to fear\nYou know what I'm saying around the national football league and of course how about the Kansas City chiefs they do it again today they beat up a really good defense as\nWell I'm looking at your eye pad you look around the NFL its record scoring each week pro football focus has had it for us weak one two three and four are up from last year each week people are putting huge points on the board and you only had ten\nWe went from forty five to ten that I think about that they\nDrop off a huge huge drop off well they couldn't they got to be able to protect\nAnd that's the biggest thing that we have every right you can't protect the pocket was collapsing around them anytime their car one or to look down field he had very little time\nYou've got to give them at least as solid four seconds if you can't you cannot be successful in the metro football league and the charges by the way we're replacing both they're starting tackle and ... could not get a consistent pass Russians the charter that\nI was wondering why not more screams today if you're having such a vicious pass Russia like\nThat because they tried to screens a couple of times but because of chargers are back up and zone they were right there to defend defend it you say never really ... the thing about screens is when you want to have the run game set up and then you want to try to get the passing game open 'til you\nDefenses wanna blitz and pressure you then you want to bring it it wasn't like they had such a vast pass rush that you could set up a screen behind them the charge that a good job of two screens that I saw the owners game slipping a mountain denouncing\nYeah this is I'm going to be I mean going to we're going to London getting they're leaving on Thursday night arriving friday you know this is this is he talking about a tougher turnaround absolute and the raiders or were flying more than anyone else in the league\nA lot right thirty thousand plus miles raiders were laws this year that's the set now Canada will be logged on to win or from the yeah and the gamble replayed at Wimbledon was going to be played and taught and ham and the new stadium\nBut that was completed in time so the game will be in ... next Sunday evening London time of course will be much earlier here in the United states but ah Chris are you put your finger on it they have to\nThey have to regroup and regroup quickly because they don't want this season to drift away for the they they took advantage of some breaks last week against Cleveland when it over time no doubt there first one and this was so important because this becomes\nThe next step if you couldn't put that second winning a row and then you can say okay we're we're getting ourselves back into the chase well now they've collapsed back down again with them\nThe chiefs are playing with the way the chargers to find out the Broncos last today same Donald played very well I looked at a couple of highlights and a young man from USC lit up the bronco Broncos had a terrible time to the east coast time zone or so and the raiders already lost at Denver\nSo now they have lost a here gives the chargers they've lost two games within the division both the chiefs fans are coming up late in the season\nOr whether that's good news bad news I don't know a cap even worse than what what appeared here are you guys put your finger you were on top of this story all gay moment\nI've never heard of home arena was a home team winning the way the charge as quiet which which tells you you went right to the story how many raider fan so we're here today\nOh you had to be a it was a doctor king on the sidelines I knew I was going to be doing a hit with these guys and I said what do you think about eighty twenty goes yes and for me with having a ... if you're the commissioner of the national football league and you're here today and you're seeing this you have to recognize that there's a problem here\nNo question I mean this is you're going to be going to Seventy five thousand seat stadium it's going to be empty every single week that's that's not going to be a good thing\nWell here's what happened in Los Angeles when I Lived here and somebody came in and remind it they\nThe chargers reduced their ticket prices it was less to see a charger game then to see a ram game and that's how the chargers who were clearly the second banana yeah and the NBA that's how they develop the fan base\nThat's what faces the chargers going into that new arena they're gonna have to make it attractive on a lot of promotions and things to fill it up now the rams looks like you know this is team that\nWhile the rams head Ramsey for real Brent you're right about that one thing that I had to that little city there's a new stadium you know how your arm in LA everybody's attracted to the glamour to glitch new things the people come out if the charges have a good team whether or not they do or not the people come out and just like we've seen so far with stuff up even if it's opposing team's fans\nComing out there are still going to come out they're going to want to everybody's going to want to see the two towers that they call a stadium that the rams are gonna be in that building\nThey might want to stay here [laughter]\nNot ... but you know the one thing I quickly is these guys are creatures of habit and what's interesting about when you do a game like this and you're going to London or I went to Tokyo with the age is you throw everybody's clock off how do you manage that as players\nWhat's going to be difficult because you're coming off of a short weekend you're traveling halfway around the world and you talk about leaving Thursday nights\nAnd arriving friday afternoon I mean that's a big transition the only thing that you can say that because you're really coaches want to say get off your feet don't do anything but you're in a foreign country and for those who have never been to London that's easier said than done you're going to feel better than you actually do but when it comes game day it might very well hit you in the wrong way if you're not care for\nTwenty

animals that are specifically trained ate a person with disabilities are permitted within the store service animals are not permitted to sit or ride in shopping carts thank you\nFor your help a spokesperson for public said that always been their policy but the signs are there for awareness who's mad about that is\nProbably the people who have fake service animals who want to be able to keep them in their purse in the car\nYou know I Love service animals but food in animals just don't mix\nCorrect although food animals mix if you're in an outdoor cafe so place this also seems like it would\nBe hard to enforce so I mean I've got my service animal who's got their little vast that even though I bought it off I Amazon for forty two dollars right and then you've got a ... like are they going to be checking papers are they if I don't try to put them in the cart is that going to be okay just seems like something that would be very hard and at times offensive to enforce\nI think that public as well as a lot of corporations are very hesitant to confront the customer about anything so this is one of those things that they can go\nHey look we're doing something about it without ever actually doing anything about it I don't think they're going to confront anyone about anything they won't say anything to you five twenty items in the town I was there last line they won't say anything to you if you don't enter in your credit card information while you're bringing run up\nDo you think the whole service animal thing is is a joke or do you believe in it\nI think there are conditions like blindness P. T. S. D. I think seizures\nUh some seizures can be detected by a by an animal and they can help comfort I think there are animals that can benefit people ... mid medically\nOr at least therapeutically I think it is something that is abused probably more than just about anything is abused in the United states of America right now is that is that safe to say is it\nReally I don't see that many service animals\nI think it's very abused I have I Know two people that I'm somewhat closely related to that openly have a I have abused at their dog where's service animal little vest and they don't need as service animals so I think it's being abused\nThe last couple of times I've flown anywhere it's been\nAstonishing to me how many more service animals you now see in the airport versus service animals that you saw ten years ago and I'm not saying they're not legit I'm just saying there was a hell of a lot of them\nYou want some pop a little pill that take away our pain why can't we bring our dog with us through\nI don't mind sitting next to a dog on a flight if it's a well behaved dog or even if it's not to be the cute little dogs ... I don't mind that I'd rather I'd rather you do that to make you feel better than than pop a pill that's going to turn you into a zombie\nSo then where do we where do we draw that line Mm I mean that that would be the question is is if a if my dog's going to replace a pill then what is my ailment like why do I have a specific moment if my dog's going to help me great point\nWell I think ... if the service dog is actually a service dog or not they are properly trained right you're bringing your dog that you need and fake card for and got a sweater for it then they might bite somebody\nThat is true and then you're going to be sued Seventy seven five seven nine to five to grab alive who might you be\nIts rich hey rich Jew rabble here how you doing but\nMeant a it was called about you're talking about public yeah and uh what the scores can or can't do correct [noise] so uh I I was a store manager for another phone call you a stay at our health care sector\nAnd uh you can't ask the person anything about the dog right but you can ask what sort of the dog ... oh\nSo it's it's a very fine line that you gotta walk right because if you ask the ocean to themselves and they get offended they have every right to see the largest uh yeah basically broke one of the ADA laws\nSure and they know it and the people who have the fake service animals know that ... any manager of any store is gonna be petrified to approach them about it to\nInsult them et cetera so a lot of people might abused that policy I don't know enough about it to say that people are abusing a policy it just seems like there are a lot of quote unquote service animals out there\nAnd maybe those are legit afflictions maybe people really need the help\nWhat what's what's legit though that's the that's the question because I Know when you talk about seeing eye dogs and the dog that go along with a you know people that BP has the um those are they're trained to you know do those specific task if if I have an emotional support dog\nI don't know if that is going to have the same type of training and be as official as as another need emotional support dogs do people\nTake advantage of the system I think they need us support talk or do they just enjoy taking their dog everywhere and that's why they're they're trying to trick everyone\nGreat question I Would imagine they've convinced themselves that they need their dog with them to cope anywhere they probably do so I'm okay with it OK eight hundred seven seven one one or two five what's up Todd how you doing man\nHey what's going on how you doing I'm good how are you great great thank you what can we do for you\nYeah so I Am because I was actually an editor or they just recently ... ... ... ...\nUm I Would ask customers I Would walk up to them and the only question we're allowed to ask is is that animal a service ... and the service animals are allowed in our nature horses and dogs\nBefore there was a show has had a [laughter] you you can't just go right over miniature horses so the only two types of of service animals allowed inside the public's dogs and little tiny horses\nYeah miniature horses are allowed oh All right well so I've seen one person bring in a miniature horse\nWhat a what services that provide for some of the little tiny horse\nThat's at first she got to ask somebody that's allowed to ask that question well it is\nAll right thank you very much I mean for me if I wanted to rest my voice I bring one around that way of someone's like hey how come you're not talking to me I'd go", "show_name": "The Billy Madison Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Sarasota", "day": "07"}
