you get here I mean what do you do where do you go I mean like what are you going to win you get here I've been thinking about this all night\nTo take one of these fly over state\nAnd we have to just give them a state that nobody I don't I don't I don't I don't think I think I think uh I think like a lot of them probably going to Canada\nYou know I think they passed I think they were actually passing through your ... and I don't think anybody looks at the map and be like okay I'm In hunters [laughter] was [laughter] we go up to Canada\nThat's the play but oh you are who whose plan was to walk to the United states exactly who said we was going to do that we actually I was on Wednesday night at three thirty in the morning\nWe all going to get up together we going to start walking to the United states already I'm going to tell you something that I did hear today and it was disturbing I Know Trump was talking hard about there might be some people they're not supposed to\nBe in that they've been checking passports and stuff has certain checkpoint they're fun to people from all over the world sure oh everybody trying to do that's what people trying to take advantage of the anonymity of some African lady from like ... yeah okay yeah so\nI think they're talking about how the word got out around the world you're trying to we we all going All right we have a sense he caught

necessarily the right way [noise]\nBut you can't make seven what ten thousand people just disappear well that that's the thing they're claiming what is it political asylum\nYou think they're going to get to the border and then like lined up to go through the office or whatever I think once they get close to the border where they know America is like right there and they can smell the barbecue but it's everybody's going to disperse like a pile ants [laughter]\nI'm like whoa I going to do that I think so understand something other than if you are a seven year old that nine ten eleven twelve\nThirteen fourteen year old and you have endured this trick you are you are never going to take\nThis country for granted right like the ... some of the people that are born here absolutely not I don't want those people here they are not looking at it like that they need to be well why don't\nWe we need we need soldiers we need new soldiers we need people that appreciate being here\nYeah I I

it's happened to those people in Honduras well we should we don't we don't but we should have a brand that hurricane wipes them out\nAnd their bio human beings and they are all human beings\nAnd who said that they support\nRight that is why do I will say\nThis those people were vow human\nBeings before Trump got elected I just said you know what that's a good point yeah yeah he's not he has made it fast you'll see that we're not to create or he just may be the or rate\nRight he just made it cool to come out of the closet which all races I don't think Trump is as bad as its borders\nOr you know what I agree with that I don't think so you can't trust him he's a now don't get me wrong I think I I think what I think about 'em but I think his supporters to a degree or are much more\nThey are much worse right just ... not like the way it was just horrible\nThere's a lot of anti Trump or\nAnti Trump people that are good I guess just as best as horrible justice ... their action at a news yeah so it's not really a partisan or political it's just who you are the person to person and we are just filled with a lot of kids in this country\nYeah here here that's you know what I agree with\nThat I mean some of these liberals going to be the worst [laughter] ... [laughter] I mean if you're a liberal is a catch all\nThis was what I respect but can I say what I respect about Republican too they're always on message they always they put everything aside to agree on what's most important to them and that's the policies that they're about and then you go to the liberal side it's a catchall from people who just want\nFrom the the the fringes where where they are almost kind of a moderate weather kind of like well you know we want social programs to take care of people to help people get back on the right track all the way to people who are just straight up temple had we had a catchall for all of the crazy right and the crazy on the other side they still own message\nRight we'll be having a black lives matter at rallies like black lives matter black lives matter and if somebody doesn't like and the man [laughter]\nGot to be back not what we really got to be poor but that's not what we're talking about right\nI'm afraid I helped smoothies not going to help the situation in which\nI write a if you're in South Carolina simple to know I'm Sorry Simpson bill [laughter] you are ... percent of civil didn't bill may be real too but not just isolated to South Carolina or you may hold the winning one point six billion dollar mega millions\nTake ...
