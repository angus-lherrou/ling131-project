I think she's dumb\nI think she's done OK well\nShe's not that dumped she went to Syracuse University and she went to law school lesson that she's not dumb as your lawyer yeah yeah she went to law school and she's a lawyer I don't think she's a lawyer but I Wonder what the law degree without ... is a dumb to go to law school and get a degree and not become I mean you have to work towards it I mean it's not it's not even go out the way up through I've done a lot understand this yeah there are people\nThat have the ability to retain information yeah and and successfully pass tests but if you break them down and the sociological situation they are dumb\nNo no but okay what do you say dumb though that doesn't really I I'm not understanding that because I have a hard time believing Megan Kelly like\nLike this whole thing of blackface right like she's never no one's ever in any kind of crowd she's been in our any conversation she's never heard that that's not face the people don't like\nThat and I'm going back to something that you want to bring up later but I'm telling you that if you argue that the fictional character is a certain color you are dumb\nI I don't [laughter]\nSanta Claus doesnt exist so why go on national international TV and make a statement about race that's going to be divisive that don't many others network might have gotten you fired and I lose that amount of money that's\nDumb can I just say that um I think you might have misspoke because a Santa Claus is definitely real I don't know I don't know where you heard\nThat it was my granddaughter and a lot about no I'm Talking about than uh MSN called a ... is that they don't that don't stand\nFor nothing that's exactly what it is or the killer listening no no for everybody who loves that some people love Santa Claus Santa Claus not just for kids now they're not some of us in real life and didn't find out about Santa Claus and it was for the [laughter]\n\nMan they got me man

Jackson I doubt you got a room full of frat boys is Rudy girls and everybody is in blackface there near their favorite black entertainer to be on it I got a problem with that I think the context of that is\nSo you're saying it's okay for a child to be re I honestly I'm saying they have found outgrow it saying that I examined the ... that the town's not racist racism something this\nTalk or smeared on your face [laughter] ah okay wait so it's the parrot puts blackface on the baby right the baby's not racist but the parents the rates I'd\nMake of this what I took a I'd make a differentiation between black face and the costume and I think and I and I think that I think that sometimes\nIt's just a costume and boy function of the role or something like that and I think black face when you put yourself in blackface black faces a very specific thing and that's and that's my I don't think any kind of black face that's black face I have an issue with\nNot an issue but yeah it's it's racist it's or certainly coast signing racism if you uh play into or to buy into hey\nHere's how I feel about it is short and sweet when you dress up like a black person and as a costume it takes away our humanity were not costumes where people you can't play us\nWe're not a thing you can play like you're going to be a superhero I'm going to be like I could go I'm being cos I'm going to be a vampire I'm going to be like me like it's not an option on the scary list I think characters are allowable for costumes you're not sometimes they're not being characters there being a black person\nAnd that's not a guy you know I get that because that the death rate us from Miami ... and ... where people you know try to get away with their like there'll be a black person they'll put like a Jordan Jersey on or something like that and I think that's unacceptable you know what I'm saying Ben thanks for holding on to sober Kevin show\n[laughter] yeah that was a quite an introduction to my phone\nCall All right how can we help you uh well I was just\nCurious I Want to see what's your stand point was um you know maybe seven years ago um early twenties I was a fan of little Wayne had\nDreadlocks I'm I dressed as little wine for Halloween a Halloween party there's nothing wrong with that uh\nI don't consider myself a racist I never thought that was something that would fall into that category\nDid you dark and your scale yes oh I didn't hear that part\nYes and you didn't I mean hey you're free let me just say this about black face is twenty eight team we live in America [noise] if you want to dress up in full all black face however you see fit you have the right to do that\nYeah may the lord be with you [laughter]\nSo you know or the lord how can you know what I mean you don't need a forty below okay they help you in certain areas layer of what are you understand that it's offensive to some people in no matter how much you explain how much you like Lois Lane they're never going to see if anything other than race is even though you may not be racist at all\n\nI I suppose I never never struck me is that part of this conversation though\nYou've never um didn't consider what you were doing being in blackface that's that's probably the thing\nNo I didn't consider that like most that I mean when I take or somebody say black face that's why the whole conversation was that was the last place I think of the old you know older times where where people will take like ...\nYou know and and later on the eyes lips what I mean that's what I\nYeah and as time goes on and there's an evolution of that that doesn't require that could that doesn't look right right now but what looks right now is it's easy to let people off the hook and say they're confused and it's\nI one thing I've learned in radio\nI have never ever gotten a proper death or been able to agree with anyone on what is actually racist because people that all kinds of things slide and they never called that race is I Would like to know what is actually races I've been called races I didn't feel races\nI just don't understand I've been all races to really yeah standup I just don't understand why I have to ...\nHave a conversation about whether black face in any type of way to me it's all just say ... understand if you're playing a person as a character now is low when a
