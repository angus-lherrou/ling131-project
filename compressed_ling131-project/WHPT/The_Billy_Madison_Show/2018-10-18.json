survive the hovering age\nThat I had a kidney transplant recuperated and less than a year started my own show and it was to the day almost almost two weeks or do okay I was twenty almost a month 'cause I got a transplant on the twenty fourth so anyway\nWhen was my point here oh well I Know it it is yeah we started and we've been here\nSince then so what how many months is that three four or five you're looking at about a day are due to ... for you don't want to or I may June July August September almost five ... five my alma five months\nUm some of the very beginning of the show when we first started I remember that's when I started shying away from social media\nBecause I knew exactly what was getting ready to happen\nI knew that the three of us were charged with coming in here\nIn space that was already established and recreating in something by adding me shifting people around adding JR shift to people around also and then putting it out to the bone listeners who already are familiar with it and they're like okay what's going on\nWe know all the players but we don't know I'm In the spots right I shied away from social media not because I didn't feel like\nI was worthy I deserved to ... okay not because I didn't want to take any criticism\nBut if you're a listener and you're a fan and not necessarily a radio professional so to speak it was hard for me to be willing to accept criticism from people who didn't know the unique situation of building a new show on the air with people you've never worked with\nSo it's hard for me that if you say you know first two days on air are you guys up what we should we just started but we didn't suck from day one because we're friends off the air that translated well into a situation that I still have to say I have to give ... credit now\nI wanted to show I wanted to do my own thing but most from day one said that we should do a show together and I keep saying this and repeating it because sometimes I have to re convince myself\nOur our our pets my skin because moguls yo if we had a show together it would be one of the best shows on the radio and I would I tell you every\nTime you said this was after the first time you set in with me on the cat named Moshe right eye and it was a matter of felt great well yeah yeah yeah and every time he said [noise] that will never happen right like I didn't even that would never have usually I read about it\nOr you have to consider ... because I'm just not to have like a man and a half on right now that it never got out of ... ... if I had a dollar for every time you said it I wouldn't even be here right now vice versa that we can pay all our tabs off of those dogs but\nIt's not that I didn't believe in you and it and and then I didn't believe in myself or JR I didn't believe in radio right I I didn't believe\nI didn't believe that it was possible to like get this thing going to get excited about radio again I thought it was just going to be business as usual\nI'm Glad we took I'm Glad we got the opportunity to do what we're doing now and when the promises no we just wanted an opportunity which is a lot of times that's a that's all you really need if you have you have if you don't you don't know what I Want to fast forward to is\nUm\nI wasn't gonna accept criticism\nBut now I feel like I'm In a better place to accept criticism because I Believe the show has come together\nA little bit more as far as the chemistry and us getting to know one another sea mowing our friends Jay our and our friends but we didn't know each other in a work sense which is totally different than a lot of you think we just sit here and talk and we do\nBut it's how we talk it's how we do is the dynamic it's\nGoing what to do in the moment when the let things flow when the fall\nBut it's the whole thing that's happening and if it sounds like it's easy that's where any\nTalent or a chemistry would come in where it just sounds like we're just now more than I haven't talked all day but for the next three hours is gonna sound that we've been talking to laugh at a job at all day from my point is this so I've been in radio Seventeen years\nAnd I've always gotten some of the same critique regardless of my success or lack there of but I mean I've always been successful that ever radio job I've been in like I've always said um every show that I've ever been on\nWhere would I bring to the table was fully embraced was the number one show including this one\nWith that I Want to say I thank you\nBut today let's see if we had a sea of geo was here he was he was still me away from this\nComet [laughter] nah I'm not I mean they are already living this chapter rubbing his hands on his during and blackjack and most of the moon knows [laughter] whether he should step in the wall or they want to be\nI Would add to the theater\nTo watch him while I told you before the show that I wanted to talk about this and also told you that I shouldn't talk about it when I Know I shouldn't talk about it right but I got to talk about here so speaking to someone in the building today about our show\nAbout expectations and about getting to know the listening audience and getting out in front of\nPeople in your new show and you want to get to know people in and shake hands and let people meet you and I said yeah we need to do all of that\nAnd I and I I used to use the term high quality engagement like we need to present the show and the best way possible at all times\nAnd I had to throw out I don't care that we're not show I Do not care see that some people operate they operate at two different worlds you know they parts\nWhose important who's not important you'd have a hard time telling me that our show telling me that our show is not as important as the might kept a morning show here's what I Want to tell you the most important thing on the bone\nAt any point in time is whatever's on the bone at that time in from six to nine this is our space and we're the most important thing on the bone right now my Catholic cannot help us\nAnd despite\nUm how would you ... how would you describe the launch of the show as a project I failed launch a botched launch ...\nExistence that would be a negative [laughter] failed or bonds whether you fly that's [laughter] no no yeah like you know that was one there was no that was one and it just somehow felt sort of expectation\nI didn't like how the show came to be and how it was presented in that whole I went on vacation for two weeks I hated every moment of ... you weren't on vacations\n[laughter]\nWhy he was on vacation [laughter] I don't like any of that was All right\nI don't know if I can talk about it now and November ... free and clear to talk about how that was handled\nI say one more month and then we could probably talk about it right now we already talked\nAbout it on and what you [laughter] got way back machine [laughter] ladies and gentlemen this

like a python almost I thought it was alligator ... wrote it looked like an alligator whether they will ruin everything you've ever hoped injury yeah I'm a\nBriefly a golf game was briefly interrupted by a rattlesnake slithering across the fourteenth hole in St Petersburg Logan ... was golfing that the main grow bay in Cyprus wings golf course in St Pete when he and his friends spotted the rattlesnake on the golf course in the video of it\nHe was every bit as well do they say how how long it was because he was ever been here in the\nI'm going to say to you\nThat snake is ten feet ease ease\nAnd they are just off guard yeah they can barely go I Know\nThe video shows a snake stretching across the green and then pay special attention to the Gulf is taking video of it it was definitely exhilarating he said it's not every day you see a huge rattlesnake on the green now I Am not going to be standing on the green taking video of this may because snakes can\nHall okay not that one couldn't haul like what you saw that was the ... ... it looked like a pick up a python yeah but if he just starts hauling down downhill and\nWell now although also if he's not coiled he can't get you right right right but I think of this a rattlesnake is nothing but a muscle when he ... up a rattlesnake is it most people think people get bitten by rattlesnakes on the ankle or on the cap\nMost people get bitten in the ass or higher because a rattlesnake is capable of striking one and a half\nTimes the distance of its land right so that they can go what twenty five feet he can strike because he's that big right right so he gonna get you know he could get you up\nYeah yeah and then it will be stuck yeah you're right in ... you're right\nUh this came after just last week golfers coming across another massive presidents on the golf course in palm metal jobs a longtime resident of the buffalo creek golf course and this was a giant alligator that according to the golf course usually just mind his own business so there's no need to be a law\nBig alligator\nYeah I worry about a big alligator you need to be not as much as that snake [noise]\nI'll take my chances fighting at alligator that alligator takes a whole different you your dog [noise]\nAlthough the snake bites you with that I don't want to drowning in is he going to get you to death row then you're gonna just

pharmaceutical reps Gulf twice a week\nFor the networking or for the love of oh man\nI fell in love with it it was for the network and I was trying to lose my biggest doctors but um instead I ended up falling in love with golf and then I just had a regular Wednesday and friday I had a regular golf outings for you good did you become out I was good enough to be invited back to play I wasn't ...\nI mean I I mean I play good enough and nobody's really good at golf except for the professionals but you know what I mean John good enough to be out there okay All right they're not going to have a good time while you're doing it not a frustrated at the game\nLet's say when we used to do group tournaments and we do best ball right they use my boss I'm tired\nRight All right on a date line all Lincoln Texas police are looking for a beer Baron who stole several cases I'm going to tell your six of beer from a convenient so I Want them to take a look at this\nPoint [noise] yeah he's on a mission [noise] he looks like you know that looks\nKind of looking like\nWhat he what Peter has got to be I mean look at it as a get out of the door towards the clerk I like those I suspect men also like to pay only absolutely no he'll like cases yeah horrible I Can't I'm like a chance\nYeah uh the police are looking for the beer Baron who stole the case there's a demand so five cases of twenty four can win it for ... plus light from a store in the little ah school road blocks in Arlington\nYellow and you know he had he had a job with\nA million dollars like police say the suspect got away in a gray dodge drug you know what I'm somebody had to get in the park a lot of it oh yeah yeah but again it's like you say but he looked like debo or that follows a let me let me give you a a miserable if Warren sap is Thursday nights\n[laughter] not measuring it right you got\nThat look he's got like\nWhat Bill was passed so I'm the clerk\nI argue [laughter] yeah the news is that you know about it I got to do All right just later\nLet me get that ball and then the police are asking for anyone who recognizes him to call him a yeah that's not happening items I drop and die within about her now he just got fired\nBecause he looked like he was in decent shape like he didn't look like a junkie are cracking right what is this is this\nI'm an alcoholic and I got to have this fear now what what is this man\nThat's a guy getting ready for the weekend [noise] guy getting ready for the weekend I bet\nYou he had really press [laughter] you know what's going\nHere but if you don't ... you won't want liquor wouldn't you\nKnow well it would\nYou don't have access to it in a convenience store though you certainly wouldn't be able to snatch as much as he was able to snap now you know he may he may flip those twenty four packs for you know Fifteen dollars on the street you know when he got himself well you see no and get that right\nThat guy in on the rise and he doesn't look like Iraq I got a bus [laughter] right about that I\nI I kind of need to know what happens with it I just want to know why\nI bet you got back about garage freezer and he just stock up on and that's a man who wants to when he wants to go in the garage and pull of cold beer out of the players don't just steal that much beer like that if it's there you do I mean does remember we talked about this before if you're going to go in and steal something from one of these stores\nYou might as well make it worth it because the times is going to be the time ... right not to beer to wants to one case when you can if you
