open and then I had\nThe mailman come up and the mailman handed me an unusually large amount of mail and packages I had all of my end and the first thing I did I mean I was at the trunk of my card looking through some stuff I turned around and I put everything in the Trump the keys were in my hand I put everything in the trunk and then I talked to the mailman for second and then I got all the mail\nOut didn't get my key\nAnd I'm and I'm and I swam the trunk three times 'cause it wouldn't slammed the first through tax like I was really trying to get closer and so I didn't know what to do I have a bunch of advice I Would say the worst advice I got was Romo I\nI Believe you got the best advice for me comes to call because the color called and corroborated exactly\nWhat I say we can kind of can be wrong cats question for the ... yeah when you closed it how soon afterward was immediately go oh my oh but\nYeah I don't care I slammed down and then they pop back up and then I went back and slammed again and then it\nMhm right yeah but I'm the third time I hit my pocket like like oh I thought I felt my [laughter] and that's ah during the ... the\nReason wasn't closing because the keys were no no no no no no I wasn't going to you know he was in the last ... so what let's just listen to this really quick motels me what's your advice ...\nBy by as well as you take a screwdriver you take a hammer and you pop that lockout\nYou ruined ruined the ... yeah you make up a larger ... a lot you ruined the law\nYou have a better chance of calling a locksmith and paying him to open up and you do wrong\nHow well that's what I thought I didn't know well what most that was after that I go how to keep the trunk loads eases what'd you say don't data bungee cords ... really glue

trunk right right right yeah\nWhy don't you do that because I have a speaker box ah so you went after market ha ha and then I also took the entire backseat out\nBecause I thought it would be a wide open whole like a slide the box around a little bit get my head around the house just a little bit like I was like there's been a little bit bigger when you get there and it's all a barter so all this

don't you want something different I mean if if you live in Florida that's what I have been when we went to Mexico which is the same temperature it's the same thing that will we get here\nDon't you know it's not it's Mexico yeah but I Love to go I Know what you're saying because I Love going to Jamaica but when we're playing in the honeymoon and we're like Jamaica and I was there I was like I could\nGo down to the beach and I think at all not at that movie was if you go to saint Pete beach or you go without just special bikini underwear\nAdded avenue to reimburse you see it in his made oh no but ... had behind why were they ... they had to be a fan by human new data\nAnd here's the other thing you don't even think bb I Do I tell you they want to do something different yeah I Would like to go to the beach and there's no red tag that do that is ... is that happening yet is it still here I don't know I think it's gone oh you think it's gone that means is still yes because even when you can't see it is still kind of like yeah\nOh I don't know I I if I was going to do something\nYou're right you're right that would be radically different than almost any other cruise you see even if you do a Mediterranean even it's all beach related\nLoving my and I'm just saying I mean from the pictures he set showed you're in the ocean but it almost looks like you're\nIn a river because you've got glaciers on both sides of the boat it's phenomenal and yeah but how long is that good for the like ... how long has accrued I mean I I Would much rather look at that right and what I looked at for four days which is just the Gulf of Mexico over wide open I think\nYou're seeing the sun and the palm tree in one area you seen it in all of them it's the same\nAnd plus I mean we talked about this on

and not be the reality no horses that no come on divorces [laughter] I have a family show drink for her son do not want to have you ever see\nWeird stuff like that my child a mother of the life of not my thing was I was ... you know and I tried to get you to go on to know it just it was that you know I I might already have you know if you don't have a sense of why are you like look at women [laughter] that was that well is that well from\nI just want to get into you know what I Can't I don't want to have been accustomed to experiencing something a free Israel to pay for it later on [laughter]\nI I don't even know what I have a bad I I don't know\nYou know it's like you know how good your good I don't think I've ever seen ... um yeah I don't use already done something I don't\nHow it's it's like you with the lottery you say why by a law now that it gives us the why am I looking at a chick that I'm not going to hold on now\nIt's the same thing like the lottery is the head [laughter]\nWas just like the lottery and so one of the million man you found them over here\nRight just like the lottery isn't it the imagination of being\nYeah but with LA you can't talk to the lottery but you can talk [laughter] you got to be there if you if I could buy a lottery or you can add some chance of winning right\nI say yeah OK layers off\nTroy you're going to tell us about the red tide\nOr no Kevin I actually had a question I I heard that shit I was wondering if anybody knows up there whether hurricane actually helped it or maybe it works\nWell that's a great way I was actually um I haven't heard anything on that and I don't even know what the current status of the red tide in this area I don't know what it is right now\nOr you can check it out I appreciate\nAll right well I tell you what if I get the information I put it out on the air thanks for calling I Need to know to be honest with you when I heard that there was red tide in the I mean I'm not I've heard of it before but when I heard it was spreading and it was all over I'd made about that in that I'm not going\nTo the beach until all of that dramas down I Can't risk it man I don't know how that would affect me\nNo not not at all no I don't even like to be like the I think even a perfectly healthy person might want to pause before young vary from their people were like habit respiratory problems and turning on red and ... feet without even getting into the reason\nBeing around it now see I'm not a fan of the beach as much as I Am seafood [laughter] just so happens the closer you get it to be the better the safe for them but I'll be All right on that I don't necessarily need it myself I I definitely would be okay\nSo um it it's still there look this is way too much science I'm not going to read on here because I guess but it's still going on oh is that was\nThat was quite a breakdown of it and you got a leg of the high end ... fired it's still going on [laughter] 'cause I got a\nYou know what the red tide organism Corinne up ... or ... or ...\nI ... yeah you have rail here in the weeds now that's what I that's why I didn't say it I just wanted to go back and go to the beach and get some shrimp\nFish or know southwest Florida reports of fish kills were received\nFor analysis Sarasota County right north east Florida\nAnd then you had some information on manatees yesterday right\nA narrative turn to the sea yeah it wasn't about the red tide them now they just are dumb okay so what what is that last time it was the headline 'cause it's very rare respiratory irritation\n... you haven't read it probably that aren't just from breathing is yeah yeah you can get that for being close to the area yeah I don't see I just don't know how bad it is and I don't know if there's a scale how they rate it yeah well\nThere there was a map right here of where it's bad\nActually what I read it at a red tie you can really make the correlation of being around the girl on that time of the month you ain't really got to be up close to a to experience the effects\n[laughter]\nHey I was thinking as I thought that was it was as if you were saying yeah you every time I area you know they've got day with the eight hundred seven seven one one or two five Seventy seven five seven that one\nOh two five yeah so um [noise] [noise] yeah bad yeah how are you how's your fantasy team doing this year\nStruggle but I'm doing okay considering leaving on bell is my first pick ... you didn't see that come and did you know no nobody feels bad and the government I I I thought he would you know make a statement like players normally do and then show up like he well he did last year and then show up signs and tender\nAnd then go ahead and play I don't really know what he's trying to accomplish on the long term ... ... okay so if you think about like the Steelers with the Steelers and and a URL Thomas who's the safety for the uh the sea hawks has the same situation right he\nCame to work wasn't ... wouldn't practice all week you did the opposite of what labor I did but he ended up playing for the team without a long term deal and he ended up breaking\nThe law and that was the point he's like I Wanna learn term deal because I don't want to end up like this\nGuy and yes his tenders for fourteen million dollars for this year right and his tenure was probably about Thirteen last year so if you look at it he's made twenty seven million over two years right\nBut is he is he doing is he's sacrificing himself for other players behind that's how he's trying to spend\nIf you want a long term deal I understand that you are screwing your team yeah\nWell you're screwing your team but at some point you have to look out for yourself because the average\nLife of an NFL players under three years okay so if you want to play ball you want port team but but but here's the thing that I think it's going to change when they do the collective bargaining agreement is they can the teams have the ability to franchise attack right so what they'll do is they'll just one year one year one year which is great because you make the the average\nOf the top five players in your position right so so he\nHis his one year tender is the average of the top five running backs in the NFL their salary right but it's only for one year\nBut the teams can keep on doing that keep on doing that he wants to long term you at some point you know worked out pretty well for her cousins who got who who's made more money over the past two years than probably Peyton Manning did more than he ever said to me more than\n... so lazy on is getting the cold shoulder because he's a running back is this why\nYes well in a sense because it's been ... running backs don't have longevity that's what I'm ... and and they know that however he's the best that we as a ... he has a little eh but he is I'm a Steeler fan and I'm just pissed because the guy they offered him forty seven million dollars\nYeah that's all I Know\nNo I ... I I don't know how much that give me the real number in the NFL's guarantee right so you can sign a hundred million dollar deal both the important part of the deal is what's guaranteed I don't think this is not work out good for him no and he put himself in a situation where you know the Steelers can't trade him\nYou know ac systems weren't built to last forever especially not in a hot humid
