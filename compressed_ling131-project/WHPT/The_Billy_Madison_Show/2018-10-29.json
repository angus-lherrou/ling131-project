think there are places of worship should have security at this point it's like any public place where you are together your guards are down your Neil you're praying I don't know what how how they particularly the ... and it's not really about what they worship is the fact that they were worshipping they were in a place of trust and that's been violated\nFor political reasons I it's the kind that we're in now it's just I I got a partial that are disturbed or\nBeing man they're getting messages synagogues being threatened they obviously outside this weekend when I went up synagogues not under\nSynagogues of historically always been all markets as ... as well as like Muslim ... like you know Muslim ... nothing even more so you really are\nYou guys probably capitalist wow yeah didn't know that yeah but I Would say in general places of worship\nI don't think people I think people are thinking twice now and I don't have any problems\nAt what what would be the argument for not having adequate security at any place of worship because that's the gets the ideals and the principles of the religion is that what the argument would be we don't feel safe with guns in our church\nI Know God every now and again and keep the little last\nGetting a lot of ... [laughter] he was on hold on cities are going to say the whole the whole first of all the Old Testament was all last week and he was angry and they all in the past it was like I'm a man [laughter] and we had a\nSon in the new law yeah but how Old Testament God when I got on a day or not [laughter] tell me what I heard on you that's true in a salt just for looking back yeah nobody called in they have\nFound we haven't found out okay in ... called the Salt Lake Sally ... gonna whip into a hot biblical ten\nMinutes [laughter] where are you getting revolving around good luck [laughter]\nWelcome to the benefit of states out of retirement a cat name\nOf a yeah anyway uh [noise]\nI don't I can understand the initial thought of yet guns in church but look at the alternative is there to keep something like this from happening correct I think the good lord I think you're a higher power we want you to be alive\nBecause you can't put metal detectors in church I I think yeah and you can't frisk people leaves me right now that are bad luck Kevin you can't be feeling people loving their Sunday Best\nI I'm thinking I'm thinking that that happens in places that that's not a foreign concept I I Know that America\nHow do you feel as you said the church is supposed to be a place of comfort how do you see find comfort after being frisked if I Know that I'm going someplace where I have to be frisked there's some comfort there\nWell you can't control the world but you can't control what goes into that building and I guess we're ... we pat\nYou down and I don't feel comfortable getting on a plane up your pet me that\nDon't know [laughter] but hey I it has to happen\nOkay but let me ask you this because it's in ... is it is it a is it a mixed message in other words everything they tell you in pretty much any given religion lander faith is that God will protect you so if they had if you have to before you can go into the house of God have to be friends then what you're telling the people is\nReally belong there and now you now the ... are going to fall\nYou've got to understand God made me good with the\nDying [laughter] why would you give me why would he blessed on hand I got if he didn't want me to defend his escape you know what the law didn't want you to lay down and just die oh no no\nNo no he didn't bless you with the ability to defend yourself and your family not tell you just Samsung beat them down with the jawbone up an advocate I add to that as they had\nTo be in a way I've been thinking about this all weekend\nI Do think about a lot of discussions we have and you'd be surprised we don't get back to a lot of them but maybe private that tell you that\nSometimes my position bombs on a topic right and it's unfair to us that we give our topic our opinion on the topic we evolved but since the news cycle is one and done I write him to come back and go\nRemember last week or\nYou know like this week I'm Still not register with the Democratic party I'm Still thinking that people should not just blindly do that there's a story about that later where Tanya is trying to get you to do the same thing we believe the same thing but\nWe're trying to do two different ... and I don't know how we can get this together you but I just don't know how but if you want my vote you're gonna have to earn it I'm going to be studying my ballot tomorrow morning over a cup of coffee All right and then I Will be going down to my early ... voting precinct\nAnd I will tell you this will be the first time as an adult voter that I Will be thoroughly versed on every single item on the ballot including judges amendments stuff that's in the news stuff that's not in the News I'm I'm wit I've got a\nGood I'm On top of it onto your instance motor I like that we need more of them\nWell you know a lot of times I'll go in there I have gone in there before and voted for just the big races yeah now politics local man we got to get these cats I\n[laughter]\nI Know what I'm saying we don't get a new within the next ... down get everybody knew was always become\nThe one's Kevin All right let's talk to I wanted to talk to that dude but I'll talk to this dude Thomas thanks for holding you on the silver Kevin show\nMe how you doing brother doing a great for Monday Thomas how're you doing\nI'm doing alright TSA low maybe what that\nMan army you know a top flight security at a world crank\nThat's right now about the wholesaler guard shooting faring in as far as putting the security at churches I really do think they're going to work why not well because if somebody's really that hard pressed\nTo do some damage like that like they did I miss synagogue like they did in Charlotte like they've done at mosques in the past\nSecurity is just\nSecurity might be a miniscule the terror for a moment but how do we know will escalate the suicide bombers where okay you got security here I got a much\nLower the whole bill okay so we're trying to shoot All right so Thomas\nYou're suggesting we do nothing\n[noise] well I mean uh I'm a Christian man I rather a theological and I believe in God and at the end of the day I Believe that God will protect us and when it comes down to it those who guy it was very it's a one way or no\nOK okay time is not going to stop you right there but see that's the thinking that that's the belief that's why would be problematic to frisky Andrew Do anything as far as protection in churches because you're going against the fundamental believe that God will protect\nYou okay well I Believe in God too and I'm In that church now you're going up against my phone to believe that God told me to protect myself God told you to get strapped he saw me to use them time listening Thomas Mann\nJust because ... ... your ... for what you suggested it doesn't mean that we should just do nothing we we look God\nGod wants us to live a good life God does not want to get on he doesn't want us to get done down trying to worship him I think I think you put security in place um because that's what you do and you don't not do that because you think oh well you know if we if we do that\nIf we don't do if we do that then they'll they'll do something else but they'll do something let them do something else man we have to have security it serves a purpose\nOr are you suggesting our security or are you suggesting you just more presence at the front door to try to deter them so because the first people there\nThere's people there there's money there there's all types of things there why when you want to security you've got to take the religious aspect well how are you disrespecting your religion by trying to protect the people that are there to worship\nWell I'm not I'm not saying that you disrespect but like like you stated earlier you know it's been a fundamental belief and this goes way\nBack in history since you know says the Christian Church was started right the church is a place of sanctuary no matter what you do no matter who's asked you you go to a church where you want to be safe\nAnd I understand that but today in churches and synagogues in place of worship people are not safe because people are coming in there with guns you understand that you can still have your faith and do things to protect yourself from obvious threats\nAs much as I hate to say it ... I I agree with you as far as that's what we're that's what's happening in today's world\nOkay ... it it you know for lack of better terms it sucks\nI respect your fat I respect that you believe in your um your higher power and you believe that he will save you but um maybe that's the problem of maybe he'll just say if you will not rest of the rest of us need to be spent thank you\n[laughter] I tell you what Kevin I might not be strapped in the house or the lord but I'll be sitting next to somebody that\nIs really hold on is it okay for you to die in the house with a lower no no no no well I mean if I'm not saying that everybody who's worshipping needs to bring a gun to church but I don't understand what's the hesitation for me expecting to be safe venture\nOut and this and I'm I Am with you I don't have I don't have anything against uh they're being someone there I mean I don't know that the president needs to be\nYou know I'm not talking about somebody like the this machine guns automatically come out when the plate\nIs walking around talking about like one of those flyers that undercover cop you you just have somebody in the pews somewhere that's ready for it to pop off I get it\nTo join us Tuesday November thirteenth for free one hour seminar offering industry and consumer trends data and inside that impact your job site today it's the cash media group home services seminar brought you buy for him and for go to the bone online dot\nCom to register today dot by cosmetic that there is no tomorrow between twelve noon and to be in and registered to wind up here a VIP ticket to Mike ... budget out Maginnis lied on friday night guards medics is located at forty eight fifty one south ... just down the be rich road\nAsian yeah buddy mark how you might not wildly sunny and warm and happy new doubling over they love that I think the next giants and other media reports from Ireland and liability to buy\nMy delegate indeed teachers in my life where like in like in my della county burgers and right when the pollen on you have to be up a little while they might get stationary\n... we had to\nDo a little bit you know to listen to the most recent episode to Johnny B should replace twenty four seven so you have no excuse to miss anything\nShown back to the show brother Kevin show\n\nI have an\nAnimal [noise]\n\n\nSaying well the\nJust the way it is you know what I'm saying you can't really\nNow over the Kevin show on one or two point five the bones sometimes I feel a little blues\nMan in afternoon I'm wrong with that you know they say by the blues was nothing but a good man feeling that I heard that yeah well yeah you listen to the blues you get into that blues bag every now and the amount of every now and again I Do my friend the a drink of choice does it depend\nOn the ... and all we always bourbon\nAnd I know you have you know there's a maybe this bourbon for this occasion when he goes yeah the blues\nScreams knob creek to me for some reason OK okay yeah yeah yeah that's yeah that's a man\nUm is it possible sometimes to listen to the blues even when you don't have them just sometimes to remember oh absolute like you're so thankful for the good times it's sometimes you have to like just Dickey tell back into that big that it just sticky tell him to just to see what it feels like a a little bit sometimes\nKevin your [noise] you learn more from sadness when you revisited after you're happy yes\nYou do take that to the ...

I Can't do that [laughter] ... yeah but you could make that you can't spank him say Mabel Mabel ... Andrew thanks for holding on this over the Kevin show what's going on\nYeah I just I don't know if I had more of a question of the state but I I don't understand\nWhat ... what was going to happen with these people you know the the the show that the the black church it was a North Carolina or something like a yeah Dylann Roof\nRight what's going on with him because I I bet you usually the so eating three square meals a day you know nobody has heavy consequences I think you have the consequences you agree\nOr do I well I haven't caught up I I I Am not up to speed on the court case with a Dylann Roof I don't know where we had on that I might have been suffering I'm well I mean I guess not yeah compared to yeah I guess he's not suffering but I really don't know what he's doing I'm\nRight and then you know the guy that was the the male the packages of the bombs wouldn't they caught up with him he put his hands up but he's a lawyer that they know what to say what to do not to get you know you know beat up by the cops\nAre or not to get shot or something that they were just there there's they've got to me right\nWell and I don't know if anybody's cracked the code on how to not get shot after a mass shooting we're right you're right but um yeah I understand well Andrew I understand it's a it it just seems like things are just kind of escalating especially with the older she'll be\nShould be heavier consequences and people will probably won't want to do stuff like\nThis Andrew and all that yeah I was gonna say on the ballot or there is a a an amendment that is to protect victims and give them some of the same rights that criminals have make sure your vote\nThe right way on that one out which one I Wish I could remember why you're throwing out I don't even know because somebody will tweet at us and let us know what the amendment is that we want to say it's amendment seven but I'm probably wrong\nTo say\nYou got to do the opposite\nOf what I think it's three and a lot of\nMy favorite show I just want a turban thank\nYou very much good well we can do your favorite even though we're not the most accurate [laughter] we're not accurate at all it's an amendment I can tell you that I Know three's the one about the casinos\nOut ... no no no more about what yeah I'm going to go to the victims rights just give me it's just the Google comes right what do you know about this thing most\nWell it it allows you as the victim to have a say in whether they get paroled or not you also get to speak and it's it's a couple of different things it's real good it's good for us for victims\nTo get their weight sounds so I just I don't really think about it I told them study and all the ... I think you need to Leah ... look at all of it but listen but what I'm hearing from you and most people don't study these things they hear stuff I haven't studied you know but you on the radio you threw it out my you know could be wrong but what I heard was\nThis amendment you said that after if I Am ever charged with anything and I do my time the last minute someone could come and try to stop\nNo no no no no no no no no no no no no no no I'm afraid to\nOut and about [laughter]\nNow that's not what it said did you find that they are yeah it is a amendments six I'm just trying to I'm just trying to find the one that's ... I was one of them are reader friendly and I think that should be\nVoted on well Andrew Read up on amendments six everyone should and make sure you both the right way which I Believe it was for it yes\nWhat the right way a way of what it says those for a proposed by the constitution or vision a proposal for I'm a bit yeah so victims rights a core and law enforcement keep victim and families abreast of what's going on during the ... during the prosecutor process and\nThey're not getting that now they may not be as this is what I was part of its rise to learn how many\nRights the the perpetrator has over the victim we our system that tends to protect the perpetrator more so than the victim\nAnd perpetrator is not a perfect their perpetrator but they're not convicted yet but they know they did a big no they did what I understand that there is a victim yeah but we haven't figured out but who've done it yet sometimes with a\nMan will come up no we don't know what I really don't know what you're saying we know that we're doing\nWhy we knew what people don't look wait a minute weather\nService like oh no I mean I don't want to do and that's what\nShe's a grandma [laughter] pet you know about what's up\nHey I just wanted to talk about the amendment that they're talking about right now ...\nThat's not what it says on the line pat oh no it was I think he probably hung up and not okay I'm ... I'm Sorry go ahead amendment six pack yes give it to us\nA Pat Pat or you talk yeah yeah name's Michael okay I'm going to say oh I see what's down yeah Michael tell us about it\nYes so you got to be careful with that amendment has hidden down below and the second paragraph or third paragraph or what it also does is it changes the uh require retirement age or the judges from Seventy to Seventy five\nOh wait no no no you don't understand we're talking about victims rights victims right yeah ... yes\nRight right hidden inside of that amendment is something that's like oh there's\nMy my what do you mean they they put some ham and there's some pork thanks\nSo I think it might be full of it yeah definitely research\nAt home yeah so so see here's what happened to see what it says All right Michael thanks a lot so what's happening mo is\nVictims right you want that right yeah of course we do here in the you know if that goes the way you want it to go that would ever say not going to go to way hey kid who why politics has got to be so [laughter] we we've just been one good thing because it's a good thing we\nHave we got to the tricky I go hide something I just retired at what the hell does that happen in that can't be true true I Would ask me that a lot of scratching out with a big\nA fall in college I I'll give you a pass on that but a ... a couple of years in Grand Cayman or gay like you've got to have that right [laughter] you know we'll we'll all I experimented with I had a boyfriend or a dog yeah you gay\nHuh they're interested in it\nYou get all this from a a a library All right\nKate defect voter you'll go with the [laughter]\nYes Hi I'm unclear about amendments six yes ah the victims' rights and I really think it's very important\nEspecially in today's world with what's going on and who cares about the judge's there it's a mandatory law about the judge's retiring I Believe seven day\nAnd they're just pushing it up to Seventy five and a lot of judges what happens is a ... ... if they're in the middle of a case or something it's not a good thing if they have to retire so through a ... and they're also saying in that\nOh well what part of it is that they if they are in the middle of something that they can extend it like until it's over you know so\nI think it gets very important about victims I really do\nYeah but ... if that's the case\nWhy they bundled together because I might care about one and not the other\nThat's why they bundled together so they can get the one that they know people wouldn't vote for to vote for I think that's very highly deceptive hideous but we got to protect the victims can\nYeah I ... I think so and honestly I'm going to say one more thing I'm Seventy years old most people think I'm fifty five or are they serious ... you sound like I take a little us and so you're saying that you know people shouldn't drive after a certain age I Know you've got hit around a lot\nBut I find that if I Know we have friends that are in their nineties I don't believe what I was\nGoing to wait a minute wait right now I'll tell you this gate now ... ...

life oh listen I agree I think it would and that's the stuff coming at you know this stuff that's coming at you you don't even know about because people won't even at you\nI Would say this that it is it is shortsighted and an erroneous to blame Trump for just as much of blame to Iraq there is as much a betrayal and rhetoric and and the vice of conversation right so I mean from us\nAs you can point to to the leaders at the top the other thing is\nYou are not instilled in a year's time [noise] with enough hatred\nTo walk into a synagogue and and shoot multiple people that's been\nYou've been on

saying yeah look for him like oh you're a leader and he doesn't necessarily come out and say I don't want to know what those big yeah he's not saying that yes he wants to vote for\nSome people are just some people are just looking for what they feel is acceptance to be who they have been for a long long time and\nAnd he feels like he asked permission to do that because we all know racism in the division and ride I started with oh\nGod if he's feeling like he has permission he's not just a feeling that he's getting their permission from the presidency getting that permission from the nation at large\nAt the same time you can't just blame the media because the media is covering what you are saying Oh absolutely absolutely and and\nThey have the clips yeah so it's not like you can be taken out of class\nThat I said this on Saturday I said the abuse if you blame the media what you're saying is you're too stupid to be able to disseminate what is fact from fiction what is opinion from a actual action\nThat's what you're saying I don't blame the media because I Am able to cognitively approach to story when nobody figure out the fact but most people here are headlines next mood that
