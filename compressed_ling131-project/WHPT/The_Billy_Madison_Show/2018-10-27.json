{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WHPT", "content": "Bombs now this happens and without some uh you know serious change these crazies who are not Trump's fault but these crazies are going to become more and more prevalent\nWe are a decade from seeing the any any change that we might we might have\nA problem we had we had I think as a media feeds into this and I just feel that\nI ... I I don't know that I don't agree with that the the media all the media is not did he make up a story about guy so not hiding bomb that now they're out in the end you know they\nThey feel that guy's his temperament and his environment of this world is coming to an end because of this president or whatever and it makes\nPeople what they are just but they're just here for their reporting what's happening in the media is not making making how ... do you really believe all I Do not I I have not seen I've not listen or can the media the virus the media can certainly be biased but the point remains that whatever they're reporting on\nActually happen there spin might might be a to drive you to believe one thing or whatever but without the actual event happening they don't report it you you know what I'm saying is that the only way out in the tail how the tail wagging the dog\nRight right but that spin is is very very strong\nOnly if you need to hear that you're only if you're an idiot and we are a country full of idiots\nBut I think that there are people that are very very uh capable of watching the news and separating the spin and the opinion and just absorbing the facts\nOf what happened in other words I don't give a damn how the news spends a the pipe bomb incident and if they try and bring politics in the ... the heart of the story the heart of the matter is that some idiot is mailing pipe bombs to people right so it has to be aware and and you have to be accountable\nTo be if you can't blame if you blame the media what you're saying is I'm In the idiot because I cannot determine what is fact\nAnd what is fiction based on an opinion that's what you do when you blame the media you say I Am not I am not intelligent enough to absorb information and filter out the parts that are not\nGermane now many people are actually filtering out the infamous seeking them on a lot of like a lot of smart people are a lot a lot I Can't concern myself with the idiot that they're going to ... go ahead\nDo I I got a ... get out of it but here here's the thing that that ... and I can hear the speak and I already getting on social media that yes the Trump did say those things and he did\nCondemn in one sentence and then the very next sentence he talked about it's all the media's fault and not only did he say it's all the media's fault but then he said\nBombs in quotation marks like they weren't real and made it in your window like it was about now if he had full stopped at the speech she gave a right after the the the bombs happened where he condemned and full weight of the American government et cetera et cetera Folsom period great\nYou're my president thank you yeah he has ... but there's like there's like two Trump's right there's the Trump teleprompter Trump which is the president we want to see and then there's the entertainer\nWhich end this entertainment is not getting\nBut they're not what I mean who knows what I Would say because I just I see your anger you gotta let it go because when you when you're when you're brag let it go you know when you break it down it's not Trump out there doing anything these people have that within them and we have to address why they have it within them because it didn't start with Trump\n... rarely\nAgree and I said that it's not Trump who's directing the product of mail bomb drawn to the mailbox bright but he is fueling the divide and to give you 'cause 'cause you think it's by chance that\nAll the people on the bombers list or people that Trump has been talking about okay I'll do that that that look we can go on it do you blame a politician forgiving the people what they want\nWhen it no I I don't know I don't but let me genuine but when people are dying\nPeople to mount genuine when people are dying right ... if I said something and continue to say something and people started dying for president I Would take a hard look at the in my in the mirror at home and say what what's my responsibility as as the leader of the nation you're part of the minority\nWell you're you're part of your part of the more I think we all are or how we will be made me write about them and show Mike real quick I mean I I'm late now go ahead real quick buddy\n... this is my second call today\nBut I'll tell you what the bleeding liberal you\nGotta I gotta stop you there I got to stop you there I I ... that's exactly what the issue is that I can have a conversation with someone that that condemns liberals Android that condemns conservatives if you want to have an intelligent conversation you have to divorce yourself for the ... the\nThe ah the language in rent and I always have called yeah yeah everybody heard of both say on both sides about twenty four yeah it's ... it's all got to live on both Joe go ahead real quick\nCan't be all get along with it is both sides but like he did say if they were playing at ease in blaming the argument you can't just keep brushing up a fire in blowing more oxygen into the fire and making that happen and then expect a different result he keeps doing it it's over and over and\nYou know what I get to a to a degree I look at Trump as just reporting on what the people are doing I I don't think he's fanning the flames well what I think is saying oh that's kind of pretty [laughter] that's what I see if\nThey may well here's\nFanning the flames east dividing this country is a\nBuyer okay I Will give you this I Will give you this because I'm not blind\nTo I Will give you this ah they're our actions there are words there are instances where you're absolutely right we should expect more from the head of our uh our country you're absolutely right I I Will grant the\nBoth the good fight all rise and appreciate that Ben I

trade markup has thrown its use with permission\nPresident commits a ... as a commits a murder or I don't think we need to wait for the impeachment process if you put 'em on charges of murder he's got to be gone so the ... the criminal charges would help facilitate the impeachment more so than the impeachment would help facilitate the criminal charge you know what I mean\nSo I don't think if you commit a crime\nI don't think there's any position in the U.S and that's what makes us us there should be no position in the U.S that if you commit a crime you are immune to prosecute\nNo and and I agree so so let's just say hypothetically Miller's investigation comes back to the president knew he was involved here to cry and whatever you want\nSo then you would hope that it would go to the ... the house first simple majority then peach and then it has to go to the center for two thirds right right and then after he's either a after he's at office then ... then they pay the piper then faces like his uh aren't\nPaid by you can be even you know he was suspended without pay\nWhat this what I said I told my friends are doing this for this whole system that we're watching like no right I guess we I think we could all admitted ...\nWe all do oh okay so if you didn't really think about what we're watching it's disgusting it is okay 'cause ... he's a president who was that judge in because he's ... himself\nOkay so if you're if you're investigating me I shouldn't even be able to talk to you shouldn't be able to affect my own investigation right so that's what he's trying to do and when every all the Republicans are saying if the Democrats doing this truth to it is it's\nA ... and it is is a circus that it was like let me tell you something on end and why I have a respect for flake because he ... I think his motivation behind it was\nTo at least bringing the country together a little bit ... because it's good because here's the thing is if they had voted which they did and and then it goes to the floor the next day it would have been terrible they would have been terrible for\nThis ... this is why don't give flaking I don't give it like any props because flake released a statement that said that said I Am voting\nFor Kavanaugh you don't have those two women are costing him on video then he does not call for an invalid he was when they're backed him in ... and it\nWas a very powerful moment and there's no question that they matter to change his mind but however he got to that decision whether it was a whether the eleventh hour would you rise because they were about to vote and everybody flake and the Democrats going on in the back room\nOr whatever whenever he came to that decision it's the right decision I didn't say oh I have two people and you even said it ... maybe three\nBut you have to people right now we're the only ones allowed to testify right ones on to ... percent certain that happened the other one's a hundred percent I'm certain that hasn't happened yeah right yeah you have to investigate the yeah I guess you can't there's no I don't think there's one person out there that can say that she wasn't a credible with\nI I agree but there'll be a lot of people that say he was he was a credible ... I Will\nSay listen I don't know that as much as always he was stepping a lot of stuff she didn't ... that she didn't I didn't see if he didn't go back\nAs she in fact I I I wouldn't I wouldn't have is\nWhen you're talking about an allegation of a violent nature the shaking woman\nSeems more credible than be angry guy no question I I\nI when I Would say that now I'm going to be okay but not all going back around to ah why I think people are having such a hard issue a you know wrapping theirselves around this and it's because there's no comprehension anymore I I just put on Facebook and not put on a toward it because I was like everybody is so concerned about everything I think the quote was a\nI Would like that you know one here and give it I'm going to tell you\nWas about ... and I think we care too much about things and the way you act like ... yeah yeah you yeah you're right about that we really don't really care it ... it really don't you know as we really don't know we we we care about ... what we yeah we don't we don't we don't want to get rid of them which is a great example\nOf member Michael Vick was thrown in jail for fighting dogs no matter how pissed people about dogs I have never heard a story about dog fighting since now so they're just passed that he did it\nAnd it was the worst thing in the world he can do but it's still happening today I I was going to get from my ... my truck right and I said hey I Need to get this guy said I wouldn't sign of wood and there wasn't a back country and they were fighting dog girls like what still going on and it's going on and nobody cares that only care when Michael ...\nI I listen I'll give you a more recent example is welcome back to me you know to the Congress I said well you know what I say hey All right [laughter] right yeah yeah there's always these as the pretty mad I'll give you more reason example the Nike cabernet they die\nEvery body weight and not not nobody miss nobody gives a damn they don't and I was making my now you're getting paid ... are getting paid to the wind out of all this opening up and\nI said that as I said at the beginning you still do your busy winning yet he's on he's on the cover of magazines when it's when when he can't play football anymore right you're going to he's going to get a he's going to get his own show now he's going to be ... he's he's creating a movement and he's not even saying anything\nI ... through ... and the other thing that I'm playing football the important thing to understand about Phil Knight is I think it's fair to say the smartest marketer in the history of the world he doesn't go\nWho without weighing the consequences of this thing I mean it was vetted anyway he knew exactly\nWhat was going to have it was on the ... yeah it was so funny that people post on our bone Nike's gonna lose billions on housing and stop went in all of a sudden they would bet it's you know no one no one understands any\nThan the ironic thing is that came out that a Nike is giving more money to Republicans since then they've given to say oh yeah because the Democrats like to get money away [laughter] Robert\nAh go ahead you're on the guy they most of them with a buddy\nAfternoon ...\nNature of the indictment on ... go ahead go\nFar beyond a just a simple or accusation from a lady who was sexually or is it goes even further um and it goes even beyond what I've been just mentioned and cronyism between the executive and the judiciary branch of judicial judiciary traditionally or whatever you call it\nOkay so the bottom line is this guy is a member of an elite fraternity and the University of Yale or Yale University a known as the ... which is they say Tadic\nFlex it is ... ... a ... society when it comes down to the cigarettes a rail deal Holyfield the bottom line is ... is known for some of\nThe most bizarre exclusive satanic ritual is that I'm sort of shenanigans that you could think of now we all over the world with this guy this guy who probably had sex with people and confidence\nSupreme Court justice [laughter] I used to\n[laughter] okay well thank you bye [laughter]\nBut just I mean look I think they're out there they're they're they're out there and Bob leading the way out there is a secret society yeah it's called the ... but the point\nIs that I I think the bigger issue is his integrity right and he plays and I thought he'd been is what I talked about the ... and this is the biggest problem I mean\n... let's just say he didn't do the sexual assault right okay let's say comes up I don't think I Would love to hear people's thoughts on this if you truly believe his story he's saying about his drinking\nRight and how he played it down how he perjured himself about devil's triangle okay Google's devil's triangle it is not a drinking game where he said it was right or his\nSecretary some yeah I I didn't know that it you know our booth look it up yeah it's not about your stomach drawing a bright um alumni as it's not\nAbout ... different definition for everywhere and to me and and it you know the crime is usually not the promise to cover up right right and so he\nPut himself out there as this choir boy on Fox News with this network that he helps old ladies out and have you know does that had no time for all this other stuff and and how he\nDownplayed and straight out lied about his drinking right okay so on that basis alone where you're supposed to be on the Supreme Court with integrity and you don't have enough respect for the processing and how much it means to be under oath that you're willing to tell lies just to protect your image is a problem\nI I agree but I Would say that he's probably not the only Supreme Court justice a or the or judge that that live in other words and everything you said is one hundred percent absolutely true I don't I don't consider it because it's out of my hands are in other words\nThe people that are going to vote on it their opinion on whether they are willing to allow certain peccadilloes or ah or flaws\nThat's up to them it to me saying he is not worthy of being the Supreme Court judge is above my pay grade\nRight boy I I guess I'm Sorry in really good I I guess the point is I you know obviously being liberal I Would have no problem if he wouldn't answer the questions talking about\nDrinking heavily in high school and college and having memory lapses right right I mean I can relate to that that's okay I mean that doesn't disqualify them now for ... you know for drinking too much in high school and college who didn't write to lie about it\nI think he'd be humanize himself and I thought that I don't get what he he was trying to say I'm Better than every button right okay this is if I ask you a question did did you assault that young lady at the party and if your answer is I went to jail yeah highly of the class I had this I Do\nPresident has every day almost twenty yeah if you get to write a president who was above everybody in our world has twenty\nUnfounded allegations I like to throw that out there now let me ask me why you look at I was like a let me ask you this doctor D a and and in in the back was you actually agreed to that even if it were found out to be too you wouldn't have a problem with him being appointed but what about the fact that\nSay the FBI investigation finds irrefutable prove that had happened\nDo we discount him not because of the incident but because he perjured himself is what are you what do you think about\nThat I you know he remembers it\nNo no no just a hypothetical they find irrefutable prove and he is now perjured himself do you want to discount him as a Supreme Court judge on that basis not the not the bases of the incidents but the fact\nThat in front of Congress and then I have a problem you know if that's\nIs what does he ... himself he's if he said he didn't do it well this is not a black and white thing right now how old is black and white and I said no black man it's not actually the white male and the only white absolutely not go out as he's an sorry is this black and white\nHis name got smeared all was everybody else's name when I read it it was just an awkward Indian guy on an awkward they I Will give you an alligator allegations are black and white\nThey they they they say if sexual\nAssault occurred ... law that these are already did something that was well what I read it I'm like you didn't do anything that I couldn't of done I guess there could be some gray areas where there were no no no I think\nThere is important to say there's levels of sexual ... okay so there's you know look in high school\nWhen I was making out with a girl and I reached for breast and she may be like in my hand down and I went again right I mean today's world at such as that goes ... okay now that's that that there's different levels I think of that and tying a girl down in holding her down\nYou're listening to one or two

master brewer how do or how does one say you know what I Love beer now want to brew it\nI don't know from the master brewer but I Do believe there for a living and loving very much um my career kind of started out as a hobby that spiraled out of control into a career\nOr like many people they they ... beer and then next thing you know you're a professional\n... here at home for many years of working kitchen since I was Fifteen um decided to the son that I wanted to do full time went to the Siebel Institute of Chicago and there's just a school dome and Nick\nAnd I worked for Thirteen Years for a company called the iron he'll brewery in the Philadelphia area okay I'm open for their locations before I a jump ship and came to live in this place\nAnd how did you ah a hook up with a ...\nUm I was introduced to Jay Paul through a close friend of mine Katie he's the head brewery at ... right down the street\nGotcha so uh you made the trek from the great white north down to the sunshine state and\nThere you go and I should say the aromas here this is interesting because it's not just like a a brewery you've got incredible food here\nAh and so you've you've really married\nThe food aspect with the beer aspect are very popular place in the short eight months that cycle brewers has been open yeah so far so good we have a lot to the rubber and fun or you go it's all about uh enjoying the good life and certainly beer cigar October fest part of the good life let's talk about first of all a beer\nThe ingredients that we talked about basically there is a barley\nThere is a wheat there is water there is used to talk about making beer the basic ingredients and the process\nOkay um so those are the four main ingredients as you said um we start with what you call it match said crack open the has the barley in the week you still getting water for a certain amount of time and what you're doing is you're converting converting all starches into sugar\nReason you want to do that as the east which is a life force the beer can eat starches Kenny sugars\nOkay which creates alcohol so after you converted you straight out of the liquid from the grain into cattle you boil it you had the hops which are basically the spices and beer that give you some bitterness and bounce out of the sweetness\nAnd also flavor aroma I'm cool it down you put into the tank you had the east east hates the sugar producers alcohol is here too\nThey made it sound very simple but it's really not that simple because it does take time a stock there are two primary types of beer there's loggers and ... what are the differences\nAre the type of east used to say is that there's two families he uses a delight forces the beard is you know it's a living thing is used for baking for making spirits and special ones for making bread or but the two main families or loggers nails lotteries likes to\nTo work very a cold and slow and it affects the flavor of the finish beer very balanced and cleaning Chris I'm Ellie east a little faster and warmer and produce a little bit more the spices and a free characters and ... and ... and such\nNow el takes longer to brood than it does lawyer correct um\nL L for men's quicker than the loggers lottery started yeah the other way around it takes a long time that's why we see many people that are home brewers they do ales they don't do like soccer is much more delicate okay loggers what a top fermenting or bottom fermenting or that his bottom from bottom for many in the air was the top fermenting she'll give us a time difference between ale and like\nUm for the same here same alcohol content to average it'll be about two weeks or the same loggers about for\nNow many people think laughter is a milder a beer than an ale is that correct I'm\nIn a way it is more different it's more cleaning Chris you have less of a fruity spicy character as tears in her own as you get with typical ales\nAnd so when we look at most of the big selling beer we talk about Budweiser and ... and ... those are primarily loggers such and then the ales which we've seen really a renaissance on the craft brew side\nOf those have just exploded no we talk about ALS there's some there's a pale ale then we see like a what a red tail and then there's an ita India pale else talk about those differences\nUm you know there there are other there are always saying based in a way they're being seen you face red tail you're having a lot more of a ... sweetness that's going to be your primary flavor and how people associate with that beer the pale ale and ... are really characterized\nOf hops so happy for bitterness flavor and aroma\nNow I ... back before there was a refrigeration ... weren't the hops the TAs created to preserve the beer correct in transport back with the British are merchants way back yeah\nThat's true it was basically a beer born out in that city and they use the hops as preservative for that long voyage um you know from England to India and um you know when the\nWhen when all the soldiers got back to England they wanted their India bailout and they wanted a stronger happier beer 'cause that's what they had been drinking yeah kind of birth textile\nWhat are the most popular bears around the world is getting us which is what a stout out yeah so we've got stout and porters and everybody looks at those their dark thinking it's going to be super super a strong and that's not necessarily the case you know\nThere's less alcohol and Guinness and there's an Budweiser\nI did not realize that so what's the difference between a talk about a ... an importer\nStanton porters are both ales they're very similar um I think especially the one thing that makes him to the Porter and his doubt as his dad has a roasted barley Porter doesn't but they both had the dark mall and the roasting Neddy coffee chocolate character to them\nAnd we've got a couple of those supporters in ... in the beers that will be sampling I'll go with that list in just a moment also another beer that's become very popular we fear tends to be a little bit softer ... on the Palin yet we're seeing more of that\nEspecially in this climate down here um you know more refreshing um softer and you know see it for warm weather drinking\nWe have seen an explosion last got to be ten Fifteen Years in terms of craft brew in people\nJust like cigars they want the boutique cigars and they want new varieties and new tastes and uh and styles and for many years it was\nBudweiser it was ... was Miller was perhaps some regional beers you didn't see people drank beer they were they stayed towards one brand\nIt was really more of a commodity and they're not Fifteen Years ago we started to seek ... come in a different crowd where people said I Want to try things that are different that are unique I Want something more flavorful a little bit more complex\nAnd all of a sudden this craft industry has just exploded and it's changed the face of the beer industry permanently\nAgreed um I think you know a lot of industries craft in general not just here I mean you know Twenty years ago how many different kinds of coffee could you get\nRight now you see ... types that Iran or you know everything and speaking of Brett I'm Glad you brought that up and I should say that uh we're conducting cigar October fest mega tasting maneuvers from these radical works in the heart of the worst city in cigar city of Tampa ball Rutherford master brewer\nIs our guest this entire cigar October fest mega tasting show talking about a a bread than and some interesting case\nFound this which I thought was really interesting there is a couple of things number one is planters\nPeanuts has unveiled a new beer called Mr I. P. A. nuts and they've teamed up with a new one whistle brewery to create their first beer brewing with\nWalk up to an ... hops delivers a citrus aroma any hint of Audi roasted peanuts I Would think they probably want to drop the honey rose to be another is right in the beer so that's kind of interesting yeah ah and another thing that I saw\nThat there was actually a company\nThat if I can find it here that is actually starting to brew beer from used bred mhm so you can really make beer from any rain correct um or is that kind of an experimental really way out of here um I think it stems from a old Russia America can boss\nWell here it is it's called a\nIn Canada yet a and it is a shuttle recalled second harvest they've route five hundred cases to raise funds and call attention to Its Food rescue efforts throughout Canada the beer is called been a slice B.
