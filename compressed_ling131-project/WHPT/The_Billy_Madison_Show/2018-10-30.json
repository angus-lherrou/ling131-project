All right I'm I'm trying to win okay that was all I'm trying to\nDo ... let's see here is that you know here's what I wanted to say noticed I\nI told you I did the research on the amendment right in the ballot\nI didn't suggest who you should vote for I don't know I think jazz you read it because you need to read it for yourself and see if it works for you don't be lazy you gotta do to work so I'm not gonna if you're telling me you're voting or you have voted then I'm excited about that and that's the energy I'm trying to put out there I don't care who you vote for as\nLong as you are right nobody because that is throwing you voted way sure of course it yeah I mean come on yeah like vote for somebody on the ballot at least\nRight now at least let the Libertarian Party go wait a minute let them go easy ... libertarian you're throwing your vote away\nI liked the libertarians on paper how about you actually just ... they're they're Republicans in disguise listen they're Republicans that are like forward thinking oh\nI there's there's something there's a reason why that thing hasn't taken off yeah well this is and I tell you why because they're not really ... so I'm going to say like this like uh I hate to say this I listen to Alex Jones I'll hate the elbow war how\nDo they listen to it like like like you just laugh at no right or different whatever yeah you you know what I mean it's it's like an experienced the theory military\nYeah but you don't take you know not only because there is a no no no I mean 'cause you quote him you know you ... you're citing them as a reference no no he's not like a genuine reference but I'll I'll go and just to you know just to see what he says you listen to a lot of questionable stuff yeah exactly yeah yeah do you know it gives you a compliment ...

[laughter]\n...\nYeah but my ... my what I'm saying is not to you both understand this and I get you wanting to support the person you think is best for but you have to understand it's a two party system\nThat's it the one of the two parties is going to win so you're protest vote in and of itself is and why you whoever you don't want to win why virtual that protest vote you're probably only two parties they know they're gonna be it shouldn't be but mine did\nMow it absolutely right like at the end of the day we get all probably get worked up about a third party candidate that on paper he looks the part of she looks the part they talk the talk they got a hell of a plan they don't have enough legit support to even make it over a dozen people put a dent in what's gonna happen\nAnd that is the problem with the two party system it's going to always be that way until I could fix this but you don't want to fix it was that\nI Need every well I don't eat every one I was just talking to you about to say I was trying to find some I said before if every one on registered for the parties if the entire voting public\nUnregistered and we were ... every by then you could dismantling then people would be like what the hell are they doing right and now the people\nWould have the power again but the problem is you would have\nTo have a spokes person or a leader or electric council of people that are they\nAll right the two party system doesn't work and now don't we have think tanks don't we have people that are paid nine to five just sit there because you're so damn smart and figure out how to attack this problem but I don't we have rules the people that do that mhm man they need to all be fired because its main crafts going on that was happening to immigrant\nI got a question wasn't wasn't no Ross Perot the last ah presidents candidate that was like independent that could have changed ... yeah that could have changed the whole scope of like a two ... like the two already Ross Perot stopped who from when I think it was Bush right one of the Bush is now but the Bush won if I yeah yeah he helped him win a wreck you rented yeah\nMan was a factor that's what I'm saying yeah he was here walk to the hill ... typically in a vote for an independent typically helps the Republican\nCamp ... okay I'm like because the people who are open to do some wild stuff they're not conservative correct correct eight I tried this guy he could have got up there like I'm a wicked yeah or worse that's\nJust the truth and you know I'm not trying to sway anybody's vote just to understand what your vote does\nBut there's some people sitting around on I'll give a male which a chance [laughter] yeah that sounds cool we can we already had Obama yeah and they have like one was a good way of which you wouldn't need your vote he just has had to walk out with the wind\nExperience Carruthers new false specials tonight like rigatoni Martina and prosciutto and find Tina's stuffed pork chop plus during the wine harvest get ten dollars off bottles of wine throughout October only ... who's the number one Chevy dealer in Tampa\nBay and shut the Tampa and Brandon\nWhere can I say big bugs on Chevy Trucks and SUV warm and sunny Tampa and Brandon who's VIP appointment program has like favorite copier smoothie ready for me when I arrived\nIn Miami Tampa Bay and Brandon who has not asking questions and go to a farm and shopping dot com boom and haven't been serving the bank for over one hundred Twenty years by shutting campus that yes several a fine ...\nMike how the here for Tampa hair M.
