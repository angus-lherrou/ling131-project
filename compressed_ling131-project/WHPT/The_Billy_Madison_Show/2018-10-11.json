or not get caught Amazon\nThis is a follow up to a story we did before the ... the new member when we talk about Amazon raising their wages for their employees are Fifteen dollars an hour blood canceling out bonuses right well Amazon pledges to compensate the warehouse workers more following criticism\nA dateline Bloomberg Amazon dot com\nIs sweet need to pay for some of its longtime warehouse workers after employees criticized the loss of bonuses and stock award as part of the company's pledged to boost all wages are all wages\nTo at least Fifteen dollars an hour\nThe world's largest on top online retailer grabbed headlines last week with this minimum page pledge followed by concerns from veteran workers who ... their\nCompensation rightfully so would actually declined because the company also eliminated bonuses of stock Amazon said any workers already Ernie Fifteen dollars would get raises a one dollar per hour now some of those employees are learned their hourly raises will actually be a dollar twenty five\nYears and I tell you what have you ever let me ask you this before you have you ever gotten a raise where you wanted to look at your boss or go\nWhy I mean you don't really have any control over it if they want to give you they like and when I get your quarter but sub Saharan but now that I'm sad to sometimes a raise [noise]\nIs showing more respect\nMinor re well\nAre you going to work for respect [laughter] is that that we are on the person who was married I Try to get all ride in a row you going to say that we don't know\nAmazon I I Love Amazon I was wondering I'm getting ready to check to see how long a delivery from Amazon would take to get into Tallahassee right now\nIs every state of cities [noise] oh man I don't know but\nDon't I don't understand how Amazon doesn't I'm thoroughly please I Can't think of a company that I'm more pleased with than Amazon\nI've always gotten everything I Need it the way I needed it I think it's a perfectly round company\nNow they're doing right by the people but right\nRight that's what you have to do you have to do if if you I mean I don't know if you're if you're making billions upon billions of dollars is an incumbent upon you to take care of your in what they have taken care\nMaking I'll tell you what taking care is giving them a livable wage so they don't have to work another job\nHow do they want to live [noise] you gotta let out on the way where you might be different for me to say oh well I mean not like a nice car and I'm not saying you've got to the I got to have a yeah I have them\nOut or at least a livable wage to me is to be able to take care of the rent and utilities\nAnd you know have a little bit leftover to feed the kids [noise]\nWait now they don't have kids a little bit let them do they need to start showing here yeah here honestly you don't have to say I don't want I don't know what I'm looking\nI drive debate and you have to pay the rent before you worry about feeding the kids go to the kids don't want to be down on the street you can always has a lot easier to find food than it is shelter yes had yeah they are\nSaying ... a livable wage I think especially if you're a company making billions again upon billions of dollars is where if you're a full time employee there and I'm not saying that you have to be it has to be middle class but you don't ... you don't need to have\nTo go to a second job to afford the basics of living I the basic ... and that's what you think any full time jobs just supply and this kind of I'm saying the minimum wage to port and I'm\nNot that basic I Would say it's certainly a company that is making as much as Amazon is should show they'll show the real reach some of the road was down to the\nWell they are they they're giving them a job the great company they have a job right now the benefits health benefits and I write but [noise] but when the when we when do we take care of those that take care of a\nWe this is a business I felt like I feel like people who don't take care of themselves as\nFor me and my my thing is I only take ... take care of people that take care of themselves for gay but you know this is what I'm saying if they're showing up\nMhm doing the job and doing it to a degree of excellence and making billions upon billions of dollars they're taking care of themselves yeah but I don't know why they're making their money or job because they're not paying everybody\nThat all of our lives and they've gotten so much of anything that everybody got to make fifty an hour but I think Fifteen an hour is a good start though not a livable wage\nOr you put in that over time it might be thirty two thousand dollars I think you can make it a grown man\nIn Florida I think I think thirty two thousand dollars is not a bad start a he was Laura okay started two thousand you got to break that down as to how much money that is among let I'll do the other if you're single thirty two thousand you average apartment is about eleven hundred dollars you got to go to one of those eight hundred dollars Kevin they around his okay now you need a gun", "year":
