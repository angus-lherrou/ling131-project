answer and they would as Bret ... would connect from forty six yards out in ... forty seven year old Dr ... has been great four and a half minutes off the clock and the cowboys get three of those seven right back\nThere up twenty seven seven if you want a turning point in the game and it happened in the second quarter but a very close second would Jacksonville having a little bit of momentum

doubting themselves after what they put forth today forty seven your final score\nAs cowboys beat the jaguars this afternoon I mentioned some of the stats and the numbers\nThe individually they don't pop off the page I said that before jak Prescott Seventeen to twenty seven hundred eighty three yards two touchdowns good workman like day he was ... three times\nWhat does pop off the screen would be his running eleven carries ... eighty two yards with the Seventeen yard touchdown run\n... Elliott twenty four carries for one of six and a touchdown it was interesting about his day was it was very workman like a lot of two three four you're against his longest run of the day was only Twenty one yard\nSo he really worked hard for what he got today he goes over a hundred yards what'd you lie to the cowboys receiving corps is how many players called the ball eight different receivers were players\nDid have a reception but none bigger than Colby usually would nine catches for a hundred and one yards two touchdowns ball coming in the second quarter Michael Gallup had just one catch for twenty seven but that one touched down that wasn't very impressive\nYou certainly expect to see more of that going forward from him ... to catch it for Twenty one yards Rico Gathers\nEliot table in Austin who did go out to the gate with an injury Jimmy's all the ... the big Thompson all with one catch a piece for the jaguars Blake Bordeaux struggled Fifteen I'm twenty six\nHundred and forty nine yards a touchdown and interceptions he was sacked three times TJ yelled and carry the ball eight times we're just forty one yards\nBordeaux scrambled for twenty two and that was pretty much it in terms of the run game for Jacksonville not much there are killing coal and for catches for forty one yards duty Westbrook three ... thirty eight with the touchdown three catches obese for James are showing the sea and yelled in the backfield\nI and other than that\nNot a whole lot the cowboys turning them over a couple of times and just quickly 'cause we don't\nSpend much time on defensive stats\nBut Leighton Vander ... is a tackling machine and he's proven to have been a really good first round pick for the cowboys eleven tackles today seven were solo Jay Lynn Smith who we talked to in the pre game about the one to combination between him and vendor asks how good it's been well he had nine tackles again today and in terms of getting to the quarterback\nAnd seemed like there were a lot of quarterback kids today ready Gregory had a stack\nGot to the quarterback three times and there was the David or banks are citing as he was back he had a couple of tackles a couple of quarterback pressures as well\nAnd the cowboys did a lot of good things today winning forty seven some other random stats of no first downs cowboys at twenty three attended vantage total yards cowboys three Seventy eight to Jacksonville is too old for a time of possession", "show_name": "The Billy Madison Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Sarasota", "day": "14"}
