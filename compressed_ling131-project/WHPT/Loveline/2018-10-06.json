with them it's kind of a against protocol to ever see a mascot out of uniform so nobody went in there\nAfter it was over we were standing outside my father and I were standing outside going I think they're really mad I think he said he thinks captain fear was genuinely upset after what happened was just an insane conversation to have the mascot actually upset and then as soon as they left he goes in there and then find that no\nI'm very sorry to the to the mascot for doing that\nI might have I mean it could have been thunder bug that let that we don't I doubt I doubt that no no tea buggy

I Am sorry I'm also looking at this picture of a John ... from a friday night [laughter] did anybody post a picture of me in jail or in the same boat you have it\nI don't it ... us yeah we we because we did the same pose except with me holding Jay are like ah like as ... is being held by John and uh that really sums up the flavor of what happened friday night I just I'm really really started to to the mascot that if I if my comment landed poorly with them that's not what I intend to\nOrder a captain fear in here and then you you talk to him and he can't say anything back in the I don't even know how we settled this\nI don't know I don't know maybe I'll maybe I'll dress up as a mascot and and see how difficult it is for one of their games or something like maybe I could do a quarter\nOf a sudden you're going to be kept in fear\nWhile I mean I I could show them that they're really not costume freak me\nMaybe a preseason game but you're not ready for regular season game is kept in\nThe high very hot in there so I I don't know that I'd like to do that I don't even\nKnow if they did like game time is necessarily for you or early in the game preseason game I think maybe like a some sort of charity event much like this would be a good place to correct start off\nSo maybe next year is apple a day maybe I have to dress up as a costume mascot and uh I just didn't know there was a

and that's the thing is like you you get the impression that Henry causes all serious all ... all the time but when you see him do spoken word there are elements of comedy in a comic timing is on point and you're going to come away from that learning\nAnd laughing and hopefully carrying a little bit before I let you go is there any chance of documenting this tour of yours much like you did in my favorite companion pieces that you've written adult roar and the preferred blur\nThose are two of my favorites because it's basically a diary of traveling throughout the country and throughout the world and he can't if you're doing that and releasing those as literary works\nYeah no I'm writing about a thousand words the day the reason why you haven't seen\nA journal book\nA for a there's a grim a grim detail\nWas the last one that was like Africa yeah all kinds of crazy a location North Korea isn't that one anyway the\nReason why there hasn't been a book for a couple of years is I've just been too busy\nThere there's like tons of manuscript material is like four or five books in various states stages of completion and so I I edit with Heidi who manages may we have a really good editing system but we do it shoulder to shoulder and I don't do it without her I can kind of press the manuscript and so\nShe needs to we need to be together to do it and so next year we're thinking we might have time to zero in on a a couple of these books and and so there's more coming a there's a lot more writing that's sitting here waiting to go\nIt's just that it's a time thing good where you know this here I've got like a hundred and forty shows in twenty some countries I have three films up this year one of which I wrote and I've been all over the place a crescent promoting all of those\nEverything else ... fifty two radio shows fifty two articles for the LA Weekly twelve a year for Rolling Stone Australia et cetera it's hard to sit down and edits [laughter] so we're hoping next year but no I'm writing about everywhere I go taking photos et cetera all the time\nGood well when you do want to promote the film that you wrote we'd love to have you back on will definitely see you October seventh when you come to the Capitol theater it's always great catching up with you I Know that the reading your books and through speaking you through the years\nA crippling depression finds its way into that cerebral cortex of yours and the fact that you're able to fight through it is admirable it's always great catching up and a continued success user\nBack you or I drove will catch up later\nSome good hunter take care bye that's Enron's in a nutshell what a dude [laughter] what a guy man he's very intimidating he can be yeah\nUm that time when in Orlando when uh I was freaking man because\nMy producer at the time we arrange everything through his route Henry's road manager ... Mike and he's like look he's going to come at the rock station they're giving him an hour to play whatever he wants during their lunch time after that you can grab them in and do a little interview sounds great super\nWell Henry played for an hour and then taco Bob or whoever was over there and said hey listen you want to do this for a second hour to go ahead and it was great so he's playing all the music but he likes me like all this obscure stuff and so the road managed like look man we got to get back to the house of blues we got to do it sounds like I'm really sorry I don't think Henry is going to have time to do the interview\nI was crushed I had a couple of books on an autograph and I'm not big on autograph guy so he's like you can still meet him though just wait you know until he's done and you can say quick hello\nYou wanted to meet him or did you want to interview him I really wanted to interview him I I you know meeting is okay but what am I going to get it I really wanted\nSo he gets done with the second hour and he comes out of his manager talks to him for a second look we got to give a\nAnd Henry's like no if we said we do the interview will do the interview and so I said what are you sure are like I I'm not trying to talk you out of the interview or anything but like I Know you have things to do um you can go he's like no no come on and I said well how long do you do you want to use it as many questions you have so\nLiterally sat in a studio that was about and I don't want that literally there we sat in a studio that was about eight by six feet\nMe and him and I got to ask him anything and everything and I wanted the answers in such a forthright way and if you get something wrong you feel like the big I thought he was a vegetarian for some reason so I mentioned that he's like well actually I'm not a vegetarian it instantly inside you just go to let him down like that's the thing I\nFor the most part I don't care what an interview subject thinks of me personally I just interview them with Henry Rawlins I always take great care and I came in here with the list I didn't even bring up the suicide and Robin Williams thing I didn't bring up the walking dead sons of anarchy bugs makes the mosquitoes sentimentality which he ate his Calvin Klein ad\nBut I felt like it went okay you're gonna catch up yeah I I don't know that will catch up\nNow he's never going I replied your emails again\nNo no he always he will reply to anybody female anybody like if you're a first time than we emailed him he'll take the time to go hello thank you for being a fan goodbye\nAnd uh he's he's an interesting cat he doesn't have personal relationships he doesn't believe in sentimentality doesn't have personal relationships no what do you make time for them like like he really I I don't know that he has other than a ... of a ...\nIn minor threat I don't know that he has too many people who yeah he would call friends he writes about a new book being attached to people means that you're attached to their BS and he walks his own path okay\nAnd and he walks it alone yeah\nHe's a he's a warrior man you ever see them on ... like YouTube a Raul is banned in concert he takes the stage wearing only a ... pair of black short nothing else microphone court wrapped around his his arm and stomp with fury and screams and belts out some hard rock and punk rock\nYeah he's a scary guy each drew global uh each drew grumble a\nYesterday on the Mike Cal to show they were discussing what went down transpired if you will between myself and a Holly from hot mornings with Miguel and hot one two and five and a sounded a little something like this I thought\nThat was going to happen after Christmas I guess\nOh I Know you're the one that it'd be taught him to and maybe he was maybe it's from like you didn't want to do it\nI think you don't want to do it all but you would do it now probably doing\nAll right well good I'm going to try and facilitate you enjoying history loved each other I don't think that's going to happen you don't want it happening I think it's going to happen\nTo me these huge embarrass these little shy he because he why I don't\nHonestly that day I felt a little Cosby as you didn't you didn't feel like you wanted to kiss him\nWell I I Would not fully divorce than\nAwkwardness\nAnd yeah it was all worried about Ninety guys or Snapchat and your brain a\nLittle rough um but now after it happened it was nice and\nMuch more deeply future of the ... yeah yeah\nWell I don't know about that last part a a good way to end it\nIt is it definitely is I have no idea from a good or not you should have bitter I'd never really hear any complaints but that's only because they usually kill the girls that I guess a\nAnd I will say that regarding my personal situation there's a lot that I Am not quite ready to address just yet that is in play here so if you have questions I respect that\nBut I also ask you to keep them yourself because I Am not at a position where I can address\nA lot of what's going on with me and my personal life right now I Will at some point in time I imagine but as of right now there are pieces that are involved and out of respect to those pieces there's only so much I can say is that fair to say\nYeah what nothing so that's good okay so with that said\nThere are other reasons that uh that that Holly and I could not go any further\nAnd one of those is that we work together and you're either going to end up like the ... the one in ten thousand workplace romance of that actually works and comes to fruition or you'll end up like the other nine thousand nine hundred and Ninety nine\nAnd you'll have to people who hate each other and still have to show up in the same workplace now nothing against a deer Holly from hot one on five but I don't know that we could achieve ... status and I needed to bring her on the show either in person or on the phone on the phone work better for her\nAnd thoroughly apologized to her for rather than confronting\nThis with her apologizing and being more thorough and forthright with my reasoning for not pursuing it any further I chose to distance myself ghost if you will and just kind of leave her to figure it out on her own so Holly welcome to the program and\nPlease allow me to sincerely and thoroughly apologize to you for not having the difficult conversation that you deserved\nBattle thank you very well and you know you don't need to thank me just for being\nA man or an adult about it I should have done it long ago there were mitigating factors that I that I left out or because I was a policy and or I should have treated you are with more respect and more honesty and I apologize that I did not\nI actually do you have to agree that you should have handled differently [laughter] she's right again today [laughter] thinking why why is there reason also that you didn't want me to be in the studio with you yesterday\n[noise] um yes uh there were some things going on uh in my in my personal life that would have made it a lot more difficult for me and I'm you know oh hey what's up how are you [laughter]\nAll right let's talk about the oil and go get so awkward ... it was started off and that was a funny joke to get out of the\nUm ... you mean back in December or like the last couple of days\nWell I mean obviously after December it got dark or that that I Know that\nYes you do um uh I Would say back in December to apologize\nTo everybody I don't think so you are you did what you do with just create great radio in the morning here on one or two five the bone so I I don't think you owe me an apology and I don't think you'll Holly an apology or anybody really\nAll right so let's talk about the oil and go get so awkward ... it was started off and that was a funny joke to get out of the\nUm ... you mean back in December or like the last couple of days\nWell I mean obviously after December awkward at that I Know that\nYes you do um uh I Would say back in December it started as a fun joke a there are worse things going on in my personal life that were that happens to you every day\nSo what you're saying is he's morphing into a Garbo unfortunate\nAs it may be yes he is a is turning into a ... and the teenage version that that\nSo he he invited the girl wall chain girl to the party yeah which is kind of mean something that she showed up but now I told him he doesn't think that she likes them\nRight even though he texted her after the party and said would you like to hang out some time and she said yes oh yeah\nRight that's what I told them I'm like she wouldn't have said yes if she didn't want to hang out with now where are you going to hang out what are you going to do how does that go down I have no idea this is the summer of all a chain love or it could be\nAnd then uh one of my friends I I won't say his name on the radio but pulled the ultimate dad move like this made me respect this guy even more than I already do he saw his son talking to the girl like Zander and a and this guy sun ... we're both talking to the girl but this guy son was maybe talking to her a little more than the dad Gareth\nHe said I'll talk to him about that I said you don't have to do that he said no no I I Do I Want him to respect boundaries I Know that when windows or friends you don't\nWrite who does that what a great guy teach him broke how he really I taught him bro code\nWow who I got to know who this is do I know who it is\nYeah ... what do you think of all the guys we know\nUm Galvin yeah\nOne of the greatest guys I Know like I already would count him as one of my favorite people that I've ever met in my entire life entire life is our lives so many of the shut up [laughter] at the top that he is Galvin and and when he said that to me I was like what what a guy what what a what a guy thing to do\nWhy did you sense that his son was talking to this girl too much I didn't\nBut he did like I had no idea and I told her that he left his ass off he said well what do you do you tell them not to I said yeah he said that is ridiculous I said you think it's ridiculous now but you and I are probably going to have that discussion someday about another girl\nThat's a pretty strong parenting that is that is way strong parenting and it's it's such a great friend move and uh and I I was so impressed\nBy the well not me not your son's got a golf ball chain girl since Calvin kind of paved the way\nBut I mean how do they go out like what what do you do at Thirteen\nThey can go to the movies they can go to the mall I they can hang out at what your house in the living room to play\nVideo games are twister no twister no video games in my house I might be\nAt your house that's weird them hanging out at my house isn't it it's in there during the living room it's a supervisor staying oh you're like in the kitchen\nBut then I'm responsible for what happens if I'm In the toilet you know going in the dude and then something happens that I'm responsible\nCopy for its wrong with you I Can't time when things happen you know what's going to happen I don't know how long are you in their man\nForever that's part of being a grab a male\nOkay so I don't know get one of those teddy bear babysitter Camden or have that facing them while you're\nGoing to the ... I can see what you're doing out\nThere the first time she'd be like a group outings ... their friends like a birthday party oh okay so they've had that okay something out of your laser tag along yeah yeah\nAnd what about that job ... are coming out that other ... and other things that are sort of how the uh [noise]\nUh and so then what I got a range and other outing 'cause I had that came off three hundred bucks a birthday party\nHe can arrange it okay what about a\nPublic pool party yeah pool parties\n... suits though you know the the the well I\nDon't know I don't know kids in bathing suits are teenagers now we're you know he goes to pool parties all the time does that mean you're right [laughter] that's what we think oh yeah you live in Florida yeah it just oh it's the summer\nI Know I just don't want them to grow up but what about like what about Bush gardens that's a good idea and I could take her that's that's a perfect idea\nYeah that is a good idea that's in are you the chaperone are you going to still have to hang back\nI'll just like you know what I'm hearing and our\nOh no no yeah you do in the bushes or yes well yeah you let them go on the ride together right you stay and watch it on a car behind them right well you have your car I mean\nWhat are they come in there [laughter] I'll let them have their freedom while they're on the secret for crying out loud and they buy one of those expensive pictures where they're freaking out on the roller coaster [laughter] change the memories forever yeah that\nDoes is perfect yeah what about adventure island a\nBathing suits again I don't know what are we supposed to be a just a you know\nIt seems weird that teenagers in Bay but he wanted to wear a blouse on some like for them to be modestly dressed yes I don't think that's so bad okay\nEach drew ... and the continuing saga of\nWallet chain girl I'm update I all I just want I think that it's done he pulls me back in I guess they were taxing over the weekend my son and the girl who he made me ... for for her birthday\nAnd then she was the only girl that was that his birthday party to right correct and then you chaperone to date with her and Galvin son and your son to Bush gardens that is correct also All right\nSo they were texting and uh they were taxing about shark NATO which was last night and she asked\nMy son if you wanted to come over and watch shark NATO oh man\nSo uh I was a I was out getting a a I was at a car dealership and getting a car 'cause that's what people do there what does a and a ...\nI had a race home my uh my wife is there and ah and my son made her leave he's like\nDad's coming home soon you have to leave and I'm like we get along like why why did you ... so I'm I'm taxing with with my wife and I'm like why did you make you leave she said because he said you were coming home it did make any sense and she said it's a it's probably because he didn't want me to see him getting ready for his shark NATO party\nSo when I finally get home dude has a long sleeved shirt on the pair of jeans that I just bought 'em from banana republic brand new Vance he's got cologne a man alone I Know and I said did you make mom leave so that you wouldn't see you in this outfit and he goes\nI'm getting too old for this ah crab I don't want to hear that stuff and I said well you can just tell her that she would understand I'm going to tell her anyway so I took him over there last night they did a little swimming watched a little shark NATO and ah she's in his home run for next year so this could be could be the first girlfriend\nWas she the only ... or is he the only person I went over to their house last night\nThe only boy a there was how much it's costing them or is this is absolutely zero the back to school shopping very expensive I went to those new Tampa premium outlets are ... even though their outlet stores still quite pricey to go back to school shopping a must ingestion hit them during the weekdays oh near the crazy\nDom yeah dumb move because there's no crowd right where this was packed clearance right oh yeah we we went to ... he got himself a backpack mhm he accidentally had the backpack on his back while we're paying we walked out of the store and they still have the backpack on his back\nHe's only got we've got to go back I got the backpack on it got to go back right\nAnd and then I said but seriously turn around so we went back and paid very reputable young in the course even goes\nWell a lot of people wouldn't have done that I said really a lot of people with their kid would have sold it back [laughter] like the people listening right now right that would have seen their kid walk out of there with a with a fifty dollar backpacking on they were looked over their shoulder to say about it really doesn't look like anybody following us let's get the hell out of here huh I I said son is a very important lesson\nUh honesty he goes honesty that's what you're supposed to do I said yeah well you know a lot of people wouldn't have done that\nSo is he confused about where he stands with all chain girls the happy just being friends\nWell funny you should ask that his big objection has been his height because she's a little taller and she doesn't like shorter guys\nDidn't she didn't he gave her piggyback rides do Busch Gardens yes okay\nHe's a sturdy young men uh he found out last night that he is one half inch shorter than she is now he's proud of like a weed so the height thing it's not going to be an issue by the time school starts\nWeek so when she got a breakout of measuring tape or something for she can officially date him\nNow his Nance probably given that have been she's good to know\nThat is right bands they give you a happy\nWith Roger you buy banned uh so I I think uh I think things might be progressing to the point where\nYou might have a a girlfriend we gotta talk to him about this don't you yeah he's going to be more alone too I Know I uh I don't know what to tell him as he has to do anything no yeah I mean\nOnce you get asked me for the credit you don't ask you a five hundred pound guy on diet tips you know what I mean you know by my track record he probably uses me as a role model for what not to do he's like my dad is a complete screw up when it comes to ... I'm going to not do the things that my dad does and do everything my dad doesn't do\nOn a side note a shock Nader was saying with the kids these days I don't know I don't know I didn't hear much about this one\nI didn't either I I didn't realize until friday that it was on last night I didn't watch a minute of it is\nFor force the forest shark man of avoid at all for a\nMan I saw the first three and a I feel like I'm missing out on something but not watching me or the one that was on last night they mean DVR it my son said he didn't watch a lot of movie I don't know what that means\nI talking to family has giant schnauzer ... have you seen a giant schnauzer before\nOh that is do you mean like nos no giant schnauzer schnauzer ... biggest giant poodle I Swear to you need a ... do the mom does have you ever see giant schnauzer as before and I said no\nThinking that this was a dirty joke go inside the house man I Want to do that shouldn't be like yeah I met her lab and they're like\nLittle chain saw like oh let's see what they got going on in there and uh they they are giant schnauzer the the the most bizarre looking dog I've ever seen in my life you take a picture I Know I I thought about it but", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Loveline", "city": "Sarasota", "day": "06"}
