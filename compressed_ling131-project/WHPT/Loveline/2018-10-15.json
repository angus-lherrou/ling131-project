made a cities or you're like\nOh God did I Do something to that [laughter] it seems so low shed a little bit of both of\nUs the best just getting dragged that's why I joined a global won TSA and clear because going past\nThe regular people here say wasn't enough now clear I go past TSA\nNothing better than just what is clear now I don't know this layers clears the the uh after you the TSA lied now how do you join that Seventy bucks what you just joined Seventy bucks you every day retinal scan you and fingerprint you and I know you know everybody's like\nYeah they're going to file you did he get we get who cares I don't know what the gardens and universal\n[laughter]\nYou can look at my poor too if you dare right kidnapping your head [laughter] so yeah so how do I do I go to I got to go somewhere to do it\nNow you go to the airport and is that ... their budget clear people they they look like you know a side to all just see a standing just go up to them you swipe your credit card you scan your fingerprints your retina and you're in you know the you go up through TSA and you've got to give them you're still going to give me a license yeah and your passport I don't do that\nAnd I walked by her around I I just like this was up\nAnd I and they go boom because I'm global one right he wants to key right if you're a global now you're a global on you got to go to the airport and one day\nAnd you fill it out I did that with the other thing with their own a traveler number yeah you gotta do to global one okay so now you got to go global on do you get it's worth it it's a hundred bucks but when you go out of the country you just fly back in your retina scan and you're you're\nAt so you want to be global one and clear glow I gather\nBlowing gives UTSA so in this country you always get the essay but uh and clear is the best yeah 'cause you fly by the TSA like 'cause every as you say\nSo when you go to so I had the TSA on that and they give you a known traveling member and your book it on your on your flights when you go out and if you're traveling with people they automatically sign that the people you're traveling with the thing is weird 'cause\nWhen I was traveling with Mohammed from work and Hama decided today was going to be the ... you know what I mean well so anyway um they\nGive you a K T and number a kid known traveling number so when we came back from Montreal me ... Spanish we were they breathe it you've got to walk to the other side of the airport\nThen you'd go follow them as long as hallway and then they make you watch you have to sit and watch a movie like while you're waiting for clearance nearby game and then there was a science said Katie and\nThis way and I'm like all that stuff no travel even like to go so I went and there was a woman and I and I'm like but I have the ... she goes no you're on the wrong probably go but I have the number right here and she's like that's a different number I'm like but I just can't you know ... you know I Know I'm In the wrong spot so finally she just got burned out you just go\nYou know throw a lot safer I go down there will be Tampa guy can just let you down she was like you know danger [laughter] so is that that do they\nStill put your bags through the little things do they still like scan your bags and stuff\nLike when you go through the metal detector\nRight oh yeah yeah okay I just\nQuestion because they used to like I don't have to take off your shoes like on my laptop\nDon't have the only thing I'd stop her words that we did not right and you just through secured by like wave a wand or something like I don't know well I mean I don't want to do it I write so that's why I asked\nAnd usually I don't get me out a I'm just saying that it was it was it was in the bats question the global number where you just walk through it [laughter]\nWell if you're a carry on you know just walk yeah they don't check your bags or do you they are you going to be able to just ... you scare and you'll be scanned bag you have to you have to look inside of bags they'll they look at even though you don't take your laptop out\nWhich I think is ridiculous any ways that you have it's a laptop whatever you take that out are you still have to scan the bag and you can't just throw a\nBike him find this global on on the Internet is a global number one kind of global one like one person [laughter]\nSo any or the number one though it's away they go to one so I'm pretty global and travel now and I'm getting gate or an ... one airport oh I Love her\nI Love her so [laughter]\nI I don't I couldn't imagine life without\nRegard agree in\nHer car hundred percent\nRight global entry into separate check\nThat you are now now yeah offensive [laughter] now you're scared me [laughter] ... protection\nAnd roll and trusted traveler program to extradite your international travel\nOr global on a tree is the best right it is something that you got to get that and then get declare you won't wait in line I Want to wait in line\nI mean when do you wait in line really ... yeah I travel in the last like three times I literally got there a half hour before my flight or were you ever hear rivals every week yeah yeah for indifferent airport she tried to leave out of Orlando on any day and you're waving an hour\nI had I mean it was really and I always like delta which is key and I have the if you fly dealt you have to get its three fifty or four hundred a year is awful it really just kicked your right and the ...\nBut the uh platinum ... yeah which gives you all these things crazy\nSaying there's a lot of in a way though well they they didn't take the the lounge sees you as you get the delta lounge which is a bass so I go and I go in early I go to two hours early I don't care to little breakfast while he's on TV oh yeah I get there before the business guys are dead dumb little briefcases\nSo why do you have a brief get a backpack you a loser subway to tie on the plane dummy I took a shower and one of those places but\nOh yeah he's really a\nI Want to say now [laughter]\nWe came back from a ... with a guy in about\nThree times a year for it [laughter]\nI thought I was just got a big deal known as ...
