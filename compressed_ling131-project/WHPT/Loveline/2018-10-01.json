up yeah just simple the scooter herself last summer designers him walking around president leave or when he walks into somebody's eve they recognize a musical hey how's it going to know I don't know\nA guy I think he's very funny he was doing the uh Adam Sandler has a new show coming out on Netflix like stand up special I guess he was on starting this week oh I think yeah yeah\nBut ah they were going out our great is that if you have your friends and you're all super famous when you could just go All right let's all get together and go on tour of the world you go in area you do make jokes on stage and hang out and just switch all people to do is like a Sandler spade rock\nOr who else was on there I don't know that Kevin James did some of the ones uh neck or tend towards and I don't know whether or Rob Schneider is on any of them or not I think he probably was in there as well probably yeah that that would be so much fun just to be like hurt burn yeah\nWell they've been able to do that for a long time to do you think back when Adam Sandler first blew up yeah he was like the famous guy and he would just put all of his friends and his movies like ... or early Adam

[laughter] I got it at a at a thing a lot of hers I've got a yeah but uh that's pretty cool that'd be a lot of fun although I guess we kinda do like hey let's all go on a cruise yeah we've\nGot to think about all the way I needed to take a private jet right on\nHad harsh for ... [laughter]\nI think the content stands separately from\nI just wandering on I disagree a hundred percent but it's still funny they makes it less because I haven't\nNo I I think we're arguing two different things and material is funny but the person who you see performing the material is a rape is right but I'm saying\nOkay you have a list of the uh say top twenty comedians he's not going to be on there not anymore of all time is right you have to go listen Bill Cosby is on there obviously the the raping and all that stuff is terrible but as far as influence and as far as being a huge David suffering here has to be on\nThere and think about this and Twenty years or even Thirty years for people who weren't alive for this case for it to really like being set in their history\nThink about when they look back and someone shows and Adele ... stand up is he going to be known for going to jail for raping and oh yeah I mean or will they be no for his comedy you know he'll be no for raping yeah or people who aren't alive today who have no knowledge of this you\nKnow anything about how many are kids think that a Steven Tyler is the guy from uh American Idol [laughter] [laughter] yeah but I mean there were you know because it's outside of the realm of dollars they didn't know they didn't grow up knowing that he was an Aerosmith or anything like that he became popular them because he was on American Idol\nI think once the generation that grew up with Cosby is gone I think he'll be looked at is just the right this guy just said I I think that all\nThe oil I mean you know he did rape a lot of women oh yeah\nYeah no no I'm not I'm not saying that he didn't do that he's in jail and that's what he did but I'm saying also he was a very influential comedian\nThat started a lot of stand up to ... there's a lot of big can read comedians out there that point to him when I started Cosby that's what I wanted to do stand up and you know and that they they love this stuff and kind of pattern themselves after him you know\nYeah I just think of like a you know other people that have been in power that have abused it and they were revered and then when it comes out that they're doing all these horrible things everyone to sweep it under the rug\nSo I don't think you could have a conversation in normal normal setting about Bill Cosby and say he's a fantastic comedian without everybody's freaking out and jumping down your throat I think if they do\nLess they put Bill Cosby and there's obviously yeah right ... and stuff but\nYou know it's funny is on the when I was listening and there was a replay from my uh the Superbowl and we have Michael ... on and I'm Mike was asking them about Jared from subway and this was prior to all the stuff coming out\nThese like ...\nAnd I'm like ... [laughter] yeah we we were hanging out together all the time is really good with my head yeah whoa the guys on\nHim did you have in the studio before because he would do a lot of radio\nUh no we had um we went down to Miami for the super bowl and the radio around he came over and was hanging out with us\nI had him in Studio twice in the interview them and he seemed like I never would've imagined that oh you are talking about a year in federal yeah he had been here a couple of times I never got that vibe without even off the air and stuff we were talking\nIn Salt lake nerd yeah I heard they got lucky with the subway thing and you know good for him whatever yeah but you didn't\nMail out right yeah ... yeah\nIt wasn't like a check your hard drive and now I find though from him and then it's like\nWhoa no yeah it really wasn't you know you'd like to say and hindsight you realize oh I totally new but now it just seemed like a nerd guy but whenever you found out about it you're like oh okay [laughter]\nI mean seems seems plausible hands like yeah you could do that or some other people like if it came out that Brad Pitt was raping God what been thinking about all that can't be right not Brad Pitt he's too good luck\nJohn de Riley like that's my always goes you mean like John C. Reilly is the most fun loving guy in my heart but what what could you imagine if all of a sudden one day they were like John C. Riley is raped by the way people I Would ask you couldn't believe it yeah I Would be like not the hair not my Johnson\nI don't know [laughter] but I I mean what happens in Hearst average Frenchman\nOr let's go to a shock you're on the Mike ... what's happening just [laughter]\nHey you know everybody keeps saying oh is she going to be remembered but think of this she rose breeders for the war in baseball removed out of the hall of famer moved out of anything baseball so\nThey are not really moved out of the hall of fame he ever made it in the hall of fame because I Am right right right right but\nBut here's a guy who's everybody looked up to the probably the best baseball player's ever play the game\nAnd in fact when you were\nIn what is your opinion do you think he should be in the hall of fame\nYes I Do yeah so do I miss accomplishments making their yeah\nIt's not the outside life of what he's doing gambled into that stuff if you look at his stats and you look at that he should be in the hall of fame absolutely you can say oh he he was wrong to gamble and do that stuff but as far as baseball goes yeah he's one of the best of all time he absolutely should be in the hall of fame\nRight and I would still say Bill Cosby is one of the best comedians of all\nI write in I've ever heard\nUh okay I I mean that's your opinion as my leg or track I appreciate that oh no I I don't think he's the funniest guy but I can see where he was a huge influence a lot of people you know so I don't know what's going to do I Greg you're on the Mike hell to show what's happening Greg\nWhat's going on but I was kind of thinking you know what you guys are talking about earlier how [noise] uh you know what they called me now I'm compared to like Twenty years\nRight and it's kind of like it sound like Michael Jackson are air Hernandez you know\nFor now you know Congress should not be excluded from a list of comedians that whereas those huge of course the best but eventually in Twenty years like you were saying it will only be remembered for what he did go early and this was a great college or pro football player would eventually you'll always remember there's a murder somebody\nYeah yeah I play like you ... that goes to a OJ OJ said should be a be in the uh football fame no no well\nI Know it's like he wasn't convicted it's the Football Hall of fame he wasn't convicted he I mean he was convicted of why it wound up doing strong arming the stealing back his stuff whatever kidnapping and all that stuff but if you're talking about stats\nAnd by the way is he in the hall of fame I don't even know I sure I Would imagine I Would imagine that he probably already was in the hall of fame but yeah if you look that up but if you're looking at it what is it it's the Football Hall of fame how great was he on the field\nNot was he a jerk\nWhat does it mean to his wife was it really made more\nThan ... you know but uh\nIs he in there and then there yeah so there you go but you do to see but he was ever convicted that's why I write but it it's more like like I always think of it in front of the kids' perspective of if I was\nA kid and I looked up to like a Bill Cosby a my whole life and then now all of a sudden he's this rapist I Would I Want my kid to look up to that guy as you know I've ah incredible comedian that I Would want him to aspire to be and you know what I'm not but it's not\nLooking up to it is the influence of big about Michael Jackson\nMichael Jackson who was in convicted but did do payout to soften some people believe that he molested kids other people don't believe that he did but there is that that a shadow of doubt around him and stuff still one of the greatest entertainers of our lives\nOf all the eyes you can argue that in our head argument I Can't think about how many people were influenced by Michael Jackson are they going to go now well no ...\nThat doesn't make him less of a performer because of you know because the conscience stands on its own separate from the fact that\nHe was a pedophile ... maybe but that that's what you look at that see do you have to look at it that way I I mean in my opinion I think that's the way Lucas easier to swallow them J. because he never was convicted whereas Cosby definitely yeah the shadow of doubt that he definitely as far as comedian though it was\nMade in one of the most influential huge and all that stuff\nIs he a good guy nope yeah is he a funny comedian yeah do you asterisk his staff you know do you do either you if I if\nYou're making all is said GQ is making a lesser whoever's making allies of the fifty most influential comedians of all time Bill Cosby's on there and they probably but we don't condone his life outside of comedy but as a comedian you have to have it on this list and I think everybody goes yeah that makes sense\nThat makes sense yeah for now yeah I think\nIt is true like you said once the generations start dying off and his comedy specials go to where you can't\nWatch oh yeah yeah ... yeah and what was your favorite sport for\nRaping and you know what I mean like that today it's the same with uh you can't talk about Pete Rose without talking about the gambling you can't talk about Michael Jackson without talking about the possible a child molestation you can't talk about O.J Simpson without talking about is the murder of his wife and the other guy you know I mean\nBut even since all this ... himself started coming out he's been the butt of light every joke and he won't be that way for going for before he was like comedy legend bill Carrey oh yeah now he's the part of every dumped out there because that\nFor you looked at Bill Cosby like he was caught hospital yeah yeah wow what a nice guy and he seems so good and he's really a you know making the name for himself and helping out other people and do it all that stuff but yeah now of course by the way you bring up a great point\nOf ah ah what was it about the comedy about his name being attaches stuff uh everyone please listen to me everyone please listen to me\nI don't know [laughter] I had a job\nIn Venice charming NGO in Studio Mike up in New York

you're like oh this guy's being nice to me and not all of a sudden\n... but that's the thing that I don't think I don't because I don't know what the facts are facts aren't out there I don't know who to believe I don't know like everyone's lying up there this is all just you know a political parties making a mess of a real situation All right so let's say this is a trial\nLet's say it to try again you're on the jury okay from everything that you've heard what do you do now\nIf I was on the jury I don't have enough evidence to beyond a reasonable doubt there you go can back in\n... and I know

hearing this is a democratic Senator Patrick Leahy asking a doctor for the weather was are as strong as memory that she has here is that audio\nWhat is the strongest memory you have the strongest memory of the ... you cannot forget take whatever time you need\n... in the head that can't that is that laughter that perjury is laughter to explain that to [noise] and they're\nHaving fun [noise]\nYou'd ever forgotten that after they were laughing with each other and you were the object Provo after ... underneath one of them while they're to laugh too for his friends having a really good time with one another\nReporter just go through this [noise] to do remember what happened\nThese are not very much so\nI got to tell you one thing that really stands out whatever you watch the hearings is how many old white\nGuys or their value added unbelievable there was one guy and he was trying to read a statement we messed up like every third word I was a good Lauren laughing\nAnd girls fumbling with their pay\nSomebody else read it I don't know what's going on\nAmy Schumer are posted a picture on her Instagram of like what it looks like from\nThere's a lot so glad she's there yeah I Know it talks about\nTalking about a comedian that it's just going the wrong way man yeah uh but I mean\nI'm just saying for the for the ... in case of that for this case right right you know what I mean like look at what this lady is staring at well she's explaining her rape or you know what I mean or the\nIncident right yeah like she oh yeah like that is and it wasn't rape right she wasn't raped she's groped\nShe well I don't know what they're what\nYou want to call it could be sexual assault could be rape could be you know grow up what what's the proper term for what are they saying actually happened you know\nRight I don't think she said there was any intercourse but they were holding her she said they were holding her down she said that put a hand over at her hand were mouth she was trying to screen to leave and they were laughing and you know hold her down grabbing her\nYeah so whatever you want to call that I hear is a actually some of the a montage of a judge Kavanaugh's strongest statements about his innocence from yesterday's hearing a that says a quite a few different things put together so take a listen to this\nMy family and my name I've been totally prominently destroy this confirmation process has become a national disgrace this is a circus I Will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process\nDue process is a foundation of the American rule of law due process means listening to both sides [noise] last time I was here I told you that when my mom was a prosecutor and I was in high school she used to practice or closing arguments use

this card and that's because nothing of this kind ever happened\nNo doubt in your mind zero monitor censored you swear to God I Swear to God [noise]\nGamble it that sort of God and that gamble here I Am a so you want to go to the court of public opinion my opinion either weirdo thanks so yeah you know you're like that's just been doing that\nAnd you're a judge in your trying to become a Supreme Court justice you have to be able to be level and be able to speak to people and bring out the facts and us up he seems like\nHey I understand I understand\nYou're getting a huge but there's nothing\nThat works better than you being calm and having the facts and just boom boom boom putting it out there as opposed to\nWhat do you like to drink do you like beer and doing all that so that to me to me in my opinion I just go oh we're not saying that that makes the whether he did it or not I'm not saying he did it I'm just saying I look at that guy he's kind of a weird\nYeah I'd buy him and his I agree with you here and I thought his entire presentation that was a a bad luck\nYou know he made his stuff yeah I get that he's pissed off but you're going to be a Supreme Court justice I think you have to have more of a level head when it comes to that kind of stuff yeah when when he was being ask direct questions he was like deflecting and like going back in asking the senators the same question like he wouldn't answer but he would ask the question back to that like I don't I don't think you should have done that it was a bad luck\nYeah I ... my whole thing is out of all this\nThe one question that I keep asking myself this guy obviously knew that he wanted to be a public servant from when he was very young you know I went to all those schools and all that so\nIf you knew that from very young why would you put yourself in a party where all this stuff is happening when you know if they're gonna be a public figure they're gonna did all this not manned you're still a kid and you still want to live your life and had an ad hit I knew\nThat if I was at a party in a gun showed up for you know everyone's on after the run around naked like there's a chance that cops are going to show up and I'm gonna have to deal with the situation\nThat I'm not in the survey you didn't it like just\nRight but also looking back on it you can say that easily and stuff and people do dumb things people do dumb things yes you would think well now he's saying for it you would think that uh but did he do it right as a matter of paying for it that's the thing you know it really does

real hard but I played for\nAll of us in that circle play sports in fact those lists wishing I played sports\nWhen you were on varsity and so forth and were starter and drinking to excess was the big thing on Saturday Night\nSo it wasn't every night was one night and it's just really disappointing there were a lot of emails and a lot of tech flying around about how he was lying to the Senate Judiciary committee today\nSo that lady who was new Kavanaugh at Yale\nDoes not seem to think that he's being treated ... and a points out some stuff they're so like I said it was Thirty years ago and that was actually more than ...\nYeah everyone's ability to remember the accounts exactly how they went down I Would suspect of a one eight hundred and Seventy seven one one or two five or seven to seven five seven nine to five I see that there's people on hold that want to talk about this and I'm going to get your phone calls I just kind of want to go through\nThis audio and stuff and then we can talk about it here in the second this is a Senator Lindsey Graham ah talking about judge Kavanaugh and uh definitely defending him here here is that Senator Lindsey Graham\nIf he wanted the FBI investigation you could have come to us what you want to do is destroyed this guy's life hold this seat open and hope you weren't at twenty twenty you said that not me this is the most an ethical sham\nSince I've been in politics and if you really wanted to know the truth you sure as hell wouldn't have done what you've done to this guy for your power God I Hope you never get it out the American people can see through that sham God I hate to say because they've\nBeen my friends but let me tell you when it comes to this you're looking for a fair process you came to the wrong town at the wrong time my friend this is not a job interview this is hell this this is going to destroy\nThe ability of good people to come forward because of this crap\nYou have interacted with professional women all your life now one accusation you're supposed to be Bill Cosby when you're a junior and senior in high school\nAnd all of a sudden you got over it spent my understanding that if you drive women and write them for two years in high school you probably don't stop to my Republican colleagues if you vote no you're legitimizing\nThe most despicable thing I have seen in my time in politics\nAnd anger southern very emotional yeah so you know but he that's that's his opinion that's what he thinks about the situation I mean he's right about the FBI investigation you know they could have but ah I don't know I don't know whether the FBI is a supposed to investigate that\nOr whether they could investigate Kevin up for his Supreme Court\nA possible appointment whenever I don't know there was something in there about they said that the FBI that's not what they knew you know so I'm not sure about that but I get what they're saying and stuff so uh the latest word is that the Senate Judiciary committee will vote today on Kavanaugh's nomination\nThere are eleven Republicans intend Democrats on the committee but only one of the Republicans is considered a maybe and that is Jeff Flake from Arizona so you have eleven to tan\nBut one of the eleven is uh maybe so this is just you know everybody's waiting to see what happens here tend to be interesting if they pass them the entire Senate will vote next week on whether to confine him as a Supreme Court justice or there is also the possibility that President Trump could pull the nomination\nThat's very unlikely or he's given to having a strong supporter throughout this entire process\nIncluding yesterday after the hearing a President Trump tweeted quote judge Kavanaugh showed America exactly why nominated him his testimony was powerful honest and riveting Democrats search and destroy strategy is disgraceful and this process has been a total sham\nAn effort to delay obstruct and resist the Senate must vote that is from a president Donald Trump so\nWe'll find out today and yeah it's going to be interesting I feel bad\nFor his kids because then the age of social media I just can't imagine all the stuff that they're all in even said that you know that his family's being dragged through all this stuff you know whenever he ... the Urban League denies it and says it's not true and meanwhile families getting dragged through all this and this is you know going to\nBe forever when we talk about judge Kavanaugh remember the whole thing yeah whether it's right or wrong whether it's true or not you're going to talk about the situation so you don't believe a woman at all me yeah\nI mean what does it matter if I Believe I Believe that something happened to her right I Believe that uh I Believe they don't see is being used by the Democratic party to to make sure that judge Kavanaugh does not become part of the Supreme Court justice\nBut what does she have to gain by doing that money well like what will be her motive because all she says she's lived\nWith horrible anxiety your whole life so I got imagine her coming forward and finally revealing that the sexual predator that she's you know as\nWell so you know some you see things that the Democratic party went to her and say hey\nWe need you to make up this story so we can derail\nThe Supreme Court justice being appointed but it's not an ... ... what how do you know that that's the thing you know if you don't believe her than me she's lying she's making the story up she has nothing to gain by coming forward she's saying our family and she's had twenty four seven security her family has been a the received death threats well there you ...\nYou know it was being from the stuff and I I'm not sure what has been debunked turnout whatever but I guess a judge Kavanaugh or his mother\nOr how I hate to say because I don't all of the fact yes\nBut ah with somebody in his family\nWas a judge or add a ruling about a foreclosure on her parents' house right\nThere is something that or whatever but then it was ... but there could be deeper things that we don't know her brother works for some company that has some sort of time or did whatever there's rumors out there now I'm telling you right now I don't know all the facts or do you yell at me if you go all that it's been debunked whatever\nBut there could be something that we don't know yeah that she's like I'm going to get the son of a bitch one day but you know it\nSeems like to to to jump into the public guy like that where everybody was watching yesterday everybody now knows your name it seems like you're you're giving up a lot for what will be the motive money a bad foreclosure it because you know her name is out there now she is she puts her story out there\nHalf the people are going to say she's a lion ... and the other people are gonna say she is a complete victim so she puts I think her coming forward that puts a lot on the line for her and her family just as much as him as well\nYou know what I mean what's the motive she's the victim in this situation so I Would disagree with that I think that\nYeah she's getting what you said she's getting death threats and all that um yeah yeah but it she all she did was come forward whereas Brett Kavanaugh I mean like I said his whole family the like we're talking about it yeah dragged through the mud foot soldiers yeah but but it came from or if she's line you know again I don't know maybe ... getting paid\nWhat you're saying though is let's say she is one hundred percent telling the truth is the victim and so there are still people you wire ... he's just trying to you know\nAnd again like we talked about ... I Believe that something happened to her I don't know if it's definitely Brett Kavanaugh there are I think a couple of his classmate said that she's confusing him live with them so this happened over Thirty years ago I think she needed to get something off her chest\nAnd because of that the Democratic party used her they didn't say to make up a story they had you have to go and tell this story and make sure people know that he's a sexual predator\nWell I Believe that I mean they should do to the store you need to put the story out there but she definitely believes that at the same when what a hundred percent and [noise]\nYou know none of us has ever gotten blackout drunk or you don't remember what happened that night\nYeah unfortunately the big part of it is is none of us know we weren't there whatever\nAnd we're looking for some sort of proof you feel bad for if she's telling the truth yeah and I don't know whether she is or not but if she is you know you're like well we can't prove it and that's the thing you want to go if this happened and I feel terrible for you and hopefully we can figure this out and stuff\nBut it is their security footage is there a thousand people that have your back and say I was there and this happened is up it was like Nineteen eighty two\nFifteen you the conversation follow what do you find the bone on Facebook Instagram and Twitter good twenty four seven that what that is one of the point by the tickets going online dot com\nOne day I'll teach chemistry to kids going to be an architect\nMy dream is to be Russia [noise]\nThis is a world of ... a world in which people who put their mind that something can really make a difference [noise]\nMy goal is to help the environment someday I'll find a cure for cancer\nAt the U.S department of education on the federal student aid we believe that firing mind can achieve anything really dedicate ourselves to making sure everyone has an opportunity to go to college [noise] each year\nWe provide more than one hundred fifty billion dollars in grants and loans and work study time making higher education possible for anyone at any stage of life I can go back to college I can change careers I can make a difference [noise]\nAm I just wanted to talk about uh you know that came in as a ... ... are\nYou there\nAll the time you were saying the I eat\nHang on Louis you dropped out a little bit start over again please you dropped out\nMy grandfather um and they all the time we get the laugh and laugh at kid as a slang term the devil's triangle el\n... ... ... named the gains change we used to play kings and down there in Florida they call it waterfall that just a bunch of drinking game that you know are called different thing I think they're taking a silly stuff that makes no sense\nAnd they just just baffles me that we're doing it he said she said and waking millions and millions of dollars that tax dollars to the air but no one can prove\nRight yeah I totally understand that 'cause like I said where I grew up\nIn a row house where\nI grew up in the time that I grew up ... meant a sexual act but it could mean something else to somebody in Pittsburgh yeah you know what I mean I think about a half a gale time yeah just to be in you know happy and some now there's there's a lot of stuff like that\nThe er the F word for for saying derogatory towards gay people bundle of text or whatever it was you know yeah the terms change and do that stuff yeah I don't know I don't know what they meant he says then amend flatulence cut us [laughter]\nYou know it sounds weird though were laughing about it and stuff because we think it means something else or let's go to Mike you're on the Mike Helton show what's happened in\nThe morning It's MORNING I ... I Want to do a just stay on track uncorroborated that is the one word that got a cat with all kept saying it built for people that she claimed worried there that night stated under going on under the\nUnder perjury is on a statement that they it never happened so her story is uncorroborated\nOr ask yourself dish if something were to happen to you and all all the all you have is your memory of it you think that somebody else was there you go to the state attorney's office walk into the state attorney's office and tell them something happened\nAnd if you can't prove that with evidence\nWithout your ... without somebody to back you up but you bring you bring your friends and I go to your portrayed lego mope I'd never happened right there's not not a first year attorney going to take that the court yeah not nobody is when you think that the court yeah I totally understand where he is uncorroborated and it came from a ... a repressed memory\nMhm so that's that's the biggest issue is that it comes from a repressed memory as well\nRight and I I don't doubt that something happened to her yeah I think that uh we all agree we go I we don't know we weren't\nThere but it doesn't seem like there are any facts or any a grain of this from anybody else in her saying the story which\nIf the situation did happen the way she said it happened it's terrible for her it's terrible for her that had happened Lewis and it's terrible that nobody believes are because there's nobody they come back up or do any of that stuff Mike I appreciate your call\nBut don't think at this party like someone would have seen them go into a room or something maybe maybe not and\nI think about this though thinking about this German what did you eat for a dinner to Wednesday's ago\nOh probably ... [laughter] I don't know the thing about that\nWas two weeks ago for dinner you know or or or or whatever you stop at a convenience store what color shirt was the guy wearing who was over by the slippery machine it just stuff that you're not paying attention to it and if you're in a party and you're drinking and having fun and you don't know what's going on over there you may be ... outside on the back deck\nAnd then this has happened in this room over here it's one of those ... or it's not happening you know what I mean I have no idea and to try and bring up this much long later I feel like I've said a million times I don't know what happened yeah and I feel horrible if this happened to her yes obviously we don't want this to happen\nBut we don't know ... all it is as her saying yes he did this and he's saying no he did write that I Know how much we can do\nI Believe her story but she can't prove that way I Am I watching her tell her yesterday I totally believe that that happened but you there's no way to say back in Nineteen eighty two that he was the guy that was there you can't you there's no way to prove that\nYeah let's uh we'll take a couple more phone calls and we're not going to spend the whole time talking about this but obviously this is the big story let's go to Jason you're on the Mike ... show what's happened to do some\nGood are you guys for good what are you at\nYour ... I got two points um first one to\nMy dad I was top secret military Claire ... and has been vetted by the government and both times alright\nKavanaugh's been vetted six times by the FBI not includes talking a neighbors strangers high school friends he's been vetted six times it's something we're always there you would think that would have come to light\nThe second point is some motive this is more important than the election of president for both sides but Supreme Court as a physician oil like sure yeah if you are the conservative or liberal church\nIt affects this country for the next Twenty years\nAnd that that could be part of the motive job wise you would\nMake a claim that might not be completely true in an effort to derail it and the goal is that the Democrats are just try to be the latest anyway as as as was said yesterday by this I don't know if they're trying to hold the seat over mhm so there's this wonderful you do it\nYeah I agree Jason\nBoth good points man yeah that's that's totally true you know that he's been better than a bunch of times and you would think that this would have come up before that so I don't know but uh let's go to a Patty Patty you're on the Mike ... what's happening\n[noise] hey I just wanted to say good morning sorry guys good morning in the morning I just wanted to say talking from experience that it's very hard for a woman to come out\nAnd literally accuse somebody sure and I was Fifteen Years old when that happened to me and still to this day I'm living with it but I don't hold it against a person but you know\nGuys do funny things and it's very hard when you're in a situation like that to come forward 'cause it's like they say people don't believe you and it's a very frightening situation\nAnd still to this day I haven't told my mom and I just it's it's just a hard thing to come out and say well what I\nThink she should it did is filed charges against them I said it's a court and I agree with the gentleman they are wasting our tax dollars money and she suggests plastic kid a mental court\nCourtroom and let the courts take hold of it because they're just saying something it's just it's ... yeah it's very hard to praise\nRight yeah I heard about it I'm Sorry that that happened to you and I think yeah you you make your point there but it's like we've been saying over and over again if this happened to her it's terrible or we don't know whether it happened\nTo her yeah and unfortunately almost all she has her word against his word and is that enough for this guy to lose the Supreme Court appointed his career he's losing his whole career yeah\nI think that most of the senators pad their mind made up before this they don't care whether it happened or not yeah\nAll right let's move on from that uh obviously is going to be big discussion the you know they're going to be voting today and doing all that stuff so we'll hear more about it but I don't want to you know kill the whole show with it it's\nWe know return to the Mike Celtic show on what to buy the bone I here's\nSome other news around the world at twenty nine year old guy named Robert mutual from Nashville was pulled over Monday for speeding the cops told him to get out of his car and he wouldn't eventually they figured out why Robert had five counterfeit one hundred dollar bills to pay Jim between his but she\nSays you know and ah he has

I haven't got into the second season yet\nThough I don't know why that Kristen Bell yeah she doesn't annoy\nMe she's a little an eye on that show but I don't know why her yeah I think that's her care that much whether she's pretty but I don't think she's pretty she's ... she's just very like I go yes clearly she's for it yeah girl next door to ask I think for me really yeah\nHer I first saw her in forgetting Sarah Marshall and ever since that movie I she ... she says ...\nEnd up eating out her up against uh the other ... nothing yeah\nThat's what really would like to see in any way to make fun of me as mad about it I really liked that show weren't they talking about that they were yeah but I don't I think Paul Riser without\nHelen Hunt tried to disappear yeah like she was in a couple of movies and others will say never see her in anything\nAh Tom Hanks stepped out of his trailer to show off his signature Mr Rogers cardigan look in the title upcoming bio pic\nAbout Mr Rogers the Trice our film is based on the true story of a friendship between Fred Rogers and a journalist named Tom junior nod or this is pretty good we have a picture up on bone TV of Tom Hanks as Mr Rogers of man he really nailed but yeah it does yeah it looks\nA lot like him which is interesting because Tom son Ptolemy Hanks actually play Mr Rogers and Drunk History yeah they do that I'm Drunk History in a column anxiety young Mr Rogers though Tom tom Hanks playing Mr Rogers or for that ...\nI Love Tom Hanks yeah couldn't imagine being colon Hanks and trying to even you know and he's not the ... be loved American icon that Tom Hanks has\nNo but Tom Hanks was until later on in his life you know I mean although I Love blues and buddy's be mothers in such a great\nIt kind of bums me I now there Tom Hanks only plays old men [laughter] like the Nazis at that point of his life now we're all of his characters he's playing the old guy no not\nAll of them Robert Blendon with the uh the which will call Dan Brown books and stuff yeah oh yeah he's not an old guy in that particular\nPlay like solitaire you with the airplanes do plain mister Rogers ... like it out themselves old man but he's not like the young vibrant ... he's the old guy he's old ah no that's like kind of moms yeah man because it's\nGoing to be sad and I'm going to be very sad when he passes away I feel like it makes me older a interesting thing Tom Hanks and starting the next high school musical oh so I Would be very\nWeird and finally in news according to a new survey the average man spends how long a year hiding in the bathroom lighting hiding in the bathroom yeah like to get away from you know get some quiet time get away from their kids or why for", "show_name": "Loveline", "year": "2018", "city": "Sarasota", "day": "01"}
