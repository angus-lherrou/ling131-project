wouldn't let you in the hall of fame\nI think it's a whole lot deeper than that I think I think if he had to do some stuff you know some personal stuff over 'cause I felt kind of sad for them because it's it's like it was a you know and they had the table set up or Easter biased baseballs and all this other stuff that white\nMan in his age or what he's done you know really it it it it was it was like a a needs more pennies\nAnd also his ... is baseball's have to be worthless\nBecause he signed so many like I had\nI had a rose a Jersey signing my office and I started running on the space I took it down and I I Would think and I love Pete I Love ... to ... a nice guy he's certainly a great baseball player but he is autograph service so diluted that it's not worth the ball that it's written on\nOh ... you read it but it's you know he said he lives out in Vegas for obvious reasons dad he uh he sits down like four hours every day you just saw him stuff yeah but I like golly that's thousands and thousands of whatever like you said they're not worth anything\nAny has to sign that many that make to make any money off because Everytime I go out to Vegas He's out there in a mall signing because you need that again on the man that's his problem is that he's you know nobody's shocked by this but he's just got a huge gambling problem and ah\nI don't think he's ever addressed that I think he tried to hide it and tried to deny it so that should be the reveal anything in this show or did he basically just tell you everything already knew\nWell you know used he used his mind is still great I mean he knew all of his numbers obviously by heart yeah but it kinda he kinda went into was when he was growing up and his dad was a a a gambling hall or whatever you wanna call it
