I'm trying to look like\nUnderstand the level of excitement that I'm watching a larger space 'cause I'm hearing what you say is giving staples\nSeveral cells Rena ... half of their ... mushroom soup

in their ... stuffed mushrooms Brett know really I like the texture of mushrooms\nYeah I I don't know the little ones in there with the flavor I don't mind at all and all of it either but I'll eat stuffed mushrooms\nAnd the taste of any of that crap no huh no mother\nOf all comfort foods is what it's called no and I feed so famous she's in the national Inventors Hall of fame next to Thomas Edison and there's a light bulb is her card with the green bean casserole recipe ought to\nGet out of his you not I've never even heard of it yeah\nThat's a crazy part I you've never even I heard that

Sorry what was going to say\nSo uh you know this has been a a a topic in a headline it's come up a few times in the last few weeks schools\nOn career days or diversity days are exposing kids to\nA more diverse people so in this case in Colorado and it's a it's a career day\nI don't know how this works 'cause this was in a career it's definitely a diverse choice ah the school district decided to apologize to parents after hosting a drag queen as part of a career day so it's we're six to eight graders and the dry queen a Jessica ... came into the\nKids were in a God why why wouldn't you tell the parents and a make or change her name\nBut what if the for what though for ... what was well purpose up going to\nBe a career oh my gosh people make a lot of money as Dr ...\nThat's true I guess you could I guess it could be a career and here is a of the news story on all\nThe reaction from the parents and the principal and\nAlso a you will hear from Jessica Laura\nBeagles from students at rocky taught middle school I go through the halls of the building last friday has a drag queen made her way through [noise]\nVideo posted online shows the reactions of six through eighth graders a relative of the student drag queen Jessica will hoar volunteer to the people\nI knew that was that be controversial because that was something I Would never expect to be allowed like when I was growing up in middle school I'm at the same time I took it as an opportunity because I got to talk to a bunch of kids and kind of open up a new door for conversation\nFor district spokesperson job for ... for the schools the focus is to have an event that is representative of diverse backgrounds and careers within their community\nEvery class had one person asked me about how to handle with negativity bullying\nDistrict to apologize for not there to find parents what is it has to do with Korea\nI still don't know I mean Monica ...\nCan make some income by ... at a student who came out to me asking me about diversity and bullying\nDoes it have to do with a career that better play and that's what we're talking\nMuch you can be a drag queen as a career and and getting mock and you know that's not a real clear what what are you doing with your life or what's wrong with your whatever so I can understand both of those\nWhat what is the heart of the career where do you go to make money is going\nYou libraries parties and yet parties part is for me hired like a ... ... people used to do or\nDie wired writer there you go okay but\nHere's is that really what you want in school for career day all shouldn't we be sitting there were all upset Lenny ... will\nDo what'd you wonder if there was a kid in class that is Len during you know questioning himself and I are herself and not sure about their sexuality or what they want to do work it's okay to feel the way they're feeling or think and then\nThis person comes up and how inspired you get okay I'm going to be okay this person's making a living well what the things I'm questioning right now I think it's amazing\nI don't\nIf the drug [laughter] one of the drug group we replaced like a dad who was a fireman or a mom who have executive or a\nA dad who was an extra you know whatever I mean more like careers\nCareers you bring in a well what about that with that top to finally come on let's get big outside of the box people\nAbout what about a drag queen or\nOut of the box get back in the box everybody back in the [laughter] the road that I just I don't know\nWhatever I don't even think in six to eight grade is and I swear to God I don't think I knew what a drag queen was in the new one day how\nI feel like you shouldn't I feel like it it it was so hush hush and shameful and that's why nobody talked about it it's okay to get out in the open it's not shameful let's not a bad thing nobody\nI knew what gay was like I didn't want to you know you know like I didn't I didn't\nSee it a shameful my ... my sister's best friends with gay was always around the house that was never a problem wasn't an issue with my father was never gave was never an issue in my house\nAnd everything that you just said should apply to drag queen as well\nI understand it but I don't even need like an eighth grade I didn't know what a drag queen was I knew a gay was I didn't know what a drag queen was\nI don't know like ...\n... more positive mom did oh\nNo we didn't grandma for that matter your grandma was getting down in fourth grade\nLittle John how to make a living as drag queen from corporate gigs to side hustle for queens tell us how they work as a result of this will be with the rest\nOf the news [laughter] great my hearing should've known in advance who was going to be freaking then that didn't happen in this particular situation and they\nWill moving forward one student's parents and CBS for an email saying quote parents are in an outrage and this is so inappropriate on so many levels for Donny told CBS for he felt parents would have been more understanding and approving if the school gave prior context to visit\nThe overall goal of that the message of self love and finding a job that you love and staying in school and using your education to find a better lifestyle that you can go to a job every day\nFrom on about that\nParents whose parents were an outrage parents are outraged because it looking for something to be pissed off about\nI Want to know if it wasn't my kids were surprised by the apparent road to a CBS for men a letter saying W T F [laughter]\nWhen I was like what [laughter] the fall and\nI couldn't believe this ... [laughter]\nSo uh I was just reading a little bit about Alaska father\nFive thousand ... Alaska thunder F five thousand\nSays so [laughter]\nI mean what a great I Wish I Wish that was Dr briefly for the school\nInstead of just like all the horror but Alaska's thunder F five thousand so that are doing parties are dancing offer money apparently is a great way to\nDo ... and you're having one way or is that career day uh basically ... guy yeah yeah and you don't think we need to raise the bar a little bit ...\nParties a week and and Alaska thunder five thousand also throws his own Pearl is her own party called bananas party is carbon out of her right and uh she calls it but not as as you also makes money to side with real estate and writing for a Web site [noise]\n\n[noise]\nSo and puts out a whole show like travels to Milwaukee puts on a whole show for people so I mean this is interesting there is a way to make income as Monica said Peters\nThere's people that can go in there and and like be be apart starter and and you know\nI mean I was just said it Roger said part of one of the things is stripping one or the other thing that I didn't say\nIt also straight I just dancing as well like a show on the stage that includes dancing and talking with people and being a the drag queen person that they paid to say\nHey listen I'm ... I Would go to a drag showed is a place in the city at a restaurant that does it drag shows all the people I Know that have gone to have had a blast I Would totally go I just don't I don't know if I don't know if it needs to be in a a a\nYeah that's all they're interested or maybe the boss should be a little ... and that's all [laughter]\nI don't know why our\n... because you said the bar should be the drawn to the bar\nAlthough ... whatever it is listening protest protest\nYeah\nWell you know I'm not knocking the people among ... or whatever you do I'm just saying maybe maybe just maybe the\nThing that it's a ... but also why why are you allowed to have beer in eighth grade but this person can't learn about at career that maybe you don't want to choose but it should be an option\nNobody was giving it to me I was doing things and I wasn't doing it at school I got about\nNo so you're mentality my point is people are saying oh there in ... ... ... they know more especially in this day and age than people give them credit for they are not ...\nOr lifestyle or sexual education by chase us but the thing is there's a charming place for everything okay alternative rare but to me that's just no debt and they all changed address saying you know that these kids get a lot\nLess time around you're a big fan of big taxes aren't you get mad\n\nThe pay is a piece of man he's All right\nIt's not worth it that was the best one I don't why they why didn't even want to hear you got to give up my God that government [laughter] you're a Democrat evil Democrat what you're talking about\n[laughter] I mean I guess if he was one who he thinks he wouldn't want to point six billion ended up with only seven hundred million\nRight now he's the guy and complaining they told him I really don't want it they will be able to advertise it like that Mm I don't get I get it\nToo much man\nI mean maybe not wrong there no matter what the real number in parentheses underneath the victim\nOf the real number is your take it over Twenty years you get one boy was over the a lotta time twenty thirty whatever it is\nIt's one point six million average taxes will leave you will for taxes\nYour salary as well when when you go into a job but you accept an offer your salary is before taxes they don't tell you what it is after taxes were\nSet up to them they'll probably blow a gasket\n[laughter] I don't really I couldn't even at that point I couldn't\nGet off the phone fast because I knew he was all mad [laughter] All right it's time for the uh toddlers are you\nTaking pain pills and now that you're supposed to ... you take an ... well you know just just help me sleep [laughter] that ... are you taking the paying bills you well just tell me so I don't get up to ...
