everything\nI'm ... tell me about a\nWho's who in your eyes who is the biggest celebrity that you worked with so far like when I heard you were doing them over to narrow it was like oh jeeze God you've made us ally easily Jodie Foster Jodie Foster when did you do with Jodie Foster\nA movie called hotel or to miss it all I think it's going to hit the festival circuit this year but generally there's going to every story festival route to cast as as a monster cash is how many Jody\nOr certainly could brown who's just been cleaning up in the war ... into a Charlie de ... those are great because there's more than I Am I missing but uh yeah those and what's it about [noise]\nUh well you know it's I don't want to get away from us 'cause I don't know what they do guy about but it's it's based on the kind of that kind of the near future and uh but it is good stuff\nAnd when you meet a Jodie Foster ... who she looked at you and she sees muscles in borrow movies she ah\nRight away have respect for you or do you have to earn that for me to all you have to earn a review and well\nYeah I mean let me\nLet me take a quick story are going to meet her and I'm super nervous and you know they really wanted to play because Jody super tiny like five feet tall okay and they really wanted to play it's me and I enjoy the opposite of that this whole film so they really wanted to play off the size difference and so I go on for my first read and she's just looking at me she's looking at me\nAnd she goes you're not nearly as big as I tell you [laughter]\nAnd I'm like heartbroken ha ha you haven't second I'm\nCrushed master literally bugging me for the right like the rest of the day and I was telling a neither one of the cast members later as like you know it's a little concern and they said it was mentioned whether you know how do you think you know I Am ex or yeah she's telling me like Liam Neeson is way\nBigger than a [laughter] ... you know like\nMan yeah again I guess she was but she's a she's a sweetheart of a woman\nYeah yeah I Love her and you guys you guys get along Amy not anybody you don't get along with that only Starbucks and I don't it you don't get along no\nYou know I've only had a ... a couple of bad experiences my whole career really and I wouldn't care to mention them at all but they were just people and not necessarily that I didn't get along with what they didn't treat people very well so I just don't like them right I just don't like people don't you people are afraid of you\nKnow I mean lots of what I mean and now we're treating ... see the way it would be because I'll I'll you know I'll say look step outside of Las Vegas so yeah that's a conversation I Want to have well I just you know I just you know I'm just not that guy\nYeah yeah when does the um when does the mess of press start for or guardians or for the next year audience or adventures I'm Sorry for the adventure I probably I Would imagine ... march April and give me give me an idea\nHow that works what did they tell you okay we uh you're going to be going to New York for a week LA for me like how does it usually works\nIt's yeah pretty much but you know I don't know because it's not um obviously I'm not the biggest movie star in this film so I don't know how you're actually the star the second gardens but I mean there's I mean this I mean we're talking about young major a list as you were in the strong and so I don't know how much of the press responsibilities will be on my shoulders\nGotcha okay man that's a yeah it's a very humble thing they say no I mean well think about it I Know but I saw the editors than even though the Guardian's I mean ... is is a huge star now he's like you do\nNow you know him you're a well a product of a boy and and you I I I get to the same thing to you\nOr how hard is it for you guys to be good looking guy in good shape you know and and be married I mean I Would imagine every girl found love Chris pat in the last five years yeah it's hard it's gotta be hard\nTo go out there and and have girls themselves I yeah your they don't situation we're in a happy you're unhappy relationship or happy yeah\nChris Brass not married and you know now that's what I was going to lie\nAnd I don't know what do you do with that but I'm just saying that it's got to be a ... got to be difficult situation is one of the things I don't know if you want me to tell us when the time one of the things that I ... they were saying the other night was um you know that he told us when he was on the show when the first guardians came out that\nThey put on the News I'm rubber pieces on drugs as a body odor that tattoo markings kind of thing\nAnd he said and that after they finally figured out a way to take them off they have the steam room for a while and then they come and they kind of just just alum off and it makes it easy\nAnd he said that ah that bears his uh he's got his start man who has to do the same thing and that he's got three guys that have to offer him and this time and gets three girls [laughter]\nI ... I Would add to call my wife and go can you can I just had the girls are in our face time of year already on it yeah I my\nWhole makeup team they're all guys in his makeup team is is that pretty much girls there she's I think there's usually for makeup artist and three of my girls are ah yeah and he's like coming out of the sun or like you know like he's a\nRow with re cute girls I you know girls sadness Shay all [laughter]\nThey're all did he get his father or either by\nThe way we just joining us on the show a day but these days here you know him from ah the guardians of the galaxy you know him from a wrestling use a a guy who is\nA Spanish that he just sized other movie buff way yeah but it's like an Blade Runner twenty forty ... yeah ... yeah\nThe ... did you love that movie ... ...\nYeah no it was great experience when you I mean think about this I worry about the same age when you're a kid and you're watching Blade Runner and you're like wow this is a great movie throughout his never thought in your head that there'll be a sequel you'll be in the sequel I mean I'm over here to be a wide twelve Thirteen when it came out\nThey want ear you send the check to them and then they send you money or they deposit money in your account right and that was like I'm not giving\nYou might say like I didn't quite understand how it goes and I still by the way\nDon't do that or because I said to him and they said well here the process is to make sure that I said listen I'm married to a Jew from Jersey\nIraq is a dime an hour and then they ... they actually have to like\nFive years the agency they said we just want to you know your wife is the best client we have\nShe is uh is she is on time with everything yeah it's a very interesting yeah but now when you get and so you get a boatload of money then it goes your agency and they take a therapy Saturday Night than he ever manager to yeah he gets a piece of it and then by the time it comes to you like do you guys were that I work all these months for all these guys chip on my money out of there\nAre men I again I I couldn't tell you the last time I looked at a pitcher\n... genuinely happy at yeah doing what you do it's not for the money is not for the fame you're just loving your life right on yeah yeah pretty much that's pretty I I'm happy I always say there's a guy I always say they're not here you're one of the nice guys you're like ... I'm so glad to see you having success\n'cause uh I'm a long time ago when you were just wrestling and you can tell you weren't really thrilled with it at that point and you never know what's going to mean a lot of your guys as you start out that way yeah we'd go by the wayside and you never you never hear about what they're doing and they're working on a jury live somewhere yeah\nI mean seriously I mean how hard it would be you walk out to a crowd of Seventy thousand people and then after a five year run you get fired and when he expected to do we expect to go work\nRight well I think it's all you know it's all a matter of what you want life and now it's everything's you know like I put everything in perspective you know I you know undertake are said to me one time like years back you said always live beneath your means and I think a lot of guys they lose sight of the night and I did for a while as well totally lost sight but\nAlso the thing is like I think it's what you want out of it you know a lot of these guys they just love the spotlight they love the money they love the flash\nYeah and just never meant anything to me about that too that's interesting because that is the probably the attraction for most people will go to it yeah I'm ... also should follow that he'd have I don't get married twelve times [laughter]\nBut I Will help you to live above your means he uses Christ that ... mile thing when I was like are these people don't have best friends like if I\nGive my buddy you know Pete Pete ever decide to get married again I'd have to call Kathleen ... yeah but it but it before and I was against that one too but uh if he was in there again I'd be the guy to come up and go hey I don't\nKnow who who who would you say is your best friend who was a guy who you talk to every day\nNow it's all it or\nYeah it's either it's my wife or my buddy Jonathon Jonathon ... it was my manager I've known since I was a teenager yeah yeah we go way way back so did you feel the pressure to hire him as your manager no knowledge you know the way it had happened was so I wanted to go into wrestling I was you know closing in on thirty ... broke I didn't know what to do with myself and I thought maybe I'd go into wrestling but what did you do\nBefore that I was a bouncer how's the bouncer for like Thirteen\nYears she was just a big guy always a big guy bouncing when I was Seventeen years old right now and then you were like I'm gonna try professional wrestling at thirty yeah while I was like twenty eight twenty now still way way later than you guys just\nYou know I didn't know what to do it's been so many years in the gym and kind of floating through my twenties now you know I got wrapped up in you know work in the clubs it was easy cash only wanted to do is lift weights right\nAnd so uh yeah ... thirty I Know what to do with myself and I I they were having open tryouts WCW at the time and so anyway I went for a trial and they blew it and you know he told me never come back [laughter] and never be functional wrestler and then there really wasn't really that\nBad you always or will really literally they yeah yeah it was just it was embarrassing they chased me out of\nThere [laughter] well did you have any idea what did you wrestle and high schoolers I ... well okay so you knew a little something at least\nYeah but it was it really wasn't that it was really more like it was like a boot camp training the guy was like three hundred and fifty pounds in like the next the guy next to me it was like a hundred and eighty pounds on the same stuff like same cardio a yeah in Grand me into the ground and the guy just focused on me and just\nYou know wrote me too I threw up and told me at least at least get out of you'll never be a professional wrestler\nI see her in that area you know that was the remember that guy as it was it was so hard\nIs it a powerhouse trainer suddenly yeah what what would the ... power plant power plant added members power plant and he's ... now that you get it now you get your your past will cry on day\nYeah and like you know bill I you know I don't know probably ... [laughter] I probably think I'm you know millions you'd\nBe like you're right I I was a never going to make it as a restaurant ... millionaire\nMovies are now for motor yet and I did a lot of stuff out of spite right [laughter]\nI think that I did that wrestling career and I stretch as long as long as I could I'm Sorry but I did go on to bigger and better they are [laughter] so so you ah so you found WCW and then what happens now Muslim but what do we as they were having open\nTryouts at the time sir I paid my few hundred dollars a month for a trial they'd you know the tower and so about a week later I called up a ... they were still WWF at the time called up actually my buddy called him up Jonathan yeah\nAnd I asked if they were having trials and they said no but they recommended to camp so I went to train was off of the wild Simone oh yeah so I literally I'm Jonathan let me the money to move from Washington DC up to Allentown, Pennsylvania uh so I could go up there and start training and that's what I did for about a year I trained with them and then I got a contract with W W\nELL kidding yeah that's great that's great team but that's a that's a couple of life lessons there first of all follow your dreams but second of all don't anybody tell you know good right if you want to know everyone knows that guy right he would've just brought back to bounce and he'd been the world's most wasted town of a bouncer yeah usually\nI get obsessed with things that I find out that I'm really bad and right you know I guess the challenge thing I Love\nYou do ... that's why I'm completely opposite when they go you're not gonna go okay [laughter] I got to take a nap\n[laughter] yeah ... that's going to be a good way to get into acting\nI found out I was horrible and I didn't think it would be so bad 'cause otherwise before that I had no aspiration to be an actor\nReally so now now you do it now you're sought after and even now you got movies line down yeah who picks them you pick 'em Jonathan pick some combination\nWe do we do a team thing yeah entertain things some things are very they're very calculated you know we we've I've taken probably take it along route and my career but we were hoping that it would lead somewhere special some are great which it it has because I when I first left WWE I was getting offered really bad rules really strict\nMarine five and a\nDad you know and it was a weird me because it was actually Austin who was a Steve Austin who told me to watch out for that and not get to ... you know it's not get stuck in that route 'cause we would if you start getting taken those roles like they'll just you'll just get stuck in that rare that's all people will see you as a straight to DVD\nYeah especially being a big guy at the enemy the bad guy and every body type\nCast me in every film that I and I just turned out a lot of roles and at the time it was hard because I wasn't making any money\nYeah yeah yeah you want you want to do it but you gotta you gotta hold out\nYeah tell you that was that was a great thing about the WWE I mean that chick came every every Monday that was probably the last paycheck I saw was\nWWE ... yeah that would have been you know a thousand ten and you get for WWE you get your salary and then they have this weird bonus system\n... it's really a weird a payment system it's actually a so you have your guarantee but nothing goes off a guarantee unless you're a girl like injured or you're just one of those guys who is just not working much ... percentages of shows and pay per view and it's different now I think that they have the network I don't know how they do it but that's all was\nSo you so you got um a three raw shows we are the main event on raw\nRight because you're leading up to a pay per view and then at that paper you're the mayor of another pay per view and so then that next jak at the fat check that's where that's where our money came from pay per views and merchandiser I remember one undertaken lived here he would just get random forty thousand dollar checks from regular size yeah it has to be great\nAnd it was usually like oh we used to get that check after Christmas and that was when all the the the video\nHoly hell's yeah and those are the like the great judgment you still get the U.S or do they own you're a character like no they do\nOn it and I was one of the things when I went to in the WWE they change my name or things of spelling in my name and I can figure out why they did it and and it was ... she said well you know be easier to pronounce his way and it was like you know\nBecause you guys you know and uh\nHe fight them on a very few be like ... got to uh to keep you got to keep the owner why because they like it I think he was pulled before you went to W. W. right by the by a lot of times they want to absorb that once you come in he fought it but then that always creates animosity you don't want to be that guy I mean look or you know\nThere's so much animosity there yeah but I yeah I don't know how that worked with him you know having the name before he went and\nSee I have enough money saved to be some of those no I think\nSo and I think he's still he's still making a very good living you know yeah I'm Still in high demand like people really want to see him he's just\nOne of what for what though I mean like he's doing independent shows are yeah\nI think you know I don't think he's done indies but he just you know you had a he did really well on TV yeah he created such a fan base for himself and he in Asia great guy and he does all the you know he does he wrote for uh the ... a comic for a while yeah how is that it's great ... great and he don't let\nMe I don't even know if you know this but uh so I have this um marvel encyclopedia that have had for years and after the ... I didn't know anything about guardians right so after the first guardians came out I went and buses that open and looked up all the characters\nAnd a drag because we only one that was like a pre existing actor\nI'm no they should have been in there I mean they won\nThe guardians of the galaxy as a group as a grew now like a more ... himself was in as a soul like had other parents and other things before or guardians yeah isn't that weird I I like I don't know what are the I don't think give you a history lesson on the thing or they go and I did", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Loveline", "city": "Sarasota", "day": "05"}
