blood sucking fly teaching is that is that really what it is a guy I Believe you oh you were an for a little bit I was like did you just say that and then luckily because of the spelling worked out they gave the blame and now you're right now are you are like when you\nQuestioned me oh I just wanted to know though I didn't know this year I decided to check in with you on the news\nWhat are we avenues ... at a rally in uh south haven Mississippi Tuesday night President Trump mocked Christine Blasey Ford who testified before Congress last week the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they're both in high school\nAh [laughter] this is pretty you're I mean this is the indication of in this area in Mississippi people seem to be on Capitol outside and on Trump decides oh God I got this video here we go\nWhat's happening now who's just crazy is what's happening now um they\nHad gang rang again\nTurned out to be from\nSo many different charges guilty\nUntil proven innocent that's very dangerous Veronica dangers\nAnd I have in my ... but for me it's like a part of the job description but it happened to me she didn't happen to him the ... what he's going Thirty years ago this time\nI had one beer right I Want to be\nWell do you think it was I was wondering\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago when I don't\n[laughter]\n\nWhat was it and I don't know where I'm now ... says marijuana I don't know but I mean that's the only thing [noise]\nI don't know\nMan my ... a man lies just shattered his wife ... daughters who are beautiful incredible\nYoung kids they destroyed\nBefore they want to destroy these really evil mean mom's name\nWas ... she brings us from your point but uh brings up some good lyrics to mend lives shattered man's wife has tattered or whatever they had\nA man who's ... a man wise is shattered his wife ... daughters who are beautiful incredible the\nMega arms are yeah life is ... ... is beautiful do does start to\nA man but they all seem to be on Trump's side and Kevin outside your like your line is drawn you ladies align yeah but I mean white ...\nThe problem is is that or if he's right about one thing it's become lately and not just for this for everything a guilty until proven innocent sure which is not the way Ira makes in this country and that's the way it's coming now that also a ... in this case it's hurting the victim because\nNow there's so much talk about guilty until proven innocent that it's taking away from what may be the truth\nWith uh the this woman in a woman in her claim it's it's ... it's it's really ridiculous I don't know how anybody ... let's just say Cavanaugh is a good guy has nine\n... imagine if he is absolutely incident free okay if he'd never assaulted any of these women if there was some sort of into that have between the two of them itchy blowing out of proportion I'm saying this just completely hypothetically\nImagine what he's going through now for nothing right yeah okay sure imagine what he's going to use like I was a judge I was a good judge for thirty three years why are they doing this to me well I Would not want to be I Would not even want to be part of it\nAnd then for her she she was sexually assaulted now she's got to relive all this stuff again and then people are calling her a wire the president's calling or lie or it's a lose lose for both of them are really is it's disgusting way this is being carried out and we always want to make women feel comfortable and make them be able to come forward if they do actually have\nA situation we want them to feel like that if they come forward there'll be protective and there'll be supportive\nBut in this case it because it was so long ago and it's just the two of them and none of their nobody else's story is lined up it's making one of them wherever it turned out to be looked like a huge lie yeah\nIn the big thing is uh you know whenever they make the blanket statement you see people at these headlines or what the shirts and stuff that they believe all women you can so I'm Sorry I Can't\nThat that goes right along with guilty until proven innocent right you have to see the fact you have to know what's going on and it's something that happened thirty six years ago or whatever it's hard to know what happened to prove that hard to prove what happened yeah there's a lot of things man there there's a lot of times\nA week I think Spanish you murdered this guy ... account for where you were on Tuesday while I was by myself nobody else around no job well yeah but I Know you're an alibi but what you mean by\nHow many times are you by yourself just hanging out\nAnd yet but you have to think about that like back in those days when there was it as much social media in like\nCameras just equipped it around you you know what I mean like it was it was a lot harder to prove that yeah so for women back in a day that was it was harder to come out because there was no way to prove these things so now that we like people are standing up and they're having\nA voice and they get a more comfortable they're coming out and trying to you know like stick up for what happened to that but you can't prove it so at the same time it's like a double edged sword because there is no winning for ... for her especially you know what I mean\nI Am afraid to make fun of you for saying quote the ...

to open up a a an adult area and I like the planet Hollywood and don't they have like a ... ... casino out and yeah\nBut even if they if they put one or two properties on one or two places on their property that we're gambling establishments oh man I Would be fantastic\nYeah but you let me tell you the state or the average things up\nRemember for years when it came to expand it gambling and this was before Charlie Crist made the dug a very good deal the state of Florida with assemble Indians and keep in mind at that time the symbol Indians were holding us hostage they said look we are we going to commit eighty billion dollars in tax revenue to the state of Florida if we get this contract Chris sign that people were pissed\nYou know the Indians could have said OK screw you were going to the department of Indian affairs in Washington and cut a deal with them\nWill give Washington eight billion dollars and not the state of Florida Charlie Crist is hands were tied he had to make that deal with the Indians and you got to remember for years the state of Florida said it's a statewide referendum which we're looking at here with us your song three which is a nightmare\nAnd all these para mutual the dog tracks horse tracts they're constantly losing money and give a slot machines give a slot machines in the states said no and then the state finally said I'll tell you what do it on a county wide referendum you go to the county voters and if you can pass it by a certain amount we'll let you have slot machines\nLake County which is Naples Fort Myers\nSarasota kennel club Jacksonville Orange Park up in Panama City borough is that track all voted for slot machines overwhelmingly right Florida said yeah we kind of changed her mind on that can't have it now really off and then just Supreme Court ah\nSo you're talking about up and up a free lunch the state of Florida can do what we saw with medical marijuana\nI don't understand why they're so against the gambling I mean you have to look ... look who's in charge yeah but I when I was saying is uh you you I mean look who's in charge that guy who seems like he'd sell his mother for money [laughter] I don't know I hate\nThat he's going to be like yeah I'll get out of me Martin was what do I get a perfect uh I don't know I I think that we're probably in this day and these are probably getting closer to it but we don't want to get sucked into voting for the wrong\nThing but look how many times they do that with the amendments remember the solar him and met a couple of years ago that was actually sponsored by who Duke Energy to that would actually halt all solar in the state of Florida we're called the sunshine state we should have solar tile panels on every home every ...\nI have some solar in my house
