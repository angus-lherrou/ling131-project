she was just in Berlin his wife and do you do the whole model of course\nAnd last night there was a ball was hit right jobs to the top of all just in the stands where ... bucks for the red Sox jumped up to try to catch it in the fans are reaching out to catch it themselves and their heads that his glove closed as ...\nThey made the wrong call Albany might have been able to catch you wasn't able to catch what they made the wrong ... the the well call you and I don't agree she said hashtags bowls call yeah they're not happy because it is a deal the ball\nSo by calling it an out what happened is the um the guy from the um ... lives are or what his glove got up over the wall put his glove out trying to catch him and his glove went up against fans and the globe closed right\nRight and the glove close so the umpires by calling in and out soon and that he was going to catch that ball now\nWhat they don't have to assume what is definite is that the ball was over the fence\n... there's no assuming that the boy was over the fence there is an assumption that he's going to catch that ball\nYou know nobody touches that it's going to be a home run by a little bit but it's I definitely route\nInto it's hitting the fan in the belly All right so you have to make an assumption to call in and out\nNo it was some ... for it to be a home run well that bullshit at home run\nYeah so and I can understand that that's an interesting argument because there's no assumption made on one side or however\nThe rule talks about um if a fan interferes with a player\nIn a situation where um they have a possibility of making a play like using them bits of making a play so even though fans are there and even though fans are reaching over and that's all okay uh you cannot interfere with a player and so he was interfered with\nAnd so that makes it um it out\nRight but how is he interfere with if nobody leaned over the fence you don't you well it's a pliable ball so what is so now all of a sudden the fans are supposed to back\nAway while it's just part of that I mean that's one of the fence steady income or they didn't lead on to the play was\nOver the wall right well that's supposed to be as overall you know\nWhat they're touching a ball that's actually in play and so that interferes with the players ability to make the play and so that's why they call them ... bad\nSo his gloves over the correct he's allowed to run the fans are allowed to go right up there right but they're not allowed to interfere with ... but they didn't the rules and what I'm reading writing rules three dot once his glove hit\nFans the fans didn't hit the glove well that's arguable one of the world I argue one of the rules I so I was no interference shall be allowed when a player reaches over a fence right that's where the good\nNo interference shall be allowed\nWhen you're making Ronald arguing and you're ... you may not interfere when a player reaches they have to give the play room\nTo make the play because otherwise years would you get there are going to start putting up the wall and then there's going to be eight feet and then you're going to start setting and if they had to so that no fan can ever interfere with something that's possible for the person for a player to catch\nAnd those who see I'd probably do and those in rows of seats that can make money right but I don't have the right\nRight so there's a there's a difference you know\nThe easy one is the ball is rolling down the right field line at a fan reaches over from their seats and almost tumbles out of the seats and picks the ball up before it bounces off it gets to the field that's the easy one\nClearly the player who didn't get to play it and so they're they're going to the old rules for that whether it's a double or whatever the deal is but in this case out of color so yup\nOh Houston as pissed because now the red Sox victory one and they happen to win by two runs which is what the home run would have been for all to me if it had been a lot so it's you know very controversial and ah jade opted not happy but\nAt the time I mean I saw it live and you know Joe ... is a better know borrows wars has
