{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WHPT", "content": "And he was going to take her to the brick and mortar downtown ever leave it's very ... I Would love to go there but I Can't afford it ...\nAnd then they went and he went and picked her up in his word rape her first date stupid went and picked her up\nHad a great meal or she sucked he didn't like her\nShe didn't seem like she liked him paid for a meal dropped her off\nAnd that was that they never spoke again how much do we throw down ... I mean at that place at least a hundred and fifty ... because ... says you're getting you know a couple of drinks too that's where they'll get you and I think those meals you're not getting their front or forty bucks a plate of Britain motor deal\nAs well I don't want to say that was stupid on his part but it was it forward it was if he can afford it sometimes one fifty is not a lot for people who have money well for me it that way and but yeah for people who have money that's just kind of are they fly ... one\nYear anniversary or something like a money yeah it's like ten year anniversary I don't know like my wedding and not having I don't really blame\nLadies were taken advantage of these type of scenario I mean you shouldn't take advantage of people I get it but if a due to dumb enough or maybe just like the we talked about\nBy the end um yeah I'd say that I mean if a guy says I like to treat a lady Ryder I'm more traditional and stuff listen it she's she wasn't saying this girl who wrote this article she said that sometimes when she would say let's say we can split the bill\nSometimes guys would take her up on it and she would split the bill with them so she wasn't saying now you're terrible she would do it but the guys that were more traditional wanted to take care of the bill maybe oftentimes they feel like that's where they find most of their value in their ability to provide especially if\nMaybe they're not very good looking or they're a little bit on the short side and they feel like this is really where they can show dominance and value is you know their\nFinances so they want to pay a my question to you which I'm asking but not really I think as we got to get out of here is is this such a bad thing is this is this the wrong thing to do I'm going to say no to the guy wants to pay and the girl wants to be taken out\nI mean it kind of sucks because they're thinking well maybe I got a chance for their when in reality he's like no I just\nWanted meal yeah yeah I mean I think it's fine to it's not\nNecessarily a ethical or moral I Would say but\nIf a dude wants to do it then let them take you out to dinner why not you ain't getting out of me I'm smarter a coffee and I make sure I get there early so I can get my coffee so by the time they get there they have to get their own ... now I'm thinking way ahead oh I Know him leap and broke had as a\n... yeah I mean I kind of look at this is a guy who just look into like hook up and maybe a girls a little bit more interested in he just he loses her you know maybe by the few drinks and and they they bang and then he never calls are again it's kind of the the same thing maybe but in the opposite direction you know\n[noise] perhaps yeah I mean you know it is what it is if if they do they're going to let you do it to them do it to them go do your thing\nIs and the same goes the other way like if a girl is willing to sleep with you on the jurors night and and then he doesn't call you and you get upset I'm Sorry that's just kind of how that happened same with guys you spend too much at the beginning that that's why I'm always very rather reticent\nAbout a releasing on whether it be resources or your time or your energy or your emotions you know you don't want to invest too much too soon you kinda gotta give a little if they take a little and they give a little back\nThen you take it to the next level and then the next level so you kind of keep on like even playing field instead of taking you know first date brick and mortar or banging on the first day you got to just kind of give a little bit of an investment guys I think that that's the best strategy if you're looking to to really find somebody and build something substantial absolute\nAnd with that
