is All right back to the topic of discussion here before hose ain't loyal a failure I Would love to hear from parents how do you teach your child how to fail gracefully like do you tell them that like what if your kid will didn't your you know hypothetical kid doesn't make the soccer team\nHow do you break it to your kid slash teenager that they're just not good enough\nHow do you tell that to a kid because that's obviously the reason why and the coach even said it like he was he was good but it wasn't that great he said however there were a few holes in his game including technical ability women's game and a game decision making that put them behind a number of kids we just didn't make the same\nSo what do you what do you tell your kid you're not good enough or or what what's the lesson to be learned you fail try again next tier I again\nYou the coach gave you the tools he said look you've got to work on your technical skills whatever that means I don't know exactly what that means but her as the coach how can I how can I get better how can I make this team next year you got you you have your answers right there yeah and you work on those things when you're seeing people appreciate that too when you\nAsked like take a real keen interest in things that I really want to do this having the want to also means a lot too that if you really want to be there\nYou know so absolutely a lot of people don't do that as us you know screw it so going in as I found this out in college\nWhen you go on the first day you just go up and introduce yourself really ah\nI hated classes but I'm very interested in in your class and I can't wait a normal learn a lot\nAnd they knew your name and I got away with a lot more stuff oh yeah you know and they had a personal connection with that and yet a personal can I Know your name and just just showing that no maybe you're not the smartest kid in class but he's not the one to that he wants he wants to do well\nAbsolutely and that means a lot to them absolutely and the thing is with like grades unless it's like a multiple choice or something like\nThat are are letting someone on a team it's ... it has a lot to do with if the teacher like you you know what I mean they want you to ... you know pass if you're a nice kid and you do well they'll give you the benefit of the doubt if you wrote an essay and you misspelled your name you know what I mean and what this coach like maybe this kid is a jerk off obviously his mom took him to court I\nHave a feeling it's probably not a very down to earth sorting kid so maybe this despite the kid but I completely agree with well like ask what you can do better next time and then doing practice higher I mean clearly mommy could hire a lawyer she'd probably hire a coach Jae go get better\nAnd he said you are so we still has next year to try out for the team and then it would be much more rewarding if he didn't make it comes back he's excellent makes the team happy day
