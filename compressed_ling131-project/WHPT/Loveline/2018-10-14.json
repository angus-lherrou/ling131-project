I mean where are you know was he smoking I saw him\nNo I didn't know he didn't look around me I didn't see him on his five minutes you're talking or something not even and then um why locked away honestly because the listener came up I'm going to take a picture with me and he felt awkward so he he walked away\nAnd then you guys never followed each\nOther on the I'm In after that no the game started I went inside I don't know where he went on and then but but I knew he started smoking after we broke up I Know that um\nYeah right but for a while ago and I think about them since well that's true you're right who knows\nA bill that does bother to know that he would walk away like if you had any intention Wyoming to hang out what you took a picture of like ... yeah but they weren't there together right why would hang up to talk a little more and more\nYou know I'm not mad walked away I just know argue that you know I'm just look at our behavior yeah\nWhy would hang around and talk to a little more if it was going well and you're like you and your stopping to see you I Would just walk away and not even say\nGoodbye or number we want to Facebook or Twitter or something\nBecause

he no that's not true\nWell you don't even know what I'm trying to figure it out\nNow we would do a bunch of radio things like he lived and I was on the radio and listen to me and he you know he ... he met on the radio people and\nYeah\nWho knows you might have a little note about what he's ...\nHe's not listening and he's he's I don't know what's his name I don't want to say now now it's weird now ah does he live on less than he can't let me know course not no more than I Do I Would have a God about the race or you know you're right [laughter]\nAny time really good percentage of dodge listen to show you know between a loving into every day and will support he wasn't going to miss this treasure\nBut I think you're making a mistake not even if you were if you could say that love was there I think you're making a mistake not just saying hey what's up ... you came up to give up my mind that I just want to reach out and say hello\n... five years ago or sick right how long ago that lots and lots of changed any ... of\nCourse I'm not so but what are you going on right now jak on ... ... ... so what I'm saying is why not just reach out and senator what do you what do you have to lose\nAnd fate of nothing was losing face the only reason you guys broke up with the timing suck\nIt strong he broke up with actually I feel like if he and like you just said he slowly you\nBroke up with him because the minute he says he says he wants to go further and they wanted to be a boy and he wants to be exclusive\nYou say no you broke it off\nAnd you think he's going to say oh okay well I'll just sit around airway boy\nWhen I when I can just say no and that was anyways listen I'm the timing is bad just gimme some money gimme some time\nAnd he knew all along I was very very vocal about the whole timing thing I'm like I like I Want to date you I Want to hang out why can't we just hang out and have fun with any labels on it right now down the road\nHe's order said no that's it yes and he was like no he needed it\nFeels like to a guy that you just not into it\nBut I when I told him I told the Roman don't speak guy and I want him for not understanding\nWhen I see the words down the road and we just keep a chill and then down the road somewhere and not wanting to break up I just don't know\nWhy but it also kind of sounds like you might be seeing other people but he wasn't done with it that doesn't ... did you tell them you want a thing of the people that\nWe were we were together all of the most hotel and we'd have no time they ...\nThey would be I mean you could look at al ... whatever you want but you could it could be just you being strong ... what's going on and talk to the ... and take it from there and see what he's up to and see what's going on not let him know right away\nWhere you know back your I'd like to go on but if you could join the whole situation about losing face at all\nI just feel like if somebody breaks up with me and then I reach out to them it's not I feel like the person\nWho Berliners later on the circumstances that weren't cheating situation or a hot tub tuition or anything like that\nI mean come on me those are real life to their body if I run in hitting that the bills bargain if I see him at the bar I Will make an appointment to test he came out and you know and chat with him and and do it that way I don't have

he was from by making it\nIs that I Will feed on that and I don't have the time you know\nTo be honest moniker you you do things like this all the time or you make reason you why you're not with somebody because you really do love being\nOn your own and I think you're more secure on your own with your cats and a chance meeting with somebody and you're not worried about if it doesn't happen because you can handle it all your very secure in your life and I think it's less scary than you are going into a relationship with somebody else you'd rather just got to hang up your\nBreath on line
