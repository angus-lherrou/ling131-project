dollars it is the richest deals eleven fights in five years yeah that's a lot yeah it's two almost two year yeah uh uh it is the richest deal in sports history what if he loses though\nThree in a row and still get the already signed a contract to use the money I Believe all star gene out gene are not sorry\nJohn Carlos ... is that what you're saying yeah yeah\nIt makes me want to say gene Carlo but I guess John Carla stand and had the previous record Thirteen year deal where three hundred and twenty five million lord we actually have the breakdown if you look up on bone TV so it's a\nThree hundred and sixty five million dollars over five years Seventy three million dollars per year six million eighty three thousand dollars per month\nOne million five hundred and twenty dollars per I mean one million five hundred and twenty dollars yeah per week\nOr per day he is making almost two hundred thousand dollars per day real he was making almost eight thousand dollars per hour or he's making one hundred and thirty eight dollars per minute I'd heard my heart or per second or two dollars and thirty cents by while by seven eleven breathalyzer every\nYear and then they'll look how far I got them in the play on a Saturday\nThat no no no this is the breakdown for ...\nO canal or are they a lot of ... and stuff yeah\nYeah you know anything about his upbringing was he just like a poor kid from Mexico that guided boxing and now he's in\nHis older brother boxed and uh yeah then you get started and ended up yeah he's been doing it and stuff uh but yeah that is unbelievable how much money one of his losses by the way he only has a few losses but one of his losses was do a Floyd Mayweather yeah Floyd Mayweather\nHas responded to ... call is call out as saying that he is ready to take on another UFC champions who were fighting to be a Mayweather\nSays oh but I mean who's going to take on to me he's no way that they this is what may weather says we're fighting Mayweather toll GM's these words I my own boss\nI Can't tell you what's going on I ... but on my end we can make it happen\nOf course could be challenged Mayweather after successfully defending his title earlier this month the U.S see two twenty nine with a fourth round submission over a counter macgregor who stepped out of the ... and into the ring last August to take on may weather Mayweather of course maintained is perfect record there so you know the the I mean\nDon't think even people would be that interested in it because the reason why they were so interested in McGregor and a mayor weather is because of the smack talk in the international\nA promotion that was done nobody cared about could be a huge amount of draw like like McGregor is a I don't think so either but the here's what can be has going from international dry he does has international dry he's right\nBut so you've got more of a national Eric in all the rocky three yeah but he's really he's bottom of the barrel Russian like he is not when I'm Talking about some yeah I I Am just talking about an appeal to countries that aren't they're not they're not stacking them like the entire European section it's you know what I'm saying if\nEverybody in Russia and everybody in America bought them not everybody had a lot of people in Russia and American than other areas obviously you're still gonna by and watch it but also you have undefeated against undefeated\nSo that's a big thing as well yeah but do you do because you have an undefeated Floyd Mayweather had a career where the fight against\nA opponents and ah you know great opponents and and ... and all that stuff and then you have to be who's a flash in the pan right now like most of the fighters\nAnd in a over a year you're never going to hear from again you're going to be fighting ability or like the rest of them but yeah well yes I it's just not the same I'm not saying I wouldn't watch it I'm not saying that interested in it it's just not the same I got to be honest with you I don't think it'll ever happen\nReally not again I didn't think that the uh main whether a recording of that going to happen so who knows but you have a you know undefeated against undefeated a committee is twenty seven oh Mayweather of courses or fifty you know so\nWe'll see what happens may rather says he's his own boss or you can do whatever you want to have a Ben Affleck is
