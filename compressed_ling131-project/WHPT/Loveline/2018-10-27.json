I'm also known as did see that he was eating himself to death\nNow although this is an interesting approach I I feel like there's so many ways around it like I don't know ask your friends and family to get food for you um maybe go to the grocery store and get lots of frozen pizzas like there's so many unhealthy options that you can find outside of fast food joints\nYeah but don't you also well you probably don't because you eat like a lunatic but I Know like there's certain things that I crave so I might be able to go to Taco Bell but I really want your poet\nYou know what I mean like so maybe didn't hang them up at your polling 'cause you can get healthy options ... way maybe wouldn't hang him up there right I could go to our bodies you know which I Do\nVery very rarely once a year\nRight um I just don't think that this is a great approach but I Wonder if this is\nI mean I guess Darren McClintock who is the big boy here I guess he was kind of happy about this he does he's asking for help and this is the guy that's helping him but getting him banned from restaurants I mean is that\nA a a bit much I feel like I don't know I'd be super super embarrassed Valerie have but I Want to hear from people quickly 'cause we don't have too much longer to talk but I Want to hear from people who've taken drastic measures to lose weight and and the more\nWomen I talked to\nWhen you die back in their history like late adolescence early twenties a lot of them did some dumb stuff it myself included ... a lot with eating I was very uneducated about eating I thought that made you fat which it is only\nPart of the story right obviously um but I Would over exercise or an insane amount of exercise I mean I was running like at one point I think I was running ten miles every day\nEvery single day and your body plateau so nothing changes after a while\nI was doing know strengthen condition you know ... uh like weight training 'cause I didn't want to be bulky because you know that's how that happens when people say that to you I just nowadays I like laughing their face when I hear women say I don't want to wait trained 'cause\nI don't want to get bulky like first of all that's insulting to the sport of body building those ... I'm a ... effort those mothers or fathers are in the gym like four hours a day and they're lifting and not just lifting but they're lifting heavy and\nThen on top of that you have to eat a lot more cars that Muslims to come from somewhere ... so when people are worried that they're going to gain a little weight from they're going to gain too much muscle by doing some squats or lifting ten pound

actually go to and afford on a regular basis can you buy some dumbbells and just do it in your home\nI mean uh what dumbbell should I buy twenty pounds\nI mean you can do like a little ah like a stack where you can get like I don't know Caswell it to\nThe uh Nordic Track them don't they have one where it's like you can buy the whole it goes from Fifteen to like Seventy pounds okay and you can buy those but they're like five hundred bucks\nAll right well I mean or I'm well five hundred bucks is a lot but I mean if you out of all of your gym memberships over years perhaps I Would\nRather have that and just work out in my yard bingo really yeah man never won a tire I'll tell you what I Want to do a tire and then a sledgehammer and just hit a hit the tire with this leisure and then flip the

year in shape or not but here's the thing though you got everyone had to get in shape you know that's the price and\nUh uh when when when did you get in shape when did you get your cardio Vic occurred physique them\nUm well let's just say I've been in fitness probably since I was about sixteen but that I got I got to be crazy when I was about Nineteen I think about\nOf like who I Am now like the ... ... since I was about Nineteen years old and I remember this because it was my second year in college I wasn't in the dorms anymore so I didn't gain the freshman Fifteen but I was like I Am a normal diet like a normal human I had a bit more fat on my body but it was not fat\nI wasn't as toned obviously and then um I remember thinking to myself and I feel like this is one of my mother was a libertarian moments but\nI was like why didn't I didn't stop complaining about the little things I don't like about my body and just like change them like I don't do it if I just had my mind to it\nSo um I moved out of the dorms stopped eating dorm food by my own food and went to the gym every day and I drop like ten twelve pounds like that like in a few weeks ... and I just got lean and tone and I felt great it was awesome then\nI went a little overboard and you know didn't get a period for like nine months that's another story that's another story for another week and we got to get out of here

about how can the average person who wants to help what you do which is a stop the suffering of circus animals and other animals throughout the globe or what would be your best recommendation and how they can get involved\nWell I um\nI think the first thing that uh they should do\nIs try to find out what animal active to act activist type groups there are there in their area and ah I'm not as much as they can about each one\nAnd the ones that deserve their help and their money I think that uh they could very well help them out because there are all of these organizations have to have money and then uh and and then they can\nThere are undoubtedly demonstrations at circuses in the area\nGo and participate in those demonstrations or if there are um uh any other it doesn't have to be for ... that can be for any kind of animal but a ... you begin to participate go to your local uh animal shelter and you can help there and many ...\nWays probably get one uh I Know shelters out here they like to have people come and walk the dog and uh that should give you a great pleasure to get a dog out of a cage and let him walk around for a few an hour or two you know you have a lot of things you can do\nThat do it carefully do uh some of these organizations are there is for the money right and be sure that your money is is used properly but before you make your contribution\nNo doubt about it you are wonderful human being you are a you used your sphere of influence to have a tremendous impact on both the animal world and on people and how we treat animals I Believe I I'm a cat lover unabashed it I'm I'm I'm a rug heterosexual males who is not afraid to say that I Love my cats I genuinely\nFeel a love for them they have taught me\nSo much in the world of patience and understanding

elephants in the lions and tigers that should be out roaming in Africa instead of and Asia\nInstead of in cages though I salute you for your work there Bob you sound amazing or at Ninety almost Ninety
