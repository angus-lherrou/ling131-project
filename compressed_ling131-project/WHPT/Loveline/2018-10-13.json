strong language from a mascot\nThe mascots the mascot signs of mascots now what was that really you know was that really left by the mascots I don't know\nWell nobody else was in their change with them it's kind of a against protocol to ever see a mascot out of his uniform so nobody went in there after it was over we were standing outside my father and I were standing outside going I think they're really mad I think he said he thinks cast in the air was genuinely upset after what happened\nWas just an insane conversation to have the mascot actually upset and then as soon as they left he goes in there and then find that I Know\nI'm very sorry to the to the mascot for doing that\nI might have I mean it could have been thunder above that let that we don't I doubt I doubt that no no the

you\nMean those guys sweat and they're you know right I was sweating you're sweating playing playing bowling and these guys are ... entertaining the kids and then you're calling them freaks oh I meant

yeah we we because we did the same pose except with me holding Jay are like ah like as ... is being held by John and uh that really sums up the flavor of what happened friday night I just I'm really really started to to the mascot or if I if my comment landed poorly with them that's not what I intend to\nOrder doing a captain fear in here and then you you talk to him and he can't say anything back in the I don't even know how we settled this\nI don't know I don't know maybe I'll maybe I'll dress up as a mascot and and see how difficult it is for one of their games or something like maybe I could do a quarter\nOf a sudden you're going to be kept in fear\nWhile I mean I I could show them that they're really not costume freak\nMaybe a preseason game but you're not ready for regular season game is kept in\nThe high very hot in there so I I don't know that I'd like to do that I don't even\nKnow if they did like game time is necessarily for you or early in the game preseason game I think

know if there'll be another one I ... a but we don't know so but I I can tell you that this one was a huge success which one was the worst one [noise]\nI don't know whether the worst the least exciting that the seven ... seven day cruise was gleefully cutting because the one the recent one did you choose to have an makers is\nThe reason what I like the first one yeah ... no one was actually good because we did the ... yeah so the first one the problem was that was like oh we have plenty of time yeah let's not get crazy whatever and then they go our leader\n[laughter] you know what I mean like that was that so then the next one everybody was like I was not get caught in the wall of having an extra time yeah let's party whatever on every night and do it where this one is just God\nFor days yeah crazy\nI was surprised that the the early departure time\nOf some people I mean there was er we've done in the case here are like two and everybody be sleep the vacuum in the hallway and it you know done\nRight yeah I got to tell you I was not a late night cruise or this year we're not yeah I almost got the Billy Madison or oh no no no no I listen I was out and about what the everybody and hanging out during the day and doing all that my ... says or that you get the word now laid out\nMy problem was I was among the ... and then I then I didn't time and I I don't know it was a nun there'll be ... that food\nAny every time I ate dinner there was like an hour period after that I Would like fighting going to sleep and then once I got through that out when I was like okay I can go out now before all this\nThing with all those guys moving to him and make a female yeah\nI have a a dancer moved there was a a nobody loses that somebody was talking about somebody who's like who who why is it that nobody says I'm Down lots of money I don't like I Want money I Want money that's all we know that might have been me sweat I'll just say that yeah did you win or lose oh I Want yeah yeah\nGood uh yeah I mean I I so I mean overall the end of the crews are in the first day my first day first time in that gives you know first hand three card poker were three seven\nRight I Will I'll get I don't want to like a thousand dollars just on my hands\nAnd I didn't gamble very much but my first step down my second hand it three card poker with just straight flush\nAll right and then we were playing ... which I hate right I just kept ... members left and right over to this is one of those things where you feel like you can't lose in hitting those numbers what is it thirty five to one thirty five to when I was like Fifteen dollars on a number right yeah I had a hundred dollars a blow when I was blown up and they just kept hitting\nIt was so funny so I went and checked my card and I had the money they give you the chips that you can use in the casino\nAnd uh so I had whatever was I don't know fifty bucks or something wasn't a lot we don't have as I Am a yeah I Do actually I didn't get ships that are ... yeah I but I I was standing there at the ... machine and are there was a you know they show the board of what had just had a black\nA it was three rides and then had to hit a double zero green and I was like\nIt's going to have another double zero green like I just for some reason my habit or didn't bet on it it had to oh yeah well\nI\nKnow if I could yeah so overall I I think we have a great time it usually is what happened there but it gets on the earth is what a great time\nAnd then slowly over the week horrendous stories really\n[laughter] ... who knew was bad it was good and all things uh well\nYou're saying about hobby is that something when you're talking about\nUm I don't know if you want to get into it I just learned more so it was a CSI and once again it well but if it's what I think you may want to write it down for 'em out and see whether you well know anything about it oh no\nThat other thing though and this is finding a punch out good I'll kill them that I don't think that it was a it is what I'm thinking of maybe something different a It's Tuesday I think\nSo uh dominance coming in yes oh that stuff ... they have a yeah yeah that I heard\nAbout that it wasn't necessarily happy stop ah well ran well he ran out what he ran out of time\nI don't know I don't know I mean not that I don't know what that means\nWell okay I Will figure out there are you surprised writing your book they Carmen beat you in three hours\nYeah law because there's just more to it then I found out I only last night yeah we got off the air yet and I'm also who who is doing who\nIs in a car I Know it's not use run here but who is doing the overnight replays this week oh wait wait you mean I guess before you show there is a replay of us\nYeah so those were supposed to be the best stuff because what we do for normally for overnight this show today will do and for tomorrow's overnight\nSo being that we weren't here what are we supposed to happen\nOr the um best stuff that I made whereas opposed to just follow up just in the same order\nAnd why didn't I don't know right where you weren't out here I don't expect you to know right by a somebody emailed me a Twitter Twitter and said I've heard Carmen get punch until she barks three times this week\nIt's the same show their armed everyday that kind of a slob imagines came out and that's not you know you weren't even here you won't even in this country right yeah I'm just saying that who does that and why does it keep happening\nAlthough I Will say why do I care it's not even related to ... hours of show here though people yet I Wonder why people get hired of hearing the same thing like ... ... should be the one that really cares about it and they don't seem to care\nYeah ah one thing I did get a bunch of a Twitter a things about was why is Robyn best stuff how do you keep you because\nHappens in part I don't know about that whole along was that it felt like nine years that I\nCan't because if I if I don't put Rob in that stuff that really limit the years in shows that I can use\nSo there's I I like you to put it in their district ... has some segments that he was a part of the family can you pitches boys up so at least south that are okay and I\nTell you awesome Robyn my tax last week what in the actual how gross during the Spanish not come back or anything like that\nWhat is happening up there the whole world do world upside down I don't understand is how do you take some of Dr ... housing with or are we have a job ...
