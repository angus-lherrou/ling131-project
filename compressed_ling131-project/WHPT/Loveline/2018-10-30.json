{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WHPT", "content": "A and they've been go with this rhetoric for a long time and not even just people on the street and on Twitter\nBut the CNN and some of the major news networks Ninety to Ninety four percent of the coverage that he gets his negative mhm and then they demand that he tones down his rhetoric so they will brutally attacked him and then demand that he toned down\nThings that he says that's not fair both sides need to tone this crackdown absolutely to get the emotion\nOut of the news ... it's telling us what's happened not why not how you feel about it or how how what happened right and let us let us feel let us do the feeling we don't need you to tell us I got shot a few\nSeventy seven five seven nine one or two five or eight hundred seven seven one one or two five I really don't like this idea of if if you're Donald Trump or your Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton or anything\nUm if your supporters are your fans do something and they're crazy and they like you and they're in favor of you are there your fan that somehow it's your fault that's BS craze that's ridiculous like\nYou know you can't control if a racist likes the few things that you have to say yeah you know what I'm saying like I'm pro Second Amendment okay well there's some races that are pro Second Amendment now if they commit a crime oh it's your fault because they liked you know that's where that's ridiculous and you're you're you're passing the blame on to someone who doesn't deserve it\nAbsolutely we got to compartmentalize what people say some people can have good points of view and be bad people look at pretty much every president United States that we've ever had there's some things that we like and some things that we don't like you don't do the whole thing was outlined confused\nAbsolutely I mean you could say there there could be racist people who love I don't know we use are you going to blame reserves they do something racist and violent no no absolutely not\nTotally unfair that that's the that's a fallacy a logical fallacy of guilt by association right\nRight and I I don't want to I don't know I I'm kind of on the fence about this but I I don't even know what I hate speech is in the sense that like if anything should be\nOff limits to say like if you're Richard Spencer and you want to say some racist stuff you can say it nobody has to be violent because you said something everyone is responsible for their for their own action I\nAgree I mean there are things that you can say that people say oh yeah I can just hit you now you shouldn't be hit for anything from words that you speak French you can freely not associate with them or I mean that that's the way to do that's why I Want to hear what everybody has to say absolutely want to know what they are the\nRaces have to say I don't I don't want to write them down I Want them allowed so we know we can identify this person this person thinks and just because they're saying something racist doesn't mean that it's going to incite other people to do raise this things those people were going to commit those crimes anyways I Would argue and they're not stable in the head and\nI don't think that anybody's words can force anybody into action or it can land unless you're unless you're threatening them otherwise they\nCan but they're crazy we have a mental health problem in this country you know I Know that oh you're just blame it on that well you know that people just blame it on guns so I think we can say that maybe we have two problems that wants to things can be true at the same sure we have a mental health problem in this country and there's more guns and there are people here yeah\nI'm a strong you know I'm supporter for gun rights okay or\nA but maybe we should talk about it and it was common sense gun control crap here that every single time and they bring it up and I go what are you one well I Want you know men jury background check yeah we have that well I Want to close the gun show loophole\nThat doesn't exist that's not a thing that doesn't exist the only thing that I could see that potentially could help is the private transfer thing where maybe you have to go through some sort of\nGovernment entity I'm not bananas about that but if that would help people that you can't do the public transfer or private transfers I mean okay maybe we could talk about that I bought a weapon at a gun show\nI had to wait three days after I had to go through the background check and I had to go pick it up at a certified a location a gun gun store right this stuff doesn't exist and this is what we were you were saying earlier that these people have no idea what they're talking about these scream at the top of the lungs yeah this is a perfect example right right\nI also think mental evaluation wouldn't hurt I Know it costs a lot of money and people are really worried about it but I think that it it could possibly help\nEspecially in schools man I mean I again kids are required to see a doctor before they go to school when they have to get their booster shots and they have to I had to get like a hepatitis series when I was in school we have to go we have to go through those channels in order to be exposed to other children so we don't make them sick\nWell I think we should also have each child to go through a mental screening so they don't make other kids sick I eat kill them when they get to I don't know an age an adolescent age\nSo I think that would also be really useful I don't understand why we're neglecting to ... the brain as if it's not part of the body it's just as much part of the body as as your legs as your lungs as your heart as a you know a virus infecting your body\nViruses and putting that in quotes can in fact your brain and make you do crazy things so I don't understand why we aren't screening kids because you gotta catch it when it's young when when I Swear to God when kids are already fourteen Fifteen Years old I feel like oftentimes it's way too late the damage has been done and then they're often fully\nYeah I'm influenced by their peers and if they're in a bad peer group than it is done do especially for young men\nSo you but yeah I mean you brought up the the background checks for kids you can't own a firearm a hand gun anyways until you're Eighteen so maybe we should think about maybe doing the same with rifles\nNo I'm not saying I'm so that a kid could own a gun just in general screening kids just see how they're doing mentally\nYou know that's just the costs thing again I'm not opposed to that ... ... what I mean are we putting lived on a on a a dollar value here like if this could actually help yeah you know if this could help is just could save lives I mean why not try and I feel like you gotta catch this stuff early it's not about trying to patch up a\nA a problem that you already have it's trying to prevent a problem from even becoming a problem in the first plane\nWell again this goes back to what I said earlier in the show too is that bad things are going to happen and there's nothing we can do about it you can regulate all you want you can make as many laws do you want\nMurders against the law and people still kill they'll find ways to kill no matter what of course so I mean we we can have the conversation but we have to have\nLook it up folks do your research go on Google and look these things up if you say you can a kid out of hand gun take that into Google and then you'll find these

leaves the bugs to know where fitzpatrick has been a turnover monster his entire career that's why he's been run out almost every city yeah although I guess why it's fun to watch and I probably should be the starter but the bucks there into deep money wise and just the entire project of trying to have a franchise quarterback that that you have to ride it out to the end\nI say a geo gives me a hundred dollars or\nPatrick ... as a starter for the next game not the not the rest of the year yet\nI say by the end of the year James Winston becomes roommates with Josh Brennan\nOperators living

going to say he's not fighting to keep his job right now because he he played like garbage but I I think they're going to ride it out and he could be very well could be gone next year and maybe it's a better thing to to go to another team because he he still is a good quarterback he's shown flashes of being good that is why they picked up as an option but you know just remember\nWe don't pay
