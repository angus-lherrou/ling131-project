generally a\nConfident person I could see someone getting like a procedure done like this girl was very flat chested she can be confident but it's something that always bothered her you know and she wanted to feel maybe more woman leaned more feminine\nI don't ... and the fact that this guy and this is like this will be really hard for me to swallow a no pun intended but um that you know he says
