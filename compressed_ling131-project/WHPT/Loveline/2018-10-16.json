good\nTerrible ... it's all sugar you lose all the fiber if\nYou had like one orange you'd be full but if you have one glass of orange juice\nThat's that's the sugar of like eight orange yeah and you know it's not good for you doesn't fill you up and then you get these crazy insulin spikes in these crazy insulin crashes that's why you always feel like super sleepy after lunch because your insulin is going up and it's gone down it's going side to side it's not good for you\nSo yeah we definitely do need to manage our eating and I think the best way to combat that without interfering with people's choice and autonomy is just education show people what they're eating another thing that's mislabeled as health food is like granola and stuff like that\nA lot of the cereals we eat not good for you and like you said it was a lot of the processed food\nUm yeah you're getting energy and calories but you're losing a lot of the micro nutrients especially when it's overly process so it can be preserved for a long time if something in your fridge him last more than like two weeks you probably shouldn't be eating it you know especially when it comes to produce or anything like that if you have like\nA meat in there for months on end or I don't know weeks on end it is not good it shouldn't be preserved that long haul food goes back\nIt goes bad so that's why you need to eat fresh you need to eat good\nProduce I got uh some turkey from you know grocery store that was for for sandwiches like turkey but it wasn't from the deli it was from the packaged I oh yeah and it expired in one

consuming and I feel so bad for kids that come up in these families where there's not taught how to eat well and\nThen they grow up and then they have weight problems her whole life and they teach their kids in just a really really bad cycle so I feel like the only way to combat this without interfering with the only thing that we should have ultimate control over which is our autonomy and our

things that are better for the show and that's my main priority right I mean\nBut he wasn't good at all a soldier I ain't good ... good looking guy but he was a good producer in doing pretty well I got lazy fucking yes\nUh-huh that's an old producer does Harman I'm aware I Know but there were other things he was good at\nAnd like a ... he was good at at his British your skills about keeping things in the beginning he was and then I kind of all just kind of fell off I think once a comedy thing started noticing that ruined every uh well I think\nHe also wasn't getting any sleep I remember at one point to sleep in here and I do that is going to know but I mean just like mentally you know that'll that'll wear you down real quick but actually if you have to have a thick skin in here and you can't the mentally you wrap your head around that and then I\nHad with the comedy like ... if you if this is your number one priority it was not and but that's the thing like you said when he first came here it was ... he was a good producer but then when he started the comedy thing and he started picking up other things this was no longer number one priority which may\nAll he was one of those people will Harvard bad feelings and let them blow up yeah you can't do that I Can't do that and all these sneaky snake yeah all I Am newly speak yeah yeah\nI'd I don't I don't tolerate that at

Google\n[laughter] leave I it was an eye\nOn the guy who was inside the mascot thing broken job no way over ... Wilder has issued an apology to the man inside the mascot catch him he punched while they're paying on ESPN show the heavyweight champion was encouraged to demonstrate his punching punching power by striking the mascot\nOn ESPN Now nest young ah he said quote I sincerely apologize to pray for him there was injured\nIf this is true Wilder wrote on Instagram while they're also hit back at reports said he didn't realize there was a man inside the mascot rather than a lady tall are you a quick baiting\nA VW Rio champion who is on beating then forty routes or fight former heavyweight champion pacing theory in Los Angeles on December other guys you get a rematch rare [laughter]\nHe invited this guy he said he wants to give and take it to his fight and stuff in there and be like yeah I mean but here's the thing if you're the heavyweight champion even if you're not even if you're just a normal person who's been on earth for I don't know ten years you would go\nAll right well I don't want to kill this guy he needed was hired as the other kind of he had a I mean you look at how he had some back about Joe ... show that he took a couple of steps and then followed three of us watches\nThat I had a hard enough that it's not hard to build it up\nAnd tell me I'm the heavyweight champion greatest in the world and point to something I'm supposed to ponds are not expect me to ... uh we'll put that on the face by\nInside ... there are speaking with sports if you're interested law baseball the Dodgers beat mirrors Saturday Night to even the er and I'll see asked at one game of peace and the red Sox defeated the Astros\nTo even the ALCOA I said one game of peace I I you know you just heard our Yankees\nIn baseball and then when the urge you to return a and then a new report says it\nHernandez was physically and sexually abused as a child also did you see the other part was that he uh it's now come out that he had a sexual relationship with his high school quarterback yeah how yeah how he had been a\nPoor guy was gay and I feel bad poor guy was gay and he had also been\nA a torch I'd like I'd be honest I don't remember what Aaron Hernandez went to jail for a it was a mariners ... right but the only do it did somebody else do it or why I don't really remember the story or gang related or something like that I\nKnow it was like her his sister's boyfriend\nOkay well I only know what the reasons why it was like a family relations but anyway my whole point is is that here's here's what I always say this is this is red and people want to know why or why you can't make gay jokes because of this because people are afraid to come out and they lived their whole life\nOr in secret and then as a result of that they're miserable and they take it on other people and they do drugs and they get crazy yeah this guy this guy was gay and he couldn't even be gay and it definitely probably added to his family\nDuring the year two thousand Thirteen offseason Hernandez was arrested and charged with murder of owning Lloyd a semi professional player who is dating the sister of Hernandez is fiance following his arrest he was immediately released by the patriots ... he was found guilty of first degree murder in two thousand Fifteen\nAnd sentenced to serve life in prison without the possibility of parole or and then of course he wound up killing himself he was found dead in the south or which was role to suicide hey listen ah I'm ... I\nI Know this is the hardest thing to do than it and do you do for me to say you're not in the position but there should be one of those motivate motivating things that makes a guy who is teetering on whether or not he should come out that's that's popular like in the NFL popular right like Tom Brady Pablo I'm not saying I'm ready\nBut ah should come out at the height of their popularity ... a up and get swat like also a gay like ... well you know wind question right but the thing is is that your that's almost insolvent gives you a sumo back in ... blonde hair and he dams no\nBecause he's been seen with guys like very cozy\nIn the hot tub with ... and he also got arrested for trying to pick up hookers so yeah yeah but", "show_name": "Loveline", "year": "2018", "city": "Sarasota", "day": "16"}
