I have to do that to step back you know and just make okay how often that is that here you are right here a lot of things could change very quickly just keep doing your thing and something\nYeah yeah my advice for anybody that wants to do what we're doing\nStay in your lane and just keep\nFocusing forward don't worry about what other people are doing don't worry about you know they're farther along you're obviously going to get jealous you obviously gonna compare yourself to other people but the main thing is just keep pushing forward stand your lane stay humble and just keep just keep granted now man\nI tell you the great my counselor gave me a piece of advice many moons ago ... when I asked him what his advice would be for a young man chubby young man who wanted to involve himself in broadcast okay and he told\nThat young boy don't and that's the advice that I Would give anybody else who wants to do this why do you say that it's a ... well number one I don't want any competition that's what I thought he was mad one number two it's a it's a ... what do you call a sludge through the you gotta just sludge already through like you said stay in your lane\nPick your battles and just it's it's slow\nMoving sometimes All right move as fast as you'd want to be and you're not appreciated and uh but it's\nFun but it is fun but I feel like I don't do it well I Would\nTell other people not to do a ... mainly because I don't want any more competition but I feel like if you start now maybe you won't even be my path there'd be a problem for me later on in life

Christian Bale because you have a great actor playing\nI agree well when I think you know disease they definitely got some great actors but I think maybe that's you know their focus more on that is who they are getting to fill these roles instead of to actually it's kind of a storyline and all that kind of going back to the basics of uh the comics I think there are missing the fan boy element\nScience fiction and put it in my ... bullet Mike right up to your mouth or your cars you and you're not doing an accent you talk very well yeah I'm a little [laughter]\nI Can't believe comic asked me that\nI wouldn't I wouldn't ...\nWhy why although ... gallon said it earlier today when you walk away from the accent that you are dealing picked up about ...\nKinda screwed I'll be out there because I said they were like how famous as this person and I said this version internationally famous and and that's always the defense I have against when people are talking about wrestlers or and I was thinking as nationally famous because of guardians right\nAnd I knew once I set out you were going to think it was a wrestler and I would say in a way it was the kind of centered everything\nI'm ... tell me about a\nWho's who in your eyes who is the biggest celebrity that you worked with so far like when I heard you were doing them or ... it was like oh jeeze you've made us ally easily Jodie Foster Jodie Foster what did you do with Jodie Foster\nA movie called hotel or to much at all I think it's going to hit the festival circuit this year but a semi dad generally will be there is going to end it's already festival routed cast as it's a monster cash it's empty Jody\nUh certainly could brown who's just been cleaning up with a ... a Charlie Day oh ahah yeah hey how are you ready to interview those are great because there is more than I'm missing but ah yeah those what's it about [noise]\nUh well you know it's I don't want to go away to ... I don't know what they've got about but it's it's based on the kind of that kind of near future and uh but it's good stuff\nAnd when you meet a Jodie Foster ... who she looks at you and she sees muscles and borrow movies she ah\nI mean the musical thing after that but I said I buy the musical doubt it\nWas you know the thing that I Love maybe you know I was watching it I'm a little bit jaded but some of the shots the camera shots they did and lo and were were amazing right I don't know how you're watching it from a different level or ... and also you know I really love and it's a hard thing to do\nTo bring films to the very end and really not know how they're going to end right that film I didn't know I was going in and and I kind of love that\nYeah you're right give you figure out a movie halfway through you ... you lose yeah in my mind I just assume everybody dies at the end of every [laughter]\nYeah did you ever heard of that theory about Greece they're already\nDead why\nThat because he saved her from drowning right and the theory was that she actually drowned dreamt that whole thing\nOh wow I ... I like\nThat makes it makes all the movies about a ... a ... here in the studio\nWith us what is what is next for you and now you're here for a little while and then when you go what do you work on ...\nUh I think right now I'm my next year almost going to be a show called Stuever do with Fox yeah yeah I ... I got a good year line do\nYou guys you got to like pull now like now you got a little bit well like if you went in there and they were like uh\nWe got a role for like a a quirky neighbor or a goofy best friend or\nJust give me ... you know that ah that I'm you know you could stretch our research my wings out to\nYeah and I am done okay I mean this year is my first year I kind of free of marble obligation I don't have any ... you know it's just I haven't had a long time and I'm doing a I'm I'm doing a like for studio films for sure now\nAnd where and where do you have to go you have to go any remote locations are they all here in one of\nThem is can be very ... to very remote locations um I think probably liked markets somewhere in South America\nAnd when you go I now I Know this or that because of the hit movies or guardians movie and because of wrestling you are internationally a famous and it's harder for you for is a big guy but do you what is it a blow your mind when you're in another country and somebody recognizes you yeah yeah it's\nAlways that's always been wherever I you know I got that more of the wrestling though yeah now I Swear man I don't get recognized a lot like how well currently\nIn Greenland and for the for the young kid who has a right to your area and in the movies um yeah\nSo I you know I don't get recognized as much as you would\nThink yeah also do you think it has to do with the fact that your muscles are exploiting who your shirt and below are there are there like like I say a nine you're wearing a jacket now you're wearing like a tight fitting sure your shoulders are ridiculous I think that if I like do a jacket on maybe had or something I get kind of blend right now in an odd but I can\nI Wonder I always wonder if uh if you were hanged glasses but I I think I ...\nYeah yeah and I'm a I usually don't walk round disguise but I just felt like I looked awful\n[laughter] walked in I literally resolve it got out of the truck I was a bad way how gray haired on a man I'm super grace hire at age ... bald I Know you're not all manner of Super Bowl yeah ah you know but you know\nThey said it made but it ... it works for you because we're so used to senior with no hair anyway so\nRight I I should've went that route I should've went I should have went all the years ago is everybody does use the same except me look I got a perfectly symmetrical round head well mine mine looks like a dead heat volleyball yeah\n... my head looks like a like it'd be boiled egg and then shift the piece off the tie I ... I feel I have\nI actually just you know I've been ball so much this year that I just wanted to just not be ball yeah and she's just because you know with ... to shave everything constantly if everything I'm unemployed actor right now so I figured if I actually had a beard last minute just shoot it off\nThe when you um these are all great questions that you've probably never wanted to answer but when you get paid for like ... they get so guardians or just say guardians or you're filming a movie they said that we need it for six weeks or\nSo whenever it is do they pay you when it's over or they pay a weekly monthly how's it work yeah\nI think usually weekly I don't know I don't know I can tell you the last time I saw a pitcher\nIsn't that great that's spoken like a rich man\nI Am I'm On a windy my nose in my agency than to go like street in my county right for every once in a while I'll look at it and ... you may only fifty bucks and you're right I mean while you're agents like hey you want to go on a yacht hunting is that and I wonder if you've been on\nThe very first time I ever or talk to an agent ... Jain a higher in age and that that's a process yet and from movie the teams that make more sense because they're spending millions of dollars but for me\nThey want your you send the check to them and then they send you money or they deposit money in your account and that was like I'm not giving you might jak like I didn't quite understand how it goes and I still by the way don't do that\nUh because uh I said to them they said well here the process is\nTo make sure that I actually listen I'm married to a Jew from Jersey and we're not going to make a dime an hour and then they ... they actually have like five years the agency they said we just want to you know your wife is the best client we have\nShe is uh is she is on time with everything and yeah it's a ... at at the very interesting yeah but now when you get to see you get a boatload of money then it goes your agency and they take their P.
