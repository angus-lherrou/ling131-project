I said these types of people\nAre having more babies William these types of people what does it with bells I mean on married people all\nThese kids are having more babies it says here ah forty percent of us babies are being born to on married parents a trend that has risen steadily over the last five decades in Nineteen Seventy only about ten percent of the birth outside we're outside of marriage and the trend toward\nOut of wedlock babies is even higher in Europe with France leading the way was sixty percent of babies being born outside marriage I don't think\nThat that's so weird anymore yeah pretty pretty\nCommon these days that aren't good use the word bastard is that even a term that people use\nI don't think they would call their kids that short man that's a dictionary definition bastard\nChild out of wedlock I have no problem with that at all I I think it's a better luck than people rushing to get married or you see a very very pregnant bride\nWhich to me likely do you Boo Boo but especially if you're like oh we got to get married began as a kid outside of wedlock\nWe gotta you know get married and nice Catholic Church I'm like that's a really bad like being in a Catholic Church where the pregnant asked bride the baby don't rush the marriage make sure you guys are good for each other despite having a child together\nAnd get married there's real marriage is never going to solve your problems I feel like that needs to be the moral of every story\nMarriage is I mean if you want to have like a union that's recognized by the state and your family and he got a lot of pressure but marriage if something is bad marriage will never\nEver fix it it'll only make it worse now did they say that these people are still together\nAnd they're raising the child together or they just you know bang and you know one night stands getting pregnant\nAnd now I'm going to have a very short article my favorite kind of article energy just strictly talking about babies being born outside of wedlock that was interesting because a lot of these married couples end up getting divorced anyways ride broke ... fifty percent in America\nI Believe so yeah so um to me I don't really have an issue with it I think that marriage will never solve a problem if you're pregnant you got knocked out by I Know a lot of people rush into marriage\nBecause they think it was all we have to do oftentimes those people come from more traditional families and I feel like\nThey're kind of under the ... not impression but under the the idea that you know we've already broken one rule we can't break more where I'm like you you're already\n... yet premarital sex were you a planned the baby or a happy accident um plant you weren't plant\nYeah that Dr my mom said that the doctor told her that she wanted to have her first baby she should probably do before she was thirty yeah so she she had me a twenty\nOh that's when you can be honest with women back in the eighties about their repair them\nSo yeah yeah yeah this is also in Israel too so who knows but yeah she said if you want to probably adverse baby for thirty so she held\nStudents so they had me at ah my mom had me at twenty nine\nSo it was kind of while it was planned it was kind of like a guy we were on the clock here we've got to get this done a ... um yeah but they were\nAlready married for forty years they've been together for two before they got married and they were married than for four and then they had me so that means six years into their relationship\nSo it wasn't like a you know they were dating for a couple of months and you know my mom got knocked\nUp so much I asked my mom course told me that I was a planned and you didn't\nOh no I was a planned baby absolutely\nAnd then I asked my dad about it years ago and he was like oh no ... it was a total mistake\n[laughter] but he always says you know oh you're my favorite mistake don't get me wrong I like the accident as a better word than\nMistake I think he said mistake mistake regret uh your own state well because this last call the night\nOh this is ... ...

to to a TV AMC was looking for something to follow the walking dead with because they liked the fact that Walking Dead brought in kind of like the guardian for sure and you know it's a long time between seasons as they were in production and they were like man we'd like to keep them around what would keep them around\nAnd the good from an original media named Charlie corps when he called me up and he was just like there's a\nPay him he's looking for a showman do you have any ideas for TV show might be cool for the gay crowd [laughter] no I don't do TV I don't really have anything I said but if you were going to do anything somebody should should do reality show that in the comic bookstore like upon stores or something like that right we shot under the working title of secret fast that's the name of the store\nBut I Am the want to call it something that was a little more a generic term like it all fields of everybody not just secret stash I guess that's the connotation to some

many people and it wasn't even like directed at me or I ever did I say and how great of a show le awesome he\nWas a really um as Robin Kelly is in his doing his best comedy now and I don't think you realize you know in any yeah\nI don't know what to believe because he is so funny like he's a really great stand up and he's just a funny person I think there\nComes a time when you get to a certain age where you feel like you should be somewhere and all of the rest of the world sees you at that level you don't feel that way being some of your friend if TV shows is that right now and Bobby and I've had no conversation rubs I'm just talking or making observations\nAnd I buy and those people started to go backwards or they start resting on their old material he is getting better and funnier and I hope he realizes\nThat and I told him before out of all of our topic friends he is definitely the best actor oh he was great on sex drugs and rock and roll gathering like even a really good on there\nAnd I think he's a ... that he doesn't know how good he is because it makes them not care when he's up on stage and that to me is the funniest thing everyone he just goes and it just seems like he's not even doing material he just talking off the top of his head and makes it available\nThe order or my wife ... remember being a so Saturday Night after that canceled than we did not go our

lady thing whatever alright okay would you like to see the ah security so\nFar I Would believe that women because she's saying I Will not be violated ... you will not grab ... says is a young boy who
