it's\nA yeah they\nWell that's what the point Cody right wake up people of course they could always do this they're just making it official now\nIt's nothing to do [laughter] [noise] right right\nI don't I don't think it's really a Trump\nNo no it's a government thing about who the president is exactly\nRight so and I understand it's a way to contact people because you everybody always has their phones makes complete sense you're not always a near the radio knew the TV\nAnd that's all they had it would be great if we all started getting messages it says don't forget the midterm elections coming up Republican [laughter] I think that might be abusive power [laughter] you're on Twitter started coming out on this\nWithout any control that tax or the fact that everybody helping me his reign shot it and make a comment afterwards on on on the I Would overall lack in look I got it yeah well that gets and then of course every single person that they were the first one to say knew someone who does with their screen shot of or is that the gag new phone who it is\nIt's been a great success by give us the cabinet stuff apparently the FBI handed that report it\nSure did I was reading the before it's pretty interesting it's all on paper so that nobody can take the digital and we get to the press you can take the digital send it to your friend\nOh they make actual copies\nOnly copies only at the Justice Department rod Grassley who ran the hearing the guy running hearing the majority he was the first at eight o'clock this morning Dianne Feinstein was at nine o'clock this morning and the\n... and you go in you read it and you leave ... maybe the the pages of water mark does something like that so not even that's\nAll I Know it was ... they wanted to read it and they left and that only certain people can see it the committee can see it and they were on a schedule there's ten other Judiciary Committee people who saw it and then the other hundred senators get to see and it's up in a pecking order\nOkay well the the uh with like starting at eleven and twelve billion Feinstein walking the walk out on some of them did was she going\nWell that's one of the other rules and I don't think any of them going to stick to the rule but you're supposed to be part of the conduct as\nYou're not even supposed to into what's in there you're not you're not you know you obviously can't say exactly what's in there but they said you can't even\nHint and then while they're\nRight meanwhile the White House headline before we started the show said FBI report a White House white a White House opinion uh that nothing there's no cooperation of sexual misconduct ... how do they\nWon the white even talking about anything you know you you know cooperation chunk comes out of the oval office doing the cabbage patch the running Mandel [laughter] you know all says I'm very happy today All right\nYou know but you're not even supposed to do that you're supposed to stay quiet and then a a tide was told me before now the reports out today everybody gets to read it think about it and then tomorrow they're\nSupposed to get together just a committee of Twenty one and vote to stand up to the Senate on Saturday\nProbably so that's the order of ... supposed to go to like next Seventy two hours we're finally going to do\nSo we'll see if it gets through if the report as anything more but I mean the White House says one thing they find no cooperation of sexual misconduct maybe this other stuff in there\nThat is misconduct but that's you know that's a statement people that he drank and they're not supposed to be right which only enough to step away from\nWhat it's supposed to prove that he wouldn't remember or something so we'll see we'll see if that comes true and if everybody's happy was report or what the next delaying tactic is dead was saying he says it could be they'll say it wasn't a deep enough investigation it's illegitimate or we got to go to the next guy the next person because there's so many questions about this guy let's just go to the next one so there's going to go to see what the tactics are but\nAs we talked about is just dirty filthy and two people are sitting in the middle right pollens who will be\nDisposed of them would actually if Kavanaugh is he going right\nIf he gets and he gets on the Supreme Court you know they take the picture all the other nonsense and then they all go to work together like do they shut him\nBecause he's not allowed to hang out with them and the Supreme Court lunchroom on villa in the ... would you want to ... would you share your lunch room table and Sean do with the with Kavanaugh\nDying I Would make him feel welcome oh you would walk up to ... in there\nAnd and you and him and Clarence Thomas would be there to he's been shown bill forever but I you know he's been there a long\nTime I would imagine I mean there there are professionals and they go on and do their thing but [noise]\nI mean they all have to get opinions and your name working groups that end up getting back together the\nBecause of the song playing and she'd be mentioned it\nMakes me think here I'm reading right now with the group that got bad ...\nIf I'm involved with it in vogue reunion I hear you are oh no I can retire a happy man\nYou're you're like in the meantime hearing it you

'cause I think she had a little problem with it out to shut it down to where it was like you shut it but uh they probably are going to hang up there and uh but I think since then she's probably let it go that's my guess I asked him about this so long I don't think they have tattoos are pure since but I when I was ... years they're here's a Wayne is on line three have Wayne what's going on\nOh jeeze
