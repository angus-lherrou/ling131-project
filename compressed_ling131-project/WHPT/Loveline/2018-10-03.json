I don't I don't understand\nAnything but well have you read any of the stuff about sweating like the lady that came forward the most recent one yeah I think she was the third lady that came forward enough she I was telling you right now I don't know I never met or anything but from my past\nAs a profile or she is like All right not only are very you're not only is she lying she's cuckoo for cocoa piling up medical term [laughter] yeah yeah I mean I Believe that\nThe third or fourth person may be the first people may be absolutely telling the truth on everything and then all of a sudden somebody crazy purchased one part of it\nWas let go from a job for lying on her job I have without going to a college doing soft she was also reprimanded about sexual misconduct well guys\nTwo guys at the place she also sued or the or some public transportation thing I forget what it was\nWhen she fell are getting off the train whatever and had our noses up and she said that she lost like four hundred thousand dollars in modeling contracts us up she was never a model of hers and then she said was modeling for men or a year after that case it on the court and stuff and he goes at the time he goes I was ... as broke as could be I didn't have\n... agency I don't even know what you're talking about is you talked to me about being a character witness or something yeah so\nThere's a lot of stuff listen when you lie about that stuff they're going to find\nOut when you when you say the you were part of nine eleven and you're in New York it's ours and stops the rent is in Kenya\nYeah they're going to find out you know what I mean like yeah people find that stuff out so why lie about it all so very incredible if a first tier runners easy you\nAre say I've been doing to retired makes a good start stop telling of its yeah yeah keep telling it and keep expanding on the right stuff yeah so I look at it\nShe she baby lions really telling the truth but she doesn't\nShe has all this stuff working against her so now or how does this but that does help or does is hurt the laser may actually how it\nHurt so that really hurts and here's the interesting question so I have no idea no idea whether or the other ladies ally and this lady seems like she as I don't know whether the other ladies are if they are what happens to them or they prosecuted\nWell there's no way that there's no way anybody is going to be able to prove whether something happen or not Seventeen years I mean when they were Seventeen years old thirty three years ago\nA lady just got a a year in prison at least a year in prison for false accusations about sexual misconduct and stuff ... yeah I forget where it was but I read about that God that would be interesting you know if you're making a false accusations about that and you're ruining someone's life possibly yeah you know are ruining their career or whatever what happens to you you can't just go\n... going around making accusations of ... ... ...\nHe did say she was a hundred percent positive that it was cabin on you know as she ends up being wrong about that yeah it was an al ...\nSome of the guys are saying no he wasn't even there when I was there I've done as I've gotten you know he wasn't even one of the big it'd be protecting their friend when I re read we know it goes on I ... my whole thing is I don't ... and I'm not even\nSaying why did you wait I understand why one way of showing it was only Seventeen year old and wait and why they never say anything and\nHow it affects their lives but I I right now it doesn't seem like there was a big enough\nThat it it seemed like at the time even if they went on to the police in this or this guy picked me up and carried me into the room I think he was sexually assaulted me I was worried I was going to get smaller and\nHe did eat me didn't so what did he do Bailey make German carry other ideas Monday morning on bread\nDo do that anymore right and and don't drink anymore because you know more and when you drink apologize to the lady and that's it now you're bringing up thirty three years later we don't really know all the all the facts and\nWe all want to say half the woman was violated he should be in trouble in Germany but nobody really knows what happened and we can't prove it either way and people are so quick to punish one side of the other automatically call one of them the bad guy and we don't really know what happened in ... and it and we're fighting about is whether one deserves\nThe benefit of the doubt and the other one does\nI think you'll have trouble things is this lady the sweat naked ladies said that she had such a good memory and then she went on to call him our cabin on ... died and she said that uh they were by the ... and ... the the ... the interviewer was like well did you see them spike in terms of you\nKnow but they were near it oh and then they were near there in the hallway where a there was women in

I I don't know what's the I mean it just I don't care it doesn't seem to make any sense to me the state they they weren't a new stadium mood seem all their money would go there yeah over or or at least the organizations money would go\nInto making that one team now you have to\nDo maybe they're trying to get some of the rowdy and ... get a better crowd per ... per square foot you know what I mean like you you look at the size of that venue and how many people show up for soccer games right now I don't\nKnow I don't know idea but it's now two sports say if you I don't care about uh\nUh Amazon is raising the minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour for all of its us employees but somebody just announced that this morning Amazon tweeted out the new Amazon Fifteen dollar minimum wage will benefit more than three hundred and fifty thousand fulltime\nPart-time temporary and seasonal employees we encourage other large employers to join us in raising starting pay and Amazon policy will advocate for Congress to raise the\nAs I Am this bothers me because Jeff Bass says is the richest billionaire in the entire world who runs Amazon I anyway to\nHear your ... going back to raise more because you'll be giving them twenty dollars for\nMuch money on that what you could ...\nMinimum wage now I have no idea and Florida I think it's ten dollars you know it's like eight name find out what\nMinimum wage is now and then you're going to tell me that uh this guy won eight twenty five okay age twenty five an hour and he wants almost double that and that's not enough\nFor you know what do you think about all this study they did when they first started raising the minimum wage to Fifteen dollars in the cities and they found that it absolutely does nothing for the people that are making more money because now the employees have to cut their hours back\nBecause they can't they don't have to do that I was on doesn't have the Amazon the Hooters won't make any of those girls fulltime because when they have to pay them better right Amazon like not only will give me benefits but if we're going to double your pay because we're doing so well\nI don't know that if they are getting their you know hourly employee benefits that Amazon's I of course they are I mean I I don't know I just feel like\nIf you are a full time employee you're getting benefits and now you're\nEight hours old time yeah there's a lot of them that are not ... not Amazon's\nFall but those people that are in full time there are seasonal and part time they're also going to get Fifteen dollars an hour and\nDo know hold on let me look at ... ... no I don't know what you\nThink there has to do with anything you you if you if you have to wear is worth a hundred million dollars should have to pay you centerfold a percentage of his money like I don't know where he does McDonalds oh their ... their workers because the McDonald's family or whoever owns them out of the ray crock families so originality\n... if you're going to be Amazon and you're going to pound your chest about raising minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour and the c._e._o. you're worried about sixty four in\n... the national level of minimum wage of three hundred and fifty thousand plus employees also you may want to listen to this the perks of being Amazon employees don't stop at collaborating with great people on exciting innovative projects we also offer a full range of benefits to regular fulltime us employees that support\nEmployees in eligible family members including domestic partners and their children\nBenefits include medical a prescription drug dental and vision coverage\nFour oh one K. savings plan\nPaid time off in a ... holiday uh overtime pay resources to help improve overall wellbeing\nAnd discounts on Amazon purchases suck it now\nYou also have to understand that when somebody says somebody is worth a hundred and sixty four billion dollars\nIt's not like they're going to go to the ATM take ten dollars on it was gonna say you know I have a hundred and sixty three billion where yeah I I mean and I don't know how you think that that so so are you saying now that if Cox stock goes up next one that\nThey are are somehow required to give you a raise\nThey're not required to but if you're going to be a company on that national level and you're going to say it's great that I'm giving all these employees Fifteen extra or raising the minimum wage in a time when we've seen giant corporations get bailed out by banks and the government and the middle class is shrinking\nThis is great but they can be doing so much more for that only listen\nThere they are creating jobs every day with the successor Amazon they're they're creating jobs not only for the Amazon workers but for the postal workers for the people who make those little brown boxes are they are making a ... year forgetting that they're taking\nA nationally imposed a minimum wage level and voluntarily gobbling it\nBut it's not even like well we'll bring you to to Amazon will give you a tender like we'll give you a\nFifteen dollars out almost doubling with the national average lead to disagree they can be the only two years and here's two things one you're not required to work at Amazon\nYou can work at Amazon if you want to and you're gonna get Fifteen dollars an hour and if you're full time you get all those benefits to one of Amazon loses money or those people when they get money back there there hey we doubled your wage all those whatever can we have some of that back 'cause we're doing bad now but he's gonna give that money back\nYou're you're you're um you know your age\nGroup has a sense of entitlement a like you've done nothing I mean you but I mean saying you've done and nothing\nTo a ... you know you you went in the ... most people were him Amazon I Would imagine if you're making eight dollars an hour you don't have much of an education or you'd have a better job and now this company is going to just go hey well but you know starting Monday we're going to double your pay most people in this world would be thrilled to death and you're\nComplaining about I'm complaining because my I watched my parents and numerous people my age watch their parents go through the recession two thousand eight people lost everything okay but whose fault is that\nA cording in the news it was Wall Street's fault yeah by the end what is it has to do with him in the Bible\nWhat do you mean but it has to do it was only ... the entitlement attitude that your comment okay go ahead what I'm saying is is because we watched all that happened and we watch all these corporations take advantage of families all across this country but\nYou realize that the families not all of them but most of them who took out those long trousers they couldn't afford are almost ... they're half is is responsible\nFor the I don't do that without owns you you if you should know right now the reason you don't live in a six thousand square foot house just 'cause you're smart you know that you're not you can't afford that right so you don't go out and get a loan even if somebody says but Spanish we give you a loan to get it you're smart enough to know in the end if not going to work out for you so that's half of the fall I agree with that yeah\nThe white Celtic show is back on one or two five the bone\nI just don't understand I'm not mad at you I just don't I Know you ... [laughter] I don't I just don't understand where you're coming from like\nHow how do you not how do you not look at a a situation and say well I was with this guy who's doing this is this is good this is a positive now more people want to go work for Amazon Amazon will grow this is a constant cycle of\nOf an upswing of an economy this is why more people are working the company going bigger prices will probably go lower and more people are consuming I mean this is a good\nCycle all I said is that he could do more of the company could do more now than I and I\nCame in the same how much more you would expect in why you expect that you deserve anymore and\nI don't even work for them to know about ... million dollars is right [laughter]\nUh Kayla good morning\nOr good I got\nThe math and actually talking about 'cause there is enough you know\nIt was just a quick look up a ... million dollars\nA year okay for the worst\nThat out by that presented the south and employees as well as US dollars into the news that says nothing\nRight so you're saying that that the one guy Spanish to try to vilify for doubling their salary if you take his meager salary that he draws from a company worth a hundred and sixty four billion dollars and give it to everybody it would be nothing okay yeah so I thank you a mark go ahead\nHey a Spanish number one if you were pretty rare you pass the SATs or pre med this whole acting as dumb as you do for radio I'm not buying it\nI don't think Spanish just trying to dumb I think he doesn't really understand and I think there's a certain sense of entitlement that his age group has that I don't understand for some reason I\nI I that's I agree with you\nAnd I don't know Spanish has it'd be good Spanish as long as I've known him as young as he was when he started\nHere has always been an incredibly hard worker so for that which would make me more noise like when I was a kid I was really poor and I was like help everybody and then I started making a little money and I ... and the only way to make this money has to work and earn as a mom I forget everybody 'cause I Know what it takes to get there and you\nHave done that I worked your way out I still want to help everybody but I don't I help yes but give them everything yeah why ... ... money with all these CEOs yeah but they do that I Know\nYeah I didn't hear what you're saying you're over as in work I Am at my house in ... but that's how you get that ... and I agree do you ever see that\nPicture of Jeff Bezos sitting in a one bedroom apartment with the banner that says Amazon on top of it that's where it starts\nI agree with what you're saying I don't disagree all I said what more can be done Mm oh by the parents that means I'm entitled\nSo it is I mean uh you're not you're not appreciative of what is being done I'm Jason good morning\nLaura everybody else or to do the goods or\nSpanish or you're killing me this this is part of the ... just hit the nail the head Mike without a fight over but why does the income of the company have anything to do with the salary I Am self employed\nI don't buy states my family will have building a company if the argument is that because the companies or it's a lot or should get paid a lot I haven't taken a a chicken a year and a half but my company\nSo should lie employees be paid to go to show my business\nHas to go up to a point to an issue in each other\nAre you a multibillion areas they're not yet well than talking to you when you get\nPaid based on yeah but he is now you were talking about two thousand eight teams\nAnd how not buying that we're not arguing about the same thing\nHow many employees do you think Amazon has there any way to look at every under without that older over three hundred and thirty out for the\nThousand so he is now saying hey here's our annual budget for salaries for minimum wage employees are we're doing really well what can we do to help them out why figure out where we could double their salaries\nAll his employees I Can't be kidding me and we get the benefits and we get this kind of emerging as a very thrilled to death right here like yours amount of I'm not I'm going all I said was they could do more\nSpanish we have sixteen lines and all of them say Spanish is wrong except for one guy let's take that one call Ryan good morning\nYes sir so all I'm trying to say is the point is the hours that that Amazon can offer their folks are purposely taken away\nDuring seasonal times after the sequel ours are for Bill so they really don't give all these benefits they tried to make it being better than it actually is way say they got ... million\nSo it's kind of like Walmart they do offer those benefits for the full time employees buffer but they've mainly hire part time in detail employed and then they lay those people often they don't need them so they're not really paying out as much as you'd like to say\nWell there's still giving you a ... an hour later if you already working for you will pick up a retail job for the season in the mall you're not going to get Fifteen dollars an hour\nTo do it right right right it's not a real problem with the\nReal problem is that companies like him or Amazon and apple and all these other huge corporation\nSpanish was really trying to get at is that those companies all use offshore bank accounts and other ways to bait our tax system so that's what really needs to be addressed is that they're not paying us tax dollars which could help the families that Spanish is really trying to actually talk\nAbout using you're going to try and tell me that Amazon berries all of their profits in an hour ago and you know ...\nTaxes you know you know just like apple but also it up and I had to pay Ireland and backpacks and okay thing user\nBut inside of Amazon raising minimum wage they could hire more full time employees and give them benefits because it is because back to what Ryan was saying they hire all these part time employees they're paying them more but they're only working there working\nA lot last hour or so really the company is saving money because they're not paying for the benefit do you hear it they actually hired full time employees it'd be more beneficial\nThan what do you think of a hard time employee and I was on does go go pulse off off the shelf the\nYou know I actually know someone who works for Amazon or the ... and when does he do he worked on the line\nSo which means why do they put it in a in an envelope and passed down and actually I\nUh boxing stacking like they do at\nUsing nail on the deserved Fifteen dollars an hour okay that the ... but I don't understand it but then ...\nYou think can be Donald's burger deserved Fifteen dollars an hour and ... but\nThat's not what we're arguing were arguing that this company is coming out and saying we're doing this great thing for our seasonal part time employees but the reality is I like I said earlier the studies that had been done on these families that are getting their wages increase nothing beneficial it's happening to them the the\nThe seasonal part time employees should we brought into this because if you are looking for a seasonal part time job then it's not your\nCareer that to Amazon higher\nIt's an all that they hire you lose all of their employees you know ... there's a lot of fulltime employees are a lot of managers there's a lot of different different uh people that work there and stuff yeah there are some ... on a part time and stuff also I'd like to point out just by raising that so that Fifteen dollars an hour\nThat there are three hundred and fifty thousand employees which is low end of what they have and stuff that per hour they're paying out five million two hundred and fifty thousand dollars per\nBeen that matters that they're paying as much ... money\nAgain yeah the bottom line to the company what I'm saying is to me the employees are more important than the company and what I'm trying to argue is that like I said the studies that have been done about these families show that that the majority of these things for seasonal part time employees\nDon't benefit them because they cut their hours they don't give them any benefits and then they have\nA let me read the headline real quick here according to ... and this is breaking news from seeing NBC dot com Amazon raises minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour for all us employees not just their minimum not there's a minimum I Would ever really\nAre I mean I Know what the headlines and but we all know the headline but headlines are made to grab your attention they're not all the time the most accurate\nAmazon and and CEO Jeff Bezos have been facing criticism for its pay disparity\nThe new minimum wage will benefit more and more than two hundred and fifty thousand Amazon employees so that means fifty thousand of them or even miss is being ... including part-time temporary employees and a hundred thousand seasonal employees so three hundred and fifty thousand of their employees\nTo a hundred and fifty thousand of which\nAre their regular a full time employees will benefit from this okay\nSo the hundred thousand part time in temporary employees\nBut the answer to your question is don't take the ... they become a full time employee and if it's not getting a fair go somewhere else\nI don't I don't like my my argument are arguing is based on you are saying that it's not benefiting the people as much as the company would like to say and as I say if you don't wanna go or somewhere else the company is voluntarily doing more to help the employees that they have\nI I agree with that they're doing more to help the plays that they do have but if you're going to be Amazon you're going to be your chest about raising it to Fifteen dollars ... there there can be more that can be done this goes for Apple because there are a lot of big corporations that when they're CEOs retired but given away a lot of the million dollars", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Loveline", "city": "Sarasota", "day": "03"}
