they are like mixture a ashes in the soil and planted a tree or\nWhatever [laughter] whatever I went and found out every hair idea then how would I\nThink it's not a good idea I just I don't want to be mixed with the dirt if I did I was just a very ... you know the reason I'm asking is because I got a story here where they say that tons of human ashes are scattered every year where\nWould that the places on full alert for it statue\nOf liberty they even have a code called ... clean up if if it happens\nSo not statue of liberty or had sexual every White House\nNote will closer closer to us from Cape Canaveral slightly closer ...\nThe happiest place are oh did they yeah they always nice guys for their support I really I ... yeah so did I Know in my well Jesus Christ [laughter] sodium is we're going to read\nThrough the wall Street Journal that says that they get\nCodes called a habit clean up which require a vacuum\nThat will clean up finer particles and that they are constantly pulling out ashes out of flower beds and places in Disney World where they think that their family wants to be human ashes have been spreading a flower beds bushes and our magic kingdom lawns ... outside the park gates enduring fireworks displays on pirates of the Caribbean\nAnd in the mode underneath the flying off into the Dumbo ride whatever you just went on a ride\nWith me I have well how much ash do you have to put in there before you can say rationed sprint\nOr like when I went on a ceremony one time where they threw somebody that's just off a boat into the water right shop I mean the fish ah guys yeah dead people face now ...\nBy the way it did you ever return the dead ladies Hawaiian shirts or the dead why in church guy do we have to return them I didn't I thought you were mirrored all she said she wanted a back to that husbands oh I still have a lot most frequently of all I don't know ... according to the audience yeah part in park workers they've been dispersed\nWhere in Disney World pretty obviously we think about a small world no ... no I don't think about it I don't I don't go to Disneyland here knows the [laughter] I've been to Disney when I was like a horse you happy for\nThe most frequent place is the Hong Kong mansion ... know that it doesn't seem like a place you'd want to put somebody that's why we got the graveyard generic our president's all of our foot me up there with all of a you don't even know they're just sit there in Grover Cleveland chest pocket you fill out the country ... yeah you got to you\nAnd they are real there are some people do it and they'll go and scatter and like you know seven different places the I'll I asked you don't just around yeah wondering whether or not\nDo we all definitely wanna be cremated though I don't know how you get a cheaper for my family you don't have to buy a plot of land anywhere yeah I don't know I\nI think I Do I just want to you I Want like my son because I assume he is every adult by the time I Want somebody to come over and just before they turn around you're dead right oh yeah and I found that\nThat's how I feel like is I get ... cremated and then two weeks later they go oh we found that special syringe and that brings everybody back to life oh now they died within the last might as well yeah cream a or\nYou say apparently speaking humor range into Disney isn't all that hard\nFamilies who have done it before so that they put the ash into a prescription pill bottle or makeup compact or Ziploc bag hidden at the bottom of the pres yeah I doubt they're looking for a while they inspect every bag that goes in yeah they do help out of the bag and they go in there were a little stick and they look around\nIt's just a matter of spreading there remains the right spot and hoping the custodians don't catch you and if they do the park staff simply sucks them up with their special\nVacuum grandma [laughter] I'm getting hot in the act will also get kicked out of the park yeah band or just kicked out this type of behavior is strictly bread but it is and he said gas to attempt to do so will be escorted off the property so it looks like he didn't get kicked out to do it before the relief yeah yeah\nUm I Would say I can do this with no problem in fact I'm going to try and take a pill bottle filled with just\nSearch and see if I get different or something like that yeah I have a
