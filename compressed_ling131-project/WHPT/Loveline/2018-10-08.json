I don't think I can handle a ... if if a ... I can do is uh is she was the first movie around him and I started off or go to sleep on those until\n[laughter] what was the\nFirst time ... I Can't believe I'm here I've done it I've made it a little dog has made it to where he wanted to be\nWell you know it was it started way back when I was you know in my early twenties I managed to\nBe an extra Blade Runner oh really yeah it's so that was pretty pretty neat me in a ... it's a scene where Harrison Ford has it took five nights to shoot the scene where he's chasing the\nRed headed robot lady down the street to a murderer before she falls roller class right and um so uh uh\nWe figure it out me and my buddy figured out that when we were extras on the set that if you got and Harrison Ford's way while he was running he's super\nMean I listen to it I get it it's the absolute worst thing to have to stay up late doing a show then go home and finally I got to sleep only to have some person that smells like cigarettes that you don't come wake you up at\nFour o'clock in the morning and be like now we got to go talk to some Yahoo is you don't know and the worst is\nThat a years ago I usually go by the name ... had say we don't know me and you show up in a city you know I hate tomorrow morning I have to do ... do you like Jesus Christ why am I doing this will be very Leno it's cool because when you don't like how I'd we're going to take you to talk to these Julian does on TV on the network and a lovely NBC's Asian\nAnd you're going to cook with a chef for ... like you I I get it and I totally\nYeah they're good morning TV show called um uh you know good morning or a [laughter] I Want to say I wake up Portland or a ... in\nPortland and uh I Do it every time that I go through\nBecause\nYou know it's Portland yeah they don't you know even though the only people watch you know probably like soccer moms they don't care that I just high on my mind and they do at the pet segments and the cooking segment so they did\nAll the normal while you know crash with me high out of my mind a spy and uh yeah but\nNormally the morning television is even worse than morning radio\nYou got to be presentable to that and you're in Philly\nThe state with somebody like four five minutes law in the interview and they don't know anything about you'd probably have a question like tell us about your comedy [noise] uh what can people expect from your show and I ate out here just like ah me talk\n[laughter] I got to lead you know like a really big like\nCrazy and what's where's that or the radio shows are like hey right now a couple of started bell rang a\nBob and Tom average guy in a\nVery cute they give you a list to attend like space or give us ten things to bring up that would lead you into jokes I couldn't possibly like you know Fifteen minutes later he goes so you like dogs I like I forgot what I\nDon't know what you\nAre you know kind of food yeah [laughter] I Know\nI mean obviously Bob and Tom are wildly successful or were in their day\nBut how do you or that I don't know that like I ... I was always surprised with comedians who had other comedians right their jokes well then those guys are the comedians you're just ... you know what I mean it's definitely are writing partner but like I don't even know if I if I Need you to give me the the things I'm supposed to ask you then what ... what is my job\nI liked the system with a stand up comedy of like comics will suggest things to each other yeah but basically we All right our own stuff\nRight or he sat there with each other and refining their rent and you\nCould come up with stuff together I certainly yeah you just a ... it's odd concept to me for somebody to have a riders but then when it comes to Bob and Tom like\nA you know they were nice to me and uh I I had a good I have a good time being in there with them and doing it but at the same time they do have you know two three four comics on every single day and say all of their plugs repeatedly out the show\nAnd it just you know started feeling more and more to me like well this is this isn't doing anything for me this is making a great radio so for you guys are but it's I think it helped me sell tickets now because people are already like me\nWe'll find out you have to listen to the Bob and Tom as well\nYou know he's a ... I I got to tell you as a radio guy I can relate to what you were saying before about being up on stage with comedians do near pike have we were in Montreal a couple of weeks ago for the comedy festival in there and we did our show\nAnd then when we're done German Sam go on for another hour or so I came walked in to go see that when I walked in the ... right in front of the like Hey Mike I'm a guy or to break and come back Mike I'm ... I'm I this is this is pretty cool so when we come back from breaking the producer comes over to goes I already had two minutes reminded okay\nAnd I go to Joe coy um what's that guy the little\nThe little guy from a ... a bride was probably there I didn't see him a crowded out there yeah yeah yeah I'm a ... a a DeStefano and I'm seeing the car Jimmy car and I and I tried to walk over and I know and I\nKnow that I don't know I don't I'm On this is not\nThis is not the time for me to go wedge myself in between Jimmy car anchors\nAre seven and be like hello [laughter] of tablets health until\nYou know like I Know I I mean I Would\nCertainly wasn't afraid to do it but I'm due to certain places where you don't belong and that was not one of the places\nRight on well that's a real murder Israel\nComic that are all just going to you know ... plus\nAlternative ... I'm like hey joke or I don't have that that I Will I Will wrap your head right off\nThe origin me carve out there I'm not gay that fills you know how I look at the top hat [laughter]\nI I actually like\nGive them a lot I just know he's a great guy a fire but if he were to get carried away I would've been like a Dr\nYeah no but I ... in that situation I'm sure he was the bottom of most of the jokes I'm In my old shift or do you feel it in there\nI Would have been fined mark I would have been fined ended up being the butt of the joke\nThe joke is funny and all like Jimmy car he intimidates me a little bit below jihad or dry is very dry right but I also find them to be very amusing so I Would have taken all the heat for Christmas ... dumb guinea\nNew York thing tried to get out of the hour to get up and kicked him out of the slowdown Bronx happening a badge why that's why I was smart enough to know\nKnock 'em dead I can hang out All right favorite movie of all I mean you do top three of you on the air is very hard to do one I yeah it's sad to hear three\nI I always I always sell out on these questions because I there's just so many things I Love that's a whole lot about movies\nYeah if you ask me what next week I always have one or two consistent ones but then depending\nOn what I'm thinking of more recent ... year is a big one for\nYou all men more recent what's the one we just what's the one that oh I Love that movie that you hated the one that you would do when I fly a parking\nLot lately I don't know how dirty kids in a parking lot love sort of a journey to the bargaining ah I literally could just set up a camera in a Walmart Pearl Harbor and\nI liked about it a real it was like I was acting hurting real\nIt hurt me I grew up as a poor kid not that poor but uh watching it I was like these kid this is life for a while to those people in Orlando and I and those kids were that kid was such a good actor\nAnd that was the first time the cheetah active and the same thing with the mother and I was like and then the mother with the Craig's list of ours like I was just so disturbing an awesome at the same time\nYeah it's very uh it's very unsettling but also heart warming strangely and yeah and uh the ending is sad and uplifting at the same time it's really a weird movie by and Willem Dafoe though like I was grateful that he was in there it was great but also just remind you that it's a movie right\nBy the known person who had like ... if\nHe hadn't been in there and has been like yeah they they still\nNeed to go to her book ask\nYou a\nVery ...
