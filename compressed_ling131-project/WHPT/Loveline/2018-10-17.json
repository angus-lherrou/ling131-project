I think what the problem is is the people making the child porn are a lot harder to get than the people that are looking at it well and if the ... century or if you're looking at it you're probably you could definitely act on it you know and then making your own so I or are you giving people that like a child part of the\nPasser no no no it's just kind of like you're saying is that why is that\nAlways like you never hear about a child video production ring\nWell yeah what I think it is and you do sometimes but I Would equate it to you never you don't hear as much as we got this guy with you know\nFive hundred pounds of cocaine worry we busted you know eighty different people that had a little bag of cocaine to know what I mean so a lot harder to get the main guy than it is you get all these idiots that are leaving Portland there ... now I'd definitely definitely don't get a pass by ...\nAlso so I was talking to some cops about um about do you know kids are trained and now the now the new team they still use these video games\nBecause people are trading through the dark Web and they're trading on line and and the porn guys the the ... are doing on video games 'cause we're sure either way to find a bunch of kids F that's why I hopped on four nights a little while trying to learn how to play and I spy on my son we play there once in a while\nJust to make sure no troops are coming out here man I'm but they do all that there and now the cops are going in and monitoring them they're playing it and they're getting in which I think is great\nUh but I said I was like why\nDon't you do it makes it gives a lot of the production comes out of this country which makes it impossible for us unless you're a great job he'll order it's\nToo far to write about in the area ... charges against you know whenever country around which is brilliant yeah\nUm no but uh uh he said that any photograph that you get right now that's child porn they have already\nThey've seen it I get there could be millions of us are going but they mark them all so when you get it they know that you're getting a sure now if you get one in your email and you open up they're going to comes former house no but if you start collecting thousands of them and distributing the other people right ads when you've than when they\nGot a flag and they know to come to come swooping in andme\nYeah so have you been getting away for a for a year that's what\nHe or the you know you're also not getting away with it they no no I don't really watch are getting away they're watching to see what you do it it's the same people that don't pay their taxes they're like oh it's been like four years my taxes yeah they're going to lie you know it's not like they're like oh you know they're just building a case against you and let you do all your dumped\n...
