the people want to know about yeah and then um I don't know how\nAt my fantasy teams are probably at some point\nI think I think will definitely get to that the first thing we started off really every week previewing the bugs game and man there are a lot of injuries from the bucks bangles game this week you see Gerald McCoys out Kwame Alexander's out Vinnie curries out\nFor the bangles you still have a violent as birth the dirtiest part in the NFL is out you know a big plus for the buccaneers\nHow do you see this matchup going I think you were the only person to predict the buccaneers to beat the browns last week\nYes I was and I actually perfectly predicted the week before when we'd lose to the falcons um\nLast minute which we did [noise] did it and heartbreaking fashion and still I'm Still stuck on the kicker thing I Know like a I think it was swayed was texting me when when um he missed the extra point I miss the extra point again and it's just\nYou know a ... a cutter is that is a good case in point the whole game and it just turns a game into something that you don't want to like I I I compare to the like the what the patriots did against the cheese\nYou play a normal game and then the better team at the end that night goes down and wins the game that's exactly what we've got to do with Cleveland at the end of the game and the best that they'll go but thank thankfully he hit the um the fifty nine you order\nI said this when I was on dribble live this weekend and tell me what you think you know we all I don't know if it's the media just fans we want our team to be the best or probably the worst right and I think that's where you go hey ... bucks to go to the super Gulf its magic oh man ... a couple of games they drop one of the bears they're the worst team I've ever seen\nIt's not sexy but you're a big time fan or the buccaneers an average team\nUm I think they're actually I think they're actually above average I really do I think that we're in a really tough division I think we're one of those teams that I mean okay if you're comparing like quarterbacks I think\nYou know you have you have breathing this division of Ryan and his division Newton this division think of all the other divisions and football and what you have to deal with now we have\n... I think ... and I nailed it I think I nailed it in that ...

Brennan we're back for another week and John Brennan is a big fan of uniforms that this was back in the day when you were still on the house or show and I was probably working with jade I remember I came by ...\nWorked very early in the morning and for some reason we start talking about uniforms for probably an hour an hour and a half and there's a website you go to the ranks\nUnify right right yeah yeah it's a it's like a a blog uni watch and um if you follow them onto it or they're really really good if you're into that guy geek stuff how many people are into that I don't know nobody I don't know why we're even a you're bringing it up but um\nI don't know I just I'm like one of those like detail oriented like perfectionist guy so it's like I like to know why you know why is like Carolina still wearing those terrible horrible uniforms from when they started I like those well here's the thing it's almost become charming because it's like the nineties and that you know what's old his new\nAgain if you'd like to think about Jake alone you know\nNo now or ... or ... or or was it Steven Davis yes and I can be ... yeah and those shiny a silver pants I I don't know so then I get down to like nobody notices the pants like nobody knows and and honestly I don't think I ever\nI wasn't always like this but I always notice things like things really started like your your favorite team so if you see a logo of like your favorite team or your childhood team does that not just like stick out to you like oh yeah you get like trigger something\nSo like when you have um like I grew up in Philadelphia and I I remember being a flyers fan and a Phillies fan\nAnd I remember like opening football cards and being like you could see like instantly if you've got an eagles player like that green jumped out and so now that they have one of the worst uniforms and the league in my opinion\nI think it's like ... that's a perfect example of why I'm into uniforms so the team that and I wasn't like a huge eagles fan I'm definitely a bigger box van an eagles fan but\nThe team that I grew up rooting for had awesome uniforms like my whole childhood and then when I moved to Florida they change to this like bizarre like you know dark green weird color that's like just on appeal\nAs when they start going to Super Bowl every year though\nThat is yeah and it's obviously you know they they win more with it but it's just something that really like always struck me like why why make that change because you had\nIt figured out you know and then you look at other teams and you go here's some classic you know historical teams that aren't changing or if they do change they changed like the giants\nYou know red white and blue state red white and blue we just you know simplify it which is is cool like buttons that you know they did a whole overhaul and I asked why why do they do that you know obviously we knew why with the box\nYou know they'll losing you know you know obviously those creams that goal uniforms are fantastic and I think a lot of us would love to see them them back now that we're in normal team and we're not like a laughing stock all the time um\nWhat is your what is your showdown of the week your uniform showdown to where if you didn't play fantasy football it and you saw every game was on TV which one would you wanna watch based solely off what you uniforms are playing\nSolely on uniforms this week I just ran down the uh the line up and this is if they're wearing and I'm picking two two teams who are our traditional so most likely they're going to be that it's not going to be a color\nA John hates new teams by the way like the classics\nOf course yeah I think I think you can't go wrong with the classics and specifically the white on white classics so I'm going with the the uh coast raiders game okay uniform match up of the week you know I think\nThis is where you'd have like a ... okay you know what I mean because this something so trivial that nobody cares about that were just talking about because we have an hour on Sunday and and you're the boss yeah we get to do whatever we\nWant you know I think it's interesting I think it's you know we can sit here and we'll talk about fantasy and will break down games the best we can and I'm sure you've ... laughing at us actually is August ... you are your uniform guy I finally got to be unique because we normally say that women\nJust base who they like off of the pretty colors and the uniforms ... and all that so you're saying I'm a lady I Am saying that you were a growing
