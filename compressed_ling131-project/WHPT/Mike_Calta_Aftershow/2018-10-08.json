I I all I Know what you're saying\nBut I think I can correct you and I think upset is a couple of times I have a trigger inside my heart that wants to reward me for nothing for nothing and I think if that is the base of alcoholism I got that but\nAt the same thing with eating like I last night we got on us of our about me and I was like on an ice cream cone like I Want to treat I Want to treat myself to something and I haven't earned it\nHe's not an you know I don't know if you're an alcoholic you can't ... I mean being an alcoholic myself bird is pretty much the same guy drunk as he is sober you know what I mean yeah and he has over ... and he doesn't get into ... ... what\nHe hasn't like drinking I tried to stop I Can't ...

and and\nYou can see in the interview if you watch a video he gets really comfortable in it and he goes from not wanting to be there to being there and enjoying it and then and one of my ... my my

thing\nYeah I'm watching ... records and there was no doubt that Charles ... who was going to do it yeah and uh\nYou know I like I'm a big eagles fan and\nHe and Matt Iceland is hosting it and he is I mean as he's tasked with a very hard job he's having to be alive and be excited and they'll all the time all the time and ... and it's making me hate him to watch it so now I said\nI'm about how um like a mat Iceman as\nBeing me not want to watch the Russians guy already know that he's going to be successful you know what I'm sitting through it but he's in knowing that it because he's so happy\nI didn't know management followed me on Twitter and that you were friends with a number of them good friends and you guys talked about me being direct message and he's like\nHey man sorry my exam is all over the top I'm really happy that I was like\nI'm Sorry and then I did I just read this guy and the only life after I'm a mother I and then he and then the next morning I was in Europe called the show so I get apologized series like oh you know the ... but I did I probably because it wasn't him it was the fact that this was so drawn out on TV and all that there is now he's like such a nice guy\nThere's there's parts of what robbery will still terrible there's parts of what an idea\nWhat you're talking about that last guy I met a lot of this new guy\nAmerican Ninja warrior management host yeah no matter who wins I I Know he ... step brothers\nGuy always yelling at the camera a Spanish ... pictures of these people for\nA Bobby would you take I think that you own exotic Tony sent me so I don't I don't like robbery go just because of the football stuff they they they went to me ... like if you did that that would be such a great thing for you know people would have me do they're already was perfect he's he's\nMiddle or upper upper middle of the road sensibility is not going to be too aggressive I Would always be trying to\nPush boundaries on my friends live property goes like dude I Want my mom lag why don't you laugh no by real life [laughter] I'm tired I really like\nIt would be great for football and he would bird goes over the line he he's gone he'll go for funny burgers for funny for him\nHe would align college football college football Saturday on ESPN you would be the biggest hero\nThat ... that sports TV and everything he gets ... no he wouldn't have I'm telling you when you would be all college football ... they would go nuts for you okay do you think it's hard is it difficult for you know and this is the hardest part of being opposed to\nHave you can love robbery law not saying you know but I I don't and I have no problem about saying it and I was much shock jock sometimes you have to catch people that are on like\nBut I think that it's more real when you're dishonest about how you feel not worry if I have to see him again rises off my my ... no no no no yeah that's really hard for me to do like I had her and does that really well\nWe just bizarre if they didn't like you know he's ... he's on your face in San Diego see I I have a there's a there's a bunch of I had a woman on asking be who got destroyed on my pocket Irish yeah yeah\nI Would say that everyone who is that you know one person likes her ...\nBe she comic yeah very pretty very very funny very like I really enjoyed falling on Instagram\nAnd then it was like I've I randomly followed her like someone had a picture of her and I was it was pretty he was at an eclipse should comic I play one of her jokes I laugh I was like oh she's an actress oh shit feminist so cool you know have a cool conversation and she came in and I I don't know if she ... I think\nYou know some of these people these days have have agendas and they come in and they\nThey go oh I'm going to diversify cat time to hammer him and I'm not I'm not a confrontational competition and so I didn't necessarily stand up to the store I didn't stand up for the women that worked at the store I didn't stand up for the guys that were is listen to people\nAnd then I never even said anything negative about her and people still are like how dare you\nNot\nSaying your mind is defend and by the way I got I think very Kennedy I think she did not I think she kind of probably use me to an extent and just like him was like\nI got an agenda and re route real through and I just sat there and kind of took it I Know that that's what my friends that my friends my friends that I've bought guys there were like dude why didn't you stand up for yourself but it was like I don't know I just sat there like I don't want to kind of like arbitration\nPart of the thing is you want to hear what they have to say I do want to say and let them hang themselves but you do you were you afraid his manager\nOr did you just I don't know I I don't know the how many women were working at the store I don't know it was all about ... you you listen to it right yeah I just don't think Europe prepared for that hunters haired for it well yeah and so\nIt's part of it and I'm being serious as part of the reason why you think in the back of the mind you want to be confrontational is because they get mad and walk out there for a walk out of your house [noise] no I Am serious if you get somebody in the studio right to walk\nThrough your lives every\nTime we don't come on I said dumb [laughter]\n\nAnd just hold the screen door open\nTo say that I'm cool with being confrontational with like with like a friend like Nicki Glazer came on and ... and I love Nicky and I was like I was like a oh is that because you're comfortable yeah yeah yeah but I'm not ... like with someone I don't I'm not ... that the guy when he gets\nMad at a call or something I it's my music when I sit there and I just let it I I laugh at it\nBut when I have a guest in Studio or somebody that I feel like it's getting hammered\nMy meter started around Michael this is going to be for real yeah and I'm like I don't want to fight with everybody and I would much rather you come into a good interviewer and be like that guy was great ... great you know who to call the show and I could have been like you suck by the\nBut the fact that he called in and was so nice it's so cool that makes it that much better than just fighting with everybody will be an advantage to just ... people to fight with them sometimes it was a brilliant but most of them they just became they were like bullies you know yeah and which is fine I worked for them but I don't feel that way but if something terms\nThat you know the you know the best part\nIs coming it's funny because he knows whenever I get mad can lay out\nIn the last like someone who get death threats and the U.S [laughter] once you've been a sign of a way to live\nOn it but then when he gets mad at somebody whatever I just kinda baffling alright let's see where the guy I don't want to step on anything so I'm just like\nThat when I'm when I'm fighting with someone who has visited with somebody in the studio like going through Gallagher out everybody everybody just gets quiet and put your head on them I I got this\nWell I Do I Know I got I got you got my bag yeah yeah I was enjoying it I just don't want to step out anything I especially being all miserable and stuff and he goes that you tell stories that don't go anywhere\nIs asking them questions it's an interview anyways I asked ...\nSo I never watch leave it to beaver 'cause I'm forty seven now but that show was black and white and I knew about it but when I was a kid you know they always had Marilyn Manson was a kid from a Wonder Years yeah and you know just like one of those dreamer so I said all my life I thought\nThat you were at a high school that was from leave it to beaver and ... and that's what you know I grew up until I was in high school I Believe that\nAnd then he just because I'm like I'm actually I'm telling ya\nAnd then he was going to go ahead carry on and I'm like oh don't tell me what to do I I was like why even here why do we put her on this\nRight because they may carry on as the English now Larry on a on a cell that and he had ... he does get hot air and he said something about our he has yet to smash year fruit [laughter] go smashing your fruit in\nThe hall it was the bass line you could have sat for three hundred days with a group of writers and tried to come up with a better life for ... getting kicked out of a radio ... go last year fruit and all that was a good beginning ... anybody else I Know\nKnow we're not like fight most people I mean if they're idiots will fight with well you don't\nDo what you I I don't know if you've ever kick someone out of a podcast like in my mind you're right that this is the worst part is however had is I had a guest on who trash to a celebrity really bad like trashed his celebrity", "year": "2018",
