[noise]\n\n\nSo the American Heart Association put out kind of guidelines recommend okay\nAnd what they recommend is thirty minutes of exercise five times a week okay they had an easy enough yeah and what you know they kind of break it down and and they recommend that you have so if you add that up that's a hundred and fifty minutes\nAnd all that they recommend that Seventy five minutes should be vigorous exercise so taking your heart rate to its maximum amount okay and that that has a lot to do with when you go back to that video to max\nWhat ... is a correct double thing it's an adjustable thing it's a it's a modify a bubble you know how ...\nAnd so you can increase your ... through aerobics exercise but you can only do it so much with say you up and run a lap around the building and if so you do that every day it may increase your video to max but not substantially okay and so what you need to do\nIs interval training and that's where\nElite athletes can expand and increase their veto to max and\nSo there's lots of different programs I was up ... looking at different uh interval training programs and they have some for you know the endurance athletes so and the people that they they consider them you know have the most enduring cyclist runners\nCross country skiers which I was surprised that but you know those those are the people that have the highest video to max and so the normal person walks around with a video to max again it's an arbitrary number but about thirty how those people are up around a hundred because\nTheir lungs taking so much oxygen heart pumps so much and gets the blood around\nAnd so that the interval training is what you do to take that to the maximum amount you take your heart rate to the maximum amount you're really pushing your body and the goal to begin with is about three minutes of training\nSo okay that's not counting increase it is is what I what I heard what I read you know is that you want to just start slow you take it to the maximum amount try and do it for three minutes try and push yourself to the maximum for three minutes\nAnd then take some risk scaled back down go back at it again and try and get your heart rate up and that's how you can you know increase your cardio respiratory fitness and then expand from there\n[noise] well I think it's it's definitely a feasible\nThing that we should all be doing right and I think\nIt's important to change it up yes you don't want to do the same kind of of workouts I Know we were I was talking to Ryan before and he was saying about young incorporates swimming and and all of that and not just that the boxing in that the cardio I have that yeah the whole side of things that by using different just focus on different muscles to focus on different breathing techniques\nYeah the city training is is high intensity interval training is really the best the best way to approach it and that was the other thing that the American Heart Association said that if I didn't mention is you should have strength training okay or a couple of times a week and so vigorous you know cardio exercising if\nAnything the thing is is thirty maybe forty five minutes just to kind of get your blood flowing to get your heart rate up to ... you know everybody can make time for that you can pick up pick a time it whether it's in the morning listening to my cats are on Saturday morning listening to the way the ... and flag\nAnd the limit of any age should not sit around and get moving absolutely call what do you what do you want to chat about next uh let's see I was going to come out of the flu shot maybe I'll it's very important yeah I already got mine but it was primarily because I was sitting next to my kids I told them I'd do it first\nThey got well hey you can't you gotta practice what you preach up all type of flu and and another what I hear it's going to be I I have a flu season if you know if you haven't heard already and and that and your flu shot so well at that and of course if you have anything else you want to talk with Dr Cooper about eight hundred seven seven one\nOne or two five or Seventy seven five seven nine minute you buy thank you to lands marketing our show producer their Tampa's healthcare marketing expert visit them it lends marketing dot com that lends within the marketing dot com\nThank you to Florida cancer specialist were hope is powered by science and as an F.

high dose flu vaccine that's out there now and so there is but it's only available at this point for people over sixty five oh and what it is is basically to boost it up flu shot that uh has extra\nAntibodies stimulating energy other have got\nOh I wouldn't have why would you think that wouldn't be available for everybody\nSo it's only been approved for people over sixty five because that's the only area that would the researched and it's a I don't it may have only been been out for a few years now but the research study in the FDA approval that they got was in a group of people that were sixty five and ... over and so\nYou should be able to take that information and apply it and say well people under sixty five should get it too but unfortunately it doesn't always work that way with the FDA approval yeah it's age dependent and what they what they researched and so [noise]\nUm for people over age sixty five you can get this high high dose flu vaccine and some of the stuff that I read is that it's available in a lot so you come to a place like where I work where there's a lot of different providers you can ask your provider if you're under sixty five if you can get the high dose flu vaccine\nI don't know what the cost would be to be honest with you I don't know that they would would give it a huge littered off label [noise] um but some off label treatments you know if if you want to pay the extra few bucks and and get a high dose flu vaccine something worth asking about as well but definitely if you're over sixty five they do recommended\nHundred ... and check
