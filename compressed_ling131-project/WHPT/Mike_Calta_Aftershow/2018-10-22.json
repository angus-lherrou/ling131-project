worked out good\nHe's a great guess yeah a show it'd be like if you were racing fan you know that I'm not okay but there are certain guys who rise above the sport right his father was certainly one of them he the story of him coming in after having such a popular father and NASCAR being a family type uh you know there are a lot of family drivers\nFive of the victims are men and one is a woman five of the victims were found wounded at the scene near a laundry Matt another victim arrived at the hospital on their own Jacksonville police that the victims range from ages of twenty to Seventy years old\nBelief leave the shooter opened fired from the passenger side of a vehicle around twelve twenty five pm there could be more than one shooters what for what do they have any idea that I doesn't say in this story I'm sure there are still investigating tried to find out what the hell is going on average yeah can you imagine walking along and all of a sudden you get shot yeah I Know but\nUsually there's some reason for\nMaybe some ... you know what are you going to kill somebody to get into the gangs ever made a drive by governments that Jacksonville stadium which\nI have I have a garden where there's been a drive by shootings by their urine of Jacksonville your average uh yeah not a not a pleasant area now are nearly five pounds of what initially believed to be cocaine concealed in his suitcase London Nashville or has been to been determined to\nBe that no oh wow yeah that is that's worth more now equivalent of one\nMillion dollar lethal doses of that now we have a picture up on bone TV\nCheck that out I yeah so I don't know what the what is the more that and all\nYou know being right yeah yeah yeah very adept to well yeah ... is killing a lot of people yeah\nThey ... I read an article Roseanne I read an article that are opioids kill more people per year than aids did in it's heyday only alright yeah per year and that crazy scary\nYeah yeah so what would you rather have a suitcase full of cocaine or a suitcase full of a sudden all kinds of lightning rod latest fully [laughter] validating out yeah I don't think that makes any sense to have that one\nA fourteen year old girl was acting aggressively and resisting arrest Thursday when she was taken to the ground by Coral Springs police officer and punch by one of them authority said on friday so Coral Springs right here in Florida yeah we have the a news story check this out on both TV you can see the I kept punching here we go\n[laughter]\nVideo other Coral Springs police officer and a fourteen year old girl had many in an uproar\nSome angry [noise] um I Would never expect this to happen that\nDean mother Jessica Denis says watching the video it's heartbreaking\nShe clearly was an aggressive everyone confusion and laying there so um [noise] I just wonder if\nShe is hired in attorney who's that the police officer used excessive force\nClear from the video that my client was on the ground her hands are under her belly the officers knees on his back and he just got shot in her job one after another\nGirl springs belief that you were only thing the end of\nThe story believe they do too early release there were large groups of teens I'd been there more than a fourteen year old belief they were seen hitting another teen they were issued trespass warning and told not to return at least they they returned officers responded and cleaned the fourteen year old began cursing\nBelieve they wind to incite the other teams and that's why he was arrested\nAll why was she beat up why would she be nervous she had her hands underneath her yeah yeah I don't I'm not saying that it's right I think they were trying to get our hands out so they could hand cover and she was on top of ran so he's hidden or or have shots or another go yeah I don't know but you're in adult\nMan you can't you can't put handcuffs on a fourteen year old girl with our ... in the stomach yeah you're right you shouldn't be a cop yeah you're\nGoing to be able to pull the hands out already will shoot at home and they're dealing with the ... the reason I said she was arrested was because she had another person then was trying to incite the other teams\nOkay ... yeah they're down rough I don't care about that but those are back in ... or ... or the ribs just repeatedly yeah I'm sure we're going my daughter did fury I'm sure we're going\nTo be hearing more about that stuff also do on the other side of that if you ah are getting arrested by police if you don't resist rarely do they punch you in the\nRoom yeah we are he was laying down on a daily yeah but she was resisting she was drawn like they're so they couldn't ... I'm not really enjoyed doing punching ... and\nWhat I'm saying it was hard to judge because she's getting punched she could just be\nTrying to block the punching him Beth it's possible though I'm sure we're going to hear more about that story for sure on Sunday buccaneers kicker Chandler Canada's arrow I had already missed a field goal from forty yards on Sunday cancers arrows where they're calling a\nCat cat's a T I Know it can't\nAll Gallo I'm Sorry I was era I Gotcha I Gotcha are still in Tampa Bay brought him back in an attempt at eight fifty nine yard field goal in overtime few expected the move would actually work but if you look up the bone TV\nI drilled it made it for fifty nine yards and the bugs got a twenty six to twenty three when over the browns\nBoy that really corrupted better Marilyn ... was the first of all the game was true nothing than the buccaneers came back strong it was three to know what's going on there's hockey scores\nAre ... that just a little bit look it up Baker Mayfield look at his face whenever those through its appraised like why he lives there earlier that couldn't afford ... who I'd say pan\nTo have a pretty good but oh yeah I feel\nSo there'll be a great quarterback he went really high in the draft to me when I'm playing for the brown was starting yeah rather than uh the primary put them in their fans are screaming for their put them in these spoiled Taylor got hurt right\nYou tell me that her ... switch them out and put them in the middle of a game a couple of weeks ago but I think it was because Taylor got hurt and went out oh\nYeah ah Riad ... is not the only one who turned down the super bowl halftime show I also did apparently Hank did as well take reportedly did too and on the heels of that comedian Amy Schumer said friday she would not do a Super Bowl commercial this year in support of ... quarterback Colin Kaepernick\nHer message came by the same day the reports surfaced about a reality of turning down the super bowl halftime show also import and supportive Capra neck\nSchumer posted a message to her I Instagram saying she believes more white NFL players should Neal during the national anthem to show their support of their black teammates taking me has become the main form of protest and the NFL against police brutality and racial injustice in\nThe U.S you know maybe there's a maybe there's a large group of white and black guys or realize what cops have to go through every day and they're like\nOkay so there's a couple of bad apples in every job we're not going to take 'em me we ... we would support Colin Kaepernick tried to do so but we're not going to take I mean here's my question is Amy Schumer trying to get people to hate us [laughter] that was it was like she just wants to be later now\nYeah I don't know what's going on man is very weird like she's all political stuff in there and\nYou know I I I don't know if people wind up hating people who rise to fame super fast it becomes a
