radios\n[noise]\n\nWelcome to the second ever final fantasy pod cast on Sunday it is Sunday Sunday Sunday Sunday I Am here with Beth Hi\nMike olive arrow what's up man I Am John Brown and we're going to get into the role of fantasy and obviously just talk about whatever we want to talk about sports related um mostly NFL related probably just because it's Sunday is\nAnd I'll Sunday and we really don't know what we're doing still were just kind of filling the time that but not he left us\nAnd they're bucks don't play this week so I mean are people that invested in football like they were last week when there are still high hopes for the season\nI'm pretty sure everybody's still wants to talk about the bears I Do you do\n... I mean well you know there's something to say I mean uh you I think you said it all on the show last week or you know ... sucks right and the ... the ... defense is over [laughter] I think I\nI definitely went all in on a on some of my just feelings and you're right they were top five defense and they showed it um I I just didn't buy it I didn't think they were really is a real deal top five I think um\nI don't know I think it was a combination of us not really being the real deal offense combined with you guys maybe not being the real deal defense or\nWhen I take away what what's your take away about about the buccaneers from from that game and obviously do you feel like the by week coming after that loss is a good thing or a bad thing I feel like it's a bad thing because I think you want to get back out on the field and forget what happened as quickly as possible\nI feel I'm One hundred and ten percent Danny green about it I think that is the team who we thought they were\nThat's the team exactly who we were last year not as bad as not as bad as that not as good as we thought um we're probably in a in a team\nAnd I think I'm coming into this year we look at that as a good thing after the first two games a as a bucks fan I think it looks like a bad thing but look\nI I look at our schedule and it it's hard to say with with looking at a schedule what games are going to win this I I always used to hate that when when shows would like go through a one team's schedule and they're not going to win that game they're not going to yeah no one thought we were going to win the say they actually literally wrote an article talking about how\nThey're partying because the saints we're going to get a when the first week of the season and of course of course it didn't work like that\nThat's why we watch the NFL or week that we have absolutely no idea what happens when we go through the schedule we go when when last when when your team somehow always ends up uh eleven and five and in the playoffs\nYes or um five and eleven last year when we were supposed to be you know eleven and five\nBut Mike oh there or did he did predict embarrassed away and did it go to the game goes as you thought it might\nI didn't think it was going to be that much of a blowout I thought I was gonna be more like maybe thirty one twenty something like that but I just think that you know look in the NFL all these NFL defensive coordinators who are worth their salt they study game film one week of fitzpatrick it was good go against New Orleans that was somewhat of a surprise week too All right\nAgain somewhat of a surprising especially gets eagles at home\nAfter you get eight quarters a tape on an NFL quarterback and you're a defensive coordinator in all your job is to break that stuff down week in week out you got them and that's how Pittsburgh had three packs and that's how Chicago is ready for him and and that that's just I mean that's the reason why he's been a journeyman same thing I mean he's not a guy who's like a James Winston\nWell my question is cause I Know a lot of people want to Mike Smith fire to their cutter said he's just not going to do that and I read their cutters comments and\nHe's pretty much pointing I think that the players on this one he said hey the coaches didn't miss tackles the coaches didn't miss assignments that coaches you know didn't miss all that stuff\nSo that's always my question we're on a fire coaches but to me is the coaches fault as if the players fault is there a lack of talent you blame that GM's I don't really know where to dig in on the buccaneers or is it just the fourth game of the year we we don't need to start dissecting every aspect of their team right now\nBut then I see I'm On the sidelines and I'm just like I don't know I Hope a ... you know murders um [laughter]\nDo you write\nI I'm Glad he didn't come here I Am glad I mean stop living in yesteryear bucks let's move forward All right and just glad he didn't come here because I think the same show will be going on here and it wears thin quickly\nOkay I have some I have some legit\nFantasy um issues do you run through players' names situations flexed player and get your opinion as I'm using the show for every single week this is just for you or I did it help you out just for an entire things just for me there is no sponsor there's nothing is it's all for me and if people listen to it who who cares but thank you\nBoys they could break we'll come back and talk about specific fantasy\nLineup flex if we're gonna make
