yeah but I mean white ...\nThe problem is is that uh if he's right about one thing it's become lately and not just for this for everything a guilty until proven innocent ... which is not the way we're unwilling to this country and that's the way it's coming out that also a ... in this case it's hurting the victim because now there's so much talk about\nGuilty until proven innocent that it's taking away from what may be the truth\nWith a that this woman in a woman and our claim it's it's ... it's it's really ridiculous I don't know how anybody ... let's just say Cavanaugh is a good guy may have anything\n... imagine if he is actually into\nOkay if he'd never assaulted any of these women if there was some sort of into that have between the two of them itchy blowing out of proportion I'm

can't\nThat that goes right along with guilty until proven innocent right you have to see the fact you have to know what's going on and something that happened thirty six years ago or whatever it's hard to know what happened to prove that hard to prove what happened\nYeah there's a lot of things man there there's a lot of times a week I think Spanish you murdered this guy ... account for where you were on Tuesday while I was by myself nobody else around no job well yeah but I Know you're an alibi but but you have\nHow many times are you by yourself just hanging out\nAnd you're at but you have to think about that like back in those days when there was that\nAs much social media in like\nCameras just equipped it around you you know what I mean like it was it was a lot harder to\nProve that yeah I feel for women back in the day that was it\nWas harder to come out because there was no way to prove these things so now that we like people are standing up and they're having a voice and
