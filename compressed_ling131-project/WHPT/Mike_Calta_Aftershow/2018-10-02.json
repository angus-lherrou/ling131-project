Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nAnyone so that means you Spanish I mean are I mean if they want to talk like your unless they're going to talk to you about ... ... the new guidance was issued a to the FBI over the weekend in response to democratic and news media pushback that the scope of the probe was to narrow it comes as the FBI presses ahead with its investigation\nQuestioning in recent days at least four people about the accusations of misconduct against Kavanaugh dating to when he was in high school and college\nI don't understand what what they're expecting to get out of the I don't I don't understand anything\nBut well have you read any of the stuff about sweating like\nThe lady that came forward the most recent one yeah I think she was a third lady that came forward stuff she I knew tell you right now I don't know I never met or anything but from my past as a profile or she is like\nAll right not only are very who not only is she lying she's cuckoo for ... medical term [laughter] yeah I mean I Believe that\nThe third or fourth person may be the first people may be absolutely telling the truth and everything and then all of a sudden somebody crazy purchased one murder\nShe was let go from a job for lying on a job at all without going to a college doing stuff she was also reprimanded about sexual misconduct well guys\nTwo guys at the place she also sued or the or some public transportation thing I forget what it was\nWhen she fell are getting off the train whatever and had her nose and stuff and she said that she was like four hundred thousand dollars in modeling contract so she was never a model of hers and then she said was modeling for met her a year after the case in court\nAnd stuff and he was at the time he goes I was ... as broke as could be I didn't have a modeling agency I don't even know what you're talking about here's your talk to me about being a character witness or something\nYeah so there's a lot of stuff listen when you lie about that stuff they're going to find out when you when you say the you were part of nine eleven and you're in New York it's ours and stops the residents gained yeah they're going to find out you know what I mean like yeah\nPeople find that stuff out so why lie about it also very incredible if a first\nThe rent is easy you are say I was in the twin towers makes a good start stop telling it if it's yeah yeah keep telling it and keep expanding I knew what I that's a yeah so ah look are\nYou seeing she baby ... baby telling the truth but she doesn't she has all this stuff working against her\nSo now or how does this but now this is help or does is hurt\nThe ladies who may actually how it hurts so that really hurts and here's the interesting question so I have no idea no idea whether or the other ladies ally and this lady seemed like she has don't know whether the other ladies are if they are what happens to them or they prosecuted\nWell there's no way that there's no way anybody is going to be able to prove whether something happen or not Seventeen years I mean when they were Seventeen years all thirty three years ago\nA lady just got a a year in prison at least a year in prison for false accusations about sexual misconduct and stuff ... yeah I forget where it was but I read about that God that was really interesting you know if you're making false accusations about that and you're ruining someone's life possibly yeah you know are ruining their career or whatever what happens to you you can't just go\n... going around making accusations that salads\nElena namely mentally okay he did say she was a hundred percent positive that it was cabin on no as she ends up being wrong about that yeah\nIt was an al ... some of the guys are saying no he wasn't even there we I was there I've done as I've gotten into he wasn't even one of the look they can be protecting their friend when I write but we know it goes on I ... my whole thing is I don't and I'm not even\nSaying why did you wait I understand why one way I certainly understand my Seventeen year old and wait and why they never say anything and\nHow it affects their lives but I I right now it doesn't seem like there was a big enough it\nIt seemed like at the time even if they went on to the police and I said this guy pick me up and carried me into the room I think he was going to sexually assault me I was worried though during his mother and\nHe did eat me didn't so what did your baby picture and carry other like it was nothing morning on bread do do that anymore right and and don't drink anymore because you know more and when you drink apologize\nTo the lady and that's it now you're bringing up thirty three years later we don't really know all the all the facts and\nWe all want to say half the woman was violated he should be in trouble in Germany but nobody really knows what happened and we can't prove or the other way and people are so quick to punish one side of the other automatically call one of them the bad guy and we don't really know what happened in ... and we're fighting about is whether one deserves\nThe benefit of the doubt and the other one does\nA ridiculous couple things is this lady the sweating to the lady said that she had such a good memory and then she went on to call him our cabin on [laughter] had died and she said that they were by the punch bowl and she's the ... the interviewer was like well did you see them spike in terms of you know but they were near it\nAnd they were near there in the hallway where a there was women and rooms having sex and stuff and\nThat's where the party is another one in ... and that's how it works she just seems like\nShe's crazy yeah yeah yeah yeah use my neck yeah yeah you look at her and you just go yeah yeah ah Long Island woman hears this story I was talking about the Long Island woman who falsely accused too Sacred Heart university football players of rape\nWas sentenced in Connecticut quarter Thursday\nOr Nikki you've you know pleaded guilty to making up all the allegations and was sentenced to three years in prison\nI have no idea and Florida I think it's ten dollars now it's like eight name find out\nWhat minimum wage is now and then you're going to tell me that uh this guy won eight twenty five okay eight twenty five an hour and he wants to almost double that and that's on enough\nFor you what do you think about all this study they did when they first started raising the minimum wage to Fifteen dollars in the cities and they found that it absolutely does nothing for the people that are making more money because now the employees have to cut their hours back\nBecause they don't have to do that I'm a zone doesn't have the Amazon the Hooters won't make any of those girls fulltime because when they have to pay the benefit right Amazon for like not only will give me benefits but we're going to double your pay because we're doing so well\nI don't know that if they're getting their you know hourly Employee Benefit that Amazon's I of course they are I mean I I don't know any bad right now I just feel like\nIf you are a full time employee you're getting benefits and now you're\nEight hour each time there's a lot of them that are not ...\nNot on Amazon's fall but those people that are in full time there are seasonal and part time they're also going to get Fifteen dollars an hour and\nDon't want to hold on let me look at ... ... no\nI don't know what you think there has to do with anything you you if you if you have to wear is worth a hundred million dollars should be able to pay you centerfold a percentage of his money like I don't know where it does McDonalds oh their their workers because the McDonald's family or whoever owns them out of the ray crock families originality ...\nIf you're going to be Amazon and you're going to pound your chest about raising minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour and ... the uh\nOh you're in sixty four you'll really enjoy I Believe in the national level of minimum wage of three hundred and fifty thousand plus employees also\nYou may want to listen to this the person being Amazon employees don't stop at collaborating with great people out of exciting innovative projects we also offer a full range of benefits to regular fulltime us employees that support employees in eligible family members including domestic partners and their children\nBenefits include medical a prescription drug dental and vision coverage\nFor all one case savings plan\nPaid time off in a ... holiday uh overtime pay resources to help improve overall wellbeing and discounts on Amazon purchases it so I stuck it\nNow I mean also have to understand that when somebody ... somebody is worth a hundred and sixty four
