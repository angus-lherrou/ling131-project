thing that everybody is watching and raving about was the Mr Rogers documentary and I also know that there's a movie being filmed with Tom Hanks where he plays Mr Rogers and they released pictures of him did you see that\nYes we laugh about it I like um yeah which is funny because a colon hangs play both writers on a Drunk History oh really yeah 'cause I as I was watching a documentary either I go I think on hangs would make a good young Fred Rogers yeah more so I watch the uh the show\nAnd I have to tell you it was the most boring guy damn thing I've ever run out and now I Want to go back to everybody you told me it was good and punched him in the face now there are a few different uh documentaries out there about Mr Rogers this is the\nWill to remind everyone that everybody's talking about the new one okay because\nThe viral video of him appealing to Congress to get twenty million dollars for a public television was pretty impressive it was it was it was almost like that was a movie because you have this real\nItalian you know tough guy Congress tomatoes sheep on the budget didn't want to give them the money\nEverybody was coming to the ... and he was getting away with them and Mr Rogers came in and he's like well I guess you just got your twenty million about\nLike you want them over and and the documentary alerted Mr Rogers is definitely a sweet guy\nAnd that he was genuine and he wasn't creepy and he wasn't gay and uh I never thought he was gay but he uh he did get questioned on that a lot and one of the guys on the show was gay and he said that the amount of time that I spent our Fred Rogers I never once or one assigned than he might be homosexual\nUh but you know that he was just a legit guy who had a genuine care for children in the upbringing of children and it was a nice story but it was one of the most boring guy damn documentaries I've ever watched\nIn my life quite possibly one of the greatest middle names of all time by the way I don't know his real name is Fred\nMick feely Rogers ... illegal Israeli that yeah isn't that interesting yeah yeah and and are you on TALK a little budget I mean have to have the staff of him and his wife and he did all the public voice is a writer and wrote a ton of songs and oh yeah yeah I was a\n... a pianist I like it was it was really I watched it and it was sweet for a couple of minutes and I thought Jesus Christ they're going to be some sort of conflict here in this thing I mean even his death was wasn't even that big of a deal oh you know um there wasn't any choke up moments it was just all\nAnd whether you like a huge advocate for like public television and stuff like that like he did a lot of\nCharity work he started he basically gave\nThem they were there was public television was established\nAnd they had a lab channels for learning and stuff and he started there he was going into the ministry and then he saw that the TV and he was like I think I'm gonna do that instead so he went and he worked on one of those uh those shows\nHe said but those solo budget and it was so bad that he knew he needed to come up with something else or go back to the ministry and then he invented by accident Mr Roger's neighborhood\nAnd you know and they showed they show things though that Facebook is already ruined like he ... he during a time where everybody was you know racism was really bad\nAnd they were ah they were kicking ... a black kids at a public pools and uh he would incorporate\nBlack folks into his show in in good positions or you know with good jobs and stuff and then he would subliminally\nShow you him like he shared a a he\nWas sitting in a little kid he pulled right and they invited a black gentleman to step in the beginning won't put his feet in there with him and and it was just him showing you that it was okay to be in the pool of black people out\nI bet you already saw that stuff on Facebook now when I watched a documentary I Know all these ... get with me to tell me about the one guy that uh it was getting a little to make really well I mean but how about that\nI should or other documentary you didn't even know my feeling was his middle name I did I Know I\nGot like hydrogen out after a while but I was a story of how he came up with the show at least interesting oh now that was my ...\nNow they have actually a book so he worked at this uh this station where they had a free movie used to show like they were but they weren't real real and he said the problem free movies is a role and sometimes the tape breaks so they run the movie the tape break so there's a they need a second to reset it\nSo he had this woman who was unsaid and she was just kind of blank face and he popped the hole with a little puppet through the thing it was like oh the saga that tell us public you know [laughter]\nYeah there's a right to have any backup movies that you like bought that you can watch\nWell yeah yeah yeah but I mean I I was also watching the ... you know I but I I thought I I you know let me give it a shot sometimes you know I I got this documentary one time a minimal Islam and the first ten minutes or do\nYou guys just try to do so they have to church that's how yeah but then I gave a time and I watched it was an excellent documentary um you know sometimes you just need to give things a little bit more time drama leaning his stand up comedy special like every ten minutes and then like a Calvin do we keep watching it and I thought it was for getting whole area so\nYou know I wrote it out until the last Fifteen minutes and I was like okay I've completely away so [laughter]\nI thought I'm this is forty 'cause that's like a it's a it's a good movie that you\nKnow ... one of the best movies of All right so you're not even forty yet\nI think that like when I was thinking that you can watch a hundred times and as soon as it comes on like you have to watch it and yeah so like I bought that and downloaded it on to all my life is there no matter where I Am just in case like I get stuck and I'm bored yeah I I can throw that out just\nHow I Am a given time agree I don't know anything funnier than Albert Brooks and who wants to play murder\n[laughter]\nUh uh you know ... or in off the comedy club the maples not really\nYeah ... that's how I don't think he's funny why am I\nDo I ...

week to vote on Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court appointments so the FBI can do another investigation or FBI investigations like this one order last week by president Donald Trump\nInto his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh are routinely limited in scope says former agent who worked with in the Tampa FBI field office this admitted ... this isn't a ministry of investigation not a criminal investigation that's according to Fred Humphries are retired earlier this year after Twenty one years\nOr that included several such investigations\nBecause no one has filed criminal charges against Kavanaugh\nThere will be no subpoenas for documents or other information and all witnesses must have agreed to speak voluntarily that's according to Humphries who has no direct knowledge about the case\nHe said it would be different if someone had brought charges men hide this week long investigation the seven into Kavanaugh was ordered by Trump after an emotional and heated Senate hearing in the allegations by research psychologist Christine ... board that Kevin I attempted rape her at a house party\nWhen they were teenagers in the Nineteen eighties I\nTell you I don't even want to talk about this any more because you can't\nGive your opinion to people without them immediately dismissing you as a terrible human being yeah and uh I you know there there are plenty of people that I Believe her\nAre okay but if you say I believe him all of a sudden you become a devil and and just because you believe in due process that doesn't necessarily mean you believe in him\nAnd it it doesn't mean you're supportive if you found out that he was in fact a violating her and if he did a ... you know if he did violate her physically but not sexually is that enough to make him not be a Supreme Court justice now is because there's thirty three years of good stuff in between\nI I don't even know what to do and the the problem is the more you talk about in the more you say more people started refining you like you've done something you're not allowed to have an opinion on this gas\nNow I Know I you're right that would that be your friend\nTo give the buck they finally played a defense it was good\nAnd you know they couldn't get a winning issue that because you figure how do we look I'm Drew Brees well that we didn't ... that was a high scoring game the first three or four

while it was being played out like yeah baseball and the tall thinning and everybody's going to\nHappen like can they hand over time\nThey have overtime but if they don't score and overtime win over time runs out then it's a tie what they should do overtime once over time runs out they start with the ... and they go from fifty yards and they keep on moving it back five yards until one Mrs ... easy enough yeah uh you know how it works at a ... over and it's all the pressure\nThat like the NHL how they do like a shootout or anything like a kickoff\nYeah college you have to go for two points after a certain point\nYou get both teams were touched down right then the next time it'll be scored a touchdown again you have to go for two and that usually you know breaks with the\nGame or you do like quarterback challenge and you have the tires\nYou know in hockey when they do like to shoot outs yeah something like that oh\nI'm thing ... ports because he was saying oh I said oh All right it's
