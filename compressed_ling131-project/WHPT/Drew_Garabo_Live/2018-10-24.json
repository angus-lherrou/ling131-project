appreciate you sharing that inside with me man and a and I truly truly do appreciate it and I urge you if you're in a pod cast and whatnot uh is Seth and John and I work on a podcast called to grab all uncensored 'cause I Love my name I guess\nAnd uh we uh we interviewed a veteran whoopee TST on our latest one and the dude or is using cannabis which could get kicked out of the VA program but he doesn't want to use the opioids that they prescribe do you guys and it's a damn shame\nThat this government that sends you off to die while protecting our nation can't offer you the compassionate care that could actually help you through the cannabis plant\nAnd uh and and that's it's disgusting in my opinion there is no reason a veteran should have to put his vi status at risk simply if he wants to use cannabis to fight off the demons of PATS day\nWhen we we know how where she got to take their medicine\nRight follow the follow the money sucks ah I like\nTalking to that guy bill it seems like a real nice guy and it kind of thinks he has to be as we dropped it last night to search through grab one censored once about five Seventy seven five seven nine one or two five and eight hundred seven seven what what did you find that blows my mind\nI Know I checked last night not a lot of people are listening from Spotify but hey we're we're there I thought that was the place\nTo be yeah I thought so too and and it populated a lot of other places too I was like checking out different podcast platforms last night on on the play store and Google and it was available on almost every single one I checked\nWe've done a handful of episodes probably about twenty or so Nineteen some of the Nineteen I check you know some of them are deeply personal like us that story with the baby and a and some of them talk about medical cannabis otherwise we met Mica and got her if you're curious about Mike on her story\nI was thinking that we should do more with John and really dig into the er the first time he was on the show and I know we we make fun of it from time to time but I don't think people really know the story and I don't know John's mindset and what he was thinking we didn't know him back and then we know now that end of the process of bringing him back on the show the second time\nSo I I think that would be fascinating 'cause we've got something with Dan yeah with my ... with the baby\nThat would be fun because I feel like I'm sort of shackled here on this radio program with me telling the details of what was really going on there\nYou are and we put the shackles on you but

it just seems like anybody who would appreciate that would already be would already would not be voting for guilt or I mean would not be voting for Gillum specifically\nI think you do that just to get the publicity I I I don't think you're trying to sway anyone's vote\nBut it just contributes just such a toxic state\nOf affairs when it comes to race and politics in this country it's disappointing it's disgusting\nIt's always our state though [laughter] this\nIs always Florida\nI don't no matter what happens this election are who are just going to be a recount they're going to be people suing it's going to be it's going to be madness again\nI don't believe any of the reports that say Gillum is leading in the polls\nI Will say I think it's important and I haven't heard reporting for duty so they say it has needs to come out and say I do not I cannot tolerate this at all like that that has to happen\nLet's see dissent this robocall deny er let's see here\nUh Andrew ... ... ... no not that I'm not I'm not seeing that it happened\nThe other than from him a however uh Andrew Gillum has said that uh\nThis is reprehensible there's a spokesperson reprehensible and could only have come from someone with intentions to fuel hatred and seek publicity a governor Rick Scott Republican said there is no room for any racial politics here in Florida non Florida is a melting pot\nOf people from all over the globe and we are proud of it no attempt to divide people by race or ethnicity will be tolerated from anyone this stops now a spokesman for dissent is\nA U.S congressman who's been criticized for his racially changed comment about Gillum a days after Tuesday's primary called the robocalls in ... oh I'm Sorry disgusting\nThis is absolutely appalling and disgusting but kind of funny oh no are and who and hopefully\nWhoever's behind this has to answer for this despicable action a spokesman for the dissenters campaign said so\nHe said this is coming from Iowa\nYeah I I guess there are a lot of ah a lot of racist groups up there in Iowa in Idaho\n... as Florida is a crucial crucial state and the next election from Idaho are focusing on this well\nWe don't I don't I don't think we have a national election just a couple of ah what senators I Believe and a governor some ... some amendments I Do not understand by the way do\nI go over the yard signs that say hey have a mammoth three don't do it did you read\nThree about the gambling you know\nWhat are they trying to do to us I mean I thought we would make it easier for casinos to open up in other places outside of uh having to have the uh you know indigenous rights to\nSee that's the thing is like you got the seminal tribe\nOn one side I think opposed to this amendment if I'm not mistaken because let's face it they have a stranglehold on gambling in the state of Florida not saying that's bad not saying that's good it's just a fact\nSo this law would loosen up a little bit and you start to see you know Billy
