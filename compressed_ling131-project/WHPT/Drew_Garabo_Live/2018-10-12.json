many\nBad yeah what do you think of oh no he's he's using a bit taken aback for a while John I haven't seen them not like anything ever either I've never seen it put food on his ... and have such a look of confusion in this day and the thing is\nI'm going to put all this on me okay 'cause I'm at a point in my life right now we're I'm off the rails I mean I I I went through I went through the McDonald's drive to the other day in order to Happy Meal like the meal in between my meal [laughter] give me an idea where my mom was the toys are actually got it in my car was bumble\nBee I'm actually illegal man like all the way to transform yeah yeah\nIn the car in Oregon I usually say because why why Happy Meal like why why not get your cheeseburger fries and not have to get the whole\nBecause it was a meal in between my knee like I knew I was going to eat in like an hour and I just was driving on oh let me preface that that's where I'm at right as a person yeah\nSo that said so that being said this is this is very tasty they've got a great sauce on there I Can't quite figure out what exactly it is maybe a garlic Mayo or it's just the consistency to me it's not it's not me right\nIn and actually the flavoring tastes kinda like a sausage Patty like almost like maybe they're staging there's okay All right but I I mean if I Am dental if I wasn't eating meat and I ate this

probably more profound one and I really thoroughly enjoyed it\nI got away as I got away without even touching I'm so for me or my wife and I don't want to touch anybody so\n[laughter] so okay buccaneers play the falcon ... we're too into the defense quarter Mike Smith who people are calling for his job he says this guy's not falling\nAtlanta has a high powered off that even though that Ryan seems to be allergic to throw it to Julio Jones most of the time and and the red zone yeah the red zone ... uh what what happens Sunday you called the bears dismantling the buccaneers I did what happens Sunday which buccaneers seemed to be the sub five hundred gene\nIs this your you can I tell you it feels like the bucks haven't played into minds right I ... it seems like it's a whole nother season\nI don't know I don't know how their defense gets that go to all of a sudden I think Atlanta like you said has a high powered off and I'm even more high powered off and then the buccaneers so I'm predicting this game to be a forty two thirty five shoot out uh\nI don't know what James is going to do but I'm going to ride is the ... games in Atlanta right yeah yeah I'm an I'd go probably the falcons making a making this one\nBecause it's a tough building to play in that Mercedes Benz or indoor stadium I I see James coming out and I'm not saying that because I Want it to happen I'm saying because I think it's going to happen is I think he crops the bed I I think that you want that to happen I Do I really do I I Want the buccaneers win but I Want Jim is across the bed and get that should have done\nThe question is is is deep down in my soul I won't root for that but that's what I Want and I I Wonder at that point if if he struggles are we done talking about Ryan Griffin oh\nWe're talking about this Patrick you're not going to have you ever go you're not talking about anybody other than James struggling Jamieson is not getting benched not\nThere's not a scenario no I'm not an issue now is definitely not in this game boy you heard there wasn't a scenario where Brian Fitzpatrick gets to play outside of those first three games and that happened so I just feel like maybe if it seems very fickle right not like anything can happen\nFluid it's not they wanted they wanted Patrick done they wanted James and there there was really no reason to put them in at half\nTime in that bears game nothing was going to change other than they want to see the sky to start getting comfortable with his team I there is unless it's an injury there's absolutely no way you see rapid Patrick again this year five touch this year of\nThere's an injury or there's some sort of massive massive blowout ... either way at the books are winning batter losing badly I think you see if it's Patrick but there is no hey James ... three intercepted you're coming out I don't see that\nOnly reason why I question isn't that weird article that came out saying after the Steelers game the cutter went to the team and said we were this close to putting in Ryan Griffin he's been looking so great in practice so if you get to appoint what if that scenario doesn't exist but he throws six interceptions\nThree and a half or whatever it or we've been talking about Ryan Griffin ever [laughter] I'm just I'm asking a question like just tell me what my Christmas present is already yeah no\nI'm just saying it would we go back to fitzpatrick because everybody everybody seems to be on the same page fitzpatrick is not the future of the team who have rang gripping sitting there right we're going to go to somebody or we've been seeing what do we have in this young kid rather than what do we have in his old man we kinda know what we have a subculture\nUnless the defense all of a sudden comes to play and the books have a number one number two defense and they're shutting teams out left and right and James still can't get it done and they go hey our defenses carrying the team James is holding us back\nThen maybe it's a rapid Patrick's situation but these are oh sorry extremes are talking about the deepest being going from worst to first of all of a sudden we're talking about the future quarterback or the bucks to start falling apart and then we're going to put in fits pattern I\nJust I don't I Want to happen for you I don't see\nThat well I mean he had he had a half last week and he in all those from way behind or two weeks ago and all that was from way behind through to picks so if he throws who picks and ... and a half and some more and another half than than what are we talking about if we're getting blown out\nWell I think the buccaneers have their investment and Jamieson I and I like that I think that they want to give him the chance to shine so I don't think he gets that this game I don't think he gets bench next him if he shows a pattern of sub standard games but we're still winning enough to have a sniff the playoffs then\nI think you take a look at who's the best bet to win US Games unless that happens I think we're stuck\nWith a ... it's not easy to bench like starting quarterback I mean look at Eli Manning I mean obviously he's won a couple of Super Bowl but it got put this guy on the bench and they just can't do it I\nGet that I really do get that but I also feel that this situation we are in is different because I feel that this entire city in the franchise is waiting for dream is to prove to us that he can actually be the quarter back in ... in that liberal we don't know\nIf that's the case from his play on the field to his actions off the field so how shorter leash is he on for the rest of the season this is this the last year his contract right yeah and now he's gotten that I picked up next year I write so I mean the decision has to be made\nWithin the next year if this is our guy if not we're looking at who else is on the team or scrapping it completely\nIt's a good point shots and I I don't know I just feels to me like although they're saying this is our guy I think it's a little more fluid than than than it seems okay\nI uh I think that they will put obviously the best quarterback in the position to win games and look we're five hundred right now we easily could be open for we easily could be three in one\nFeel like this is almost the start of a new seeds and okay you had you had the magic era you saw what happened what they played a couple of weeks ago they got completely dismantled the fans are calling for everybody everybody get fired now you're starting to get her Fifteen or going into a dimensional part if you can turn it all around James can shut the haters up all you need us when\nIt's unfamiliar territory and on the ground for me because I've never been above than through a bye week before I've always a fan of the team by the time the first five week um so I've sat through this by we going wow\nThis feels really weird I don't care about the patriots anymore I truly don't I'm not just saying that I I when they lose it doesn't affect me at all looser jak will lose the Tennessee lose whoever you I don't give a rat's fat as I Am an edit this season at least\nFor the buccaneers so here I Am going right through into brand new season it does feel like we haven't played since Doug Williams was a quarterback what the\nHell is going to happen in Atlanta and I don't think any of us knows Mike Smith the defensive coordinator says it does this guy's not by but what are you going to say if you're the defensive coordinator you know\nI don't know we'll see we'll see how Cornell's internal Dante David play I I'm I'm interested to see how they come out because either they're not as bad as they were against the bears or they are and we're going to get a taste for it on Sunday\nJohn setting who wins [noise]\nIn my in my heart I just have this overwhelming feeling that James Winston is going to put on a clinic and put up a bunch of points and come Monday morning by her time will be on his nuts as hard as ever that that's what I mean do you have to wait I mean you'd have to you'd have to put up the number is ... yeah I think the bucks when and I think James political bunch of numbers I think the ... states sub par\nBut Jamieson is able to uh you know over power and it's a shootout and and the bus when something like a you know forty eight forty two or something but\nGoodness gracious had number micro Santa ... what's your gut telling you about this Sunday ... and ... falcons Tampa Bay but really dig in and all of your analysis that we that we that we rely on your ... All right Dr phil a shame it gets in the game oh All right I like it so far I mean I don't like it but it's going to [laughter]\nAnd that he's in the game and without knowing that there isn't there\nIsn't there he's in there right and then he finally realizes he's he's ready to be a leader and so the corals on campus have though you know he's not eating any W alright against find you know your your keyboard\n[noise] how did they have said when you don't get back say [laughter]\nIt's hard to recover from open heart surgery without [laughter]\nIt's hard to get well when you sleep on the street\nIt's hard to take care of a baby with untreated depression\nHealth goes beyond hospital\nAt Providence St Joseph how we believe health is a human rights I see what we're doing to advocate for the vulnerable and invest in hell for all future dot P.

[laughter]\nIt it it sounds like someone might it would be rapping about talking about current events if I Would have started and less yeah I Would have won\nKiki he keeps you taste they'll produce the touchdown and yard ... even though the guy in front of them on the debt to chart will fuller was in the game so I Would say a who Texans got this week\nYeah John Texans I Believe or at home I think they're a night of dirt ears were drew calls me the gambling degenerate not that I'm sure [laughter] believes the Texans are nine and a half point favorite at home against whomever their opponent is\nA buffalo one well there you go uh yeah I I Would say a key key to take a might be a very nice ... over flex play Freeman\nRoyce Freeman ... Freeman who may not play against the buck oh means having colon plays and then a sneaky de fs bargain players Ito Smith Ito Smith Ito Smith\nIs ... ... the best time at football fourth round draft pick this year the taxes that take his name from the early ...\n... oh bad not young young young young how young ho ... young oh cool yeah that's what it was a that you get to\nThe city so I thought you got to drop one of these for the weekend you up to that you can play one you can drop it afflicts does as you have to drop or your bank ... ... as a ... one of the aren't\nMr Lindsay from Denver the running back who's a who's a ... ram Japanese get more touches enough free Ramsey seven point choice a constant from Washington a little digging up right now are you in the PR non PPO this would be a PR league okay that's a big factor with Tom\n... Iraq and uh and or buck Alan from the Baltimore Ravens\nA which one do you leave out\nLindsay's the better back\nThompson is the better play NPR leagues because the trend now isn't Barclay part of this trend\nAh especially at the flexed position if you're playing a running back there you want to get all these passing yards that are out there nobody's playing Christian McCaffrey irrelevant commemorative flex their playing them starting running backs right are the ones are be to say\nBut you want to get some of those passing yards so I think you can make a case for Thompson what Washington or home against Carolina yep that's right here a lotta may or may not be a one point favorite [laughter]\nAnd not in the desert Lindsey might get game flowed um fantasy term football term out because they're playing the rams yep\nI'm Lindsay is a very he's the best running back\nBut he doesn't he's like what five eight right he went on draft and yeah I'm drafted 'cause it was so small Colorado or but he's basically taking a lot of the reps that like John sending thought Royce Freeman would be getting are going to is Philip Lindsey I Believe is gray and\nUm so I I Would say in that case or it it might be Thompson a Allen might get a goal line\nLook right that's called touchdown dependent yes it is um I I Would say Tom Sawyer and especially with Peterson banged up\nThank you very much right by the way I Know he's taught right so that's the best play and then you choose on the other to\nBuy fair enough he's right he's taught right and he he got great to see was a weekend we'll return with Marjorie bravo live we're out of the Walmart parking lot collecting non perishable items and supplies out the the victims of hurricane Michael and we'll be right back [noise]\n\nI Know

you my son\n... flirt with missing the school bus every day it's the best way to do it every single day he gets he wakes up at six forty he's in the shower at six fifty he's out of the shower at seven twenty\nWhoa I kid you not and and he gets dress and the bus comes at seven thirty he's out the door at seven thirty every day and barely catch the bus and I said you keep playing with fire you're going to get burned and if you get burnt your dad's not drive a new school you're going to walk\nHe knows I don't mean you're not going to settle a civil four miles away and it's an awful rose getting killed on\nBut that's what I tell them every day so today I did my thing of these in the Chicago Seven Fifteen still in the shower seven twenty gets out of the shower seven twenty five but okay seven thirty bud okay I go to take the trash out to look up there's this bus with the bus stop\nI go run back in the house you're buses that the bus stop throws on his white van dam Daniel any any runs\nFive minutes later knock on the door dad I missed the bus oh so instead of my customary seven thirty say goodbye to my son nap until nine Fifteen nine thirty get my days straight I got to get in my car and go sit through the car drop off\nForty eight minutes oh door back to my front door because of the traffic so I I couldn't stop again\nThis year we seem to have here is is that uh normally long shower right from talking about a thirty five minute shower is that where we are\nEvery day John every day my water bill is on but I don't want to know that you know what's going on in there I I don't want to either so I don't think we should put you know that's also not a good I mean when you're young I guess it doesn't matter but I ...\nIn the morning it's it's it's dreams or essence maybe tell him to switch to the night I I don't think I don't think it's an either or situation at that age ... and ... and and I don't feel comfortable having that conversation what do we know it's not a just a just a straight shower he\nSaid that he's he's his his girlfriend got um some face scrub uh and so he's been using that\nAnd then I just foolish and very key to to to get skin I respect\nThem it's an expensive process so I I I just I couldn't get that stuck in a cup of coffee and me before the show today and I'm really I Am in need of ones if anybody's coming out here and they want to stop by I Would even accept an ice black coffee today [noise] hot black coffee be fine as long as reflected\nOff I think next time the intermissions the bus I think that it's not you taking the schools that you put them in in over in the driver has a less than two stars I think that's just punishment and acts\nLike a like a dangerous driver like you might not know who is not going to like that like you might not make it back kind of Hoover drive\nI got a stack or to pocket if you want to thank you for you really know what are those are illegal when they came out I remember we used to take those

like\nYour take one of these is a pretty worked out All right I must be a legit [laughter]\nOut of everything I put in my body over the years that is my biggest regret it and that's when I started working with Fisher Napoleon and they were on those and I didn't know I thought that's what you had to do to do morning radio and it was\nI Would draw would take one in in between we're playing since I was running up and down the hall and I would want to go work out my insides felt so dirty I didn't realize how most I probably was having a heart attack I got a high at heart problems in my family is that we all are anti cocaine\nOn the show about how we'll never done it a little guy I Know we were all snorting Saturday\n[laughter] years ago and truckers used to get over the counter white crosses which was basically superpower do do do does yeah yeah\nYeah ... white crosses and and that's what they would use to stay awake further fourteen hour a driving ship 'em before the show John setting told you might go to the U.S lipstick on your teeth yeah and that that triggered something for ...\nBack in the day before Spencer Gifts was what it is now which is like you can get cool T shirts and and stuff like that so that there was this kind of ... like you used to be able to get\nSome some it's still very ... what's the last time you really are very naughty last week I mean there's a full sex toy section\nRight but they used to have these so stupid key chains and cards with obscene sayings on them and well vulgar not obscene\nBecause I I had a key chain when I was in eighth grade that says I'm looking to get some lipstick on my depth stick in eighth\nGrade I did not know what that meant oh yeah yo argument in eighth grade I had not experienced that yet\nWhat did you think like what did you think it came out of the world would stick knowledge I\nI I I had a good idea what it meant but I didn't quite know what that meant but I had the key chain\nAnd then I'm sure no one listening remembers is\nThey also had business cards that had obscene sayings on them like not not just your FBI female body inspector but like a ... you would just some of the card that said uh\nIs that your face or did your ducked throw up or or if I wanted to hear from a whole I would've forwarded oh and they were just little business cards on the I had about a hundred of them in my bell crow uh regrow wallet\nShe named mile an eighth grade I had to keep my backpack and said how do you make a tissue dance\nYou put a little book in it and say I live in both of those worlds my [laughter] so I [laughter] when he said that about your lipstick it just reminded me of that key chain and ah I ventured there is a boat listener somewhere with a key chain that still says I'm looking to get some lipstick on buddy and I will say\nI can count on probably less than one hand how many women I Would tell that to when I say none of the times I Would just be like a\nYeah you got to figure out in your mid ... yeah exactly yeah I think I when I was when I was single I went out with a girl and she had lipstick underneath the whole time and I didn't tell her I mean\nYeah I I did see I Want to embarrass or but then afterwards he gets back because why don't you tell me I Would say I mean\nThat's a real fine line to walk if I told the the other night after she was already in bed clearly didn't brush I said hey you got them in in your team and she got mad at me and I was like hey listen if you want to go to bed like that that's\nFine but if you want me to stay in this room and still love you ask your husband your guts the brush them shoppers because I paid for for those chick flicks teen hundred per want a nice clean\nI mean if you paid for and you know here is the right to\nTell those into your right before we got married and I was like this ... this is an investment right here and it's paying off so far\nAs he has his tank right how are you already be like hey you know trying to brush 'em I\nAnd metal fly like a tornado than it was over\nMy head survive I was lucky but so many of our clients or not this one\nCar accidents destroy lives in families can seconds lifelong injuries and lost earnings below also do things we once loved paralysis and even as I sat there thinking of what could have been I thought of all my clients all these years who weren't so
