progressive insurance studios visit progressive dot com or call one eight hundred or grocery today\nWell like in a lot has happened during the week I'm Ari Cooper was traded away by the raiders of the Dallas Cowboys for a number one draft choice you know and I fortunately Mars John Lynch the great running back has gone to injured reserve and we may or may not see him\nCome the month of December so where are the ...\nIt has turned lucky for running backs and wide receivers today against the goals\nWell ever since John Gotti came in one of the first edition is the editor of the team was Doug Martin a running back from Tampa Bay form of at the buccaneers\nHe's going to have to pick things up in your own after running back by committee so we're going to continue to CJ them shark and duck and and and we're gonna see Doc Martin but more for that we're finally get the artery Washington back to the phones to help alleviate some of that running back by committee\nFor receiver grew bread is going to come down to my friend\nWe saw in London that he took over the responsibilities when mark Cooper went out of the game with a concussion and so he's going to have to take a ... game up the ... a more viable part of this ... and of course you got to get more out of jail joining Nelson\nThe great relationship is one thing that the writers can count on is that the relationship of chemistry between their car tight end Jared Jared Cook I think that's going to have to come and big especially against us any type of saying\nOkay another change during the by which a force kicker\nAnd he'll be active today is Daniel Carlson\nWas drafted in the fifth round by the Minnesota Vikings at a nightmare of a game and the Vikings turn him loose and he was picked up by the raiders he's a rookie out of Auburn he's tall for a field goal specialist egos six five so we'll see him today and I want ... only like\nA ... is still out he has a scratch today unable to go and the writers really miss him\nIn the middle of that offensive line yeah it's already tough enough when you have to start a rookie left tackle by the way our brand of Parker's plan right Sacco another rookie so again just like the London experiment\nWhere experience where we have three first year players that off that's why that's very critical ... when it has to be especially creative replay calling more poorly that's why that run game is so important and it's got to be their cars best friends today\nOkay from left to right the rookie ... Miller at tackled John Feliciano again it left guard and the great veteran Rodney Hudson will lead the way at center gave Jackson is the right guard and the other rookie Brandon Parker will open up at right tackle over on the defensive side\nOr let's go to a couple of scratches in that secondary rushed Sean Melvin and Reggie Nelson are both out\nWhat that means is that Karl Joseph\nLincoln is healthy we will see a lot of him at safety today and of course Darryl Worley and Gary on calmly will be on the corners but Carl Joseph this will give the team an opportunity to take a long look at one time first round draft choice\nWell what's a credibly important especially against us Indianapolis called team brand has the Carl has to be able to Rome from ... from the middle centerfield sideline to sideline because the coach do a good job at stretching the field especially it's either and so your car Joseph is definitely known for his hitting but more for they said that he's going to have to be able to be in the right place at the right time\nAre well I have more of today's coverage coming up and when we come back Kim Kate's joins us from our progressive insurance studios you're listening

rising inflation drops in the dollars ... some experts say another crashes coming you can fight this note with stocks or bonds but with gold and silver coins and an IRA from Augusta precious metals\nReally pleased with the way the defense of Vince frosty Rutgers at all brown and our last play up and playing the contained they're not letting the ball cut outside you know the ... the burn all season by that jet sweep around the perimeter of stretching the perimeter for the defense of as are doing a really good job of contending\nThat right now second to an antenna and Mac returns as a running back leaves the middle linebacker for the raiders [noise]\nNear midfield play acting by luck wants to talk back to the lab and he does beautifully hitting jak doing all it was off the endangered list and that's another first out it's going to be very close let's see what they spotted their underwriters territory around that forty three yard line\n\nYeah that's what the that's what the rent is going to do is set up for it looks like it's it looks like a shorter they're going to measure whether this is either going to be\nThe third and short or a first down they all spot the ball and it looks like a short by a by the yard\nI Know definitely on that last play action Andrew Luck was looking at the Y. he'll ... the raiders safety is it a good job and not let him get behind them he just decided to check down to his hide in and pick up some yours that are close to the first time\nSo here come the chains from across the field on the far side that's where the colds and their road whites trend with blue their station right in front of us silver black ... black jerseys the the raiders\nAnd just short of the birds down and of course if you're a quarterback like Andrew Luck you'll take that down and inches that gives you some options and the writers have\nTo be aware of those run and pass their underwriter territory hair balls going to be spotted right around the forty three on line and the raiders\nAnd if you're the defense you got to be aware of that year they're going to go forward even if it happens to be worked out unless they have is a tremendous loss on they're going to probably go for it so you have to not let your guard down Balkan out there can't afford to have a safety creep up\nAnd then tried to grow something over the top and take a shot because officer known to do that especially the farther afield Marlon Mac and as a running back and there's third in short one wants to go up underneath center [noise]\nHe's got it [noise] and a toss played them\nAt home unless I got the first down die is across the border yard on the thirty nine and yard died and the cold to keep this drive or it has not been a spectacular Dr Larkin but it's been very methodical\nYeah they've been picking their points uh you know left and right they've been trying to stretch the perimeter or the raiders defense in that time the raiders did even though they stopped me in the first time they did a good job of preventing from a huge gang because I really thought at the beginning of that play they were out point\nThe where do you why Hilton Wilkins those checked in the other rookie running back he's out on the field luck comes up underneath center and the writer territory after receiving the opening kickoff no scorer like going beautiful day in Oakland and here comes the rocky running back robots\nFive yards on that play Wilkins is out of the whole mess\nAnd that's a good old fashioned downhill run a forty six power where they pull the backside guard to become to leave locked up in up inside the hope that time the cold solvency wind did a great job at opening and given the ... hour walk or a couple of yours is the first five I think it was picked up five\nJust shy of the thirty five yard line now back in the gun luck has been showing both under center and back into the gun\nHe has for receivers three to the right side on this formation second down and they all run huge home for a first down to the twenty six yard line they are right or is expected to pass in Jordan welcome to talk for ten yards and hounded into a huge hole\nWell that's what happens when you have a savvy quarterback like Andrew Luck the raiders actually brought a blitz a but then you know they sort of be the muscles are the shotgun version of the draw up you will called the writer sleeping and then as you mentioned a huge hole in the middle of the defense a woman's able to run up and get the first ... hours after the Joe Wilkins\nTwo vying plays out of the rookies were moments he goes back to the sideline for head coach Frank writes Marlon Mack the hammer checks back in its first and ten or at the raiders twenty six yard line and play action Mac luck looking deep\nFires the touchdown\nSay what a tremendous catch by mole alley talks a first year tied in out of VCU I may vote he went up was one big all grabbed the ball and slipped down into the end zone just writes first\nA wonderful right handed one handed catch by the young man and the coal stung\nThe writers on the opening drive and here's Adam sanitary trotting out of the
