I I was wondering if there was some ... that was supposed to take\nNow it sounds just like it was loud busy body to\nOh I mean she was making me part of the conversation anyway I was a ... and Mike is looking at me like if she had an ice pick she would have put it in this lady's me\nMaybe you're just in the uh you know radio heavy hitters section I mean I Know there was a lifetime a gal posting he

wouldn't have anything there\nNo no no I don't ever I don't ever insert myself into someone else's conversation so loud dude that's the problem is that she was loud I don't think she was trying to get your attention I think it was just a coincidence she was talking about radio ...\nThere is no polite way to shutter someone right like ... or can you even in this in today's society with our lack of decorum can you turn around and go skiing around\nYou seem to be talking about something very loud and I find your subject matter quite inane could you please either change the subject or top

I was I wanted to say Billie philosophy but that's who married Mary Mary Kay let's turn to\nA contained wasn't a a sports guy yeah\nGive me a second I Can't why can't I think of a stupid new journey do name are you starting to suffer these not\nI Wish I was his name is taping me\nDon't tell me please I'm and I'm not going to look it up I'm going to get this one I'm from the ...\nAre now I'm ... are now\nI don't need to call me I got there are no\nOf those a record club twelve compact disc circus that's for a penny thing that just went rogue\nWhy is the person mailing a journey cassette to another person\nMaybe somebody got a divorce okay forty years ago when there are finally going through all their stuff having a yard sale and they found hey here's your all tapes down in my life\nIt we don't know what this journey ... is this could be some sort of strange you know random bootleg that if you know very coveted I mean this doesn't mean it's one of their heads\nSo you're saying this might be like twenty Eleven's eclipse\nDave's not here man a line so I Know you're not tell you where are you young lady\nI'm Kelly Hi Jody how you doing darling okay how are you good thank you what can we do for you\nSo I was just gonna say journey came back for me when I watch the movie monster about Eileen or\n... or ... yeah you know I there was a great movie ah I I've never seen it yeah\nUh I still can't look at least around the same as she did such a great job as that serial killer and prostitutes that I've not looked at her the same a sense I'm sure she doesn't mind she's she's my favorite African American actress um what but uh but yeah but the song\nFrom the Sopranos really re launch that journey has always been a popular band don't get me wrong but the Sopranos really put them right back there uh into the forefront in my opinion\nA great thank you darling I appreciate the call and I have a great day Jody Seventy seven five seven I Want it to five I'm just hoping no one tries to a jumping on could respond to gotta live below\nZero I'm not looking at some of this already sir hello sir true sir\n... about a collar or is this true the Rob I live\nA scholar could you please get on with your point so I don't have to hang up on you\n\nSir did\nHe hang up on us hello true\nIs he doing your bidding on you're going to figure that out I think you can hear of yeah I think he's had\n... I think I can hear you I Want um I'm calling about the journey song before that short playing are you on that way yeah\nAnd I wanted to let you know that's singer and that was in one before that you're waiting for a very to come in what strike Raleigh it came from a well Santana span is the one that same black magic woman yeah\nYeah that strike Riley him and Neal Sean we're both in Santana banned in less than an end to form journey and they had probably one or two records before the air even came in in the band they are actually a band to force a hairy but\nNow Greg Raleigh was British you know and as\nAn aid he wrote songs and get the ball goes and it actually much better than Jonathan Ames version that wind up was much better than a job in a in a line up there are a little more rock and they weren't so love song ...\nWell you you sound like a ... quite a journey historians ... thank you\nYeah oh and also I'm the one that called once before I told you I see another base if they can get booed off stage at a concert yeah yeah I remember that I Do that yeah yeah so anyway that's that's all I had to study and I\nAppreciate that very much he really wasn't doing a bit on us I thought he was driven out alive all oh\nHey I think and I hate to admit that you're gonna watch the show but I'm thinking that the show believe they did a mash up or like a ... version of don't stop believing that God created a healer that might have actually Roger any more to the forefront than the ...\nUh no way do a very friendly and ... value was way before ugly just so you know that song resuscitated don't stop believing that it ... it would not leaders not have the power to bring that song back from the dead\nThat song was already resuscitated by the Sopranos and then we doing it sure that brought it to the younger crowd I suppose but that's that song owes it to the Sopranos to be or the I mean I guess\nYou could say it was it was maybe like a wave that they just carry on with glee but if you look how many people watch Sopranos and you actually old how many people might be able to name the last song of the Sopranos Arlington like how it actually ended versus how many people actually watch leave when he was on oh it could be tough [noise]\nAll right thank you Seventy seven five seven nine what did you find glee a network show and ah had Sopranos a a\nCable say Dahlia but they did have a Q and a in two thousand Thirteen and they said that they were an extremely dark time when the Sopranos came out but they do credit the Sopranos and bleed for for pan of putting them back in front of people\nSopranos and good yes oh but I guess the ... I think the Sopranos came before ugly well they're saying oh years before they were in a very dark time so the Sopranos save their lives so if not for Sopranos than you might not have a a might not have a ...\nYeah ... they said David Chase had called us we knew a year in advance of that song was going to close the show oh wow that period of time before the dark one for Neal the guys and I didn't have a singer in these coincidences just started to appear\nOh well I'm Glad that worked out for them to travel I'd go ahead real quick\n[laughter] well it's I guess hey dude\nYeah so I ended up getting a lion believe\nOkay what happened\nWas horrible they didn't know what it was for a while and I was getting treated here and ah they ended up ah cutting it up and then finally get to the doctor started screaming oh my God oh my God that's\nSo they pulled him out get out of you\nThey pulled them out to get out of me I got to take it home and I kept it for a couple of months so called friends\nOr you name it [laughter] no I didn't but I Wish I Would know where the league was an idea how big was your ...\nAh probably about the size of a nickel it's it's a pretty good sized maggots on one of the five cent maggots [laughter] All right thank you man I appreciate that very much I'm not comfortable saying that word anymore sounds too bad\n...

up it's got to be funny right you know [laughter] what did you just say [laughter]\nSeventy seven five seven I Want it to five there is a dad locally who had one of those cool kids parties and the kids all drank and then the cops came and he got arrested because he wouldn't let the kids open the door or escape\nI Know you brought it up at the end of the show yesterday but I feel like there's a lot of layers to the story so you have a party were letting underage kids drink and then you don't let them leave and then the kids are fearing for their lives and started contacting their parents\nYeah you know that is that was the whole thing that's exactly what happened yeah well I mean if you're letting them drink right you can't\nBe letting them leave because I realized there's a middle ground between keeping kids safe and holding them against their will write like if you're allowing them to drink you can allow them to leave especially not drive\nRight but when the cop show up to make them all go in the back of the house in a closet and not make any noise I don't think you're doing yourself any\nFavors standard house party protocol I\nI had a nickle for every time I'd been hiding in a closet\nIn a house party yeah cops here at dead everybody knows the rules [laughter]\nHis dad's an idiot okay but this is happening oh\nThere are people risk listening right now who secretly they'll probably won't say up front publicly sequel they are going yeah I I'd have my teenage a friend or no way to make it even want to drink alcohol and no way if he did what I let him sip it\nI Know we hear from the parents all the time had my kids going to try wait for the first time I wanted to be with me so he knows what he's getting or if they're going to drink I wanted to be with me but we're talking about all the all the other neighborhood kids drinking with you yeah\nIs that any do you think parents if they go All right hey listen I'm going to have the kids overall gonna drink I just want the I once you get to know what's gonna happen because how could you send a sixteen year old home and the parents and not know that the kid's been drinking correct I wouldn't know that my son had been drinking smoking anything\nWhat are you hoping to gain at that point is that always is ... is it always a parent who wants to be cool yes or is it is there something else just a parent wants to be cool I just feel like this data\nWas thirty six and the kids were sixteen so I feel like you're still kinda young enough to feel like you can relate to the kid yet\nAnd maybe he saw a couple of prospects among the young ladies if you know what I Do I'm not I'm not saying I'm just saying\nWhat if he wasn't a pervert what just why do we just say I love my daughter I Want to be cool I Want you guys to drink do it here with me\nI don't know dude I it's so hard for me to relate to that\n'cause like my my son's girlfriend's parents and I we text and it's always hey thank you so much for driving all uh you know if you need me I'm Free Saturday oh yeah the kids had a blast of the restaurant well it's never like it would never had a million years be cutting your son get drunk at our

ah took place in Pittsburgh this past weekend a lot of the doctors and nurses who treated the shooter who attacked the synagogue happened to be Jewish so is the president of the hospital Dr Jeff calling\nHe is also a member of the synagogue the tree of life I Believe that was attacked\nI Would like for you to listen to this audio clip and ask yourself if you are capable of this type of compassion I don't know that we are I I don't know that most people are I don't know that I Am\nI Would be so I\nMy mind doesn't even work like this this is a guy who attended that synagogue who saw his friends neighbors\nA Ninety seven year old Holocaust survivor gunned down and killed in front of him because of the hatred of the man who shot up the the synagogue the man who this guy was responsible for nursing back to health take a listen\nI went up to me too [noise] but I was just curious as to\nFair quite honestly just forgot [noise]\nHuge [noise]\nPeople ... evil he's this [noise] some other show [noise] and how does he cared for [noise]\nThat to where he is today [noise] that's sort of deal or state we have to wrestle with as a society where you were sort of [noise]\nThey made it a little bit over ... favorite dish is [noise] you know he was really interesting the good great care here\nFor many people that tend to be more Jewish [laughter] they're heroes for a very big Detroit the cops because as you off when they come from to the problem when they were foods record but we are very proud of it [noise]\n[noise] I'm blown away man I [noise]\nYou know those of us who were only connected to this story because we're all Americans or because we have Jewish ancestry are disgusted distraught mad at the monster who could perpetrate something like this but the guy who's staff\nWas tasked with nursing this guy back to health said he's some mothers son\nBut when somebody comes into the hospital to eat have to treat them don't you\nYou sign Hippocratic Oath and that's the very definition of it you are there to render aid whenever possible you don't get to be morally selective\nNow I wouldn't have thought that the guy if he had said yeah legally and and that was bound by my job to take care of this person but I think we all know I Would have rather he died or ride rather caught him with my scalpel a million times and is growing was he shot a\nI don't know is yeah ... yeah okay with multiple times by the cops right right\nYeah I don't think it would be wrong if the guy said if we're having a completely different interview the guy says I couldn't bring myself to help them like I don't think that's wrong\nMe either I I Can't fault anybody for having a reaction to this that is negative I Can't I Can't second guess you\nAnd for a guy to be able to show that kind of a compassion towards a human being who a lot of us myself included\nThink is barely humid if you could get yourself riled up to the point where you first tweet I'm going in you don't have anybody in your life to stop you and go hey uh no this is a bad idea and then he doesn't\nThink a lot of these Mad Men who Robin and started shooting up places they either kill themselves or their murder they don't know they're not normally shot and the nurse back to health right or at least I haven't heard of one in a while\nThat's correct Seventy seven five seven nine one or two five and eight hundred seven seven one one oh two five what's up Tom\nA little man or a show next album that doctor and allow it does how do you did I Know he took an oath but still that that is simply amazing that is\nThat is the type of person who is supposed to be a doctor I think the people who can say that so many years of medical school spent so much money and and you so much of their brilliant brain choose to render aid to people there are other different mentality than you and me you know what I mean we're sort of like this are like well\nWouldn't be so bad if somebody pinch this guy's oxygen line or at least made his life miserable while he was in the hospital but this Dr ... the guy who was the the head of the hospital\nOr can have so much compassion to say he's just the guy he's a mother son\n... son I Know that's amazing it's amazing it's that worry more doctors like that\nThough there are I guarantee you there are the most doctors I think most doctors are probably like that they just don't get the opportunity to speak about it a lot because thank God there aren't a lot of people out there are going into places of worship and shooting up the place\nLike off yet thank God so much so that gives you guys are great nightmarish it that\nI mean he might have been courting the guys he was putting them back together but still I\nI don't even think he was Dr Collins said my job is to judge him my job is to take care of him\nSeventy seven five seven nine one or two five and eight hundred seven seven one or two five the interview struck a chord with a lot of people on Twitter\nAs Dr Cohen show compassion and highlighting the shooters humanity in what is being called the worst anti Semitic attack in us history\nAri Fleischer said out of depravity comes humanity as evil as some people can be there are more good people who do the right thing no matter the circumstance as sickening of the attack was our nation is great compassionate and tolerant people like Dr Cohen are proof\nJust a good man\n... you you if you were a doctor you would have refused well I think once you get to the point where your doctor you can't refuse but you would have had a
