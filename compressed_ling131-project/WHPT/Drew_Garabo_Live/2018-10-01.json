I I just watched that going man what are we uh what do we how do I how do I approach the rest of the season Raleigh chew and chew\nWell you would think you know we forget since they're cut her got another chance a lot of people I Would say most people were expecting slash hoping for dirt cutter to lose his job at the end of last season and and I think it it was well known going into these on a short leash show if you if you put together a loss like that and maybe one more\nI think we need to start having serious conversation about whether or not this guy deserved to be the head coach right now\nSo is is that the fan reaction then today is calling for someone like your ... it to be a fan you got to go ...\nI don't think you have to I just think that when you get beat that bad when you're supposed to be on the upswing\nYou have to look at the coaches I mean you know that everybody you know there is talent on that field and when you when you look at the off chance you know in the struggles they went through early in the game they got the ball\n... many times when they could do nothing so I mean we could put it on the defense all day but fitzpatrick James had a little bit of success it's not like the ... was was that great were down and put it all on the defense even though it was terrible\nAnd all around atrocious and embarrassing performance but like Kyle W. O. T. B. said on Twitter We're used to this by now you stick around because it's so amazing when they do well kind of like the browns I guess right except the browns don't really have the expectations that the bucks there this year and we started chewing up so you lost two\nI think a lot of had to do with it being the first two games a year 'cause I Know I said earlier if you would have taken those first two games and they would have been the tenth or eleven game and maybe the bucks or five hundred a little better a little worse I don't think it's as big of a story because it started off to see them like that that's all we knew was fits magic\nForeigners are passing games for touched down the boxer to know this is the greatest thing ever I think that would be lost if we were later in the

... ... total nightmare one thing our team with others always that's just like you said that he says well it's a fairly good teachers and held off this is where that you get when you don't have the east as war\nLabor right on that and ... a year later and the general manager lie in a much more to do with your it that's when the players OJ list so what does a little bit of that is what I say All right well thank you\nSo so then as a newbie bucks fan look I should've okay take it easy sorry I had a question for you\nA lot of people don't blame the GM but the gym and he he picks the players\nAnd whoever pick those players on defense they should probably have a conversation with that guy today I don't like calling for people's jobs because even football coaches they've got families to feed their families live right here\n[laughter] yeah so the you know you don't have ... wife listening right now are tied lights kids are out of school and their lives then Jason so oh

know that\nThe NBA over here but I think coach cliff has a lot to teach us about tenacity so\nWe'll talk to him on Wednesday will also be joined by the Tampa Bay lightning and thunder bug as they

immediately\nSeventy seven five seven nine to five and eight hundred seven seven one one or two five or feel though bragging another to a machine I blame the GM all the time or Scott you've been above trend your entire life how old are you\nI'm I'm forty two drew I was born in life move Seventy six oh buffalo avenue and love the show that I'd love to ever since I tore down the naval training center in Orlando ... thanks man and a the bucks in the beginning\nThey they sucked let's just say that they were on every show I ever watched with Dick Clark an epic man rolling the wrong way with a foot\nOr the show he means bloopers and practical jokes what a television program that was and yeah they went oh insect theme their first year in the lead in their second here\nYes they ask Kais what he thought to the office and he just said offensive so my whole life\nI've been waiting until two thousand nature and the joy I felt when they got that trophy which also other teams have not even got there and I just have to be happy for any success they have whatsoever even if it's miniscule or fleeting because it's a bus life man\nAll right so how do you feel after after getting its Ronald yesterday by a by Chicago do you do is a bum you out at all or do you just go now that's easy today\nUm I just go hey go to the game drink beers talk with the Tampa Bay fans because there's a lot more terrible towels at the stadium than there was bucks fan\nI don't think that maybe that's why the bus continue to pump out mediocrity because the fans except that\nYeah that that's the thing is um I\nDon't know that you have to accept mediocrity as a as a fan like a real holiday who have gotten into it with about a James lately but I still consider a good dude Mike Smith should be fired after yesterday's debacle his defense has been abysmal for their cutters entire run at least the officers shown improvement the defenses regrets regrets in all facets\nAspect fire Mike Smith has stock and barrel say\nWell what's the answer that because we're kind of ... I don't know if we are but we're talking about people who are calling for other jobs today so if if you're not going to accept mediocrity what is your action today because it seems like\nWhy why aren't the players to blame I mean they showed some cells from the game is saying there are guys that were completely out of position now is that on the guys are out on the coach we don't really know\nBut then who do we as fans is what do we do we just point the finger because somebody made that decision about those players do we do we go for the GM do we go for the coaches because there is not going to be if we get behind have fire whoever the hell player ... ... whatever oh that's not going to happen you're never gonna fire a player because the the fan base thinks they suck\nI just don't understand how professional football teams can get so shook the the whole game gets thrown\nYou that there was that was never a football game yesterday right like a ... I mean you knew your embarrassment I'm sure you're delighting\nSubculture no no I'm not a but uh but\nBut from the outset ... it wasn't even a game we we were out of it from the first trial are they prepared to play\nLook when people say things like they didn't show up to play I don't get that because you're only job is to play football and I think all those guys are ready to run through the wall for their coach but\nIt was in and inspired performance by a team that did not look ready to play is because of a short week I don't know\nI don't I don't know either but the bears had a game plan your city threw the ball a lot they didn't run the ball with their with their running back door and Howard like they normally do they they they saw a weakness in the bug just they and that's why they continued to expose and that's why even when the bears are winning by thirty or forty they kept passing the ball\nSeven to seven five seven nine one or two if I could not be stopped\nI'm Still a buck said I just need a little workshop on how to be one\nI Try not to read into these emotions and things that I saw too much because it could just be me but as I as I'm watching that team having seen the the team that we saw in week one specifically in in week two\nThey didn't seem like they wanted to be there we're talking about how this team was clicking and how they're having fun and I wanted to play for Ryan Fitzpatrick even after the bears were clearly piling on you know in the first quarter\nThe office got out there and did not look like they were on a mission to score the Paul Ryan fitzpatrick as much as I Love him he did not have that fire in his eyes that we've seen early on in the season\nFundamental mistakes judgment mistakes he made one good throat to Sean Jackson the Sean to the rest Chris what's up walking to grab alive\nAge or I've been above spent my whole entire life and I'll tell you the one thing that\nIs like a it may have a bucks fan and I'm tired of it is the people and the other team studying records against us and I don't know if there's a way to look it up but we've had so many other teams set records against the that's the embarrassing\nI get that like it's okay to lose the game but if you're gonna let mental trip is key throw six touchdown passes and teams put up video game like numbers against your team you not only have a problem Europe public embarrassment and that's a to a lifelong bucks fan I I Can't imagine that's a lot of fun to do\nIt it's a heartache I Will say that\n... so what's your attitude going into the by week and then with our next game what's your mindset like let's let's get them are only one game out in the NFC South or what\nYeah I mean it got to be optimistic he had to go out there now and hope that they they play well and and they wait a little bit I guess I mean ... it's a question like that but I gather\nOnce you hire us we begin the process of obtained evidence to take you witness statements investigating

can have to think about it because we don't play again it's\nThere's no right way to feel like there is you feel however you feel All right and that's your right to feel that way as a fan of the team\nI felt confused I feel so confused 'cause I was ready yesterday I got this season I've\nBeen reading a watch box football more than ever before I was like man I'm I'm ready\nI mean there are any of the week off to get ride for Atlanta 'cause Atlanta has another great often so we'll see what kind of change and they make to the defense of side of the ball whether it's coach their players\nI mean if you fire the general manager of the defense isn't automatically going to get better right you can't go back in time and make different draft picks\nNo and the glaciers don't really do a lot of in season firing and I don't I don't know if if they're kind of want to get rid of Mike Smith I don't know if you will be forced to\nHe doesn't want to he just sat in his press conference literally minutes ago this has zero to do with relationships cutter says of his sticking with defensive coordinator Mike Smith we as coaches have to coach better and that starts with me so he's he's ready to say these are my guys and I'm going down with the ship I respect that I suppose\nI guess at some point I mean the seasons sixteen games a long time but they're not that long when you look the other sports okay a quarter of the seasons gone already home every game is so important so I think at some point and it's all about getting in the play offs it's all about winning the super bowl\nAt some point with this coaching staff and even your GM you say is this a group of guys do they have the capability\nTo get us to a Super Bowl period this year next year the year after it I don't know that the answer to that question is yes\n[noise] yeah I just\nBummed me out because I I went to public like before the game I got all my grocery shopping done I was ready to go by twelve fifty a watch red zone for a little bit and then I put on the uh the the Fox broadcast and said man here I Am bears bucks I've never been so emotionally invested in a bucks game before\nAnd all that happened was they wipe their bare as with us\nAnd left us in shambles thinking they're left us in shambles yelling at each other are pointing at each other getting burned on defense but\nThey gave me the rest of your son had to go out there and enjoy it they didn't make you sit around for three hours and watch them and take it down to the wire that said hey listen today if not are they go out there and enjoy Sunday with your family\nWell uh my my son didn't want to enjoy time with me at all ... we were recovering from Halloween horror nights which by the way it so great like I did pulled our guys are like post graduate school when we went on a guy's mhm pulled her guys the second time you realize that this is one of the all time great haunted houses and Halloween or nights history\nFrom what I

Night live weekend update to talk about his relationship with ... which\nIs super awkward the whole episode which pretty awkward like I think they won it whether it's our Catholic does hilarious

going good how 'bout you\nGood so I think ... is taking a page from Trump and working in the media and a lot of the same way as the Trump did it still does and and so he admires Trump for his ability to to really throw a wrench and things that get people talking in the media\nTo save the things that people aren't used to hearing because we're so used to fabricated\nControlled concise statements were Kanye and to a lesser degree Donald Trump speak from their heart they don't worry about how's this going to land they think\nI'm going to speak my mind and if I get something wrong or if I screw something up I'm going to explain that later ... and ... ... I don't get the guy but I but I sure am glad that there's someone\nWho speaks his mind and then on afraid man or whether we agree with what he says or not it's too easy to go a tiny as crazy Iraq counties full of crap\n... I don't I'm not saying we should pay attention to is one of the great minds of our generation\nBut it sure as hell is refreshing to have someone who speaks out Seventy seven five seven nine to five\nAnd I consider his albums even as new once the works of art\nHe's got something to say now\nIs he mentally stable pal I don't know or any of us want mentally stable artist I Want you agree the

father who's teenagers do to my house banging Kanye West's\nMhm um I pretty much feel like he's a dang eighty one makes many ... ... ... well\nThe fact that he will run his mouth before he'll engages boy you know having to go back and correct something as as serious as we should've polish the thirteenth amendment and your skin is dark urine ...\nWell you see is point do you do you if you do see is worrying about amending it to where we no longer allowed to enslave the incarcerated that was the point that he was trying to get out\nI I understand that I understand that but in the time between\nThe uh the putting that statement out and him correcting the statement and let's let's be clear not everyone watches the little show that he's gone to a to make his clarification you know I\nI I'm a ... a lot of times that never gets All right so had it not been for your show I wouldn't even know that he made of courage to\nSit there you are calling us off kilter look at you\n... well I appreciate your show but mostly you\nDoubt ... thank you very much I appreciate you thank you thank screw you two Seventy seven five seven nine to five I Love you just don't take 'em so seriously if I may I can understand that the things he said are are absolutely crazy played out\nBut to me he's a rapper he artist\nHe's a musician that's that's that's what he is to me he's not he's not making to see my senator no\nI'm not relying on ... to be myself grapes you know I I he's a rapper who's been given a platform and he's got something to saying he's going to say is it going to think before he speaks a lot of time hell no do I think before everything I say hell no\nAnd you know what you know why it's got a lot of stuff that they got a record coming out who's going to say some stupid some and he's going to go back to undergrad who's got something else to promote it to say some more crazy stuff that is true that all first\nA make America great again hat and all that thing with TMZ he did all that right before he ... he ...\nAnd and now the ... album like ... with the Y. is on hold because he's going to Africa to complete the project and uh he wants to draw inspiration and energy from the earth\nI get that that's cool\nSeventy seven five seven I wanted to five and eight hundred seven several one would have you know if you want to go to Africa if you were an artist and you had to pull energy to finish your creation or too many too many uh too many vaccinations yeah\nYeah I pulled my energy from somewhere a little more local right yeah I I I don't want to get vaccinated for smallpox in the flooded although God like rainbow river or something that's good enough for me what's up Justin\nHey what's going on you love the show I listen to you guys for a long time or is it\nIs one that say real quick I was one of those people have thought it was crazy saying until I heard the song ... people you really voice their opinion on what do you think about Trump wind up back at the song that came out during the first ... first posted that white actually it was ...\nYup but if you listen to that song it really shows is deeper truth feelings about what it costs with digital cable interview they try to chop it making looking saying but I asked that question directly targeting out\nI just feel like anyone with a voice that goes against tiny percent the media is shut out and that's what are you seeing\nAnd that's what I like about it is you know love what he says hate what he says he's got to say it and I think it's important to listen to him and anyone who says oh\nYou know you're you're this color so you don't get to think that way or it's not right that you think that what you have to think that way that's dangerous it's a dangerous mentality we should look at what makes cognac inspired to say the things that he does agree or disagree\nAnd and then you know make your own decisions about the dude crazy not crazy stable not stable whatever but you know we're so used to\nSo used to people just doing the same tired rhetoric those on the right saying oh these liberals are those are the less than out the Nazis blah blah blah well not everybody has to fall into that are that the same predictable people will chastised the other side for the same tired things when\nYou look at it we can lump Hollywood and in the music scene and everything in together there are not many voices I mean off the top of my head I can name maybe three or four a pivotal people in that world that would ever come out and say anything pro Trump let alone somebody who has the audience the Kanye West usually ...\nWilling to like take his audience and go hey don't buy my albums anymore if you don't like it what's up Matthew\nHave one of the probably one of the top and it makes me happy is just how angry black and other a quote unquote liberals get on a black person support somebody on the right I'm\nI'm a libertarian and I can't stand the Republican but the Democrats oh my gosh you got it on the line if you are black or they get so\nAre you black oh no no I'm not let that is none of that is a\nIn Eric neglect as you can get but it's so funny to me how angry like just like bending stealing from their mouth\nBut who who is who who are black people are so mad\nYou know I I'm not saying everybody black person has thrilled that we're ... says but who are these angry black people you speak of\nOh just get on Twitter you'll\nI Am on Twitter among other non stop twenty four seven three sixty five I'm not seeing the angry black people anywhere\nYou haven't seen how angry they are it on your first reporting from\nDay no I I I I mean Snoop Dogg came out last week it said he was a racist bitch [laughter]\nThat is still under a you know said that uh he was getting a sense of ... that\nGuy's message was terrible the way that he worded it but I don't think that he's that off I don't think that people who who are on the other side are open to ... having different point of\nView that would've been a better way to say yeah yeah like like thinking that Kanye has an obligation because of the color of his skin just to believe a certain thing and say a certain thing I don't buy into that\nDid you find it interesting how he answered the question but are you black and oh no no no I don't know can you ask me hey settle you black no but that's not good either at all Johnny black\nFrom the waist down like are you black no I'm not asked me John drew are you black you're\nSeventy seven five seven nine to five\nYou asked me again Seth you but no but that that would be great if I was there you go I feed decade and I feel better about that answer and you can you ask me again\nGermany black I Wish Mica still Caucasian but I Love everyone has begun are\nYou black who you Seventy seven five seven nine to five and eight hundred seven seven one would have to five or we've talked football are today will still help you bucks fans well\nHopefully you bucks fans will help me a little bit more than the bucks fans did the beginning of the show because as a brand new committed to bucks fan guy I'm Still having a hard time with what happened yesterday haven't you he'll get a habit and I want to talk about how real Thomas went out\nIn a blaze of glory crew boss and I want to give prizes to anyone who who\nDid not like he quit his job but ... anybody else who went out in a blaze of glory like real Thomas did what a what a way to go live\n\n\nMichael resigned as you know\nUm [noise]\n\nThey do things about it at all day yesterday number one as a new book Stan\nI'm just trying to figure out how I should feel down I don't want to lose over the same like I've done in years past I Want to I Want to be the a foul\nWeather than this year as opposed to the fair weather fan I Want to stick with the team they didn't make it easy yesterday as they stunk up the place in Chicago but\nDid they play a very superior bears defense yes did our defense make Michel ... looked like Joe Montana yes so now what two weeks ago we were ready to make Ryan Fitzpatrick the most awesome Tampa Bay athlete ever\nAnd then now we're burying the buccaneers so\nI think there's hope now I've been thinking about the okay I think there are so James Swanson has officially been named starting quarterback for when they get out there by week\nOh Jay how it's going to miss them time which I I think he's one of their biggest weapons but that's okay they still have can't break they still have D. Jackson Evans God when the whole crew alright the second round draft pick their running back finally was activated yesterday they've still got the fence intact they're gonna have to win every single game by scoring at least six or seven touchdown\nSee that's the thing is even if Ryan at outta fits magic game yesterday we still would have lost because Mitchell Trybulski through six touchdown passes\nSo set you brought up on your show yesterday I heard you mention that the article that came out I think on Sunday about how dark cutter had talked to the team earlier in the week the U.S to discuss with them about what he was going to do regarding a fitzpatrick James within that article I found it very interesting to know that he told the team\nOn that Monday Night game he was going to put in Ryan Griffin in place of Ryan Fitzpatrick\nAnd I just I Wonder what that good that does for the team I\nI don't know I think the whole quarterback situation the way it's been handled the way that he handled the media this week by not named mia quarterback I think it's been more of a method of needs to be and more of a distraction at least it seems that way but he did say that to me that he considered putting Ryan Griffin in the game\nI guess what he was telling the team was that he liked the way that Griffin had practiced and when he was trying to see was if you practice this art I might put you in again even if it if it doesn't look good All right but I\nI don't I don't know that's just what are the writer was polling from from what cut her side of the team\nYesterday we saw an embarrassment and I just need to know from you guys have been bucks fans for a long time you've probably seen more\nThere are some defeats the net so then\nThat was pretty bad because I think that a lot of fans had hopes for yesterday right I think are a lot of what\nI heard they tested especially when the sheriff there was ... so the defense wouldn't really have that much on their hands that the bears defenses overrated in that day with the way that the bucks by the second half was the team that they were the first two games that they could very easily be three in one right now\n... what I saw yesterday was a team that came out flat and inspired out matched out man confused blowing assignments but I still will root for the buccaneers when they come off the by week against the falcons I just agree with that that they are going to have to score fifty seven points\nSeventy seven five seven I Want to do five and eight hundred seven seven one one or two five you\nDo you hold anything against Seamus from what you saw yesterday from him not really okay I don't think you can know\nYou can't hold anything regarding the outcome of the game against injustice\nPerformance like could you always there to actually go he clearly wasn't ready there was too much pressure\nI don't know how you come into a game down already twenty eight to three and do anything but what James said I don't fault him for any I really thought that he'd be able to put up at least two or three touchdowns I thought you know\nYeah I mean hearing all the hype and you know he had an amazing preseason take that for what it will and you'd like to see this guy who is being anointed as the future of the franchise come in and be able to rally the team and make a comeback like we saw Ryan Fitzpatrick do against the Steelers the week before in from that aspect\nI didn't feel that it got the dolphins got that more powerful I didn't seem like they were clicking more it seems like the same office we saw with Ryan Fitzpatrick\nJust with Jamie ... who was able to throw two interceptions and I believe one touchdown\nSeventy seven five seven nine when did you buy what I look for my quarterback is throwing more touchdowns than you do interceptions James didn't do that yesterday but again it's been awhile since he's played an NFL game what's up sue welcome to figure out a lot then we'll talk about her all Thomas after this phone call up\nCame to this is sue how are you\nOh my God buffalo see what's going on\nWell you know this was a good time for me to hear the ... and\nSo I did okay for you [laughter] wow oh I don't I don't really know it can do their votes are\nThere it's not good this year and if it's the land is flat so ... I don't want to be about stand trial\nWell you're not trying hard enough ... you can be above fan and still be embarrassed by what happened yesterday and that's what I'm trying to figure out 'cause I'm so used to being a patriots fan and and and rooting for winning teams or at least teams that win make to make it to the play offs it's I'm not used to seeing the type of the type of\nWhatever we saw yesterday which was which was flat and inspired I I don't know the dirt cutter had these guys ready to play or if these guys that themselves ready to play you know\nRight well I think I'm a bills fan eight down I'll eat that heart and that's my problem\nThat is a problem you should definitely try to get that fixed Seventy seven five seven nine minute you've got to work that out with some sort of like a football counselor yeah\nMan what a what a lot of high hopes to\nYou and listen to it there's plenty of twelve games laugh\nI Know and and right now or two into we had to fantastic victories where we're singing the praises of Ryan fits magic against the saints in the eagles the Steelers last really hurt\nAnd then uh and yesterday wasn't even a lawsuit was who was just a a pummeling\nWell I think that makes it worse if we if we weren't riding the high of that if we had a couple you know minor acceptable wins will re pulled it out but I mean those first two games with just so much offensive power right and you see these guys clicking and you see the fun they're having a press conference where\nThat is all gone it's all gone every single aspect\nOf it you didn't they didn't look like they're having fun out there that they were clicking out there they weren't playing football there is nothing to hang our hat on this exact moment and it's very sad\nI got to get it back and get your mojo back but how like what can you point to yesterday that you can feel even remotely positive about 'cause there's there's nothing other than Catherine sorrow made the only field goal but he tried\nThat ... their contracts their paychecks should motivate them you know well there are sure but what motivates me is the fed I'm not making money I Want to feel good about something\nI Know motivate you free tickets in a parking pass\nI wouldn't do how I Am for sale aiming Seventy seven five seven nine to five\nYou think you're so cool ... uh I read an article this morning top ten worse or football stadiums in the country soldier field number five oh wow how how do you feel about that I think I think it's a beautiful facility yeah it's old\nMy brother in law went to the game in
