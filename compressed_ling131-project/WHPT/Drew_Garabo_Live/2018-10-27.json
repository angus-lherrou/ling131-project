I ... I made it wants to the office it was like what'd you get this or just made it in there yeah but you think that's just elaborate thing is not that it's not that much to it\nAnd people freak out when you're just like oh we like us a frozen fish but you have these days in age just for a restaurant to sell it or to pick it up it has to be frozen but it is a health code violation well\nFirst of all there's no bluefin in the Gulf I don't understand why you know there has to be this red tide no so but you know yeah that's the that's the main thing in it\nThe difference when you flash freeze it and you you have an ordered bring it to the restaurant thought out whatever but if you have for like months in a cooler that\nStereotype but if you ever have you go to a restaurant that has it for much of a cool you're not doing the wrong legitimate dogs that you're in the wrong west rub because you know if you're a big ... you got a frozen but it's thought out it was gold salt immediately yeah immediately\nAnd uh you know it's fun to they had the ... that we actually going to sell or if labels Tampa Bay as just as easy as put a little poker exhausted in there\nPut a couple of seasonings in

then testing to the then making sure you have the right staff but you don't want to do is open up when you're not ready correct that's\nThe wrong thing so I keep on telling people seems to know if it goes over two weeks and the rest of the worst thing we're going to make sure we opened and we got out and you go from there because you open your fizzle there's really no way to combat ready screwed all those people so\nIt's a food truck because you can't you can't have a friend or family and I know you cannot you basically are open and ready for ...\nYeah exactly we're gonna have breakfast

put years on you you haven't lived yet right yeah yeah he was undercover ... as being undercover is well it on\nA SWAT Team that's been a lot of mean you get that heart racing it it'll age it that's for sure what's your favorite undercover cop movie oh\nI Love Russell Crowe in American gangs as well that's not an undercover and a colleague Ronald benefit autographs go now radical was mine was entertaining\nBut bad boys I think that's the funny or bad boy yeah that was too will Will Smith right right I mean\nYeah but what can you say that's covering right if you want a holiday you can't live like that on the cover what am I a dying jobs in Miami Vice is supposed to be able to cover these driving around the test rolls on who's not seeing that car and hit a minute I don't know the fact\nI had a quick question I'm running red lights don't do it in a while you're on the on the drive and and uh the light's green automatically threats are in the motion of going through the light of it from a police officer standpoint ... of all and someone over running a red light at the last\nOr not you're not running around like the the the the way the law reads as you have to be passed the pro nation line so they all every intersection has that white lie of wide lines long as you're over that white line you're not running around so I've already consider entered the intersection sidewalk white lie or the middle of a white ...\nOh yeah I Am currently ... not the entire car one across the one that my front wheel is cross that you're you're\nOnce you're that you've already entered the intersection part of the like turning right but also a great question like\nThat is yeah that is that is so so you could technically so I mean I Can't imagine that I mean let me ask you\nThis or what if what if someone you you witnessed them the light's yellow you witnessed them speed up a\n... increase that speed expert mentally to make it and they just barely get across I mean do you go well at some point that person was speeding to get that like I mean is that a different situation not likely not monthly now I think\nThe days of writing traffic tickets I've seen it over twenty seven years\nThat the number of citations that are issued have dropped every year and it's just because people don't want to issue\nAre owned my department you know we don't all have a culture where we go and issue a bunch of tickets are too expensive and the only people that really make money is the shirts company rot your goes up and insurance companies make money it's about education is not about punishing people cry educate them if we can have a conversation and give you weren't as they please don't\nBut now if you see someone to driving aggressively\nYou there's some people I I tell I tell our troops there is some people they just need some education there's other people that many twenty tickets are there a difference you we've all seen those drivers to but\nWe just don't have a culture of Guam right a bunch of tickets unfortunately\nFor for a lot of people and that's a good law abiding citizens that may be the only time that they have some type of interaction with the police officers because they were speeding or they did go through that red light and a deputy or that police officer may be working a complaint or at a school zones something like\nThat you are you know the job you lead the job a ... as he embezzles likes to say real tall [noise] if you want to fracture a law to win the cops\n[laughter] what what are the worst hit me Raymond give me a two hour window jak how does it say you know ended among quota [laughter] and I tell people that I was back way back and I like I said that I'm like you're just trying to fill your code I said I don't have a food I could write as many as I was\nSaying at the beginning of the mother of the best time alone\nAbout me or I noticed that a man is what I look at the time\nI met my buddy's one to one more question how what is your opinion on the red light cameras ... well\nI could tell you that studies have shown I I I think all of us were for because we thought it was gonna is gonna stop accidents because we're all going to lock the breaks up and not go through the interaction because at a red light cameras\nThat hasn't happened right we can look at the red light cameras and look at the intersection and seeing that nothing has diminished the number of accidents are still there so then you look and see who's benefitting from\nFrom the from the cameras and not even in state and write a lot of times now and and I I think it comes down to sometimes I understand people's argument it becomes a money thing so I'm not a big ... I'm not a big proponent of red light cameras I\nI don't if if it would help reduce the number of accident and one less person being her hey listen count me in but it but it hasn't diminished that hasn't lowered it one I mean one percent\nThe other thing is limited to say there's been a spike kind of asked all of a moot question and I I get this a lot when I have you on people asking questions\nThat are predicated upon you writing laws you you're yes it doesn't matter really what your opinion on a red light camera because you have nothing to do with whether we're going to have a red like\nIdol or not the law as I'm sworn to uphold the laws but I don't make them all and I can help work with some legislators and say hey this is what we need you know I'm responsible for keeping our community say ... helped me with this right\nSo that that's what you want to do you want to focus questions on the you know what what what can he facilitate what can he changed what can you how can he effect or whatever it is you do not I mean\nYeah but I I I I Do understand that a lot of people aside from the\nThe the parameters of the job probably want to know just they just want to know your onion about things that didn't want to know what that man that's\nPart of being the sheriff hey you want to get to know your share of that is absolutely as you should\nGo ahead Ben you did oh so some uh some time sitting in an\nSaddam show I think you you went on it a and\nOne of the questions about red light cameras is that there's a myth out there that or I don't know if the ... but that you have a right to protest the ticket and face the uh the officer who wrote to the ticket in ... in court but obviously there is no officer with a red light ticket so if you went to court to protest the ticket\nYou know medically get the ticket thrown out because that's a ... there's an officer\nAbsolutely not it's even tougher to be because you get this picture and they even have the video there's a maybe a thirty second video and it shows the light and it shows your car and word is in position to win the red light turned and where your car was and kind of hard to beat that one\nAll right the un has your a restraining order against being around police horses wired yet\nUh I I I took one picture with it or is it I Believe it will do the top of the type of police are much nicer than ... hours that this is I after\nI got arrested and was like to play in St Pete labels that oh that was St Petersburg or they don't play and they they come in they're sweeping the streets\nDo look odd [laughter] well look\nI Know you've got to get out and I don't want your fish to Rio what's a what's going on to Mars which he and\nNothing crazier in Studio okay I've been to one and talk about the buccaneers and get ready for a lot of money\nBut uh where are you staying on the bus buccaneers ... are you are you Winston or are you a a vivid at ...\nI I'd have to say Jim is Winston and it's only because of a lot of charitable work he does a ride run in some of the same circles right I I I admire him for that All right but now when I'm not a big football fan I'm not a big sports guy\nThat while I'm not going to I'm not going to look down only because my neither am I neither\nAm I tell you which teams are from which city when it got really he couldn't hang which could have\n[laughter] I mean if he's not even read me the ...\nI I Love my last them forty five minutes you could come home for the game but was there was no care [laughter]\nAll right ... bucks playing them are by the\nBangles ... a ... an addict and so that's pretty good is it homeland nowhere to being older I'm a\nWell they have lost tuna or maybe they were looking good I think it began in\nUniform one one is going to Kansas City so there's still a Pittsburgh okay\nAll right All right well you'll hear that goes tomorrow in his own show the embattled show uh that's that's a Lebanon wants to ride my rent or hey did you do the pups grow by the way no sir uh okay All right you're going to be at the Punjab though right will\nBe there and I am in Spanish to score okay oh really well Ryan Adams duty you know I was I was in Ryan's corner turned ... and then they changed the fight\nBut I've always been a Spanish is going okay let me write a good okay knows that okay All right I'm I'm I'm Tim Ryan but I'm going to try to get Spanish to smash has had oh I think that what kind of how is that yeah yeah well I'm In the corner man\nOn the right way I see a difference between those two I think about forty pounds thirty forty pounds\nYeah man ... yeah [laughter] Forbes out of the house for ...\nLast year we right\nAll right Becky ... always get outta years you'll enjoy that send me a picture how you could get our I Know a a mid June Jim hold on a will be taking your calls ... ... ...

he's a report to\nThe phones drives me crazy excuse me I'm a friend turned from France Germany tonight with an amazingly 'cause I remember Frank ... is a movement mine for Seventy five for that call that I Am I'm going to\nYeah I was wondering what the Jake on including the flow of traffic and sales growth and he's on trial or is that a little bit more like it just it was a lot also second part I was wondering what it'll do counties\nThat is on the fence all the criminal division of marijuana and I'll listen off the\nAlright alright and you'd think you know again there are certainly submitted setting in hung up I\nI think he's not their cars that are in the past and lean that overtaking lane and never do you know they're arriving slower than their cars in the right ... and some states do have a law that it's illegal if you're not over taken a car you're not supposed to be in that lane\nFor doesn't have that law but a ... you know to be honest it just there's too many other laws traffic wise that can prevent someone from getting hurt or hurting someone else that need to be addressed before that but I'll be the first to admit that there is nothing more frustrating\nAnd they do the line of cars back in the in the left lane you're trying to overtake in anger over taken and grandma's driving forty miles per hour ... if it causes and yeah and it's yours actor writer there need at that needs to be ...\nAnd I know we're gonna we're gonna talk about something uh in regards to marijuana in some in is of a part of something you've already enacted so we'll get to the I I I mean you can answer again I don't know that your opinion on the deal or a lead the legalization of marijuana or is is relevant because you\nDon't you don't make but if you are you going to have an opinion on it go ride and how\nI'm In favor of medical marijuana I don't think that anyone should be no human being should have to suffer if there's something out there that would be able to to mediate that dead ... disease so I'm In favor of that as far as the decriminalization I\nYou know my personal opinion right maybe not to popular opinion I've I've seen in juveniles and and young adults are\nAre there all the studies I've read studies and and how it's come out and it's it's a limited our cognitive ability and development right and and it's in all the studies show that I've seen all the problems that there had been in\nIn a Colorado all the homeless problem solved the addictive issues and all the problems they thought that they weren't going to have and yes the state thought that hey we're going to get rich off this and make all this money off the tax and it's cost them double the money ... between rehab impaired drivers and the homeless problem that they have out there because of it\nAnd they're still black market marijuana um problem out there so\nYou know that's that's the reasons why but again I I don't make the law if they decide to vote and that's the way it's gonna be then obviously the I'll I'll I'll ... there there's a fine line I guess and this is the\nDifference between you know whether it should be legal or medicinal or whatever but the but the criminalizing it do you ever stands I mean should should you know people will be thrown away and put felonies on their thing for ... small marijuana possessions or\nNo and that's why one the first thing I I did and I would get to that was created\nDid was to create a diversion program I I I I my sentiment is actually\nA if you have a misdemeanor amount of marijuana or it's a I call I hate to say a victimless crime you haven't uh I don't think as your share if I've kept your kept your county safe\nBy locking up someone who has a misdemeanor amount of marijuana so that's why I have the diversion programs to make sure that we're not I'm not wasting taxpayer monies worth the cost that it takes to housing or prosecute them or anything\nReally ... things that he can change and that the question was about decriminalization he's already sort of moving in that very well I was gonna say and we're going to get into this and that we're going to go to break\nSoon after I'd take a gyms call but\nYou talked about one of the things you've already instituted and correct me if I'm wrong or I misunderstood what you said but I I think that maybe you have a a minor charge the marijuana charge on your record a you made it easier to wear that doesn't automatically exclude Jew from maybe joining the force them I did I misinterpret what she was\nTold me marijuana use marijuana now I'm not saying a marijuana charge from several years ago automatically disqualify you depends on the time that's a it's a it's a applicant by applicant basis but what I did is I wanted to modify some of the hiring standards were were or short we've been short forever\nOr the the the counting needs the response and the deputies need help out there\nAnd do we have gone for two hundred and thirty five open physicians down to a hundred and fifty nine physicians okay\nAnd what I did is modified the education standards or you don't need a college degree you know we're going to send you the academy and teach you how to be a deputy sheriff right because you know not everybody could afford I mean I'm able to go to doubt that's exactly right there are a lot of people are being disqualified because they simply can't afford to go to college it's it's very expensive\nAnd I didn't want someone who's been disqualified that had a passion for serving their community\nBecause they couldn't afford to go to college but in regards to the marijuana I relax the ah the marijuana use it used to be three years I dropped it down to two years that that ... that you won't be disqualified along with the tattoos used to have a tattoo on your arm you're automatically disqualified qualify right I I I modified that now you can have tattoos on\n... and ... and that's I mean I mean it's it's still to be commended but to a degree that's just common sense right tattoos in this day and they were going to disqualify you from being the old officer of the law\nIt's evolving as an agency is a the the keep the community our world society as a ... you know Twenty years ago you had a tattoo you're a gang member right you're not that's not the case now ... you know and uh so we just had to have all been I think that's just part
