would I Would watch it nonstop tripping balls\nBut when it came to this stuff like Bambi\nUh Roger Rabbit to a lesser degree great film I never saw a Lion King is so great and I consider Little Mermaid to be an unheralded masterpiece\nI watch a lot of your boy Lucy K secret life of pets these the voice of one of the main characters and a hard for me to get into it knowing what he's done especially to Sarah Silverman but still perfect movie\nDid you see we didn't even talk about this yesterday about Sarah Silverman sister Laura\nBush either to Google it right now Google Luis C K Lauren Silverman he got bull sisters at the same time\nOh man she had a very different reaction to it than Sarah dead so she must not be a comedienne she is oh she [laughter] she is a comedian\nAnd she's just not as successful and or an or others this ... this is\nThis is from like over a year ago\nRight how did how did this get by us\nA yeah Sarah Silverman sister says Luis C K masturbate in front of her about twenty times\nAnd she wasn't cool with it like now she's saying that it was creepy and obsessive but how do you let him do it the second time let if it's creepy\nProbably wasn't an appointment that she bought their you know he probably just did it you know once it happened without without a doubt\nLadies can you stay friends with the dude if he if he masturbate in front of you repeatedly\nAnd this happened it seemed like over one period of time she wrote that while at a cross country trip Lucy Cape afford became famous he masturbate it in front of her twenty times so it was on one on one trip\nSeventy seven five seven nine to five and eight hundred seven seven one one or two five\nI I don't get\nThis he's a horny dude what does he not know about and that pornography or um cam shows or any of this stuff I think\nHe got off on putting women in in any comparable position I I think he got off on the fact that his ... and you're not supposed to do it\nSo during a string of tweets from November twenty Seventeen she said it was not criminal but compulsive and gross after people went after saying it was criminal she responded by saying nope please let's keep the spokes on actual victims of salt abuse or power and intimidation so she has said come out and said it was a criminal\nSo she she doesn't think that it was necessarily illegal but she was still not that cool with it\nAll right I have refrained from initiating this conversation for a reason because it's not criminal not an abuse of power I guess I'm just compelled at this point to be a character witness for ... for those brave enough to come forward\nSo he he masturbating repeatedly in front of both Silverman sisters that is something else man\nI didn't the good thing about this as we didn't know Sarah Silverman had a sister so now we can't look into her work I think we have to look at the bright side of all this really tragic news that's coming out\nWell I knew she had a sister and she was a part of her show the Sarah Silverman show but just not as funny\nHe was a gentleman he always invited me to wait outside the motel room door if I wanted I usually did but he made it clear the masturbating was going to happen each and every morning naked on the bed sometimes I just read my book in the corner I did not enjoy it I\nCan you do that can you go hey we're taking this costs country trip I'll pay for gas put every morning I'm going to be masturbating in our room and you can stand outside if you don't like it\nMany more development mints and here it must be noted that we had been dating briefly beforehand I had broken up with him at the start of the trip and we continued on anyway for some reason youth I guess we'd been intimate previously just giving all the facts I'm not a victim but I fully believe those coming forward\nThat's there's a lot there's a lot going on there it's just it's\nPretty much what we've heard all along about 'em right it's generally the same thing with every woman it's just these women were closer to him they dated them these other women they were aspiring comedians\nRight and that's the difference is if you're friends with someone you are familiar with them it's still kind of creepy what he did\nI think he's got a problem I Would think so I think he's got a problem [laughter] I didn't I didn't know you get real setting where we hear about the sex addicts you don't really believe it but when you hear all these women now you're thinking that there might be something amiss\nI Would like to see his first gig back like real the other than these uh these underground gigs that he's doing first kickback he goes up on stage and just pulls it out and starts doing it right in front of everybody\nMike if you had a male friend and it was just platonic and he asked you if he could pleasure himself in front of you no matter no matter the answer if it's yes or no could you still be friends\nA person if they had asked you that come

New York oh she said there was\nControversy on a Real Housewives of New York with Lou and she dressed as Diana Ross and she made her skin look darker than it really is\nAnd people said that was racist and I don't know she explained I thought like who doesn't love Diana Ross she wants to look like Diana Ross for one day and I don't know how that got racist on Halloween\nOr comments were rejected by the group at the today show table and plenty of people on social media who reacted similarly\nShe's she's just entertaining she knows [noise] you can't be in the media not see seven of these stories every single year yeah from celebrities that do it not just regular people that are going to do it and posted\nBy the way a Megan Kelly also the person who made sure the kids know that Santa Claus is white last year\nOf member she said there is no black Santa Claus like [laughter] that was what she was on Fox News where that plays a little bit better but I think we're there is audio from ah the today show this morning stand by and I'll get it for you of her defending Diana Ross blackface\nHalloween or black or white they mean by\nI kept that was okay as long as you were trying to find that character is LA feels like something is offensive to them then you should say it and that's fair game and if they're going to dress up like I Want to take when they mentioned as people like ... if you think it's offensive it properly and one of my head\nFor Melissa Rivers stern look so much like our mom oh the poor dog facing oh\nHave have you seen the picture of the girl 'cause I Know that what she said is is broadly wrong but to me this ... that is not your traditional blackface\nWas more like a gold safe than anything else I mean\nShe didn't even need any black face with that hair right you are fine we know who you are\nYou yeah you just don't do it it it doesn't matter if you don't think it's racist enough people think it's racist\nTo the point where you're going to get in trouble for it so the juice is not worth the squeeze at all just don't do blackface do you think they can tell he's playing a part no I I truly think that she doesn't see anything wrong with it and guess what you don't have to think there's anything wrong with it\nBut you have to understand that there are people who do what it is I don't even the Flint is if you look at she's wearing it looks\nYeah I mean that's the thing when I saw the episode I watched the show and I'm you know some people were it was like very people were just asking does she have does she have some like self Tanner honest she did she do something to her skin like I don't think that you would know just by seeing or if you didn't know her otherwise that she had dark and her skin\nI wouldn't have known that that was black face I Would have just thought she had some gold makeup on or something so I wouldn't have had that much of a problem with it but Megan Kelly defending it and then saying she doesn't know why black faces offensive\nWhile there you go that's that's the issue Seventy seven five seven nine one or two five and eight hundred seven seven one or two five now this moron\nWho grabbed a boob repeatedly on an airplane flight the guys from Tampa and he said quote the president says it's OK Brian Michael Alexander aged forty nine of Tampa\nFaces a federal charge of abusive criminal contact in connection with an incident aboard an airline flight to Albuquerque New Mexico he grabbed a woman at least twice during Sunday flight from Houston to Albuquerque\nAnd said quote the president of the United states says it's OK to grab women by their private parts oh my\n... you think he did this okay here's my theory [noise] the guy is\nNot a Trump supporter no no way the guys on the left\nAnd wanted to make a point about how damaging he thinks the president's comments are okay so he thought he'd grab a boob get arrested for it but then go but the president says it's OK President never said it's OK he said he did it\nSo in order to just prove a point you're saying this crazy liberal is risking his freedom and is assaulting another woman\nTo prove a point yeah he's\nA trigger snow like wow I don't think he grabbed I think he's a triggered snowflake correct I don't think he grabbed the boob for the purpose of making a point I think he's a creep who grabbed the boot so we figured why not bring down the president that I already have since I'm a ... a\nGood point you're not bringing anybody down put yourself in the scenario\nYeah and and the woman yelled out Trump's not this isn't even got me on his radar it and it does feed into a certain narrative you know that that men are feeling emboldened to do terrible things because Donald Trump is our presence howdy ... hey ... how do you let your boom get grabbed wife\nShe was ... she he was sitting behind her oh so he reads his hand around and everybody else on this flight\nShe uh at first she thought it was an accident then it happened again recalling she said recalling a hand that had six fingers were Harry and dirty fingernails so she found the hand grabbed her arm and then slowly and attentive league grow per right side\nWitnesses on board said they saw the woman stand up and tell the man behind her that she didn't know why he thought it was okay to touch her now we're talking the woman said told him he needed to stop she asked for a different seat\nAnd the crew member moved her to the back of the plane\nUh the man's father re Alexander defended his son quote I don't believe the allegations are true yeah because you were there a guy I'm convinced he's not guilty from everything I've heard and read about it so far from talking to him I'm convinced that what he said and what he was charged with did not happen\nDidn't he pretty much admitted by saying the president has said this is okay\nYeah like you pretty\nMuch admitted to it by saying quote the president to the United states says it's OK to grab women by their
