otherwise someone's going to get hit and it's going to ruin somebody's day if they hit them what's that Troy ... how you doing man\nHey I just uh there's a big misconception that when people get it from me right that people in the vehicle or going to go flying through the windshield\n... okay\nYou know because when you get hit for me I did go fired back in the seat I just had this discussion what some people I work with the other day\nI just noticed that the go forward as well when you get hit from behind the ... you know you go forward no no when you get in the back eagles flying back in the last guy I I\nI don't know what you adjusted this weekend that killed her brain cells my man but when you are you\nKidding me I I work in the medical to Plano\nRather fat ask what you do when a when a body at rest tend to get\nIn the front you'd go fight for the guy that hit you goes fly forward when you get hit you get smashed into the back of your seat\nTook out why why would an airbag let me ask you if why would an airbag deploy if I flew backwards rather than into the airbag which is in front of me whom he got you there\nWell that makes perfect sense because after you go flying back\nIn your seat used in your body then move forward\nBut not enough to make it go flying through the windshield\nSo if you're at rest and a guy hits you from behind you're going to go forward because the acceleration\nIs like from behind do he hits you agree or real forward\nYou're going to get ... back into your seat\nMica so why does this seat belt tightening tightening keep you can hear the discussion I'll go ahead I mean I appreciate that you're listening to the show but you're still not go ahead\nOkay look it up you guys\nI'm not looking up any things are not looking up anything

that it is a restraining the\nPerson flies backwards that is why that we have to put head rests on the back of our chairs because without it\nIf it looked in the sixties or seventies or nothing but shattered vertebrae isn't next from the back of the head slamming over the top of the chair and causing all the vertebrae damage now most cars airbags do not deploy with rear impact\nMost cars you know because the insurance standpoint\nAs airbags once they deploy a total the cars vehicles so unless they have side curtain air bags and there were those sensors golf than the ... as well because they're anticipating there might be somebody not buckled up in the back seat that will fly for it as a projectile\nAn inch of the people in the front seat and that will push them forwards into the steering wheel because you see just as many injuries are broken noses and shattered cheekbones slamming into the steering wheel without airbags\nI got you well I Want to know Dave ... my my head rests today they opened up on my side on the passenger side what what does that is that it's not a thing that the jeep does or does every car do that\nAlmost every car does that that is for impact and cushioning absorbing so it dispersed as the energy through the address so that um if you have ... have you seen any of those seat covers they have what's called laser injector it says right on the side and it causes the seems to split anytime there's sufficient impact\nTo disperse the energy to save the person's head and neck from being destroyed and most people being killed so I just want to

as a as chemicals in Brooklyn that should be pretty interesting um [noise]\nSo now the importance of the worst thing that you can call a guy a lady is crazy that and that is true a lot of ladies absolutely hate to be called that word that is the worst of the world that you can call us a lady\nOr she's trying to foot the script right she's saying if a if a guy cause you crazy then you need to ask what\nWhat happened what what did you want to know what did you do to her yeah if if a man calls a woman crazy ask what bad thing did you do to her she saying it's it's our fault it's hard to\nStop the rhetoric that a woman is crazy or difficult if a man says to you that a woman this crazy or difficult ask him what bad thing did you do to her\nMy question to that is where did where did that start like it's not like one guy one day just said our thing for ladies that will cause us sometimes it's crazy I think there's something\nWith women\nIn there you know in their ah an eight hour makeup yeah they're all crazy though I'm not saying they're all crazy but I Do think that women have the capability due to hormones or whatever it may be at times\nTo act the way that may be perceived as crazy I'm like I don't think that I don't think that's made up ... you think guys just said we'll call women crazy to to undermine them one day\nI think it's probably got a little there's a little something behind it no no\nNo no that it bothers went in and they say it to agitate them because they know they go you're crazy and immediately that's going to make them go even more crazy\nWhy why why would crazy bother a woman I think if a guy gets called crazy some calls me crazy I I get turned out to take it as a compliment why why is crazy a bad thing\nWhy is it a buzzword why why I mean like we're all crazy everybody's crazy so\nFor me and you don't want to ah inoculate then you don't want to call them ... right that's like that the biggest thing either no I'm not going to say I would never call you ... they would make you feel less than what we feel as if you call it would make me feel pretty awesome yeah that'd be cool and it was like\nLook at me and said you're crazy\nThat would drive me crazy and then I Would go crazy\nIf you're already crazy and we're just one of the other you're crazy\nIt was a legitimate thing like I was going nights and I need to you know [noise]\nSee a therapist or something I was going crazy then that's a real discussion but if you're just saying to educate me I think\nThat's what those are two different things I mean I've always I mean you're saying that's a work thing that really makes a man mad\nWhen it's not and across the board characteristic that women are calling men\nYou know on on a regular basis obviously we're talking about here it's a thing men call women crazy when they act crazy and I think sometimes women have it in them to do so there's not a specific characteristics you call a guy put see what does that mean he's not nearly enough he's not doing what you wanted to do is not I'm just saying there is not the equivalent\nNumber ma'am that word is that I I Would kind of agree with Mike I don't know if it had the same effect by bill that word it said on the same level as calling a woman crazy both of those design to just dig as deep as you like if you're about to buy somebody ... what are you guys yelling at each other you're calling each other the word right until you start throwing throwing hands but\nWhat I'm saying is that when a man calls a woman crazy I think a lot of the time there is something happening where the woman could be perceived as crazy I think the key word is just a word that's used to put people down I'm not validating the word crazy I'm just saying that women have it in them to act crazy sometimes sometimes rightfully so\nI just don't think there's the the opposite equivalent for a man like as far as my personality you can call me a Pussy but that's nothing more than a than than a death when I'm calling you crazy it's because I think you're acting crazy\nWell that's you but not every guy would do that so what constitutes crazy for you\nFor me I mean I Can't tell you that I've ever called my girlfriend crazy and I've been with girls who have been crazy I've seen my significant other girlfriends act completely insane and crazy sure whether it be jealousy whether it be you know little pet peeves around the house whatever it may be I've seen women act that way and there's guys out there who act by to\nWhat is it is crazy mental illness is did acting in an irrational\nWay I guess I Would say acting in an irrational well usually tied to a jealousy or things like that I Would say none of them sometimes when a man's call your girl crazy if you look at that girl over there are you looking at her ask\nYour your being crazy no\nSeventy seven five set about why don't you five and eight hundred seven seven one or two five I embrace the fact that I probably crazy so I don't go out they're throwing the label crazy 'cause you could look at a million thoughts that come through my mind and a million things that come out of my mouth ago you're pretty crazy\nYeah but if you're crazy then you should be able to you you you know what crazy is that's why I have no problem telling the which has been criticized cause I'm Crazy and I know what crazy looks

I mean they let him do the he was not welcome there they throughout the middle finger which is fine and then one fan delete delete splashed some beer on the guy\nNormally I Would say that's gone back should probably be found and booted from the stadium they've got a step further ... kill and his agent drew Rosen house say players have to be protected we want that than to be prosecuted\nPatriots identified the fan and have banned him for life from attending Patriot's games that Gillette Stadium but that's not enough they have now identify the suspect as a Twenty one year old man from Massachusetts and he will be charged with disorderly conduct and throwing an object that a sporting event\nNow normally again I Would say that\nThe fan is in the wrong here but if you do a quick Google of ... hill you'll find that this is not exactly a good dude this is a guy who was dismissed from his college team at Oklahoma State for punching a choking is pregnant girlfriend\nSo does that make it okay that somebody shoots you know spills beer on the guy no it doesn't make it okay it just makes me a lot less sympathetic when I find out that somebody sprayed beer on the guy the guy's a comeback but the NFL they got to protect their players even when they're players are\nGone bags are these guys comebacks for life if they do something in college and look he got kicked out of school he he slid in the draft if if he didn't do any of the stuff he would have probably been a first round draft pick\nAs he is comeback forever because unlike Jamie since he's been in the NFL we haven't heard anything about him that is true obviously it's it's horrible what he did disgusting he\nWas Twenty years old he got into an argument with his girlfriend that escalate into physical violence she was eight weeks pregnant was concerned about the fetus because he punched in the stomach he also posture in the face busted her lip and choked her out\nI don't think you come back from that I think if you got that and you to beat up a pregnant woman I think there's something in you that's going to be wrong\nFor him I mean he got into the NFL though so he he must have pulled somebody and he knew he was a draft pick too so the chief invest a little bit of capital and um\nThey uh they invested quite a bit and he never had another brush with the law he is a very prolific football player\nI mean I Know it's not what we're actually talking about but I just wonder you know if a guy to something like this it's it's horrible the ever come back from that or are you just to argue justice comeback forever my ... ah\nWe we fix the problem the problem like the only problem was my ... my ... so therefore the bucks probably get around the table and go Thirteen or three\nI don't like calling for people's jobs but if you were going to get rid of this guy in the buccaneers Ron pays for the worst defense in NFL history and why did you not do it two weeks ago why did you not give the new defensive coordinator week to prepare and get ready for this why did you wait until they came out to perform the way they half of the first few games again that's on the head coach\nRight but in this case they got rid of a Mike Smith today they uh brought they are promoted some dude who I've never heard of the line backers coach and they think that that's got to be enough I guess you are so if we are as just kick the gets the Cleveland Browns on Sunday it's over using cutter gets it\nNo I don't I don't think cutter gets fired during the year I just don't think the glaciers do that I don't see any point unless they all believe that there's enough talent on this team to win a division and go to the playoffs they might but I don't think there's any reason why he fired the cutter but if they lose to the browns at\nHome and go to two and four figure season is pretty much you have to start looking forward to the draft oh yeah for\nSure it not only that so Mike Smith everybody says Mike Smith gotta go Mike Smith got to go just because Mike Smith is that bad and he's the problem doesn't mean that the answer is right behind him ... I haven't been hearing people clamoring for the line backers coach you know to be promoted I mean that's just the next man up soldier who think that that guy\nIs now going to fix our problems it it it seems a little silly to me\nCorrect and again James wasn't the problem yesterday but I also don't think he was the answer yesterday he played okay\nWe love the staff we look at the static every hundred Ninety five yards touchdowns looks perfect but it's it's those turnovers and when you're playing defense away the books are you just it's not fair gyms but you just can't turn the ball over and have a chance to win\nCorrect it and he is in the I don't remember the exact up but he's the upper end over the past few years of turnovers for quarterbacks period he hearing over the ball more than most quarterbacks in the NFL so it's not like\nPoof we're just imagining something that James did wrong because we don't like him there are things that he does that are not good and and I think to not acknowledge that right is a you know you're lying to yourself you're gonna see a very\nInteresting uh cross study on Sunday about where the buccaneers All right now I'm Alive who are you [noise]\n\nSay Hi hey hey you said you got to have you say you got a talent when you meet the other day yeah let me ask you something okay to a high note to a high note if you tell it that way high a high note alright yeah\nSo if I'm not talented you say I could do some high notes with Iraq\n[noise] really high note if you got me the other day right although you say you're ... yeah\nSo you want to hear high notes\nHow you know\nYour doors\nLike metal oh\nIn the game I was trying to get hot and just to get by just to get limited at the\nYou George\nGood from a disease in a hung up he didn't stop me that I'm a high note shows you ready [noise]\nI'm not yelling what selling like way like the oh yeah like well that's why you boil them what to do it while you're doing\nYou'd have to say Hi yo\nMa\nI like the opera like ten or like the ... to ... you know like a lot of the\nWell they can I just know\nThat that I Know anyone can do that anyway that I can do that too I can do that too well I can do that too okay well\nDo that too I I I Know\nHow to do this yeah it was last night dodge drab dog San\nPedro\n... de ... last night and the same thing I can you ...
