take by the way it goes I don't like Bob Dylan I don't you don't like Bob them I don't think he's a talent I don't think ... or ... or any other way to look at these young kids don't want to know what one video how can about trying to okay first I Will listen listen\nListen to Bob Bob Dylan Tom ... Bob Dylan gets into the rock and Roll Hall and they and they all look like a Rolling Stone alone\nWith Bob Dylan is probably one of them are like well okay listen you had to be at a unique voice it's not it's not for everyone I agree I I\nI I give you that am I going to tell you that Bob Dylan was one of the greatest singers ever uh no but neither was Frank Sinatra or the rights of doctors who was a vocal style is by far more than a saying okay uh you know when he kind of folk saying a lot of his songs as well a Bob Dylan\nJust just lyrical and what he did he wrote knocking on Heaven's Door man that's that's\nRaiders eulogy ever knocking on heaven's you're right you're right not not only have you read like a Rolling Stone but you write knocking on Heaven's Door he is a good writer I have an absolutely is it\nUh didn't he ... what what is it is it the the times they are changing he wrote that as well correct or am I ...
