wasn't built around James Winston for him to have as many tools as possible you've got my Kevin you've got to Sean Jackson you've now got God when you got OJ Howard you've got it all there in Ryan Fitzpatrick can show you what what the how how high power the officers can be\nLike James can't it it is right there I don't think that\nThe team is as bad as we think\nThey I think I think they are I think they played a lot of bad defenses this year and I think the buccaneers have a good authentic could be explosive but if you look back on some of the defense and they play\nThey play defense is during the bottom in passing\nAnd I just look I just don't think they have a lot of great players obviously quarterbacks a huge issue right now but look at the first draft picks the buccaneers had this year ... Jones those guys can't even get on the field that is a huge problem heart graves is out for the year I mean these have been draft picks when you don't know your draft picks it sets your franchise behind\nYou have to go out you have to overspending free agency and then you're picking of guys that are on the tail end of their career it's not going to lead you to a championship\nAnd when you look at draft picks it gets no more disappointing and I would say revolting then trading up to take a kicker who's not even with your team anymore how does that not cost you your job right there\nIn that decision I think is just call the paranormal collie what you will they will haunt us forever because our kicking game I don't think it'll ever recover\nNo we we are ... kicker and they say goes back to ... Bryant Wright Leno yeah absolutely but I mean and what a good do that is and he's still carving out a career for himself in Atlanta but man what\nAgainst the Cincinnati Bengals you spotted them thirty four points and and then your poll James finally when it's too late and all fits magic does is come in there and throw a bomb the Mike Evans and get that team on his back he's not the guy in the future he's thirty something years old and he's a\nCareer back up I Know it well\nThe reason that they would Seamus over fits magic is because of that shame is is the quarterback of the future but your future is going to be littered with off the field problems in turnovers that's what your future looks\nLike and shame on everybody who believed in it shame on everybody who champion this kid because he's not that good he's not a good guy and he's not a good quarterback so then what what are you rooting for now you can't get rid of it's too late\nSeventy seven five seven nine one or two five ... bucks or something else and how are you going to do grab alive how you doing man\nGot under what's good\nSo I definitely agree with that are set up and he just said that ah you spank are this past two years would you give them ... chances and as it was just do with a guy you know sure well I mean I think a lot of you but what do you know go ahead well not only as a not only as a player but also as a person\nSure yeah well that's what they should have been reverse order it should've been you should've been done with them as a person when he wouldn't learn from what happened to that says you engaged in bad things get what's your take on the on the decline of gyms wants to micro it's under\nWell I agree with you and all the accolades that he's ever had aids put them in a position to where people forget and forgive him forgive but at the end of the day all the hype created around him will even know if he's a pressure performer so then he gets in there could be as redemption song and look what happens\nCould have been he could've thrown\nThree touchdown passes yesterday and we would have continued to be forced to eat a bag of you know what\nHe is the worst kind of bad because he does put up monster numbers he right you know he was going to be through for over three hundred fifty yards last week he was\nHe probably could have thrown interceptions still hit that many yards this week and that's the problem is it gives people on the team people with in the front office to look and say well look what he did look at these numbers he's put up and it makes it that much worse than that much harder to try and get rid of this guy no question\nThink you're saying redemption sons\n... or so on Monday\nWell you're not into football we're not going to cover this all afternoon it's just in my opinion the biggest most glaring local story\nFits magic France and football he transcends sports he's bigger than all\nYou could have scripted it yesterday and he better as I said you guys and tax we visit [noise] retention of Brian Fitzpatrick who didn't want to be demoted he knows he's a career back up and he didn't want to be demoted so he said I get it it's James this team but I don't like it\nIt's crazy that the that the buccaneers were planning for the future by bringing Seamus back but yet it seems like they were planning to run for this year by saying there's no way they're training to Sean jak I absolutely no idea why they are going to hang on to ... they're not going anywhere the season to get rid of the guy get anything you can start to rebuild this team\nYesterday before the game they rumor that ah they float the rumor and\nTo ... I don't know that he's flooded out there they're saying that it might have been flooded by a team that wanted to trade for him or his agent or his agent so I er I don't know what happened there but I Do know\nThat you don't demand a trade and then an hour or two later you are talking intensely and positively to the backup quarterback on your team about how excited you are that he's back in the\nGame oh well I mean he was he was not quiet during the the fits magic era now he ... he went on ESPN and said\nHow could we take him out I think if he wants Ryan Fitzpatrick as his quarterback I don't think there's any if things or buts about it\nSeventy seven five seven and I want it to five the team had the opportunity to vote a captain's that that you voted on the team rice\nThe team didn't even vote Seamus Winston your your franchise quarterback one of the captains if that doesn't tell you ... cut her or you Jason light a that you've got a problem in your locker room and that problem is the perennial problem then you're running a horrible franchise you're doing a lousy job\nIt's crazy because when you talk about James the number one thing that's always attached to his name is how much of a leader he is and how he has those intangibles and how he's a winner and I now voting them captain ... ... ... people tried are trying to not make a big deal of it but I think it's a big deal\nRooted as when everybody's watching when everybody wants to see the team embrace him and say this is our leader they chose not to so I mean if that doesn't tell you everything you need to know and you can call reading into something that's not there but it it seems pretty clear his own team does not want him they're\nSeventy seven five seven nine one or two five and eight hundred seven seven want it to five what's up Scott welcome to grow out alive\nYeah ... ... ... ... they they have ... ... ... because if he gets hurt they're stuck\nWith it yeah that's right yeah look I guarantee you knowing the bucks like I Know the bugs and knowing dark cutter like I've been casually familiar with how he coaches football there is little doubt in my mind that James which will be named your starter for this Sunday scale against the Carolina Panthers\nRight now the phase of all the ... ...\n... no offense but you know be football franchises don't get to where they are because they listen to the fans\nIn the real issue that I see with at rates on James was shows up on the ... ... the team loses producers poorly I mean it is it's just even if he just dresses up he does he just does a rally\nTo forbid Jamieson pressing out than we tell them you're going to sit down and street clothes and watch Ryan yes Patrick or ... or\n... thank you should punish punish them and make them dress up as a captain fear for a whole game\nI think it will be one of two things I think if if James Winston is a buccaneer come next week then he starts but I think how do you not if they're there if there's somebody out there who would give something of note to the bucks why do you not just get rid of him and this is going to\nBe a circus for the rest of the year if it's been a magic place he's going to have its ups and downs of Winston slave he's going to have ups and downs we're gonna keep calling for your other guy this whole season it's just on track to be a total disaster the\nLast ... years but this by far seems to be the most UCSB and all the storylines that are happy valley I Love every minute of it\nSo since I was jokingly said something about this the other day what would the Tampa Bay buccaneers after pair along with James Winston to get ...\nBut nobody nobody's taking Jamie ... I I couldn't even entertain that no one's going to take James if you get rid of everything is done off the field which is a huge deal you have teams that won't sign capture nicotine but because of the stuff they bring up the field\nSo if you're just looking at what he does on the field what are you willing to give give up for this guy and how many teams actually need a quarterback may maybe Denver Denver just released their backup quarterback because he was trespassing like they're not going to tolerate any of that crap there\nAre the team you're lucky if you don't want to be like what interests which I\nThink there's one or two centers there are the teams out there like the giants are the jak who probably could use somebody now but if you say we're going to let James sit behind ... burger for three years or whatever and and hope that he can learn a thing or two maybe you know maybe it's not about having a quarterback this season but one for the future\nOf muscle and he said the same rent what is it the butler and everybody I like my\nDad beat a worse to be a dumpster fire\nOh I I Would much rather have the bad and very interesting and crazy than anything else that you couldn't ask for anything better when they put it fits yesterday I'm like are you doing it wasn't a part of you are you're thinking oh he's going to come out and he's going to turn it if it's tragic and it's going to get worse it\nI I didn't even know what to expect so yeah I was not mentally prepared to see that that psychotic celebration that we saw that we've seen in the past that just does something to your soul to get you fired up\nHe is all of us on the football field riot let us not lose Ryan fits magic and all this he is every single one of us celebrating exuberant late\nThat Philip brought his little brother on our mission into orbit\nNow I Can't believe how easy it wants to save hundreds of dollars on my car insurance for thank al\n... al ...

with me that during that Pittsburgh game where fitzpatrick was really struggling in the first half there was a story that came out where cutter said Ryan Griffin was very close to going in that game because he performed so well in practice so I don't think that that guy is viewed\nAs a bum just the guy they like him they like yeah so I mean I I don't know if he's the quarterback of the future but he's at least somebody in the\nDirt cutter thought about giving a chance during the regular season game or if they're caught her in the gym are here next year that it doesn't matter if he's you know

P. feel about it I I wanted a flooded you guys' first to see if we are on board and then uh and then the of Roger and Jay pure on board\nYeah we just have to pick somebody that we know and believe in right and somebody that that that that really bleeds drew Rob all live like we don't want to just put some known a loser out there to to with our name on the line when he somebody who is this true to us so we know will represent us properly\nCorrect who is that person I don't know about exist actually seven seven I Want us to five 'cause that's what I was thinking as you're saying that I'm like okay who would that be because we're coming down for the ... right\nYes my love is the lady read so much I don't want to make the thing I don't want I Want to fight for I've I I don't want her to fight it clearly you do yeah that\nThat was the biggest fan but I don't I don't I don't know if she uh she wants to get arrested for us and what what if it was a different competition dawn like like crushing things with your boobs like the my Celtic crush out to start to punch\nI I'm just spit balling ... into the punch out and you know what my Cal to want he doesn't want these little\nFood games do you want people getting you know I don't want to know who was gay but also the the what is it the fear of food either one I also think some uh I also think some ladies crushing things with their breath to get the show started as a way to get the crowd I it sounds like a back alley John sending thing that you knew behind Janice after the events over for sure I was just trying to\nFind a way to get Britain Bob without having to fight ...\nWhat about a year your lap what about MCI guy\nThat's yeah I I don't know if he's going to fight I don't know if he would fight either but he looks like he could kick some ass like I wouldn't vitamins yeah no I Would not fight them either he's he's not exactly the most reliable dude in the world yeah he's got that pass go strength you don't wanna mess with a\nSeventy seven five seven and I want to do five and eight hundred seven seven to five what's up Andrew\nWill take a lot of psychology\nTo Angela it's interesting a lot of al hey how are you or would you consider fighting for the ... yeah well\nSee that I mean that would be quite to swerve if we if we championed Angela if he volunteered as tribute\nThe the the the history between us 'cause that's what I just rock rocky marsh Yan or one of the greatest prize fighters in history work was\nReally kind of fun to be honest with you\nI mean I I for entertainment value if I'm a listener I hear Angela is going to fight on behalf of drew Rob\nAlly but you have to prove orange yellow dry oh probably the hardest part here my hair around\nYour you'd have a lot to talk about it afterwards I can\nTell you that how about this um I got I got an angle here All right it's alive squirrel on a pole match Roger injury he's guy [laughter] he breaks attack I'm In front of everybody\nBut eventually gets there first and the squirrels relief yeah yeah yeah and he gives an Eskimo cases are\nAll in all seriousness I guess I could be a pretty it's a\nYou know what it's better than any idea of I've heard so far which means is the first idea I've heard so a lot when I'm off year All right hold on one second I mean if you don't think we already have your number you've underestimate our security but hold on hold on one second hold on\nAnd I could get his number I Will say this is just a just cause I'm being open with my thoughts he's made his choice ... drawing the line in the sand I hear him on Roger and J. P. regularly\nSo what are you saying well I'm sure you might throw the fight and I'm just saying I I think if you had to rank his shows on the bone it would be ... live in a and you know a point five would be so are we still a for a boy and how can\nThere be a voice [laughter]\nHe fired up about fits magic is you know letters numbers earlier today and they are really you know what I meant and that's all that matters I mean John had a rough week and I don't even want to tell you what I found in his car today\nGo on in my car that hooker\nWhy to drop that thing off in your car for you because you've forgotten the office on and what isn't there a good friend to receive not trust I received from John from yesterday and I found it fascinating because it's fifty dollars a puddle oh my God are you and I just [laughter]\nYou got to two things have chocolate milk [laughter]\n[laughter] but do not have Coca Cola shifts [laughter] chicken trauma sticks [laughter] sorry I'm ...

got a little too I wasn't beeps did you know that well it said or someone who looks a lot like beams in the fine print\nI I got to tell you that uh the video be breaking down how they got that is is really kind of terrifying when you realize how easy it is to manipulate the media yes I mean that could have been you could do that was something very serious you know you can do it so that was something political shirt and it would have worked just as easily if not even even more you\nKnow it has Seventy seven five seven nine one or two five what's up Mike\nI I agree it's okay\nFor businesses to ... ... ... a project they don't agree with it right but I'm going to do the slippery slope right oh no it it becomes an issue where the government then\nThe question is who decides what is hate speech right yeah if the people in power say that if you disagree with me at a speech so that's where the the thing has the end of the private business can invest their money and whatever they choose sure\nBut I don't think the government has a right to squash a platform because they disagree with the statements of it\nWere on the same page there that they know it makes perfect sense and we're on the same page at least you and I are because it's a I don't trust anyone to tell me what hate speech is I don't trust the government to did decide\nWell this is hate speech because you said gay and you and you mentioned in a derogatory way when you just said you know oh erasers music is so gay why it's not that's not hate speech necessarily\nJust means you'd probably could use a better word to describe their music\nSeventy seven five seven nine one or two five that said\nIf you're hosting a platform\nWhere extremists either on the left or the right or advocating violence against the targeted group of individuals I think we all agree that that doesn't help anyone so if you're inciting violence\nAnd you encourage hey go ... Republican senator or go shoot a Jew or anything like that you your free speech patterns where my personal safety is compromise\nRight does that make sense oh yeah like it's like saying that the Jews are the enemy of the world you can think that\nBut but to say they must be eliminated well then I think you've crossed the line into an insight to the violence and if you look at someone else's Joan rose is false has he ever encouraged violence I don't know I have you ever said there should be violent revolution I'm\nSure that somebody would tell you that he has I mean not not that I Know of personally I mean I look at it for what that is to me that that is entertainment or he's playing a character although it's crazy um you know I I don't I don't take much of what he\nSays seriously Seventy seven five seven nine one or two five yeah\nThe thing about were questioning the platform today and it's obviously when they push so many people away from other platforms they had to go somewhere\nBut that guy could have just as easily thrived or been posting those terrible things on any media platforms nerve the the media platform is not going to create psychopathic hateful people it's just going to give them\nA place to to spew their message that they already\nHave it you know if he's on Facebook's during that may be more people are going wow this this this we need to alert somebody but it's not on here maybe we'll go yeah so we feel too\nI get that but how many times has there been something terrible and then you say oh we looked at a social media page and the signs were all there yeah it was the pictures of his guns in saying that he wants to kill whoever it may be for for months now so\nNow you're right but then a lot of people just like take a picture of their guns so then where do you go oh this person's going to act on it I mean you look at somebody\nOnly what the capture of with the caption eliminate the Jews I think that's when we started looking into the diving on even if\nYou don't have guns if you if you encourage V. elimination of a certain race we should look into you any race white Jewish which is a race and religion Hispanic any we ought to look into you if you're encouraging you raised to be eliminated raw and the same page there except for people who would advocate for the elimination of race Geoff what's up\nHey what's going on and on one thing I I agree with you or the last statement you made about when it because\nOf the statements are getting certain people and\nI said that he's going in that should've been a red light got ill should have been addressed and on some of these other social media sites where people oh stuff like that\nThey banned or they get what I used the jail or you know stuff like that but um I feel like it's okay for them to do what they're doing it because it's almost like they're condoning what people are doing it with a speech and the targeting of certain races or something like that\nI see what

a real thing\nSons really there's I think there's more words coming here to serve us\nOn it I don't know if we want to revisit it we we touched on I briefly the other day or if you've visited the hamburger marries a that is it the border between October force in October twenty if uh you should go get tested for hepatitis a because I'm somebody who works there tested positive so I I\nI Would probably not go back there probably kills the you know the vibe survives\nDo you think this play survives because when you when you're down in ... you know it's not an option and you want to murder right I'm going to go in there you're not gonna remember the story\nNo you'll think oh hamburger marriage there is a fun flamboyant play to play a place to play a drag queen bingo and uh get a little high pay\nReally territories there two weeks ago oh well now and it's actually transmitted ... too so yeah she probably ate the food and some either so [laughter] she's probably I saw her by the way on a joke I see oh my God\nI Know well she's got to go get tested\nYeah yeah ... yeah yeah yeah I mean I'm Talking about hepatitis on the show no no we're talking about many things hepatitis not one of them and tell them they might as well just test for everything while she's there to be safe so how did this how who had hepatitis was at a server wasn't somebody who prepared food I take it was either a server somebody prepared food oh All right I mean I don't want to be wrong right\nIf this doesn't specify whether it was just as an employee I mean but honestly yeah I think I I mean if you're a server your hands are on the plate if you're working in the kitchen you're actually touching the food so I think you've got a fair amount of a possible contamination of or their ... the company they gave us some of the greats\nThe double ... oh yeah the mega stuff Oreo yeah ladies and gentlemen coming in twenty Nineteen the most stuff\nOreo featuring almost double the feeling of a mega stuff Oreo you\nInterested I Love the feeling of it or you know I Know it's just like sweet and animal fat but I but I Love it you know what's crazy about or is is that there are there Regan oh that was not able sat at all\nYeah no that creamy goodness that you would think has ... yeah it it's good um they they have been stepping out of the box over the past couple of years in one of the things that people want is more stuffing city most stuff Oreo twenty Nineteen\nHave they gone to the point where they're just selling the cream from the middle of the Orioles are they are they getting there\nI once saw package where it was like it had a little spot kind of like a dump grew where it was like the spot for the filling and then it had just the the cookie separately so you could add your own filling to your Oreo no she's maybe one\nIs that the problem is with the stuff is that it's too much to dip it in a dip in the milk yeah doesn't soak up properly right got more stuffing\nBecause the way for is the part that that soaks in the milk\nI don't know what it is but I feel like it's either humidity or air temperature or air composition because sometimes have you here I feel like you can get a perfect soak on a on an Oreo but other times you can let it sit in your milk for like twenty minutes and it's still won't break down\nYeah twenty minutes it's going to be a goofy mass usually did you consider getting Orioles yesterday with your your trip the public's where you get a cookie dough and the donor or\nI'm a man I Will tell you I was there for an embarrassing amount of time\nI spend a lot of time in the cookie Iowa I spend a lot of time and the candy aisle yeah and uh I just felt like the hostess donuts are paired with chocolate milk and um my cookie dough which was not to make cookies it was the type of cooking do you can eat with a spoon oh yeah so you know I just I think\nWas right Mm I um I bought three bags of Halloween candy yesterday this is the earliest I've ever bought it and I bought stuff that I like I'm Wondering how many cars publics as by to get one\nOn ah Hershey miniatures right now uh there's not going to be a single

country and public one number one overrated will now\nBe put together a new top ten list this is something that I Know ... it's very very passionate about and I think there'll be some debate to be had the top ten chicken tenders in the country who is the best chicken tenders in the country ...\n... I Will tell you surprisingly ... and I know that they could have put those places because the public's on their on their ... I'll tell you\nWhere they ranked number ten Carl's junior can number nine Jack in the box ... number eight KFC Okay Number seven Dairy Queen do any of these jumping out\nTo yeah so I have not been to any of these places that chicken tenders\nNumber six McDonald's ... good I'm trying to be more of a chicken tender guy he's like I feel like I'm really not black guy but he ... number five\nArby's chicken tenders\nOr already what they had a ...

I Would probably say PT cues the best chicken tenders but Popeye's was uh was rated number one\nCan I give you a food story that are absolutely blows me away I saw a gallon to read about this today\nReceived as a vending machine [laughter] have you seen this you know yes this is this is insane\nNinety percent of Americans said that they have traded or wish they have ... you could have traded their unwanted candy for Halloween\nSo receives is setting up vending machines that's a candy exchange you put in your non received candy and it gives you reach these peanut butter or are these machines there are going to be a few of them um one is in New York City will be on Fifth Avenue between Washington Square north and east eighth street between foreign nine PM\nAnd between Terry town New York in Manhattan and they're going to exchange up to ten thousand cuts oh\nGood lord ... so it is it is for your Halloween candy right right because I mean most times of year how are you getting candy but you do want unless you bought it no\nHalloween so you take your unwanted Halloween ... and then who\nI didn't know the move was to buy candy that you don't like I feel whenever we by how we can go oh we love they're so we want the kids to have it but then you have to buy stuff you hate that we don't eat it I\nThat's what I Do every year I buy the crap that I Would meet but this year I bought her she stuff and we'll see how that works out of this is this is in trouble for me me too so we're going to come back and we'll or ... stuff that's such a wonderful angle on this James Winston story\nAnd if you know someone in the bay who is absolutely horrible at their job you don't need to mention them but like orange you yeah if you think your horrible at your job or you want to call someone out either in your office or out who is absolutely the worst that their job\nWill give you some tickets to go check out kiss the show just announced today their farewell tour at an early next

seeing\nIn the bay area is worse at his or her job than James Winston obviously he is the most high profile sucks at his job example that we could use today because look\nThere's no sense of gloating right now but it sure is fine we were right and you all wrong\nAnd it's crazy that you can't find one person to still defend this guy\nEven those who are the most vocal passionate and misguided supporters of James Winston have grown silence silent because there is no supporting what you saw yesterday\nBecause fans hate interceptions more the sexual abuse allegations\nThey can stand up for this guy through allegations\nInvestigations suspensions didn't prove anything and say that\nThis doesn't matter because it happened years ago we used the quarterback of the future blah blah blah blah\nI got a question and this is some out there will call this a reach\nIs there any correlation between being able to watch a quarterback make some of the most blatant obvious terrible mistakes on the field\nTo then say if he can do things so blatantly bad and bone headed on the field how could he not be making decisions like that in his own life is that too far for each I don't think so because I mean when you look at his ... he\nMakes it look worse than anybody I've ever seen I mean the interception is an interception right when he does it a lot of the time when you look at the one that got a bench\nYou have to ask yourself what the hell did you have a stroke like what is going on in your head you any it what is wrong with your brain if you\nCould throw three interceptions yesterday and then throw that past that he threw on the force 'em there's something wrong with your brain there is something wrong with your brain\nOr friend Whitney who represent Campbell which had a tweet yesterday I've never seen a good player with bad judgment\nOoh damn yes you're on the heart and I love that good Seventy seven five seven nine to five and eight hundred seven seven why would you five if you want to nominate somebody in the bay area please no last names that you think is worse at his or her job\nThen James Winston we'd love to hear about it and if you got somebody good then um we'll get we'll give you something our prize stash\nYou want to relive a some of the highlights from yesterday I got a little something real you went to college I Want to relive the the ... the glory moment yeah please\nDon't receive retirement running back for me was when\nAll the feeling [laughter]\n[noise]\n[laughter]\nThat's our due to this this this was the best and this is the one that uh that ended it all for doing this [noise]\nGot to get rid of [laughter]\n\nAwful so that was the only got about or you or me ask you a question drew up you're not offended are you more of a box fan or a genius hater yup\nI'm both of those\nIs that this Haiti James so much and seeing a bonus patients they did that fuel your fan W figure becoming a better buccaneers fan because you're getting what you want for the team\nPut it this way I Would have been thrilled had the buccaneers one yesterday\nI'm okay with them losing yesterday because James Wednesday was finally exposed as the sham as the over rated as the lack of a leader that he is that's the satisfaction that I've found Ryan Fitzpatrick came into that game and the third quarter which is way too late\nAnd he ... the box victory hopes they still lost because the buck suck on defense\nBut I Am I Am validated by what we saw yesterday with James's for interceptions\nWhat what what do you think for the rest of the season with its Patrick because what I'm thinking as it looks like the team's falling apart right that there had switching quarterback right Kwame Alexander search here on the coins heard road Joe's hurt the injuries are piling up that would be to bay is hurt it doesn't seem like it's going to get any better it well what do you think's gonna happen\nHonestly fifty starts this game\nWe still lose to a better Carolina team and James Winston starts the following week with one more chance\nTo play himself either onto this roster or someone else's roster he's young enough to where we need to showcase him at least one more time to see how it responds after being bench for a week 'cause you gotta think he wasn't benched for weeks went through three\nHe had the service suspension week for which I Believe was the bears game\nHe wasn't necessarily benched it's just that ride fitzpatrick was named to start this time he was patched and bench part\nTo me we can put all the off the field Amy on the field things together as far as things that he's done wrong for the team in for the city and however you want to look at it when he came back from that suspension there were no more second chances third chances are fourth chances you were on a short lease\nLeash you had your last chance coming in here to me it was\nTake this team somewhere it'd be a leader it'd be a quarterback or you're done and I do not think we ever see I've said it before but I truly believe we never see James Winston again with the ... oh I think you see him in the next few weeks I think you start talking smack in my heart I don't think he makes it so next weekend I don't think he's a buccaneer by next Sunday\nWho do for what's up well going to do go out alive\nOr are there is nothing will stand around again but you know the bucks a bit of mess for a really long time and I always wanted to do well I don't like the early ... but I'm just happy to\nGet the ball and I always have a really good looking toward that way it was the best but as you guys said he couldn't really what kind of like the ...\nAll right Seventy seven five seven nine to five it's nice to have the boats going to the game tomorrow\nTough on
