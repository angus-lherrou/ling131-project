there and was drinking crown royal at six o'clock in the morning I'm playing songs I tell you those are some of the best times I've had on my radio career with a short amount of time to us about what you guys\nWell we had a lot of fun you know and and I'm actually a in Tampa a today I'm I'm you know where I'm at literally right this second I'm In the back seat of a car about to pull into MacDill yeah and um we're doing we're doing a big bottle shining today\nA on redneck Riviera whiskey which has money which gets out and then um and then later on did they go into Gaspar ... the big cafe you know that big\nSuggest bars in temple terrace from three to five today and go me John and he'll sign bottles redneck Riviera whiskey which I Can't believe we don't have a case of yet here in the in the studio it's okay I which\nI can fix that problem I Know I can fix that problem rapidly do you know I you know if you John reaches\nThe shortest guy to ever threatened me and [laughter] last time he was here you played some you were in town for something and John Will get on stage and kill it and he goes [noise] gimme your God damn how do you love your message you give me your guide to manners I'm a GPS into my tour bus right up in your neighborhood the guy was like no don't\nYou make me scared a good way\nMan you have quite the memory and it's it's it's astonishing I'll have to call you when I write the book\nYeah you should I mean I I got a lot of good details on things are what are you a are you in ... filmmaking music together are you doing separate or what are you doing\nNano big enrichment we've we put out a string of hits over the last three or four years it's been an incredible and uh this year we're going to be close to a hundred concerts\nAnd um you know this redneck Riviera whiskey that I've got out um it it's the reason I'm I'm going to a lot of military bases\nIs because every bottle that shell of it which I own the brand I don't endorse it our own it right I give ... give ten percent which we call that tied right you're tied up on every dollar goes to a organization called the folds of honor and soldiers of honor is a group that pays for the college scholarships for kids\nWho lost a parent and combat and listen to this we we ship so much whiskey the first quarter of this year that I'm actually presenting the first time to check a twofold give honor this we actually Monday morning I live on Fox and friends\nTo folds of honor in Tulsa that covers six college grants while I'm our first quarter alone\nWow that is from\nUm yeah she'll come into the deal you know on a weekend like this when we're remembering are following in our heroes and you know the men and women who fought to keep our country free\nIt's a big deal that's why I came down here and that gas bars like you said the general public can come over and and check it out you talked about crown royal earlier that was my dream man you know from day one crown royal that's what I drank a Canadian blended\nAnd I started wondering well where's the American blended is there an American blended you know and nobody really had anything called American blended whiskey\nSo I spent all twenty Seventeen working on this blend of American whiskey\nAnd finally got it to that sweet spot and put it out and let me tell you something man it's pretty astonishing uh the results that we're getting so far we're in Seventeen states which sixteen more open up the next six to ...\nLet me tell you about John John knows about whiskey okay this is a guy who spent time drinking and if you've got something now that he feels is where it needs to be you know that it's good All right and the other thing is that when you retrieve the level of success\nBegin richer I have a lot of hits and they've done really well but John's written a bunch of smash songs for other artists so he's really free and rich and for him to do give money back and I mean it is especially in this time where people will know whether the sitter standard salute or like the president or\nWhat you need to do is reach inside and realize how lucky your life has been and what can you do to give back and for you to do this redneck Riviera and how about these uh fold Tamara guys I I Do think that as a wonderful thing and that's really what more people should do when they have success\nSupporting our military is not political no okay it's just not it's not left center or right they are the reason we get to have a less center in Iraq or whatever you want to be so ...\nWhen it comes to a brand like written that were the euro and given ten percent back I don't get back\nPennies on it I got back ten percent yeah I mean it's a child that goes back people ask me all the time how do I find a store\nThat's got your whiskey at it because there's a lotta I'm sure people listening right now that are going to want or I signed it or you go to a redneck Riviera dot com and there's a store located are you click on it but she was it didn't hit enter and you'll see there are so many stories I think Florida actually right now is the number one state in sales for redneck\nRiviera was making is just incredible what's going on down here\nYeah oh look I'm going to continue to spread the word on this because uh I I look I said I Know you know good whiskey but I also\nThink it's great that you take the time to give back I mean there's a guy who's made enough money where he could just go by an island somewhere and be like I'm a child here and forget about everybody out there but there you are a ... you still got any a relationship with the president since the ... parents\nYou know I don't I don't I don't speak to in daily or anything but I have spoken to him a couple of times and\nIt's it's I never thought when I was on Celebrity Apprentice I was sitting across from the future president I don't think he thought that either\nBut I Do I Do but you know either I I Love them I saw him on TV last night I turn I was in my grandmother I go can you believe he's from ...\nYou know but here's my goal I put it in my request that Mr President a ...
