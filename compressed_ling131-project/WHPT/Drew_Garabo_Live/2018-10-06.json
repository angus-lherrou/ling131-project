tap\nAnd so they took a half a meal it's off your property tax bill you know and they basically transferred at the money that we would have gotten locally that's about thirty five million dollars for our capital budget they transferred that to the operating budget up in Tallahassee to be able to take care of that shortfall in\nThe issue as we've never gotten that have no back you know local school districts that happened in when two thousand about seven thousand eight two thousand I okay or not and so we've we've lost out of our budget over the last\nEight or nine years about four hundred and seven million dollars that would have been used to tackle maintenance and and growth in in\nThe legislature you can't control that when you don't get those dollars correct because a lot of people would say that hey I've looked at the average house that might have been a four hundred thousand dollar house went down to being a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollar house\nOr during the recession and oh wait no nine and now it's back up to say a three hundred fifty thousand dollar house so maybe we're not back to two thousand five to two thousand seven a real estate values but at the same time it's gone up so much they be thinking well you should have more money than you then you had before that's\nExactly what people think but here's what the challenge has been for school districts across the state of Florida is as growth has occurred as the economy has grown as property values have increased the millage rates that the legislature dictates to the school boards to levy on our local property taxes have been rolled back\nAnd so we can't take advantage of that growth and so we don't get those additional dollars that property owners might think we're getting because if you looked at your tax bills last three years if you compare him your tax your millage rates for schools have gone down each year as the property values have gone up so we haven't been able to take care of that um\nThe justification by the legislature they're just taking those dollars elsewhere and you just have no say I mean ... how do you respond as the superintendent of schools I mean that's that's gotta be killing young\nVery frustrating we've been trying to send that message very clear the last few years I think there's a anytime it you know it's interesting even though millage rates may go down a little bit and rolled back if you generate more money out of the total tax role\nState of Florida considers that a tax increase and I think folks just didn't want that label you know that I gave it to increase even though you're millage rates are dropping and so that's been a struggle that's why we are having a shortfall and our capital budget a pass go\nA manatee Sarasota poke

not the way that they sell it\nAround not at all and I think you know the fact that you can't find a single school day with what your what your oven is a tough yeah\nAnd so that that's the question I probably get the most out there it was about the lottery about the lottery because they you know I really do believe are citizens still believe those dollars come to us and we can do some of these things that were sometimes struggling with in our in our annual budget but it's it's not even dollars that we really see they they pass through us they come to that go to other\nUm legislative mandates and that's kind of how the lottery spent in two thousand Eighteen\nTo get a question for Jeff now she can't ... to a call and talk to him he's your Hillsborough County\nA school district superintendent Jeff akin to call us at eight hundred seven seven one one or two five or seven to seven five seven nine one oh two five if you'd have a question and you know this military and a lot of people aren't even familiar with the term millage right that's the percentage and I'll Try to articulate incorrect me the percentage of\nAh that that's a calculation of where your tax dollars go is that correct and and so that ... has actually dropped\nA as as the economy has improved the legislature just taking that money away so you're still you're not even back to the ... pre recession rhetoric\nAnd so if the legislature would have just kept them illustrates the saying like you right when we buy something more expensive we know we're going to probably pay more in taxes when we buy something more expensive it's right there therefore when value increases you know the taxes are going to increase\nThe the way that the the um millage rates are that are for school boards and we have to we have to be what the legislature dictates the school board's loving and so each year as a property values have increased not post recession the military have been dropping\nA the legislature has dropped as millage right so we can't even take advantage of that growth it would have meant to public education in the state of Florida hundreds of millions of more dollars that could have come to school districts to be able to to do many of the things that we sometimes you know or have been talking about for years we need to do in our classrooms have better I'm\nA workforce for the classrooms technologies in the hands of our students we'd have been able to do so much more but we haven't been able\nTo hold on the curtain back that's the that's the back story that's what people don't here and and sometimes don't get a chance to hear let's go to Joe Joe has a question uh Joe welcome to the cat and emotional\nOh hey how's it going guys uh yeah as a you know just try to encourage citizen out there that was\nKind of curious about like what does it cost her child just send you a child to school at public school like average overall\nThat's great you know yeah that's a great question so there is a bass student allocation that's how the state of alert so the sales tax revenue and your property taxes\nAre on your on your tax bill but say it that says um schools to state so there's a section on your tax bill a property tax bill that that money goes to the state levels they collect sales tax revenue to state level\nThose are the dollars that they put together for the state's education budget and then what they do they allocate it back to school to school district in a PR people allocation the bass student allocation is the most flexible funding we get that's a per student and it's a little over forty two hundred dollars per child\nThen what the state does it it adds on those those strings are those categorical as those those funds that says what are you a hundred in a school year her per child wow and and just say you know we are right now in the state of Florida four thousand dollars below the national average for per pupil funding\nAnd so um I don't want to be I don't like to say I want to be average it anything I Want to be great at a lot of her and um but that's one thing if we could just get the average in the state of Florida and we would be a placing a high priority on education millions of millions of dollars\nUm in order to enhance you know the education outcomes across the state of Florida\nBut it's just remarkable you know there's always another

ten kids are not\nProjected to go on to a four year college a path\n... we have decided and planes city just said that's okay you know there's ...\nPlenty of opportunity there's plenty of jobs that you can get right here in Plant City ah eastern Hillsborough County in central Florida in general uh that can lead you to a successful career\nAnd you know I gotta say Steve you have been such a great asset to planes and you've also done such such great things but the career academy and others let's get which I'll get to know a little bit\nUh but my about talk about six figure salaries are at a dealership there's plenty of them are there are ... and you know there's there's great there's great people who work there and she's been a great supporter and occur catty really what that is\nIs a it started at actually Plant City high school they they built a business advisory board where major employers in Plant City faculty staff elected officials came together and said hey\nHere's the issue of or the potential perceived as she made out of ten kids are going off to college how we turn that around\nUs so we put some you know get heads together and we we formed a new career academy or and and what that is doing is connecting these kids\nWith major employers in the area and educating them well not only what the opportunities are after graduation what the pathway is to get those jobs and how to remain in those don't try to be successful\nOr a lot of those things are what Steve alluded to it's not necessarily a you know your your credentials or what sort of switched certification you habits can you show up to work on time can you put on there are a lot of job application hit you shake a person and and look them in the eye and tell them you're gonna you're\nGoing to do a good job or that their facilities so you know that's what we're doing we've ah we've hosted several um field trips where we've taken hundreds of students do multiple major employers all over a plane said he just to show them hey here's what companies run your own backyard you might not even know about these kids are just blown away their minds are just a\nJust expand on what the opportunities are and and and Jeff at at the school board has been such a\nA vital partner in that um I I think you guys are often\nProbably unfairly um you know your goals are a little bit different than right\nI Want to get you have comments on the Ed Ed is holding I'd like you had if you can hold on for a little bit I'd like to well we have Jeff to to be able to comment on what his thoughts are on this topic\nWell first of all the workforce has changed it has changed as well you know and we have to adapt to where the workforce needs are right now and so when I came in as superintendent and I saw a graduation rate that was too low\nAnd we said wait a minute we have to we have to give kids hope we have to figure out for them to get through high school they have to see what's past high school for them\nSo I have an amazing workforce connections officer Scott Brooks who his team went out and did a whole skills gap analysis across this community and said where are the words the where's the workforce I'm going and how can we better kind of program our high schools differently and then we also oversee for technical colleges in Hillsborough County\nUm how can we partner with our local trade unions how can we do all these things that ... that feed the workforce that help the students that are in ninth tenth eleventh\nGrade start to see what's pass high school for them\nAnd it's worked I mean because now our kids are engaged in programs in high school and we we've tripled our industry certifications that kids are earning now in high school or just over the last three years\nWe've grown our apprenticeship programs with our trade unions to be able to to put people to work and by the way this referendum going to put a lot of people to work two of the other things you will have to understand a lot of this work that's going to be demanded out there\nWith a happening sales tax that means we're going to need that type of workforce out there or we won't be able to get to work done\nAnd radio are with that kind of hope for our kids the graduation rates increased ten percentage points in just three years because our kids are seeing passed\nAt that high school graduation stage and more into that opportunity which may not be college it maybe it may definitely be some sort of a technical college or it may be right into the workforce in their local community and we want him to stay and just like Jake said\nWe have great jobs right here you know why not do everything we can to recruit them to stay right here in this region\nI think it's important and I know that we have hired some since we started the career academy we've hired some some students\n... and I know some of the other local uh ... Jake mentioned some of the of the local companies that have had the kids come and tore the different businesses because what we've learned is not only did the students not know what the opportunities are right in our community and your ... what did you Plant City we're not even\nThe gold Tampa were just Plant City the opportunities are out there there are tremendous opportunities and not only did the students not know about it the parent's right to write a parents often times are not even aware of what the opportunities are locally threat\nWe have some we have some major employers for some nationally known brands we have dark container that own solo cup everybody knows what a red cello cup is that's that's an ... nationwide brand yet\nThey're they're they're out of Plant City for a hearty manufacturing makes hardy played you know that's that's a product that's sold all over the United states it's it's it's from Plant City and\nUh you know when one of the largest Chevrolet dealership in the country you know right in Plant City so we have a lot of different uh companies just in Plant City are\nNot even talking about all the great companies in Tampa and all the businesses and opportunities within our entire county so there's tremendous opportunity and obviously as far as the lifestyle I mean this is a place where you know people want to live and work\nWe've got great kids in Hillsborough County public schools ... amazing students and so we don't want them to go anywhere we know stay right here and we know we have\nTechnical colleges we have four way pathways we have apprenticeship programs we have right into the workforce and we ate so we have all the options now that we've mapped out for students\nAnd that's why I truly believe we partner together\nUm with uh the ISI when we've been partnering together with our trade unions that's when we've seen our graduation rates take an uptick because our kids are seeing that there's there's hope for them pass other than just going on to a four year college and and if they think that's the only pathway they'll give up early if they feel like that they're not going to get the grades to try it in a in that kind of\nBig your graduation rate can you can you talk to point cities a graduation rate yeah well I I\nThink the mayor over their heads I really love the ... the fact that every plan for the high school has higher than Ninety percent graduation rate and I've had to ask that is awesome where we're going as a school district or we're getting closer and closer every year to having a Ninety percent graduation rate for a school district the plant city is beating us to the\nPunch the oil and the people tease him in a joke about Plant City being out in the country in rural and that kind of

... get then hand but I Can't make an appointment history locations\nThere's a new one in Brandon there's one in Tampa and then there's one right over here and Margot St Petersburg\nYou know they're going to be a lot of people don't want to go to school because that's just something they feel that they would like to do and that's great I don't discourage anybody from wanting to get further education a lot of a lot of a more mature adults like to go back and get that college degree because it's something personal attendant that's outstanding that's wonderful there's nothing wrong with that\nBut when you hear a statistic at in in\nAnd Jake and I are in those meetings or for for a career academy talking about how eight out of ten students to graduate from plants the high school and these are good smart kids are not going to have a four year degree but yet are we talking about the college ... college take tests take tests\nOr get your SAT's go to college or take these test they all they talk about\nAnd then when all of a sudden they're not planning on going to college how do you think that makes that college students feel\nI mean you're you're you're a little closer to not not being removed from a teeny identify with ... out is talking\nAbout I was going to say because I feel like my parents weren't really educated on college in the future for us going up at least just sports sports sports and sure somebody would have had us up and get a scholarship for sports but if I wasn't into what that school offered\nThen I wouldn't accept a scholarship and then before you know I'm graduating and I have to know what I'm doing with my life and I didn't know where it's going to go when I was going to do I ended up going to school for like fashion merchandising when it says you know debt right that that's what I Want to do because I felt the\nPressure to hurry up and go to college right and then I kept telling myself but I don't want to go to just you know look at just a regular community college because what is that for like I'm just I was confused as to what I wanted to do and even now I mean thank God I changed my mind when schools audio production and I'm here today\nAnd there's that but I Will say that I was confusing cell where my parents we didn't know what we are doing\nSo you've got a lot of opportunities got work ethic you guys could enter personal people skills\nAnd so those are the things that that uh yeah ... and we we can't train those kind of thing so you got all kinds of opportunity based on whatever it is that you got to do and\nYou know and we we got to tell we gotta teach ... we had to teach these parents and teach the kids that it's okay to work with their hands a lot of kids like working with their hands I like working with my hands I re but my first engine before I was out of high school because I had a dad that show me how to do that kinda stuff and how to how to work on cars but [noise]\nUh what are your thoughts on how we can change that perception that about about people working with the hand\nWell a ... which I you know the manufacturing days one avenue I'm\nYou know I think a lot of people know what auto mechanics do welders a cause you know address was stuff like that some some trays or you know I I don't think anybody knows what a machinist or the ... I got she got the question a mechanic so right on even though that they need to be made\nAnd this whole country was actually built on the skilled trades the middle class my father and my grandfather they built a country you know all the all those builders\nAnd then you pass always want you to do about us so they wonder if it pays the colleges the next step up right but you can of everybody in college and now I ... ... people go to college 'cause they don't really know what to do may end up and let us know Jerry Lewis and get her\nGraduate or the other but a lot of debt drop out uh end up at Starbucks back at home again living there until their mid twenties you know it's still know\nDelay I tell you ... you weren't a plant or a yummy [laughter] we plan to add call in and he's all over the age like Jake we not talk about this exact same thing it's been dead horse but if I didn't I just saw a recent\nArticle that was talking about oh a lot of uh people my age now did you begin into their retirement to help their kids up staying at home ... cell phone bills and they're the payments and you know\nSo yeah I you know until I was twenty eight and that was a lot of it was a hiring the problem here the problem I was because\nI was on and so much you know college school debt that I wanted to feel like I could catch up I Can't even get my\nFeet high anti alive as an as a car dealer if you talk to our our people that the sales people in the finance people we see it every day people come in good people that have sixty eighty a hundred thousand dollars in student loans they're making a\nVery very low wage they're just trying to put two and two together they're just trying to pay their bills are trying to buy a car for transportation not trying to buy over there ...\nAnd here they are saddled with all this debt and they don't have much income and often times the\nThe the school they went to and we see the job application you know the school they went to and what they study has nothing to do with what they're doing right now just to make ends meet yeah that's just one rushed rating and I'm not telling you once in a while yeah you're you're what twenty eight and thirty now you're thirty now yeah\nSo you are pretty much moved out at the age twenty eight because of the student that year exactly what we are tired mountain in the mindset Scott a change because there is opportunities like ed said and\nYou know shaking are talking about there's opportunity out there it's just we've got to make these these students aware of it so they don't waste their time kind of floundering right or during their twenties heading your mind and I frequently listed on\nWestern that focus or that you pick on those points like take the training wheels up you've got to grow up was let's go to the house and get a job than\nJust you know those are the kind of things that should a strike home it's everybody's house so\nThey do and hey thanks so much for calling we appreciate your making time for us today really really a great point to that you made and I say Jake was he not all over ah those points that's unbelievable like it's like you plan for him to calm [laughter]\nThey eat you know it it it's just remarkable that we you know it it's like we're missing it it it's it's it's so counterintuitive the way things are working right now\nHow we have eight out of ten students there and I know I Know maybe the statistics changed for some of the other Hillsborough County in ... the entire bay area schools but I bet you it's six or seven out of ten nine eight out of ten it's\nJust over twenty percent usually have a four year degree and it's you know that's going up because everyone's hold that that's what you have to do and there and get to your for and that's great\nFor some kids but why why make the other sixty eighty percent of the kids feel bad about\nYeah I've been working on transportation issues for quite a few years now I started at metropolitan ministries and with families who were living there and mostly single moms that we're finding work fairly easily they were able and hardworking people and the barrier\nFor them with how do they get their how can they get to the job once they get it and and that really kind of drove home for me the fact that Transportation's really as a quality of life issue and um Hillsborough County he's not getting enough to make sure that the people who live there and work there had to solutions they need to get where they got to go\nThat makes sense but definitely makes sense um we have a gosh we have a lot of things you want to get into I don't want to get too far because we're we're we're over for the break last time so we'll take a break here and just a little bit but you\nTalked about the uh the general parameters of of the uh of the referendum Tyler in in Thirty years why Thirty years for for the once in a tax\nWhile we're more than Thirty years overdue for this type of investments their reason that our transportation system is as bad as it is and as many different ways as it is because for decades we have under invested in transportation here in Hillsborough County\nAre per capita transportation spending about the same as Macon Georgia Sheboygan, Wisconsin great places I'm sure but not exaggerated types of counties in regions that we like to compare ourselves with\nUm another feature of eight thirty year investment is that\nFor you know any significant projects that by the county Hillsborough County or Plant City ... might want to bond that as an option\nBut the last thing and the worst thing we can do is just hand over a blank check for Thirty years and that's the ... that is not what we did this was a very carefully crafted plan fifty four percent of the funding will go to roads forty five percent will go to public transportation\nOne percent will go to planning an oversight but within those those buckets that roads bucket of fifty four percent end up public transportation bucket of forty five percent there are really specific parameters and requirements about how that money is spent and that is critical because that's going to make sure that\nThe voters wishes when this passes in November are respected for each of the next Thirty years\nI think that's often the concern is that one something like this start it it can end up being a big big pot of money and\nHow would the responsibility be managed and handle people want to know that the dollars are are going to go you know where there's supposed to go and I think that's that's definitely worth talking about how to be fifty four percent going to ... to the roads effectively and forty five percent to uh to heart as they say the Hillsborough Area Rapid transit I get such a hard stands for\nA how are those numbers arrived at ... or you eat bases\nPercentages off of the metropolitan planning organizations long term transportation plants that were citizen lead group we got to kind of doubt the citizen petition Seventy seven thousand people find our petition and six weeks to get it on the ballot and in order to do that we had to look at the plans in place Hillsborough County has a nine billion dollar backlog\nAnd those are projects that had been vetted has been gone through a community processing me hearing than there is no funding to do them\n... I'm Sorry ... like a back when you say nine billion dollar backlog is that on existing projects in project needed\nThat is projects needed road projects cross walks in front of schools are roads are only resurfaced once every Seventy five years the plan all now for transportation plan passes that will be once every twenty five years making the roads we had better and more efficient\nThese are just projects that the county in the heart no that they need to do that don't have the funding to do\nYou know take what kind of ... what kind of concerns do you know Jake is the\nThe you know he's an employee the ATC he runs our ATC but but many of us are on the on the board that are local business people that care about the economic development of a Plant City in the local area\nBut this is this is for a fulltime job you know I've got to is they say a day job I'm a I'm a car dealer but but it still impact me and my business but\nBut ah Jake what what are your thoughts on on some of the concerns and particularly about our community Plant City because a lot of people don't think about the fact his biggest Hillsborough County is\nWe have three municipalities the second largest yeah second largest uh was second largest that's right it's it's Tampa Plant City in ... the only three incorporate municipalities\nYeah ... you know I'm I don't think anyone that drove here today and say that we ... we don't have infrastructure issues wrote issues in Hillsborough County\nYou know I think that you know I represent like you said the you know the eastern portion of Hillsborough County and this and the city of Plant City actually as a page fifty one rose in the past year or through a unique partnership with ... Hillsborough County and the city of Plant City um\nThey were bad you know they will to the city will tell you they were in rough shape probably as bad as anywhere else in the in the end Hillsborough County um and my former employer ... see\nWhat you were a Tampa Hillsborough ... see so you've got your background in a in\nA big part of the camera you know we ... you know we represent the entire county attempt Hillsborough and\n[noise] you know when when when your job is to recruit companies and and help companies expand locally you know a lot of lot of the calls you get or hate we can't even get into our\n... we can into our driveway or ... you know the truckers are or you know an unsafe or not you know roads aren't up to par uh it's just some serious issues and you're not even mentioned transit we won't even you know dive into that\nYou know I'm just curious to see you know one of the one of the big questions that come up as\nYou know a lot of questions with the other a referendum we talk about talked about is you know what about the you know let grow pay for it so how do how do you answer that type of question 'cause I Know you probably get it a lot you know how why haven't we been able to use the funds from the growth and economic times we've had the how how how how can we can't pay for ourselves for or this growth bite so\nWe want to get into those those issues and also want to talk a little bit about this oversight committee we're gonna we're gonna take a break and then come back and talk about that 'cause I I I think we ought to really get into\nHow we're going to make sure these these funds are properly managed you know and try to address some of those concerns are numbers are eight hundred seven seven one one or two five and Seventy seven five seven nine one or two five Michael is on hold we'll get to you Michael when we come back it's the cat named most show [noise]\n\nFour three two one finds a boon your smart speaker should be telling them to play two\nPoint five the boom went oh two point five the bone get the point where they were one of the two point five\nBeauty knew all in one hair color can make it easy killing your hair at home [noise]\nEverything for the ... vote\nLead by professional open to everyone Sally beauty [noise]\nHi Jamie progressive employee in the months two months in a row\nHi Jamie me gave me I just had a new idea for our song what the right tool so when it like\nTell us what you want to pay ... trombone goes about why you say well I'll be fine garbage option to pick your budget then we just all these fingers Maxwell choir goes statement coming after they've come out you know maybe anyway for your practice tonight I knew there so the\nReverse of casual the insurance company and affiliates by some coverage match limited by state law\nIt's the amounts of data and even crazier speed and fight us by rising is the one hundred percent fiber optic network with ... connection you'll get the fastest Internet available download speeds up to nine hundred forty ...\nTV phone added to your price guarantee over Seventy nine Ninety nine per month on line with a two year agreement plus get two hundred dollars toward a range of Google and that's smart home devices and a one hundred dollar bills are pretty big guard when you order online\nGo to get by US DOT com and switch to the one hundred percent fiber optic network one hundred percent phenomenal\nWhether it's our hearts lungs or other organs were diagnosis tends to make us uneasy at Kaiser Permanente our specialists care for you and about you working together creating a treatment plant specific to your diagnosis a total health\nDifferent primary to specialty care find reinsurance and a great team of health care professionals committed to your healthy recovery visit KP dot org slash specialty care to learn more from the Mayo Clinic they'd incorporated when when one is different history ...\nDuring the ...

means is that many jobs are too far away are ... times here that are climbing in the last five years they've gone up almost ten percent that's double the national average it's more of an increase then you see in ... county ... county so and then everyone knows that I I think in a lot of places\nAre rush hour has become a twenty four seven phenomenon and the rising that and more and more parts of the county used to be that you would move out into the county and city of mango Dover Brandon sufferer Plant City somewhere like that to escape traffic you can't escape it anyway you know just to clarify we\nKnow that the you know the the interstates are I guess federal and state oriented not in this this particular initiative for the one sent the proposed one cent tax or for the next Thirty years would not impact interstates correct that's right yeah the look\nThis taxes local local roads it's OK finding it has to stand the county okay only be spent on transportation projects\nI Wonder how that could help it I don't know it may be kind of a difficult question titled but how could that really if I I I guess can be times are impacted this it's not just the freeways because I'm when I think to me that I think I think interstate Seventy\nFive two Seventy five I for but I guess it's just not that it's not just that it's also it's also the infrastructure\nGradually Hillsborough County has ten thousand laying miles of road so I mean I got ya from year to Los Angeles and back while it's a lot of land miles to maintain\nAnd even though not have any of this funding will be spent on asphalt on the interstates Ron freeways it will it will have an impact job when you have local roads that back up all the wage interstate off ramps\nThat that that creates a huge problem and we see that like a ... if you live in Tampa Palms or knew Tampa you're dating often\nBears the problems on ... down the streets further afield can back up all the way and there's the congestion radiates and that's a huge problem and it's not getting any better the best thing for voters that there's a chance to actually do something about it\nOr not just under ... tens of thousands of people who probably have a pretty sad ... from Hillsborough County supervisor of elections sitting on their dining room because mail ballots went out a couple of days ago so folks are actually already voting\n... mentioned I've known the first hour you know at that one thing we haven't talked about Steve is the growth projections\nLet's well and and I I think that's a great point Jake because we tend to think in the hearing the now\nWell yeah traffic's bad but and it's gotten worse but well we've kind of come back from a recession and here we are I don't think they necessarily\nAre looking into the future and I think we tend to not think about five ten twenty Thirty years now and I think there is this a little bit of this mindset of oh it'll get taken care of one way or another and that's it simply doesn't work that way\nIt doesn't work that way we haven't done a good job of handling the growth that we've seen over the past couple of decades we haven't been investing in our infrastructure to make sure that we maintain the quality of life\nOur roads are you know have potholes are not being re surface and were expected to have another seven hundred thousand people moved ... county in the next Thirty years that's the equivalent of all of the city of Orlando and all of the city of Miami\nComing to Hillsborough County and we don't do something today you know Tyler and I talk about this effort\nAs a recognition because if we don't start investing today the problem is only going to get worse\nYou know [noise]\nTransportation is a you know it is important because not only have people moving here but for those people to move here it's got to be a place where they can get to the jobs and they can get around and we know that jobs you know of course is what you do Jake you know ... jobs and businesses coming to the community coming to the area are impacted\nBy our infrastructure oh immensely and you know I think that those projections are you know a good thing for for the economic development of the world we talk about look all these people coming to\nA central Florida or Plant City and it's not what you might expect to everyone retiring coming of these are people looking for jobs or they're looking at people buying homes new homes and families or they're looking for these job opportunities which you know the central Florida Hillsborough County doing a great job at ... you know bringing these new companies and helping those that are already here expand\nYou know but we we pride ourselves in being a low tax state tax or no income ... no state income to things like that so when you don't want to lose that competitive advantage you know\nBut when it comes to things like transportation improvements it's one of those dual edged sword you you're you're kind of they're kind of um [noise]\nYou know it's up to the voter to decide what's more important to them do they want to have a a community that's easier to get around safer to get around more bike friendly um where these companies coming our looking ahead this is where I Want my company of the\nI've been in some cities and then you know I'm not going to pick on any city spent in the deep south and and I'm not just talking about the the freeways on top of the city streets the roadways\nIn the cities and some of the roads I can think of a few cities off time ahead with the roads are really pretty bad\nAnd that doesn't make it an attractive community it not only is difficult on your you know damaging to your car and difficult to drive through and get through but also it it really impact the the er the feeling that look at the community I don't know if that's really a part of this but\nBut there are certainly some cities that I Know I wouldn't want to live in because it's just that and it makes it makes a whole comedian the poor\nKenneth Lay yet if we can't makes makes it look run down as right if you can't move as a community we we we can't grow period and but we we do that\nAnd so often we talk about what the cost of a penny is you know if you look at Hillsborough County where the fourth largest county where sixty third and how much we spend on transportation and you look at that growth\nWe're not going to be able to maintain that gross if we don't do something there's a cost canoeing nothing we're paying that costs now we're paying it with our time we're paying it with our wallets and we're paying it with the lives that are being lost on are dangerous\nRotates in this dangerous roads in the nation in Hillsborough County and it's not a status quo that we can maintain when you mentioned the danger of\n... of the road we're almost up to break it looks like so I'll I'll make it kind of ... will do that when we talk back when er when we come back rather when we come back let's talk about what makes\nThe roads dangerous and also I Want to talk a little bit about new roads or existing roads and how that's going to be impacted by the by the referendum so we're going to come back after the top of the hour in talk about those things were here with Christina Barker and Tyler Hudson it's a cat and emotional [noise]\n[noise] to go

another question to shows like the committee and oversight ladies and this guy in that guy and everybody else\nAre we going to be in all this can lead to members with all this extra money coming in and what's actually going to happen well let's see action out of government rather than a lot of\nOkay great great points outlets let's start with the first thing that you said where did all the money go throughout the years and if I can just when you say throughout the years you talking about just tax dollars in general al I just wanted to kind of clarify so we can have yeah well you guys are overlooking\nAbout transportation and yell and cool and roads and stuff right\nWhere did you spend the money\nOkay well ... yeah that's a really great question are we get that a lot of you know why aren't these basic needs are already being met by the government and I worked at the city of Tampa for four years right now we pay for our transportation system with and make them gas taxes and ability fees and property taxes\nProperty tax revenue for the city of Tampa is only just this year reaching two thousand seven levels we're okay Kim because of the economic recovery act in a downturn in government budgets took a really big hit over that time and that is when that backlog that I talked about that name billion dollar backlog\nReally started to grow and where we are today we cannot fix the problem unless we get a new dedicated started to\nRead as we have a nine billion backlog on project go ahead oh you're going to say some\nYeah I've I've wanted to interrupt how much was earmarked for transportation to start with and where did that money go\nRight now and I can speak to the city of Tampa pretty well damn about seven million dollars for transportation to spend every year if you look at some of the priorities in our car and then that we can take safety for example in about six hundred thousand dollars for safety projects\nThroughout the entire city for the entire year so no no surprise there that we don't have crossed locked in front of every school are sidewalk being fixed\nThere's not enough revenue to uh to adequately fund our transportation\nIts own property values were basically cut in half during the recession that revenue half of that revenue went away is that correct or a roughly\n... yeah when you talk about property taxes and the general a revenue budgets that that the governments have and they're only recording it and so in soils matter what\nThe slum what's that go ahead now we can hear you I think go ahead live life the phones now we got you can you hear me he can't hear us yeah yeah\nI don't okay if you need to let if you need to let him go jerk I let him that's addresses questions because I had great questions I don't want him to think that we're not going to show what would I Would rather go ahead I'm\nBeen real quick about about the oversight committee or the bank ... thought maybe these folks are repaid they will not be paid that there is it's very clear in the charter amendment this is\nGlad you asked that because that's that's what people think I Would I was about ... bucks and but salaries\nYeah guys and there's a lot of people to get paid more than a salary that these people don't get a salary or anything like that but also there can be no conflicts of interest that no one can get on this committee if they receive funding from the government so a lot this money is going to be spent on somebody's always will be on newer roads for example\nYou worked with a big empty and asphalt company that's right exactly right that is critical as other ways to get paid I'm hearing in was dropping engineering festival and drank it just as an independent oversight committee is what it's called and it is truly independent that was the design of it ended I make it a little bit harder to find folks who can get on it all the better\nOff going out into I'm Glad he s as those tough questions because we we need to hear those kinda questions we need to know what people are thinking eight hundred seven seven one one or two five to seven to seven five seven nine one or two five if you got a question like al did because those questions really do they do need to be asked and and\nYou know clearly to his point we had money that was we had money to just evaporated similar during the recession but even before
