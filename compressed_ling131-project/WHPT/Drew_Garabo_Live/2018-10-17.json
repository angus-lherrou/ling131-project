right Seventy seven five seven nine one oh two five is our number I got a response you on Twitter by a company today and it made my day and this is so stupid part of my uh my ... my childhood\nI associate my fondest memories\nWith briar is ice cream like for some reason my mom always got ... she would usually get chocolate which to me that was the purest best chocolate ice cream know chocolate syrup necessary now whipped cream necessary just a simple bowl with chocolate ice cream in it\nBut every once in awhile she'd go near politics than chalk struck\nAnd I just thought this morning how funny it was every time you see the carton in the freezer and you'd open it up you know what you're gonna find no chocolate not even remnants of chocolate a third of the way strawberry and full vanilla\nOh really my house is different now is your house or just like that but what the strawberry all the way filled and some of the vanilla gun\nHuh well yeah we didn't even mess with a strawberry yeah just all vanilla you all the all chocolate I don't even understand strawberry ice cream well it's been riders had the little pieces of strawberry at I don't I don't like that so refreshing for dessert [laughter] if you are supposed to be refreshing on a on the in the Milky and creamy\nOh it was the best man at that that we had an ice cream scooped out at a white handle and and the black scoop part in all I think about is every ... every damn night who you remember your ice cream scoops yeah oh no I'm very fond memories so\nHas that love is that more of a sentimental thing with briar like would you put ... an upper echelon of of ice cream\nToday no I I I think it's too simplistic idea ice cream has gotten so convoluted Ben and Jerry changed the game those two wizards from Vermont completely changed the ice cream game back in my day ah it was a simplistic sublime pleasure to just have a scoop of prior chocolate\nAnd just to show my mom that I Do remember that ice cream school we had a white one with the black handle for some reason mom got a second scoop a very inferior yellow plastic scoop\nThat I never really cared for and I always I always enjoyed the black and white school more well do you think there is a personality thing that you could do and look at why certain people gravitate towards chocolate versus van and straw\nOr I don't know if its personality I think it's just a flavor and and I think most people would probably appreciate in this order a chocolate vanilla strawberry\nI I think for me it goes shock straw van but for you it goes what shocked man straw right and for you it goes van chalk strong yes interesting what does it mean Seventy seven five seven nine one or two five high it's to grab alive who might you be\nStray Hi Trey what's up\nSo you guys are nothing up you have it all\nThe gathering of all that's neat yeah\nIt's not that we're not messing it up you're a psychopath you so you you'd you'd say if you take us

for ... for the apples and some chocolate hummus yeah I I\nAs the don't ask you X with desert\nIn the world that we live in now though with all the flavors I mean for for the most part if you're going to the ice cream mile you're going to leave with the cookies and cream you know I Know there's a tradition was up there I hate to say this prior to the bottom of the barrel when it comes to flavored ice cream they did you not give you the toppings or the feelings that you deserve the ice cream is like Romney that's right I Do not support them\nThat's fair but I I Can't I I haven't had writer's

okay I don't it so Seventy seven five seven nine to five and eight hundred seven seven one or two five Piers Morgan who loves to say things that piss people\nOff slammed I guess a it was\n... who's a Daniel Craig yeah blonde actor who had a pop who's strapped to his chest like those little baby aren't things where you got a baby there and he said uh\nIt was a ...\nOh double o seven not you as well is it okay or not okay to judge other dudes by the way they hold their kids that is not okay it's Ninety or God dang\nBusiness right I yeah I don't think it is and again this is not a freedom of speech argument this is a\nCommon sense argument is it okay or not okay to insinuate or even state that a dude is less of a man because he wears a pap who's to carry his kid\nPhoebe told me that\nGuys carrying babies is equivalent to a woman as a woman to working is to a guy\nYeah very sexy yeah I I don't know why but women love to see responsible dads I guess\nWell now jeeze just I'm just working through I suffer you to understand 'cause you're not a father but\nI mean do you want to be after you hear that one real or find a baby and I think same with dogs I think even if you're Karen Brody around I think it\nMight get one I think about getting a boost for him all the time Seventy seven five seven nine one or two five and eight hundred seven seven one one or two five is it okay or not okay\nTo say that a man is less of a man because he's strapped up baby to his chest throughout alive\nHey I Do it all the time I'm a single dad two kids one nine months or two I got strep or else I Can't get anything done\nSo you're saying it's not okay for another person to judge you by the way you carry your cat\nFan okay no it's okay where\nYou know what's interesting is I used to be anti leash I thought that a dehumanize the kids\nWhat if you're a single dad and you've got more than one kid and you want to make sure that kid does not run off into traffic yeah at least is your best way of doing\nCell phone muzzle emily's right or is not too much for muzzle full leash\nI agree I always thought the leashes I couldn't believe what they were doing their kids and now I I totally understand yet\nI Would never do it but I understand why people do a kiss her squarely I mean they'll ah oh yeah they want to die like kids kids want to find the most amount of danger so that they can test your love for the Seventy seven five seven I Want to do five Matt okay or not okay with that or buts aids Piers Morgan that\nIt's not OK okay\nNobody should shame and other dad right\nExactly and it also makes me think of another situation where Titus O'Neill has been ridiculed because she gave it starting to kiss on the lips of national television and during the WWE event and he's taken a lot of ridicule and ate over the Internet because of that\nYou did I see Titus taking any you know I'd be afraid of\nIt was like a year to go uh it's mostly like so you know like in the rest of the world or whatever but it's\nI think he's thinking of Tom Brady yeah I was gonna say that's nothing just look at the tongue kissing the Tom Brady give his son as the incentive\nHey if you don't like the way Titus uh shows the facts to do is get your more than welcome to tell him\n[laughter] you you go outside the body and everybody was was getting all over time writing about kissing his son in the lead but are you guys won't do that well Titus Seventy seven seven I Would have to fight on\nIf I saw the same exact scenario that I saw what Tom Brady and that documentary where his son wanted to go do something like play a video game\nAnd he said okay come over here give me a kiss first and then the kids aren't goes like somewhat normal case the father and then Tom goes no no no Mr come and get the real ... give daddy the real thing and then they all have a very along gated very\nUncomfortable kids that's where I have a problem with it\nIt was not elongated there was nothing uncomfortable about the ...\nI mean if you're using kisses as a bargaining chip against your child something's wrong at your dad was the hottest Thomas Brady is why would you not want to have a long kiss\nI've got the uh the audio right here hold on one second\nServing its not disturbing probably I'm not sure if you'd be allowed to play it massage therapy [noise] while he's getting a massage so\n[noise] I Do\nHave a
