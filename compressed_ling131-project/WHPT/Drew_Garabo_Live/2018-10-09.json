I was hearing that from a lot of people I was hearing a lot of people have the dogs hit him when they when they got dogs they want I Know thank God they weren't on duty when we went through\nNo doubt there are dogs when you when you get by lake everybody who works for carnival at the Tampa terminal I don't know if they tell them to like act like they love their jobs or if they genuinely love their jobs they were ... got us so pump for the crews from the porters to the people point you which way to go there\nAll just like\nA fantastic time or going out and then you get off the boat and it is like\nA and they're just like they're going to bring your visitors\nUm but uh but we thought no issues getting on the boat because they're never any issues getting on the boat\nWe didn't encounter any dogs you and I didn't even\nSee one I thought for certain that that was an old wives' tale that dogs are even president at the cruise ship\nSo we're talking to a couple of people that are private island excursion and ... and there are like we made a big mistake we so what'd you do he said well we smoke to Jay in our car so you don't want to do that so they said because they smoked AJ in their car they're smelling like the weed\nThe dog alerted on them in the terminal ... I Know and then uh and then they opened up not just their carry on luggage but they're checked luggage course and went through all their stuff like\nEverything it sounded like down to their toiletries yeah they've got the dogs but they're not necessarily trying to pass a guy bring a pen on they're trying to find guys that are looking at traffic the devils are dandruff damn right okay I don't know I\nI really don't know what their goal is I think they want people to not have weed on a cruise\n[noise] yeah I think that might be it I think people who are have their we'd probably don't buy as much alcohol so I think they were ... they are going after people with we'd at least I got that impression because they're taking their wheat and arrest them\nWhat a waste of time I know I Would have turned around and left right and\nYeah you got me by the are no longer we're\nGoing to have people get so drunk they fall off the cruise ships but I've got to take a couple of pen for sure\nWho I tell you there are I I'm surprised that nobody fell overboard on this cruise with the sees the way they were and people in the conditions that I wait\nUntil I'm into that nobody fell overboard they're not going to they might go that's the last we didn't like that guy they\nWould have to trust me he was rooting for the [laughter] if he was rooting for it so hard it was me and and I had a\nBalcony thank God it's me Joey flash and job standing on the balcony and John just kept saying\nWell look like if you have Joe you were to fall off right now like how far would you get before what are we supposed to do do we run to the phone and call do we shout man overboard he was really getting into the the soup to nuts of someone falling overboard\nIt's a very fascinating occurs to me like what happens like what are my emotions going to be like what's that feeling like when I looked down at Joey looking back at me you know with these pleading eyes and I just know that you've never going to see him again\nAs her direct phone line to the to the captain of something like that happens fortunately we never found out\nThat I was looking at once once I found out about the storm you know I keep up with my whether I was trying to set up a meeting with me and the captain and make sure he was briefed\nSo [laughter] he he's not even joking we're at the piano bar with a lady the camper resident and a and Ozzie\nAnd um and the cruise entertainment director was there and John wanted to have a word with them to offer a service it was just thinking like he was he anytime he saw someone in a white suit he legit wanted to talk to them about the weather patterns and what he saw the radar and what they were going to do about it\nI just thought they weren't doing enough\nSeventy seven five seven nine to five and eight hundred seven seven one or two five so we uh we we got home safely I Believe\nCan we mentioned the one hero of the cruise though that that that I'd like to mentioned\nBy name a personal hero mine guy Feehery\n[noise] I I went in his cruise with a little bit of animosity towards guy Feehery because you know he's additional um but uh but now I I feel like I'm I ... I feel like he is entered a world of reverence\nFor John that I that I must put grudgingly admit that guy Feehery his burgers were amazing I ate two burgers on that Cruz\nWas the only two because I'd like to I'd like to call you a three at least I think you hit three [noise]\nNo no I I had to I had the one with the baking just given a donkey sauce and that was the last one I had to\nSet this I Know you don't like burgers or they free yeah no\nBut I mean this places like take this burger and it's as good of a burger as you can get put it up there with five guys in and out like it's a high quality burger and they're just they're any huge stacks and there's this little Latino gentleman you want to padded you weren't prepared if you want to baking dish you want the donkey soft all day anything you want\nOff it was awesome like his whole cruise ship activity revolved around is guys burger open and can we go get a guy's burger and it was amazing ... there was an amazing burger it was like a like a five guys meet sent it out yeah I got amazing bird or old topping bar Seth\nLettuce tomato sauteed onions mushrooms bacon to pull a male I Would have been knocking on the pickles\nThere was a sweet pickles oh I Know I Know I I Know but his uh his ah his burgers or they were amazing\nI have a whole new respect for the man you don't even have them all along like most of his hat I Know you you never thought that he could prepare good good meal I\nI've never had his food before a judge them without sampling his wares and I was wrong to do so you\nCan't walk around with hair like that and not a cook up a wonderful burger\nGuy makes an amazing amazing burger the customs guy as we got off the boat knew who I was thank God 'cause he takes my passport it goes to grab all the data and I was later this hour on TALK shows as well so I uh uh they may go they're going through I go up that's all you need is a local radio job and I can smuggle bananas back from Mexico because\nAs worried about is I was getting on the boat people on the ship were telling us that it's getting off where you truly need to be worried that they will rip every shred of your thing apart and make sure you're not taking the out of Mexico but on the way out nobody even look nobody even looked at my back\nNot not we ... I took the time I mean I could have taken the time to hide stuff and then uh then and I still can't find it a draw the line who are you ...\nHey what's up yet but I Would do hey man doing very well thank you just trying to get our land legs as they say\nOh I understand well I wanted to go back real quick I was about uh some people on the cruise got busted with a pen yeah get charged with\nThey didn't get charged with anything up from what they said the people on the on the cruise said we can do this one of two ways we can keep this stuff and you guys can get on board or you can choose to keep this stuff and then we uh we accelerate things from there and of course they chose what anybody would choose which is you go out and keep my stuff and I'm going to go ahead and get on the cruise\nAnd then I started putting my clothes away and my ... my room [laughter] somebody knocked and said hey you have to go and I said okay give me a minute and they came back and knocked again\nAnd then when I got there everybody was very upset and I was supposed to go to the library and there was men yelling at me have\nA whole go to the library you held us all up ... nobody nobody likes that portion of the cruise but you have to do what you want to get it over as quickly as possible I really thought I was I felt in my heart that I was going to be able to avoid it\nSeventy seven five seven nine to five every every crews that one guy that thinks he's going to be able to avoid it holds everybody else so that's the one that got a falls off over border dies on the cruise he was rooting for that live below\nUh yes I have a story about bringing on air nail yeah on a cruise ship and I am but Cale and my family\nA love to go ahead and my ... year old daughter yet I'm I have I happen to be compassionate you a\n... and ... and like an idiot I brought my medication let me and my ... and the fact that they had a bullet and make her at which I was brought into a separate room to get tied it down and check and a police officer asked me what was in there and I ...

star distribution dot US\nI have not true I'm it's toxic Ken it's disappointing and it's not good for our country and it's not good for a civil discourse about some very very serious issues that we face as a nation and that we face as a state\nUm I don't think the demagoguery and and the the partisan divide in the automatic retreat into your corners of lobbying uh grenades at the other side\nReally solves any problems which is why I Love being a mayor 'cause I really don't have to worry about that stuff I don't care who's a Democrat who's a Republican but I think for the good of the country\nWe ought to be America's first and part is in second and unfortunately that's not happening and that is is not good for the long term sustainability of a democracy is leading light in the world\nYeah we we seem to be in a a in a ... contest right now and I clean that up out of respect for your office a it because you know we can't have these conversations anymore the minute that you find out that I'm a liberal or I find out that you're on the right than your own you know and he tolerant buffoon and a Nazi and it was ... and all that\nWe just retreat to our corners like you said and we only want to have rallies with like minded individuals where we can talk about how bad the other side is and now they're ruining America\nWhen in actuality we're all still Americans and we should be able to talk about these issues at the very least and work out our differences or at the very least agree to disagree very respectfully but we're not doing any of these things and I don't know how we turn this thing around Bob\n[noise] you know I don't either drew and and what you said is exactly right that there is no common ground anymore um and those that try to find common ground often find themselves a primary in an election ... depending on you know if you're on the Democratic side you get primary from the left 'cause you're not that\nFar off the spectrum and if you're on the right you get primary from the far right extreme and most Americans and certainly most Floridians are somewhere in the middle of a little bit center right a little bit center left we're not out on the either extreme and it's\nUnfortunate because we've got serious challenges as a nation and we need serious credible people\nWho are willing to reach across the aisle to find common ground that doesn't mean we always agree with each other but ultimately if you're there for the right reasons\nAnd you're not just there to perpetuate your political career\nYou're not just there to to to uh to uh make promises to the special interest groups but you're there for real Americans face the real challenges I'm it's unfortunate because that's where we have found ourselves\nNo doubt we're speaking with the honorable mayor Baba corner mayor the city of Tampa ...\nMerit only lasted three weeks but it was a blast three weeks I Want to know how to fits magic change your life\n[laughter] and where it made me wish I could grow beer beer to wear a shirt with all that chest\nHair and you know [laughter] maybe what I was a huge I could do that but I Can't do\nAny none of us and what what a magical time those couple of weeks ago right\nKnow I think all of us are looked at\nIt was three games and saw a great season coming a you know the guys are playing well the fence was rock and roll and we got more weapons uh in those receivers than probably any team in the NFL\nBut within the wheels just fell off the truck and I I don't know what the heck's going on but you know I remember the optimist eye if it's not ... you know needs to take leadership and take ownership and get that defense actually defending people\nAnd [laughter] and it will be nice you know\nYou you have a pretty good to be in the locker room with that just started sending people that's all we we you know I don't know why Brent Grimes get scratched a\nHealthy scratch at the beginning of last game a lot of weird things happening were but look where what two into you know there's no way I thought we'd be to do with a fitzpatrick filling in those first two weeks so let's just call it a a wash and we start to season this Sunday against the rival Atlanta\nFalcons ready to take off regretting us not them\nYou know it's so it's a long season we'll recognize that and ah I'm I'm hopeful that they will get to get their stuff together and start play like they're capable of they got the talent there's no doubt about that\nI'm sure sure let me ask you a question we don't get a better parking spot at the buccaneers games do you think it's ... corner do you think it's a big nasty the ultimate fan who's\nIn the hall of fame well having been issuing a game with big nasty who is in the NFL hall of fame I Will say he gets a decent parking space but I Will be willing to wager that are honorable mayor Baba corn gets a helicopter ride to and from each game to avoid the awful traffic and gets air dropped out of there with a parachute attached any lands\nRight at the yard line and then throws the spear ends of the seminal way no that's wrong rug sport\n[laughter] am I right I don't know what mayor you're talking about but that's not me [laughter]\nI guarantee you this I guarantee you this\nGuy's nine months from now when I'm the former mayor I'll be walking from lot F\nWay I'm [laughter] definitely\nA sub and

said\nPeople do get a little weird um [laughter] what happens on the ship just started talking is due to the hot tub and um and so I stopped for a second and John are both really hungry and the guy goes through\nTrying to get in here oh no and I go with the men were were really hungry I got to go get\nSomething and he's like well and so we're walking away me I'm sure he was thinking about what addict through as he didn't want to give them a hot so aggressive\nInvites under the hot tub with with strangers that's I'm not I'm not OK lesson is by the more of a demand\nBut here's here's where we're shocking so drew says I'll come back\nIn in my head I'm thinking that you will be sure and then we get done eating are delicious guy Feehery Burger King and drew says I think we should go get the hot tub with that guy he seemed really sad so under Druze you know idea we went and actually physically got into the hot tub with this guy and his wife\nAnd I made small talk with the guy and he's asking me all these weird questions that I'm trying to hang in there like a chip and then he goes uh\nHey man how come you're not looking at me when you're talking to me a lot of how I got into a\nWell we're not a poor man there's a lot of girls in bathing suits and whatnot like ... I'm just looking he goes what can you look at me more\nOh I Know I didn't ... and I said oh I'm you know I'll I'll Try I guess\nAnd then he goes hey how can we don't smile more [laughter] and I said how come I don't watch\n[laughter] when I started dragging myself in October I normally well it's not gonna be don't smile\nMore so I I don't know you guys on your show ever ask you that I said I don't know we're all dead ends\nI said no and he said well do you ever smile on the radio you must be small and you say a lot of fun stuff that I go I I don't know man I I don't pay attention to how much I smile or the other guys on my show never said anything to me like hey smile more have smile less\nI'm Sorry drew major al on yourself you you did you did that this is all on\nYou was and then I and then I left and are you\nA little tipsy who says hey that's not you know that's not let's go get back in the hot tub with this guy he seems that what was it the open water what happened\nI was very conscious of talking to people more of like wanting to give them what they want because they're on that grew some of them to meet me look\nSometimes people come out to a remote they'll say hey drew was mean to me or he was on his phone this isn't like hey I a true because he didn't get in the hot tub with me when he was going to get food\nLook I Am on this cruise to talk to people and I will talk to them until they tell me they don't want to talk to me anymore so what\nWas really unique to me is I didn't know who knew who we were in who didn't write except for when they had the couch cruise land you're dying so I had at least forty five conversations with people and then they let me know hey love the show oh yeah\nThat is a very that's the weirdest dynamic of all because you want to make sure that everybody who's there to interact with us or whatever gets that but you don't want to just start going after people 'cause I Know nervous and some people aren't going to negotiate so I don't want to just go up to like you said you know why you did you want to talk\nI Know you want to meet me that that that is always a weird move like assuming someone knows who you are going Hi you have that later because there were people who I Would see who definitely did not want to talk to me like you could tell you get a little head nod yeah that's a given and then ah and then I started talking to this lady yesterday or not yesterday I talked to anybody yesterday day before yesterday\nAnd she said uh hey do you hate me ... I got I I don't even know who you are and she said well just Everytime you see me it's like you're looking right through me [laughter] and I\nAnd I went oh I'm I'm Sorry I'm probably just looking for something but I'll I'll be sure I I look into you more often as opposed to look right through\nYou know the the other guy in the hot side we're not looking at him and this lady you're standing right through our I don't know how I sat right through some watcher I game straight gr although they need to do that I Would have weird uh\nForgot demanded am I could get to the hot tub with him I mean how can I get a whole nother level and here's the even the\nMost worst part of all no I don't even know cold little pool of warmed up a hundred degrees outside I didn't understand what psychopaths we're doing\nIn the hot tub while they were not ... not out of it all is\nAnd then let's let's be honest every hot up there is probably about four to five person capacity and each other about twelve to Fifteen people inside of them search or is very close\nSeventy seven five seven nine to five or you ate well what do you do not he well the cruise I didn't take notice what you're eating or how much of it\nI famous I always had grilled fish every night vegetables I actually was pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to eat while in clean on the ship so I woke up\nAt my eggs hit the gym then you have to pull it was like a retreat almost where you didn't have to think about anything you just said what you want and then you can eat whatever you get hungry and the nap whenever you want you\nWith us here a final Celtic cruiser the Celtic cruising again\nOh I'm ... and nice I'm ready I'm ready for next year\nThat's what's crazy is that I'm so tired and like I just feel generally wore down but it feels like the maps and the rest of the get on the cruise is like the best sleep ever\nYeah I took many naps I Would uh I Would hang out with people in the afternoon and then I just disappeared in my cab wondering where are you in for hours just to know how many nasty thing I woke you up from many every single one of them I uh I Would sleep for a couple of hours and then there was a knock on my door or a tax or something and and there's John but I needed\nThat otherwise I Would have been completely antisocial\nAnd then one night I uh I Do a little a little video a video chat with my girl oh

Choose to trust with\nPhotographs of my way\nPeople are going to cheat [noise]\nNot anything that I Do I understand it's human nature maybe not supposed to be monogamous but if you're going to be married and you're going to work at a radio station you just have to be I just want to just be a little bit more discreet or we're just gonna chalk it up that you are a complete moron\nOr you don't care about your ... your like you don't care about being busted\nOr to sickness I Can't figure it out\nBut how many female friends of mine has to come to me and go hey how well do you know so and so and why she's sending me his you know what before I go All right what was the tenth one maybe it's time to have a conversation with the ... about why I don't like you you wonder if you want to know why you want to play that\nI Can't wait in lake me you don't want me to tell people why I don't like you do to\nStop it cut\nIt out if they want to see your penis they will ask to see your penis you've got a wife dude\nSo we're just we're sending out crane shots all willy nilly we don't even know if the women want them\nI don't know what the deal is man\nI don't know either but I don't uh you know I don't live in that world I don't talk to a lot of these women 'cause I just really talk to my wife but I I don't know why we're hearing so much about\nThis one guy I don't I don't ask questions about this this guy he's fine to me I have no issue with them but everything that pops up I just don't know why I keep hearing about it how many people know about this many\nAnd I think it's I Am starting to think 'cause I've been that guy was kind of like ah maybe some does misunderstood but it's becoming now where it seems it's ramping it it seems like it it probably is an issue in in in the uh me too era it will be a matter of time before somebody comes out and says I'm not comfortable with this\nIf you don't care enough about your wife and your family did not do these things I Need you to care about my radio station that I work for enough not to do these things because I'm sick of ladies I'm not sick of you sending the message is because I Want you to know\nI'm you're OK telling me these things and I'm not going to judge you for a safe place exactly and I'm Glad that that so many of you have told me\nOr they are they running you because they know that he worked for the bone or because they're they're horrified by what they saw or they comparing it to what you may have sent them in the past\nGreat questions [laughter] um the nature of them coming to me is God I feel like such an idiot because he made me feel special because I thought I was like the only one well gauging in this kind of thing with him\nI mean we can't be mad at a guy for that for a making a lady thinks she's the only one that's that's part of the game isn't it no it's not a you\nCan be honest I mean it's you know honestly\nWhen you're cheating was like what [laughter] what are they swim in the fact that it's important\nIt's gross man\nI mean it does point there is just it can't be that much like you just have to be smarter but you can't be doing it that often does that many people who are in the span of of the last six months I've personally heard about five or six different people who've experienced the same thing and we're not happy about it\nAnd it's and it's not like we're looking for anything because we know this dude era don't like this dude these people find us when we're on the cruise that lady just started talking hey you guys know blank blank he's a real creep who did this and this and this and called me in and said this and it's like dude ... what do you do one man what are you doing\nIt to be more discreet when you cheat is that what we're trying to learn\nI'd say don't cheat I'd say if you if you have a wife and she gave you a baby then I'm respect that I Know it's hard to do I tried to be there myself but um\nYou know just it just sad\nWhen uh when when it hurts the feelings of these girls who feel like there's something special and then they put two and two together a hearing on the radio that maybe they aren't that's special to him you're special to\nMe but I mean what's that these women are what running to the radio person I was trying to get with them so they're gonna run to another radio personality trait I mean\nIt sounds like they liked the attention too\nI'm sure they do I'm a you know there's no one who is a\nWho's without quote unquote blame it's just you're representing yourself and you're representing a radio station barely and you're representing your family and try to have a little respect men\nTry try to show a little bit or at least have a conversation with your wife hey listen I'm happy with you I'm happy with the family that we've built I just really need to show my weighing the other lady\nIs that I mean part is that cheating if you if you send your way to other ladies maybe just putting the feelers that maybe you're trying to keep it as that I Know a lot of women would say yes and you would probably say no I Need somebody in the middle [laughter]\nWell no I Would say yes if your if your partner doesn't know about it okay like at this point in time I've told my girlfriend that I Will not be sending my wiener routes other girls if I did that that would be cheating because I told her that I'm not going to\nEven if we take out the moral compass of of cheating is right or wrong let's just take that out there are men in this world who have been cheating for decades without every single person that they work with knowing about the terrible crappy things they're doing this guy's not even good at what he's doing if you're going to do this and you feel the need\nFind a way to be a little more discreet to where there's not women coming out of the woodwork every other day saying they receive pictures of your previous penises penis\nEvery this is from a co worker ours every promo girl at the station has a story about the guy you're talking about total tool\nIt and I'll tell you from the things that I've heard lately this is becoming a little more than just\nYou know like in ... [laughter] bad bad luck I mean I if I was this guy and he's listening and I know we're talking about um I Would be very worried\nYeah stop it dude this is not me not liking you I don't like you and this as a major reason why because too many female Facebook friends of mine go hey this guy who's also Facebook friends with you who says he works at your station he's showing these photographs of his Packer so I I haven't said anything to do\n'cause I don't like it but how do we know what his his his pack or we don't we don't know it has been Packer I don't think he's thrown a a ...\nI don't know I don't know I don't know how these guys get their rods about town I how do we know you think he's putting fake rot out that I don't I don't know if if the huge matchup I Need to take a look at both we asked to investigate there's only one man that's good enough for the job and that's me for your church\nSeventy seven five seven nine one or two five but look we've held off of saying anything on the radio about it because I'm not looking to ruin this guy's life if you are listening right now dude everyone knows what youre doing and you should stop doing it before it gets you in a lot of trouble\nOr if it's an arrangement that he might have with his wife where she says hey send it out there and you know see what you can you know bring home for us [laughter] everybody some and it's different thing\nSure absolutely and if that's the case good on you may go for it but I highly doubt that's the case\nI told 'em I tweeted Christie Mac seven years ago that I thought you had a nicer bus CBS got rid of me for it so you had a nice but I Know I said we were talking we said very nice things about you today and maybe I ...

back to you know Tam scaling back I Will tell you that\nThis is not saying he's done anything possibly that bad but when you're just touching the surface and you have this many people coming out you have\nTo at least ask the question what other stuff has he done precisely like not you know probably not maybe not but when you just mentioned it once in all of a sudden there's people coming out with stories from it's crazy\nNow you lady should feel bad about yourself it's it's just very disappointing that a guy would abuse whatever small amount of fame he has gotten it this radio station to uh to get inappropriate with girls\nMan I don't ever I don't think that I'm I'm famous in any way shape or form but when I when I see this stuff happening I I I started to wonder you could get it oh you're talking about it's about getting it is just so many women that are very sensitive\nNot to not necessarily to the guy but to to what he represents or where he works right we'll see you know I'm Brenda Strong I don't ever exploited that I only use it to to benefit show or charities not not my own hog you're good to disguise it's not okay but\nIt and I don't think there are women reaching out to this person I don't think the guy is a hot commodity where his is is DMZ are full I think he's seeing people listeners people that he works with people that the whoever the hell\nYou know he's worked within the past yeah it'll end up my end by and he just kind of reaches out to them like\nHey hey poke hey poke what what's that what's poke Facebook you can poke somebody does that mean you want to do it with them yeah oh really hey this is my way of saying Hi without saying I ... yeah with my winter it's kind of annoying oh it is I mean you're you're ... you can't poke me\nOr I don't want to about ... up to it on Facebook you try not going to see or failure both of\nYou are so did we do to be put to blackmail ransom a timeline in ... in in the in the player we were you\nKind of had a back just taking a step back ours guy knows who he is and what he's done\nSo so let's let's reset that so what this guy down at the guy that works here and a lot of women have come out saying this guy has sent his his package out I Know you have a problem with the with the guy in general\nBut is it what what is it that he's doing that's bothering you so much as if you take advantage of these women to me he's just he just play the number he's sending the crank send them to crank hopefully one outta ten women will like\nI just find that really really disrespectful to use is to use your position at this station which I'm sure isn't the first time you've done this\nIt's it's kinda gross and one female friends of mine reach out to me and go hey do you know this guy is he a friend of yours 'cause he's relentless then I feel bad about it and then when girls who I've met through the station tell me that they now feel horrible about themselves because they thought that they were the only ones you know that he tried this with\nThen you know that'll make you feel a lot to make you feel some kind of way\nSeventy seven five seven nine one or two five today's it's okay it's not okay\nIs being

seven five seven nine to five and eight hundred and seven seven one or two five I could understand if I'm a high school administrator and I go this routine is a little bit suggestive\nBut I don't think you want any of those parents finding out that you called their routine obscene or said that they look like a bunch of rivers\nI remember girls getting in trouble in high school because they would have this thing I wanted to be called like cheers sex or something where it's girls would get in trouble because they would make faces like that while they cheered in in in in the younger days I

allowed to ... what do you mean\nLike Seventy seven five seven nine to five you see the uh Tampa Bay a police officer who's suing the city for his old job back and back paid after he was a fire for hugging the lady\nOh I was more ... you know they may he made Ninety six thousand dollars a year I can see why he was trying to get that job back and\nI honestly didn't know cops I mean not that that's a lot for a cop but that seemed I did not know they made that much\nWhat steps seems like a lot not for ... seemed like a good living that's a lot of money I don't know I just it seems like a lot\nHas he been there forever 'cause you know a lot of times they get raises and you know there's years in the system\nAnd so he is he's worked for the department had worked for the apartment since Ninety nine\nWas suspended for four days without paying twenty Fifteen after a woman said she met with him forty to fifty times sometimes for sex during a two year period starting in twenty eleven and investigation concluded that bad sex inside the belief vehicle which you're not supposed to do\nBut it couldn't be verified that he had violated departmental rules\nRegard regulating standard of conduct an attack during this duty\nThen it twenty Seventeen this do shows up to an accident and meet say fifty eight year old lady okay now\nHere's where things get weird\nAfter interviewing a woman about the crash\nThis particular officer left the scene but then encountered the lady afterward on Bush boulevard he said pull over she wrote down her window and asked him to pull over because she thought he had kept her driver's license\nShe said that he squeezed her right boom while she sat in the car not funny he also\nAsked for a better look at her breasts and flirted her ignoring her outstretched hands and insisting upon repeating hogs and this was the fifty eight year old woman you said yeah he said that she did all the flirting and made him uncomfortable and so they fired him\nI could\nI could see how older woman flooded with you can make you feel uncomfortable sure uh fifty eight year old lady a Nineteen year police veteran and they said that because he agreed to hugging are\nThey let them go they say you can't lean into a driver's side woman's a car and hug even if she initiates the encounter really\nFired on August twenty fourth for violating such rules as standard of conduct truthfulness and departmental matters and safety and attention the duty\nOh wouldn't want to hug the cob who isn't I Would\nWant to talk to show the little appreciation for what they've done\nWhy why is it and I see these stories some you know when top whenever cops get fired but a lot of it seems to stem from when a cop pull somebody over it seems like that's what a lot of the flirting takes place\nBecause women think that if I flirt with this guy you know maybe it's going to let me go Scott Free\nIs that or is it not even a woman's not even thinking that it's at the top go it oh listen I let's see maybe I'll see if she wants to get out of the ticket what what what can I get away with today it's a great question\nI Would leave that to the ladies of the audience when you get pulled over do you feel like the cubs looking for a little something something looking for you to like maybe give them a reason to get out of the ticket\nI mean that has become such a thing you know what I mean like it's just the thing that we except you know women to get out of tickets you know they they own button a blouse they do whatever so you have to think in society it's a running joke\nIf you're a police officer who was a little bit of a perverse you be at least got to have your mind open to that when you pull over really hot chick like is she going to at least offer or mid rise a little out of a nip\nOr something I'm sure they will be on my mind the minute that I that I pulled him over my head and wonder what are what are what you're going to show here to get a ticket I mean I'm certainly not going to let her but I Wonder what you're going to try what's up Sarah\n[noise] hey that that hey\nI'm just claim here by and the cheerleading on it okay\nAnd I think it's important that we remember that they had or Eighteen and they work out and they have ... an ad that followed that it changes wide receiver hasn't ... at that certain shared and you know when they pull out of that as the other hand set by they die a professional athlete\nWell but you wouldn't say there is important to a team as a wide receiver what'd you\nSay the same ... same stat\nWhat sport
