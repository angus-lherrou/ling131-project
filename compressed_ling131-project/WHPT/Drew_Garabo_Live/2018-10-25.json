know\nWhy people think it's racist even if she doesn't think that it's racist\nOr NBC that to ... hours with right is it is they don't want this they have already been through this they don't want this\nThat factors into this I think because Matt Lauer was canned because he made fellow co workers uncomfortable with his sex office\nThe thing that's ironic I was reading about her this morning there was a lot of people within NBC that were mad at her because she was so vocal about the Matt Lauer stuff it was ... she didn't entire shows about the me too movement about what was happening in the NBC building that people were upset with so I mean it was both ways but didn't\nTurn they said every show on NBC was talking about with Megan Kelly said\nRight and is it an interesting that they NBC turned a blind eye to what Matt Lauer did for a long time they knew like they covered it up and they knew\nI sure hope you guys a button underneath his desk a lock the door right\nYou allowed a dude because he had a men's power and got great ratings you allowed him to have a sex button on his on his desk where if you wanted to get it on with the female co worker he simply needed a press a

that's why\nThey're reliable sources from the Hollywood Reporter have said they've spoke with NBC sources and she is out and she has never coming back\nNow Ryan rub your just or do we did something very uh I I think very poignant of the million costume ideas to pick dressing as black face tells a lot about someone\nWhat if your kid let's let's say you guys have a five year old boy you two together you're going through a gay lover yeah I Love this year I gave you taught him all true gay couple and you have a five year old a boy okay\nHis name's Nathan alright I cheat on you often just

a little white boys\nOh okay so he comes to you guys me goes down and dad um I Want to or I Want to be a uh the the Black Panther I forget what his name was I don't know but I ... I Would encourage it would be Michael Jordan's character alright much better regardless he says I've got my caution but dad I Want to make my face a little darker\nCan I you got a buddy I don't think so son that's probably not a good idea that there will be a plus he let them do it\nOr going to how about you a mascot we'll get to a mask how 'bout that will get you the black panther mask now he's not going to be able to breathe very well and I will make sure that the breathing holes or actually\nI don't want him to the uh but that was why is blackface wrong what's wrong with the yeah the\nFaces a problem with you know it's just not something that we want to do right now with you it was controversial\nAnd since ... without a doubt I just want to be the black as Halloween it's something people used to do back in the day that was very very insensitive um that's along with not saying the N word that's another thing that we don't do well don't we don't say the we're not said I Know that your other data yards that set or the other day it's not I am and it was a little bit late and he's white and\nDaddy call them the other one I Know your dad when he hears the rap music ... he doesn't skip over the N. word now he doesn't not a word things along with it that that's not a word you should say\nHere you go but here's some daddy's a bronze emotion just just put this on ... that don't fill me in ... don't tell your other about what I often you know he's ... okay Seventy seven five seven nine why don't\nAny he gave it to me like it used to that\nOh a stickler with our son

up\nNot much I was just going I think they just want to get get her wired I just think that somebody had it in ... they were just looking or any or excuse to get rid of her\nNo that's not the case Ronnie ... no ... in all all respect you for having that perspective but no she stopped in it I mean she I I might not think she should be fired you might not think she should be fired but she did enough in today's PC culture to wear NBC could fire her within reason sir\nRight yeah and I was calling her a ... a that so back in ...\nYou know I used to uh say man you're kinda rough on people on the phone and everything and you know I start listening listening to you every day and so and then I got started ... some of your calls that you know again\nLike I was like this guy's saying some of these calls I\nGot it I I\nMan you've got more patient so now I Would sure\nWhether you are presumed that very much you know listen I can or cannot some bean bags around when it comes to uh to colors but at the same time where we have fun here and\nWe're going to the labor it when someone calls up and we need to get into or get into it but it'll be quick it will be done in the past that I've used people has a punching bag in ... in the process\nOr should have fun I don't fault you for your thinking I'm addicted ... there are people who still think I'm a deck Seventy seven five seven nine one or two five and I'm not here to tell you the wrong by the way\nA what's up John welcome to grab a live\nUnder that what's up but not much I'm so this is so I Am a a person of color I'm I'm Hispanic right and uh I just wanted to approach this yeah that's one of the birds is from a slightly different angle and I have a question for you in terms of uh the the\nBlack states versus like you know a a white kid who wants to go out and dressed as a black power ranger for instance\nI'm just there a black power I there is okay and he happened to be happy to be a black guy actually oh good um\nSo what I'm I'm confused about is I'm totally against the black face I understand that Amos and Andy style dimensional stuff I completely understand that what I don't understand is the idea that if a white kid looks up to an idolizes someone who's a person of color but they can't dresses that person\nOr they can ... well ... and I think you do understand it they can dresses that person but they're\nThe appropriateness of that ends as soon as they try to dark in their pigmentation not because of their intent but because of the reaction in America is unfortunate history with lamb Kooning and exploiting a black people for their entered\nWhich I under which I understand that aspect\nBut if you're using you understand everything like if if you really do understand when I just said then you have no further questions and you understand everything\nBut I don't understand the the the part in terms of reactions from someone else we can't control the way someone else reacts so in terms of saying like I mean essentially what you're basically saying is that essentially white kids are only look up to white a\nWhite man you're smart you're ... you're you're smarter than this man you're drawing on the radio and I respect that you sound like a guy but you don't really believe what you just said because I think you believe that\nThis is I think that this is forcing us back towards the segregation\nOkay thank you Seventy seven five seven nine to five thank you for the phone\nCall I rented F we ran with what he said we'd be doing for hours on this today wrecked\nAnd it'd be easy to do and it'd be very divisive and we'd yell at each other but I mean I go ahead and know that you're trolling I can tell a very smart guy who wants to kick over the uh the hornet's nest that's you not today thank you were here to have fun\nOr Renee what's up if you are against black face then that is pro segregation and this is ...\nAnd I tell you I'm not a fan of it 'cause I have not heard one black person ever come out in support of this right site or why why are we going to say here's why but oh yeah this is totally okay to write on see anything wrong with that I never heard one black per say listen I'm cool with that I don't know why you guys get so worked up about ... right\nEven if the N. double ACP ends ah Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson all got together as a coalition and said hey no big deal with blackface we have way more important things to worry about that I can understand hockey is advocating for it but guess what until that happens let's go ahead and be a little bit culturally sensitive\nNot do it what's up Renee hey Hi\nUm I heard it's pretty much the\nLast straw that broke the camel's back apparently when she was on Fox ... and she made comments that Santa Claus was white than she did you have to expect except that in that Jesus as white air that bat right\nShe ... she says she locally because politically correct and there was also remembers that her ratings are very low in this in a way to get rid of it\n[noise] yeah um I don't know man if your ratings are low they can get rid of you for any reason she she made it very easy for them but they knew who they were getting when they brought her on board and\nThey shouldn't have been that surprise I Can't help but think\nThat there's an executive producer for Megan Kelly today there was a representative from the network and on their show prep meetings and at some point in time they should flush out hey we see you've got black face up on the board here Megan that's a sensitive area for you what do you plan on saying about it\nAnd then she could go oh a while I was just I don't see why it's racist and they will go okay here's the language you can use to where you don't end up getting

kid it was really nailed and to me that I should be a lawyer [laughter] and uh that was that was kind of like the main that was kind of the\nThe main focus and so I really kind of push down all of those deep desires and dreams my whole life and follow the path that I thought I was supposed to follow you know to lead to this fix that but I thought was what we were all you know hoping to have and then once I kinda had\nThat I just realized that this is a this is what I Want at all and so um you know once I kind of I I started getting into it as a design and started giving 'em slipping houses are getting the tiny houses right and then once I started seeing that there were these bands that\nLook like tiny houses and they function a lot like these tiny houses but they can lose and they can

wrong\nWell I Will say that you're about fifty percent right you get very far enough he fired up is a competitive guy but he is a Christian you're absolutely correct so when he's yelling and he's

over that run a bad you know a ... but um you know let them ... you can usually get a couple of guys that can be ... and ... um\nWhat I Would ask you guys about how do you feel about this whole kicking gay I mean\nWow has really changed as it seems like kick or they're just struggling a lot more than they used to I must be the extra point looking back on that but you know many games are coming down the kicker it then it's just like I I feel for the guys I mean no one really talked the kicker throughout the week or throughout the season until they have to kick one of those those right do you miss it you know that it's like\nEverybody knows your name and then if you make it in your hero but right it's it's a tough position of being ...\nVincent our guys when guys go out there to kick in the deep end till they yell and things that the ... lining up\nOh yeah oh yeah there there and here I mean they tried they tried to ice on the other and now you know you have guys walk on the field started yelling at him trying to figure out what his wife and kids names\nAre ... that I'm In it yeah it's pretty gnarly you know guys what are\nDefinitely getting your head there but you know that's that's why I get paid the big bucks man you got to be focused you gotta you know two and all that out and go to your job at a you know\nI think you know yeah if you could sum if I could solve any way I feel about kicking in the NFL over the last five to ten years or so it's the look on Justin Tucker's face when he missed the past week\nThat would have tied up the game that is every kicker in the NFL for some reason whether it's mental strength physical physical strength concentration or that extra distance on the extra point\nKick or not what they were\nFive ten years ago mentally and and I don't know how you find that ex military or how you find the next ... or someone like that man it's a it's so intriguing that these guys have all the pressure in the world and are treated somewhat like lepers either teammates who don't have to have during the week you know\n[laughter] I Know of and there there are so you know these guys got a job I mean it's a skill set right that's why there's only one on the ... and ... and it's very very important it takes a lot a lot of practice an effort on their behalf I mean I've seen teams have kicker come in throughout the season always try out new guys\nIt's oh it's very competitive I mean yeah six seven eight wide receivers on the team but you're only going to have carry one kicker um so it's very tough to make it in the NFL at the national Kippur so these guys are the best the best\nAnd um again they do have a favorite no pressure job that\nYou know it is not easy to do um it's it's not the individual sport you know football teams for it you know the old and all that but you know for the most part every other part of the game is really about a group of guys worked together kicking it was about one guy at a you know of all of the other and they go through those two polls\nMan alive a Tampa Bay buccaneers great Vincent Jackson joins us a good luck on Tuesday it as a donation dry for hurricane Michael relief supplies noon
