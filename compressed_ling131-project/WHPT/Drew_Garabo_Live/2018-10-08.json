work with but as she can work with me maybe she can work with anybody\nA including kept getting a and a ... and\nKelly came on the show and she learn the skills of being first iPhone screener and then a a a phone screener air personality and a borderline assistant to the assistant to the executive producer of Audrey grab alive\nAnd threw it all she does a lot of stuff off the air to make my job ridiculously easy um she on the air is a very unique presence as well\nAnd uh it was always my uh my dream that she would learn this and become the raw was to my Frasier Crane if I may use a a tossed salad and scrambled eggs reference\nA and then uh if my memory serves correctly I think we still have the audio of when this happened on January night two thousand fourteen ... a year and a half ago\nOkay no I just wanted more time to do what I Need you to better myself personally as opposed to bettering myself for the shell that makes sense\nOkay I I guess it does do you feel like this show stands in the way of you better and you're ...\nYou're twisting my words around I never said that the show was standing there\nAnd in fact I told you in our meeting that I wanted to stay with the show but there are time constraints on top of it so I felt that leaving and backing down would be the best way for me to go and then I wanted to set a date so that way we had enough time and you had enough time to see there was somebody else that you liked better than\nOkay poses a real quick that that was when Kayla turned in her six months' notice things from a mode of no deal refresh my memory wasn't something going on like something pretty traumatic what had happened the weekend before or something and I came into work on a Monday\nSomething bad or just happened yeah I I don't remember exactly what had happened but I there was some something was off a little bit me too so then I come into work until it says\nTo me that she says hey I got to talk to you about something and that's when she dropped a bomb on me that she was starting in her six months' notice and she was going to be expanding her bread or and leaving the show in favor of not a better opportunity but of no opportunity and and in my heart what I wanted to do at that time which is let her get the hell out of there I'm like if you don't want to be\nHere on the show pounds than you know we we don't if you don't want us we don't want you can certainly find somebody to take her place when you told me that day in the office\nI don't want to show anymore right I Want to be here that I'm done right which at the time seemed like the right thing to do right\nAnd which today seemed like the right thing to do no uh I knew then that it was going to happen again I knew then that this was not going to be a a a relationship that would last us throughout the rest of my career if someone tries to quit you watch they're going to quit on you again in my opinion so\nI've talked to a couple of people around here John Brennan I talked to said about it for awhile talked to geo and I realize you know what I think kale is making a mistake here I really feel like if she does want to leave us She's hell bent on leaving\nOkay but let me presented to you in a different way are you still got some work left to do here we can help you get to a new opportunity if you want to maybe you want to reconsider and the FEMA and the talk of the show that day was\nLet let's help you out and and let's make you not make you stay but help you stay here for a little while so that we can maybe help you get to where you want to go instead of leaving our chauffeur nothing we can get you to leave our show for something\nAnd uh and that day that we knew it would come a has come now and ... leaving the show\nUp on yes\nSo ... you know the last couple of weeks that I was leaving to go to Vegas on they presented me with an offer as everything and uh I accepted so I Will be leaving the station in two weeks to travel out west for another opportunity\nGood and we're very happy for you or we are disappointed that your new employer ... became knock on the air with us\nOne could say that makes them look like a tremendous policy I just did I mean well like we we reached out but like I don't know why the guy wouldn't talk to us how did you reach out I don't know how do we do need to reach and I have ... out [laughter]\nI texted him just to see when you guys were going over my demo tape basically a a couple of weeks ago on and he said that his ... his company wouldn't allow that [laughter]\nDon't know ... it just it wouldn't our little knife company wouldn't allow that and I just ... in that that Cox's very lenient and they really encourage us to be with everybody else in different radio stations around the market and now it's just pushing buttons\nThat knows your view of war I Would do the same thing I Would be like I'm going to work for like I don't care about my old guy\nAnd are you leaving to be a ... in the morning show or you leave it to be an executive producer what is the job title that you're leaving the show for\nI Will be leading to the ... in the morning zoo in Las Vegas Nevada\nThat's not really the name of the show [laughter]\nIn the\nOf\nTurns up [laughter] I Hope he has no volume levels um so it is chubby can in the mornings you is your name is becoming more easy with Kayla\nNo it just be ... in the mornings I'll be I'll be part of this you\nGot to wear like a little safari [laughter]\nAnd ah and talk to us about uh the brand like there's that's what everybody wants to know when she tried to leave the show the first time she felt like her brand could be better off expanding somewhere else or how does this affect the radio Kayla brand\nI think it's good for the brand the bread is very excited to travel out west I've never lived anywhere about Florida that's the one thing that I'm super excited about I've never lived anywhere but this area and lord I Lived in Tallahassee for a couple of years at the sites that\nBorn and raised here I'm I'm ready to go see what happens outlast and then if I don't like it I'll come back in a couple of you than you guys will see me again\nMaybe production surely a Florida resident again within one year everybody wants to take that one I'll take action\nShe told me about her contract so I think she's saying there for at least three years and then she's coming back home\nAnd he won ... know it'd be more than a year more than a year you were more than here I'm going to say year and a half\nYear and a half so that's a good guess I Know I I think it will be fine oh it will be yeah it really is that when you do morning radio you can attach to this and you do morning radio you pretty much have no life because you kind of go home and you settled back in your in bed by what six\nSeven o'clock in Vegas logging nice\nTry my adjustment as the one thing that I'm worried about because basically my bedtime there I mean nine o'clock there is ... is midnight here to\nTake you a week to just using a week you could move to Great Britain and within a week you would have the time thing down it's easy\nI'm more worried about traveling across country with my car I've never done it before going to drive yeah oh wow everything else like I had a moving company do everything for me but I moved the car [laughter]\nAh but I've never done it before and my parents take a trip now they're both retired so they're going to come across the country with me so it will be like old times when we used to travel to the mountains together\nI think we should renamed give Dick arrest give Kayla rest in her memory let her legacy live on on the show forever can we call give the brand or us yeah sure okay now now I'm it\nBy the way I'd like to remind you that tomorrow is actually are a three year anniversary\nWell was our through university I haven't left yet for\nThe day you are now it's the day you're no longer on the show so tomorrow's NATO three anniversary it would have been or three anniversary I think it's a three year anniversary and you can feel free to sink and tell all your new friends but he just fell short I we we can just sort of three years together and ...\nNo that is three years because my last day here will be not next friday but the Friday after\nYou may work here for the next two weeks but two days are less likely is your last day as regrettable live your a lame duck president for the next few weeks\nWhen I when I go to apply for another job and the next couple of years and I put down on my resume that I worked here technically it'll be three years on the show\nTechnically McNichol you have a minute [laughter] when you leave your you're gone once you leave here will you put drew down as

hours suffered if that's the thing about being on the ship is I don't know how people can maintain any sort of diet whatsoever and a lot of that that is to eat much bad food as possible\nOh I Would love to do like a like so like a science experience on my body like what it what it was like when I got on the ship to what is going to be like when I get off because it's just\nIt's just eating and drinking that's well that's what we're here\nTo do yup and we're definitely doing it it is the Celtic cruise twelve um we spent yesterday and causing all we haven't really talked much about that no or\nAnything we didn't we didn't talk about the uh the first party either where uh everybody Robert Kelly yeah Burt crash or perform All right\nThat was all about their let's go let's go back to that the um the welcome party is usually just like a welcome party there's ... has played them before and then um they did a comic night where it was the guy who won at ... uh\nI Can't remember the name he was funny though there's something ... another guy hands\nGreat love him and then a body Kelly in Denver crash or and the guys were offering great afterwards a Mike in ... came out and it was like they were they were taking snaps at each other's pretty it\nThey were roasting each I saw clips of the of the land crews and I thought they were roasting each other pretty good there but they got up and they were doing somewhat of a sing along but it just to kind of it's turned into a doll roasting each other and there was some there was very many cringe worthy moment there were\nI I'm really anxious to listen to my show on Tuesday Morning to hear just how many of those were good natured jobs and how many of those were below the belt jobs well\nLet's put it to like this the the ... most friendly joke made I think was a by Robert Kelly or to galvanize\nI'm Talking about how he how he he got fat again and that was the nicest joke I think I heard or map\nYou know hurt me to watch all that so that was fun that was the first night and then um I don't remember much\nAfter that will hold on let's let's get through this because I feel like I feel like we need to ... ... yeah friday um was a day at sea right uh I think we we just enjoyed to see a lot on that day was a lot of ... oh you want to know what we did on a lot on on friday\nWas we spend a lot of time at the uh the serenity deck which only one and over a adults on the sex swinging club\nThere's no sex or swinging club but there are no kids either which is just great see go up there and it's a little bit quieter and hang out in or out of the sun yeah a couple of hot tubs up there we just been a lot of time up there\nAnd then um those are friday day at the friday night against our better judgment we went back to the to the dinner that night before\nThat was the that was that was the formal dinner we all we all look nice you work tie you were looking very dapper we all got you well got dressed up in a\nYeah went to dinner it was a long long\nDinner the dinners here I mean I think I don't know if that's what people kind of look for because a lot of people don't go out for like fancy dining maybe they're looking for five hours worth of a dining experience but to me I just I Want to live\nYeah I Want to live somewhere other than trapped at that table and I and you know our tables great we've got John Brennan and his brother and his awesome wife and then\nAnd a Micah Joes there and it's a fun table\nIt is it's a it's a great table it's just that uh the food takes forever and the drinks take federal yeah gee is at our table Fiji oh is that er table often forgotten geo [laughter]\nUm the ... the food has been let me put it like this every meal that I eat here that's not a guy furious burger right is just one step closer to me getting another guy fury burger yeah\nI understand that you've separated foods and the two categories are guys burgers and everything else\nDid I've I've separated now my life into that are there there was a a G be [laughter] and then everything after that yeah [laughter]\nI I Will tell you the food is is everywhere um the desert that we had last night with that\nApple horrible thing with the ...\nLast night so last night we had we had we were tired of the construct of sitting down and dining with everybody who went on our own door buffet yeah and it's just I like I like eating in my own pace I like my salad having all the topics that I wanted to have on I like my apple Chris with more crest unless apple with ice cream\nAnd and getting it at my leisure I think tonight I'm going to go back to the regular dinner because of this last night so I figure we should probably do that and she'll probably be on the right thing to do I'm so let's talk about uh causing all Mexico we had a lot of a fear going into Mexico that we're going to be abducted by the cartel um there was very easy to get into that country\nCan I tell you this so it was it was great we get off the ship we get over to ... to play a ... or me or what about uh let's see if we get there and and I'm feeling pretty safe and I haven't had a thought about being abducted or decapitated or anything and we get there and the surveyor comes over and he brings our drinks and he goes you\nAre very safe here guys you're very safe don't worry don't worry about anything you are safe it's not just me here watching you we have cameras everywhere and I was like\nWhy I Know\nWhat's the matter that speech to not do anything to him I had to be like if anything it just made me feel like we had something to worry about\n[noise] uh but then you know uh we got to experience the or the beach there was a lot of really cool listeners some authentic Mexican food um and uh\nHas passed away yesterday what

become ...\nVery very close but I think it's the first time that I've ever\nLaid in bed with you\nIt's definitely the first time we've recorded it for audio\n... what was interesting I also think that there's a representation here of\nHow much closer we've become just over the cruise because recorded our first pod cast in this room and I remember thinking to myself\nBeing hesitant to sit on the corner of that I remember thinking to myself like who wants to other people sitting on their bed right and here we are just two days later I'm ... I'm In your bag or you are I'm In it it's very cozy very relaxed I there's no place in the world I'd rather be\nThis is how audio should be recorded always [laughter] um so yeah you're the first person to be in his bed beside me and the whole cruise so you've done a fine job of keeping the female persuasion away for ...\nIt and I and then I can strongly say that that is that that is the fact last night I left you just a little before but most most nights I've you know all put you to bed you know we've spent our last moments together yeah last night we left each other a little early but I can I can safely say\nNothing on me has um it's a of acted a respectfully which is good of the girls have been really cool to I mean they listen to the show they\nKnow that I'm not looking to uh you know hook up or smash or anything like that so um everybody you know everybody's been respectful and and it's been fun everybody's been cool there's been really nobody to creepy\nI mean there's been a few incidents of people kind of have an interest to drink and\nIt's it's interesting because I'd like I'd been in in the presence of\nOf you specifically with multiple people who you can tell that they they're trying to be as nice as possible but the words that are coming out of their mouth or just ... you were you were in the we're in the hot tub with the dude yesterday oh my God it was like you could tell just was like\nHe was starstruck pretty much right but every time he opens his mouth he was just saying things worse and worse and he wanted you to you want it to make sure that you looked at him when you were speaking are like\nHey man can you look at me when you're talking to me and I go what are you there there's a there's a pool here I'm looking everywhere and then he goes\nHey man I can be ... [laughter] and I said what he said I'm going to be ... to the guys on your show ever say anything about that I go no no they never really told me that I should say Bob or that it'll swallowed up why do you not feel like a violin up he said well are you happy [laughter]\nIt's a really really happy amount of having a great job I just I just I just don't have a resting while face so now I'm self conscious and I'm trying to like let everybody know what a good time I have with with my eyes embassy you are having\nA good you know you have there been any ... I'll I'll say I expected the third to be stronger I Know that there are women out there possibly respecting your boundaries\nPossibly yet um especially given all the ladies who are on the cruise yeah they um they have respected boundaries big time um\nI I don't feel like anybody trying to think they're causing to me or anything and I um last night after I say goodbye to you guys there are a bunch of people sitting around watching the guys sing and play and I just whispering in Spanish his ear ... and when I go back to my room and a and fall asleep and that's exactly what I did\nHave you perjure yourself at all and the crews\nUm so the first night [noise] um yeah my uh my\nGirlfriend and I face time and I'm okay with it and after ... I guess yeah except we did it over time which is which is cool I'm you know\nWe're like on your face time if that's exactly what it is so that was neat um and yeah that was the only uh how about you how your have your best efforts but it's\nNot what I'd like to be um I had one chance there's been like these periods of the day where I go back to the to the cabin for a nap in the dark\nAnd then usually like Joe and I've kind of lost each other he's my roommate ... each other during the day so I don't know where he is right so then I sneak back to the room for a quick you know yeah afternoon delight with myself or and then both times that's happened Joe is as you know yeah\nShowed up both times so I'm a and that's how that has been workshop you because you know it has so this point I'm like edge to myself like multiple times throughout the trip so boy\nI've just I'm worried about when I get out of here using yourself man seriously I'm ready to work for you change pants and I didn't\nPay off um so it is our last day it's a it's just the day and the weather outside you just could only be described as dingy um breezy the seas are a little bit rough and we are indeed headed back to Florida right as a storm system heads are way\nYeah it doesn't make much sense to like literally talk about the weather since it's going to be a day behind but I from what I can see right now this is going to be tropical storm Michael it might actually be tropical storm Michael already and it legitimately formed\nRight over where we were we were in causing Mel uh yesterday and this is right in the area was it was for me and now I ... I think we're running from it that's the way I found on our hits hard on our tail and then from everything they're saying\nRight now it it will probably make landfall fall somewhere or in the panhandle of Florida at least today which by the time you hear this could be it could be coming for you\n[laughter] we can be God a yard joyous Suzie as them yesterday when a talking about someone falling overboard on the ship in the store and then be hoping for someone to fall over on this\nFalling overboard and I've said this for falling overboard on a cruise ship is one of the most fascinating terrifying things that like if you just allow your mind to just go to that place to think about what it's like if you're fall overboard on a cruise ship it's one of the scariest things you could ever imagine\nThere's no doubt because within a blink of your eyes the cruise ship is miles away from you you can't swim against this current and no one knows that you're off of the cruise ship\nAll in in in the thing is is in this weather specifically if you had been drinking all day in and you're you're not very with it and you stumble your way out to the edge of one of these guard rails and one of these big waves hits us You're just in the water and then like no one even knows you're gone\nYou're right and I don't know how many times it happens we do see news stories from part of the times where that does happen and you can totally see how it does with them because these swirling wins in the rough seas that we're experiencing right now\nIt I'm One of the things that we went and did um I think you I think it was friday was RCA we went to when we went and attempted to sing karaoke\nYeah I um I don't have much memory of that I remember sitting in the karaoke place I'm are turning in for the empty dads and not getting picked\nDid yeah it was um that was a little bit of a hazy day as well I remember Mike or got up uh in somebody put on hold on what they are there was somebody by the name of precious who put it in a song and they didn't show up for their songs to make a got up and pretended to be precious\nThat should really be a a and I already of are getting somewhere that's got at least one good game on because if we uh at this point\nUh the sporting weekend consisted of Conor McGregor getting tapped out which which we missed last night we didn't see on the boat um Florida State lost by one point to Miami is cool\nBullets won in a shootout or did not get a chance to see any of that 'cause they don't have it on the boat but there were a lot of votes fans\nI Believe that are a ... was was that the game I think that they didn't see any social media regarding it but I Believe he was there\nI think you're right and um that yeah we haven't gotten to watch a lot of sports so we'll find a a a television with some NFL football and watch it and then we'll go to sleep and they'll wake up I Want to get off the boat and will listen to this on the radio
