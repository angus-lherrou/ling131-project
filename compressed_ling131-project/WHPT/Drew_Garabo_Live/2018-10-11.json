also see ghosts better than humans\nThey say that that pets\nRespond to the supernatural more profoundly than we do as human beings course they do do do you think that Brody has seen a ghost\nUm I mean there's been there's nothing traumatic that I can you know bring but there there are times where you see him doing something you're like what in the hell is he looking at what is what is going on so I mean those little moments um but I I Believe in ghost I think there are ghost\nThat that all over everywhere okay there could be a ghost here right now for all we know\nSo let's work through that [noise] um ghosts what is it to you is it an aberration\nHere's the thing I Can't give you the philosophical breakdown of what I think a ghost is all I Know is that when you have that many people who believe they've seen something all you need is one of them to be telling the truth for it to be real\nRight they could be telling the truth that that's what they thought that they saw\nWell some things you are just things you think you see I mean if I see do walking across my living room in the middle you know in the middle of the night and I see that right that's what I saw ... have you seen a dude walking ... milk [laughter] not if I didn't invite 'em [laughter] see\nNot saying that nothing happens to us and when we die I don't think anything happens to us when we die but I'm open to anything I'm open to heaven hell purgatory\nI'm open to our energy dissipating into the universe and becoming something else I'm open to reincarnation I'm open to any of it 'cause I'm I don't know with certainty I don't think anything happens I think when you're dead you're you're dead\nSo within that possibility why can't it be some of us\nBecause for me to believe that means that I had to buy into\nThis physical being this vintage of mine is somehow going to appear after I die\nLike if I die tightly deaths and an sadly tragic death I choked to death thought a chick pea or garb positive being you know the difference and I I pass in the studio\nAnd I will forever hearts\nThis room\nChild goes to a break and he looked up and there's just a flicker of me in the corner like am I actually buy me on the cruise I mean\nWhen you say it like that it sounds like it might not be possible but [noise]\nBut I don't think\nThat after we die we're here\nIn this key\nI also don't think I don't think it's everybody I don't think everybody dies in everybody becomes a ghost in the world is just full of goes just running amok\nSo then then who decides who gets to be like I said I don't know you know what happened to maybe it's a scientific thing maybe there's a certain you know acidic compound in certain bodies that allows they're sold to live on after they die\nI don't know but I Do believe that these people have seen ghost and I think ghost exists out there\nSeventy seven five seven nine one or two five and eight hundred seven seven one one or two five to grab a lot hello who are

they say I'm ... girl had had funny situation that happened to me they are real\nOkay ... please help me out here I'm I'm automatically cynical I immediately don't don't I\nI Believe that you believe you've seen ghosts but I don't believe that you see him go does that make sense\nI get what you're saying but when you expand yourself then you go down and have your own experience I've had quite a few\nOkay talk to me about the most significant one what you saw where you were et cetera\nDo you want something creepy creepy or he didn't want something just miles says I have so many that it's crazy\nTo me I Will take creepy upon creepy upon creepy\nAlright I'll make a long story short a as a child my mom woke me up and up I'm washing dishes and things\nLike hire the nail ... to the back door and my childhood home in our current and I look at it and looked at me and read out the front door\nThey probably have some beers and get along\nUntil they started talking about politics\nAnd things that quote unquote matter now the bad news is that we're more divided than we've ever been the good news is Seventy seven percent of people think that we can fix it\nNow\nI have no idea how other than new social media and frightening everyone that you know getting off Twitter Facebook Snapchat Instagram emails everything I don't know how we put it back together I don't know\nIt feels like it can only get worse because I mean it's it's just a cycle I mean at this point the cycle is in place I mean in the immediate future we're going to have an election uh you know Donald Trump very well might get reelected half of the country will be absolutely disgusted with the other half\nAnd then you know in another four years all get fired up again over whoever's next\nI respect people's passion and if you truly believe\nWe live in a totalitarian state and you need to to decry the president from the moment you wake up until you go to bed at night because that gives you purpose and you feel like you're fighting for something your family your children whatever\nOkay All right I respect that I I don't know that it's quote unquote healthy for you but I respect that you have that passion just like have respect for people to wake up and go finally we have a president who's not a career politician who's getting things done\nWho's going to bring in Kanye West and kid rock on the same day for a hell of a lunch in\nWell Connie I missed the watching\nThe well he showed eventually right he missed the signing of some big new music\nBill right they they ... which if someone can explain it to me I'd love to hear it I tried to read up on it I don't know how it's good for the music industry but kid rock side it and and I guess ... years okay with it [laughter]\nIt's just so weird to me to watch that video of Kanye talking to the president [laughter] 'cause 'cause Kanye is is on another level the guy is\nDeep perhaps a bit skewed\nAnd he's showing the president what he thinks should be air force one on his phone did you see that I did\nI also saw that the password for ... stone is zero zero zero zero you did see somebody was behind him when he was punching in his\nOffice phone [laughter] two seven five seven nine to five and eight hundred seven seven one one or two five so how do we do with that how\nDo we regain the ability to go I disagree with you fundamentally\nYou are still in American you have the right to feel the way you do I hope that you respect my right to feel the way I Do and let's work this out\nThe answer is not a good one it's not possible\nI don't think it is I I I don't think there's putting the toothpaste back in the two I think we squeeze the aim gleam aqua fresh Colgate or crest all over the counter\nIn in the phone call that we would get on this would be one of them damn liberals who just don't shut up and realized they around\nOr on the other half is so freaking [laughter] the Nazis\nYeah I uh I there's there's no there's no middle ground we've got snowflakes the Nazis and when I guess I got accepted which one are you [laughter] I don't want to be either [laughter] Seventy seven five seven I Want to do five deer out alive hello\nHey this or that does that I download somebody\nHey ah that that goes thing I I'm I never see that those but a shady nah the\nBan I thought I Can't take it seriously when you say I seen I'm Sorry just certain things you should tweak in your vocabulary I'm not telling you how to live your life certain things should tweak I seen as one of them I'm I'm not trying to be a grammar not your grammar snowflake\nPlease if you want to appear intelligent to other people\nEliminate the phrase I seen I have seen or I saw sir I'm sure you're a nice guy I'm sure you've seen what you've seen but if you just do mean that solid I'm not going to mess with your two two or two I'm not going to mess with you there are there\nI'm not going to mess with your your your are your apostrophe or whatever just no more I seemed pleased for the love of God if you believe in God do not alive hello\nHello Hi how are you a G me hey drew an\nAll just focus on that fat only about a ... okay winter of facts of wills you don't know facts from all sides huh trolls from fall sold but\nWho gets to tell us what our facts\nNew you go to school you have books you read the newspapers\nBut up at the newspapers they're slanted they're they're biased there one way or the other really\nYeah well this is the\nHopefully you know you ... you read newspapers that have a a high journalistic principles which are designed to account for the biases yeah like a war\nOkay thank you sir I appreciate that the what I'm saying is there is no more unfiltered unbiased news there's there's just there's Fox News given neither side they're CNN given either side they're tough though there's Washington Post there's truth wars infowars but who's giving you the truth what's really happening\nWell I think it's when you get pulled when things I mean 'cause you could watch the news station all day that covered quote unquote news in America if it didn't have to do with with anything political I don't know if that's\nNecessarily what most people are looking for but you can get the news like the news you get on your local news for the for the nation but people don't want that people want something to feed their beliefs\nAnd the new that and the tail wags the dog because then the news stations go man look at this response that we get when we take a pro Trump slant or look at the response that we get when we take an anti Trump slant\nSo then you end up just feeding your core demographic as they just open up their mouths you shovel all this horse manure into their mouths and they do is just one or the alarm you\nLet me tell you you could tell me I was in fact\nHorse video does not taste like it was on you you learn anything so then we have no agenda on the show despite the fact that we lean a little bit more left than I lean a little bit more or less than the other shows on his style I have an agenda I I don't I don't mean nor do I want you to fall in step with what I Believe\nIf I can teach you anything and I can't it's that you should have a healthy distrust of most if not all media sources except for of course this one\n'cause I Am telling you that I have not bought nor paid for\nBy any political group or any opinion piece or think peace or anything the only people that pay my bills Cox media group Tampa they they give me very little guidance which is good they can be very little direction on what angle to take on what stories\nAnd then the the sponsors that pay me to tell you about their their products and services or someone who says hey get in there and and go against Trump because everybody's doing for Trump or go for Trump more because that's going to move the needle a little bit Seventy seven five seven I went up to five what's up ...\n... ... or like that and it's one of the world but it sure is a true independent\nBut we need to look for Twenty years later and expertise to try it will show all ... it away for the aged ...\nLotion rhetoric that you go to those people are getting it all adds up to orange rely on that ... what is going to work as well as the bell a strike towards work\nDo you ever do you feel like\n... this is the way I feel and I want to see if you feel the same because you and I ... I agree with a lot of what you said do you feel like maybe we have been\nControlled by the media that we have been pigeonholed and we had been successfully divided\nThe and I don't know if it's the trial lateral commission or the builder burgers or the Rothschild or the Koch brothers are the ... of the world I don't know who did it but someone successfully managed\nTo just drive or a steak right through them and not a delicious ... a state wide through the middle of America and go you're on this side you're on the inside your enemies we win\nWell it's pandering demographics right so you could have a news story they matter what and if you let's say you look at it there's a right\nOn the story straight you're going to let's say you're going to have a slightly more left me a story and I think people need to get their news from the aggregate sources\nIs a good idea for that it will lose on average just aggregate right age at like ... or ... or the story in going forever\nAnd it's true you know by ... or different you know war what you would consider normal sources like eagle freedom order whatever De Niro conclusion and it didn't get it okay\nTo come up with what makes sense for the ... how are the most people that\nI like it man thank you very much I'm Glad there's one dude like you out there\nBut the thing is that is asking way too much of the general population of the United states of America they\nThat lady who ah who went at me or the or the African American lady very prominent lady on Twitter\nOh yeah you did tell me about that who\nUh who went at me because of the color of skin because\nI'm white I'm not an ally like I Can't possibly be an ally and speak out against racism because of the color of my skin and it uh it it left me honestly it left me hurt that someone I respected on Twitter that I got along with\nWould would accuse me of not pressing charges of the girl who taught me in the face because she was a white lady not even a cute she was convinced that had been an African American lady hit me in the face that I Would have called the cops\nAnd I would not have no matter what the color of the skin was but she was convinced and because of that I'm not an ally\n... it's interesting what people want to fight a issues that don't exist [laughter]\nLike she was on this day I was mad at you for something that didn't happen she wants to you [laughter] she wants to punish you for something that that didn't actually happen but she knows how you would react if it did I don't know how it would have reacted is your name Helena\nYes it is how you doing a good young lady how are you what nationality are you\nI Am African American is Sunni Muslim and I was calling is my first time calling ever radio a male great ... [laughter] and um I was calling about the whole goes thing and as far as Muslims to lean at least um the things that people are seeing aren't\nGoes they're not people spirit there again which is\nAnother creation that God made that believing in the ... the adolescent necessarily believe in so I too as a child had um [noise] like uh I saw something in the wall\nWas sleeping and I actually spoke to these things though we believe that the gin take form of people maybe you did have a loved one and you know they play around\nThey're not supposed to be a long story behind that whatever the not posted like bother you but we believe that if you see something that supposedly is considered a goes to people aren't listening there most likely the agenda which is a whole nother creation talks about in the car on like again\nIs that Jay I imagine ... yeah ...\nYeah I I've seen that before I didn't know what that meant and uh and now it makes a little bit more sense you know in other words these these other worldly operations sometimes take the human form of someone so you might see a personnel not really wow that is so fast it's so interesting and and as they\nLive longer than that so they live that supposedly they like live\nLonger and each child that's Lawrence is assigned again from like you know the state on which is\nThe devil or whatever they're not all that some of them convert there's many Gen and different religions but yeah that's what we believe\nSo do you do okay as a Muslim or ... oh so interesting to me because\nWe think that we're right when it comes to religion I I don't have a religion therefore I I don't I don't think I'm right I don't think I'm wrong I have no religion but\nEvery religion thinks that they're the ones that are right and that everyone else was the heat and everyone else was wrong\nBut someone's maybe nobody's right you know what I mean like maybe maybe we haven't had that the story through years of people trying to control the way we think is going I mean we got to come up with the way you know Karl Marx said at the religions the opiate of the masses are\nSo many more program to if we were all lawless society if you do not believe in the granite the Christians and I believe in the Bible of Jews did not believe in the Old Testament\nWould maybe we'd be killing each other maybe we would literally go to someone that go hey I like the way you look boom you're dead you know\nRight I don't have like an endless than my whole entire life so um my mother was from a\nCatholic religion and my father was from Philly and he was Christian and they met up had me and became list them and I was three so\nI had the oldest at twelve children and so my other sister asking me she converted to Christianity a couple of years ago and my brother just recently came out in the heat isn't Muslim So\nClearly I agree with you like everyone we don't know one you know we believe that we know that it's an issue but there are people who don't and so I don't know\nI like your mindset thank you very much for the phone call and I hope you'll call again thank you don't appreciate that I didn't mean to say\nDarn when I was somewhat a

eight hundred and seven seven one would have to five to grab a live alone [laughter]\nHey I had a comment about the other thing I get I understand that some people think that it's like it's racist but honestly I Love doing the gas station or maybe edit them like a way does so I think it's just your perspective on how you look at it\nWell sure I can understand your perspective but I think you could also look at it from the perspective of the young lady who called up and if that's your only Indian American representation on television you can certainly understand how that would land poorly with people\nI I can agree with that however maybe they should have some other character so maybe some other church or something oh maybe why should they be analyzed so to speak or being the wants to do that but no one else doing anything well\nIs it better to have no Indian representation on television or a or one that promotes a stereotypical version it's a good question\nAnd I don't know the answer well\nThe thing is is that there are a lot of really really good stories about people I grew up down the road from a from a guy um who actually got\nOut of Iraq and in was escaping so he can have a better life for his family and you hope his family open multiple little party stores corner stores in Michigan around Michigan\nAnd it was a great story and there are many people who got out of oppressive places and bad scenarios and were able to live the American dream and start these businesses and now are doing wonderful things for the family when I hear that story and I see it portrayed I don't look at it as a negative stereotypes that was there was also a lot of doctors yes\nBut that was a very feasible path for people to start businesses and and Ruth or families in America\nCompletely different story if you have an Indian American doing the voice of up who then hackers area\nI think yeah but the fact that they have a white do do it I don't know I don't think is there is wide I don't know what the hell is to not alive low\n[noise] real question is who is going to kill a pool and the episode oh snap [noise]\nI don't know who who would do it or what's up with a sideshow Bob he's still thing yeah especially is such a Bob would come back into the serial killer\nIt was only I mean typically just wants to kill Barton cross the but uh but yeah I think he would branch out and\nWhat if he was trying to kill bart bart ran into the store for first savior and then he accidentally killed them\nBought ... and that's a that's Kelsey grammar Frasier\nI maybe I should try to show\nMaybe make a snake the criminal the criminal kills up to ... to ... to ... to me to work on The Simpsons was how'd you get out alive who are you\nYellow hello a\nLot of that

that nobody's really talking about here is the voice actors themselves\nThey're doing their job and they're passionate about what they're doing I'm sure they don't mean any uh ill intention was people seem to think when they see a stereotypical character on television\nThey take it way too personally I I myself or from middle Georgia so I have a lot of a family would be considered rednecks right and if you see read an expert to portrayed on television are usually not the most intelligent people\nI Know they're not talking about me personally right hey I have some people in my family who to fit that description so I find humor in it\nYeah but I have that but like but but on the other side of the ... in what the guy said laughing at everybody sure you you try to have a healthy\nDose of humor in your life and laugh at every one but like suppose they have a Jewish character and all they do is try to swindle people out of money you save money because that's the stereotype about Jewish people it it just goes in and and promotes that stereotype that not exactly helpful\nYou know if it's a disparaging good or bad absolutely agree but if it's something\nLike ... I cannot I'm not an Indian American but I don't know if I were an Indian American had a family of a large Indian American family someone in my family is my run a convenience store and speak with an accent and I could relate to that and it started disparaging thing\nRight like what you ... if if it were a Jewish Christian Slater labor ... or whatever that's wrong that's that's that's not you know if that's a a negative connotation or a negative representation I got I mean tell tell me I read that talk like this on TV I felt like he rate from Shakespeare\nNo you won't find the payment of the shrew that's one hail the piece of work but man I'm more of A Midsummer Night's Dream guy\nScrew you hey I'm leader die hey I'm white or gee do you follow that\nCrown prince of Denmark and that damn Rosa grand to kill Mr coming over from Denmark trying to find that hamlet\nOr he kills his daddy man that's got a Shakespeare either Shakespeare for it and they try to hear about\nMac bath what's that that new burger from McDonalds now mayor back that that story about them damn wages wages and which is Eastwick hey I don't know when we talk for a second about Pygmalion about what\nThat I Know Shakespeare that's at Arthur sir Arthur Connecticut Yankee and king Arthur Stuart can you're advocating are preserved that's money I'd actually watch that\nYou do you does your part to change the stereotype I mean you um you change your your your racist voice from a redneck too uh yep to a northerner you've done your part\nI really have to offend everyone I've ... I've changed what I Want to make fun of racist I no longer go hey\nDon't care for black people too much to a free black people in my right\nBecause there is as much racism up north as there is down here in the south we've you know we just were practicing in a long time Seventy seven five seven nine one one by we I mean you I'm OK we always born celebrity deaths because we do with the person because we we have a certain image of the person\nSunrise from our colleague at the AJC Atlanta Journal constitution Jamie ... is a great job he wrote a tactic summary on it [noise]\nWearing a signature red make America great again make America great again baseball cap rapper and producer Kanye West dominated a meeting with President Donald Trump in the oval office they you know a lot of the body language and our president had his arms folded a lot\nHe he always has his arms folded that is like his position\nIt's a very um it's a very it's like a defensive but kind of\nClose as we talk yeah like ours folded I figured it out well\nI think that's considered somewhat of an aggressive stance I mean if not to your closing off your your your when you have your arms folded your your closing yourself off to something\nRight a county declared that the ... made him feel like Superman\nOr he dropped a bomb and more before reporters talked about running for president himself and twenty twenty four he smoked for nearly ten minutes straight at one point in time make clear again he is a big supporter of the president's policies especially on North Korea you stop the war said Mr west at one point\nAnd the president said quote\nI tell you what that was pretty impressive that was quite something and ... said it was from the soul I channeled it and he called President Trump a master of industry which hey say what you will about the guy he knows industry does business ...\nDo you think there's somebody on that side of the spectrum whether it be a Jay Z whether it be a Kendrick Lamar because obviously ... exist in this world where and I'm not saying this is a negative thing it's been publicized that deals with mental health day like we don't know where he's at or what he really believed but is there somebody from that world that could come out and say\nHey Donald Trump isn't as bad as you think he is in some of the stuff he's doing is helping you is really helping a lot of people in this country is that does that person exist that people would then listened to\nSee that's the thing the minute that Conyers shoot diminished the economy of war that McGahn that\nA lot of people including people in his inner circle like I don't get to do what do you do it you're not supposed to do that\nTrying to tell ... that he can't think that way that you can't be a free thinker now if ... you know Jay Z if he had said a\nI met with Donald Trump and he's he's got some look I have issues with some of the things but he's got some decent things to say I think people might listen to him a little bit more than they listen to ... people like the label Conyers crazy play a little of the audio for it uh hopefully he does not\nAnd this also known as clean version of hell for basically an economic growth for the that name radius or supermax of Florence, Colorado [noise] sales of Unabomber Alcott operatives mass\nOrders from the farmer things with an edge however losing sixty six to eight years old is really the reason why they have\nIt's because it's starting to a positive for the community we started showing that he actually had power that he wasn't just one of a monolithic voiced but he can ... people around so their series that there's infinite amounts of universe in this alternate universe so it's very important for me\nTo get who've around because an alternate universe I in him and I have to go and get him free because he was doing positive inside of Chicago\nJust like how moving back to Chicago and not just about you know getting on stage and be an entertainer and having a monolithic voice that for for ... the sound\nLike somebody had monolithic as the word of the day and they're Callow\nWow he uh he's really going for\nA gym round sitting next and blows my mind because I just saw Mr Brown at the uh debartolo gala this past week or this past year and a a phenomenal speaker civil rights activist an athlete and to see him sitting next to John you're you just wonder what's going through his mind\nWhere's Bob I Know I Know kid rock was in the house as well yeah did he get there and he'll be in Tampa tomorrow night maybe you had to get out of there and catch a flight I met with our\nPresident and I know I I don't know why or why but I bet you didn't stick around maybe just wanted to sign that music bill and get the hell out of dodge not sure\nHe specifically party people expect that if you're black you have to be Democrats I have a uh I've I've had conversations that basically said that welfare is the reason why a lot of black people end up being a Democrat they say you know first of all it is a limited\nAmount of ... white dude says the welfare of the reason that black people you know Democrats\nAre getting more money for having more kids in your home and then we got rid of the mental\nHealth Institute in the eighties and nineties and the fritter rate just shot up now you have shot Iraq was people called ... which is actually are a murder rate is going down but twenty percent every year I just talked to the superintendent that when Microsoft Access Ron ...\nRight hand man so uh I think it's the bravery that helps you beat this game called life you know they try to scare me to not ready to have my own friends but it's had fiercely it gives me hiring away you know my dad\nAnd my mom's separated so I didn't have a lot of mail energy in my home and also uh I'm married to a family that I'm not a lot of mail energy going on that beautiful though there are times where you know something about\nThat is true the closest thing to mail energy is a Nineteen Seventy athlete named Bruce Jenner who's now Caitlin\nIs he getting at the fact that Donald Trump is like a father figure to him and I know what he's getting it you're saying he feels the male energy you see so he he gets his whole spiel about\nIn the beginning about how he's gotta go get this guy to jail because he feels like it could be him from a past life and he sounds crazy and then he goes on you know where he's talking about policies and he's he's he can't be completely gone he seems I I have to wonder if he fully understand what he's doing\nI don't think so I I think ... finds itself I think I'm sure he before he goes to bed at night he thinks wow wow look at me I got to meet with the president today and speak my mind in front of a room full of cameras it is nuts and then you listen to his newer ... newest album\nAnd uh you listen to some of the songs on there and you go the students not wrap very tightly at all\nYou know I Love Hillary I Love everyone writes but the campaign I'm with her just didn't make me feel is a guy that didn't get to see my dad all the time like\nThat could play catch with his son it was something about when I put his hat off and made me feel like Superman you made a super man that was that's my favorite superhero and you made a supermax Cape for me also as a guy that looks up to you look up to ...\nThere's the language okay so you're down five seven nine to five I I Love the passion but as a broadcaster ... just be as would have worked very well there\nDo we do we like having a president who you can turn on and see him just having a conversation with somebody like me Kanye West pick out of the the situation his political leanings\nI've never sat and watched anything like that where where president having a mainstream artist in touch just have a conversation for everybody to see\nSt George Bush obviously didn't care about black people as Congress and Senate abrupt\nAnd Jay Z met right abroad yeah ...\nMeetings and maybe it's because this is so polarized like this feels different but I just it doesn't seem like I remember turning on the scene just open forum conversations between celebrities and the president in the oval office\nCorrect and we should encourage people to have these conversations and listen to these conversations even if you disagree with proper you can't stand Tanya hey\nListen to the two of them talk and you'll realize\nWhere we are in America and we're ... we are whatever plan at least from\nWhat the beep on it however you want to do a five seconds to like it just goes in and get it done right now you gave me the heart to go to a seat is because at the heat is when I went in\nAnd two thousand Fifteen we're fourteen billion dollar company loses two billion dollars a year now we have a thirty eight billion dollar market calf it's called the easy effect and I went\nTo cast for we had a meeting of Chicago and I said\nYou have to bring manufacturing\nOn shore instead even shore into the core\nIt's not about the borders the core of the to Chicago is the core middle America we have to make middle America strong so I\nHad the ball because I had enough votes to put on his hat I mean just the latest thing made me a billionaire and I could have lost two hundred million dollars walking away from that deal but even with that\nI knew it was more important for me to take the chance of walking away from that deal than I have no fathers in Chicago with no halls and when we do have written a reformation\nFor no cause it's oh it's ... not rehabilitation 'cause they didn't have the ability and the first place we never had any one it's hard to teach us that we had no power that's right\nSo I'm a it's more important than any specific deal any anything that we bring jobs into America and that we provide a transition with mental health in the mirror I can uh education curriculum that\nA gym it's worked on Larry Hoover also have a curriculum that he's worked only have Montessori curriculum that we worked on ... works at the beautiful ... the walls off I'm a thousand that has a cricket\nModel edited goes a long way you know a little longer but still love what do you have to say Seventy seven five seven nine to five and eight hundred seven seven one one or two five\nIt's too easy to say ... crazy and I'm not saying that he is the same as individual you're going to run into\nPeople calling him crazy I think it's got a little more teeth to it there's a little more something behind it rather than just saying he's crazy for agreeing with Trump I think people would try to attribute his ah him aligned with Trump to the fact that he battles with mental illness\nCorrect and Jim Brown has been an outspoken civil rights activists for a long time says things that gets under ...\nSkin like this today outside the White House where\nWe had the opportunity to meet with the president of the United states which everybody doesn't have the privilege\nAnd with me at eighty two years old\nThe only thing I could talk about is how to help other people\nAnd how how to help out young people in this country the violence and how to deal with life skills education which American program promotes program I've been working with Thirty years so it was a positive\nAnd he said I don't think that we should be taking knees in protest instead of standing up for our flag Seventy seven five seven I Want to do five you certainly feel that way I respect fully disagree to grab a lot of low hold on one second oh let's see [noise] Rob you say Conyers disgusting what's disgusting about him\nHe's discussing I honestly uh for someone who never bought her country done anything for our country rather than just put a raft\nAll the stuff that's disgusting what the hell do that route just\nOr he'll even mentioned that you had the opportunity to beat the president with other people has the same thing with Kim it's disgusting how they are doing that so we need to stop this on uh fortunately it\nStopped as like why would you have a problem with the guy taking advantage of his fame and speaking to the president I don't understand what's disgusting about it\nI had more respect for people try to uh get a child molesters and stuff off the street\nOkay that was down and sure they can speak to you haven't told me what's disgusting about our about Tanya was speaking to our president what the\nConversation at ... de way he speaks away he just goes all his rant ... he's not all there of\nCourse so what so mentally ill people are discussing too you\nKnow no no no just said he should not you'll get a category 'cause they should it be to go through you know about that just go through it and make sure\nNo I don't know what you're talking about making any sense whatsoever you're now you're never going to get to speak to the president because you can't speak\nBut Conyers should certainly be encouraged to speak to the president even if you don't like what do you have to say president well you don't have to but they don't go to you and go Hey Joe jak off do you think that the president should be able to speak to Kanye West no ties super rich and famous and he ... he has the president's hair\nYou speak for our country that we're talking about take that back Joe jak off your now Joe champion\nIf there is one tried to take from that guy's phone call ... ... is the president the United states is using his time best by spending it with some ... in Kanye West now that's a great glass that that that's a little more reasonable way to to to frame that\nThat I can understand will dig a little deeper into the conversation between Mr Trump and Mr west so crazy if you miss it earlier in the show good and bad news
