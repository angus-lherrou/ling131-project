I mean he sounded a little is fixated you sound like you're really you're gasping for breath you OK\nSolicit it 'cause I think I'll just tell you what I was like I said I was a lovely\n... who I can understand where you would think that it was a bit of obfuscation or press the digital ... involved in the housing of one Big Mac in one bite but I assure you although both beef patties were consumed by me just like crazy Patty was consumed by you\nKnow\n[noise] that was by the way it self congratulatory up usually I take a step in consternation at a jerk base color or that one I was quite pleased with my ability to juxtapose the beef Patty was crazy Patty Richard what's up sometimes it's like pop up video to show after when do you what I just to Richard how are you\nGood how are you an awesome thing as Happy Friday\nThe one that you have a question he or she might challenge that you can cheat was it wasn't at the last day or you know from those\n[noise] I don't think it's most was it was that a ... that's a taco bussing isn't it I ... I think that was a taco bus thing but I don't believe that I tried a burrito into bites\n'cause I I Would remember that usually the foods I tried that with I remember I I rather fuzzy taco came by for a grand opening but I don't gosh you know when you get food in a in radio Richard at all blends together into one gigantic buffet\nI can see how that works for sure if I was that's why I was thinking\nThat's why we're all disgusting looking in radio oil horrible physique stinky though Richard\nIf it was the name of the breed though was the L has to say I can confirm that is a taco bus burrito\nRight and they did a challenge with that if I'm not mistake right but I I he he may be right did they bring one by that I tried\n... I don't I don't remember I normally have a good feel for the I don't remember the food stuff\nI I don't think I could have done that in two bites because that was a a speed challenge that was one of those if you eat out half a in twenty minutes because there's so there's no way that I could have\nDone it was a lot of talk about it but I don't think you actually attempted it\nAnd this doesn't we're not counting the um the hunger now you know it's a challenge we did recently\nNo or nor we kept which I beat you and by the end it there there's like a reverse all hell yeah thank you uh and uh and we also ... tried the inferno challenge several years ago with sb K which he won which I did recently yeah that that was a strange to me they're backed by the way or the Taliban yeah yeah I'm going to tell you guys that I think\nI Want to say Pasadena excited and if that's a city in Florida and California I think it is right\nNow Dina here not to grill or ... or ... constantly though not particular Pasadena yeah there is one juror on road yeah is it a road in Saint Pete area\nOkay well maybe that's where they are then or maybe that's where they were then Chris what's up walking into grab alive\n[noise] I was I thought it was the last one\nWell actually the main mountain stands out to me because that was not able to bite challenge that was between geo and myself to see if we could lady and the tramp it in other words he gets at one end of the ship uh get I get it the other end of the show we'll get and our mouths meet in the middle so geo an I tackled men\nAre the men mountain the meat bound together and we successfully ate the whole thing amongst the two of us that didn't bring us any degree of satisfaction in fact I'm Still repulsed that we even tried it let alone accomplished it [noise]\nBut thank you I appreciate\nThat very much I'll hang up and listen your response Seventy seven five seven nine one or two five um kick ball tomorrow at a at a ... a a dramatic has told me today that they are sold out for kick ball teams but\nThey love free to come out and bid on some live auction items they always have great auction items if you have kids bring them out to the kids zone there was a kid area there they always kill it every year they don't kill kids but they kill it every year they have dodge ball games and it's a lot of fun for little kids big kid that cetera and all the money that you spend there\nGoes to build homes for homeless veterans and you'll you'll ... you'll see the guys and hear their stories tomorrow like Charlie lemon and the other dudes it's a great event\nBecause it's very competitive it shouldn't be but it's very competitive and there was phenomenal food and a good spirit of helping your fellow man\nI'll tell you even if you have interest in none of those things I Would say come just to watch a cat named mostly kick ball 'cause I I'm very fascinated to know what that's going to look like myself\nI've got twenty dollars on action on anybody who will take it that he doesn't show tomorrow\nI don't know there's there's this group test going on right now in a high on subscribe then I mean Moe is he's active in their CEOs\nYeah the the dog barks the most wags the least no the dog tags the most bites the least\nWithin her Merrill is three years in a row for kick ball back in the day\nNow sorry not buying it I er I by the way it is you're wanting fraternity be league football flag or be league a wealth of soccer and be like basketball there are yeah there was no lower than be like there was no see anybody wanted to could play but I did and ... is a it's like you I don't think I don't think most shows up\nFor the last decade no one has sold more semi trucks the sting rays\nAnd now during the model your clothes that we can find a generous thing they discount with huge model year in ... to get you into a twenty eight teams Silverado for just twenty two nine that's a big time thirty percent off cleared price on a new tweeting Silverado just twenty two nine but at that close up price they will sell fast\nAnd now for the first time we've got the hugely popular twenty Nineteen Colorado extending cap on sale at just Twenty one nine with Ken Colorado extending cats at that price just Twenty one nine to great Chevy Trucks uh twenty eight teams still run for twenty two nine\nTwenty Nineteen Colorado extending cat for just Twenty one nine leads the way your Chevy Truck price leader ...

[noise]\nTakes a certain got to make that work uh\nWe give you ... you know I won't hold you back\nSo I uh I heard yesterday that there is going to be an announcement about the punch up today and I have yet to attend to punch on other looking for a reason to last year my son had a band thanks so I couldn't go this year I Believe my schedule is free so I'm able to go\nWhat was that in July or something like I remember being high work yeah so it was it wasn't July because\nIt was right after I had been sick which was in the month of August so I think it was actually it might have been around this time of September ...\nYeah I have yet to attend one and I regret that so this year I've been looking for a reason and the reason as you and um I I heard that there was going to be announcement so I I kinda wanted the scoop so I texted my 'cause you don't have to tell me but I promise on tweet it what's the announcement and he told me what it was and I said oh All right\nSo I checked in Spanish and Spanish didn't seem to either know or\nWhatever so I felt weird I was like oh my God maybe I just well you know Spanish I mean he doesn't know what I don't yeah he doesn't want to be responsible for telling you something and then get in trouble right so he played a really well because I was like oh God maybe he doesn't know how he thought probably maybe I don't know whatever\nSo then I guess they made the announcement this morning that there's been a shovel of cards in the lineup which I think it's a great move and uh and so\nSpanish was going to fight Danny doughnuts and I I did not like that only because I like to any donuts a lot and just like last year when I had to root for either Spanish or my friend marching grammatical to beat the other one up\nI Would be torn I Love Spanish as much I mean let's be honest a better friend I don't I don't know Danny all that well but still like Danny and I wouldn't want to see Spanish punch them all over the dad loved the show yeah you big supporter and a really good do\nSo then he was going to fight Danny doughnuts and crying right Adams was going to fight a transgender individual by name Francesca Francesca\nAnd Ryan Adams is Johnny B producer and Johnny B as a show at night for those that are unfamiliar correct\nAnd we call crying right Adam ... for the long standing thing with the with the problem that we do I call that a and now it's kind of caught on uh the problem that we had a while back he kind of sent an email that we made fun of a foreign and said we got what about me why or whatever so I and I'm not here to dig up any old history and I have nothing against the guy or anything um so\nI guess he's no longer going to fight the transgendered Francesca and he is now going to fight is is that true you hurt Mike say he's going to fight Spanish\nThat's what I'm hearing that's what I heard I I was chatting with a Pat Pat before the show yeah and you know asking him for a full rundown in and he you know back them up and said this is this is going to happen this is the fight\nSpanish texted me today and he said it's official this is going down\nWho are at the house up there you are I think just so we could put this out there I was the only person on the show that predicted or the marking dramatic and Spanish by correctly last year and a this fight will be over in the first round\nAnd who will be the winner span of okay good thought for a second to last or guidelines\nTo ride out a lot on the show these fine but just stepping in the ring and seeing what Spanish how he brought us of our team last year he so fast you in shape I mean it's just I don't think there's any chance\nI I'm not trying to talk right out of out of it\nBut at this point Spanish is fairly close to being a a professional fighter or an amateur fighter within the actual scope of things I think he's training and he does Joe year round now so this is not just some radio guy who does it once a year he's taking this very seriously\nWell to be fair\nBefore I ... or ... loose on all social media he was saying go ahead and doubt me I'm trained in my ass off you doubters just ... me\nSo I'm not just playing devil's advocate when I say he's training very hard to [noise]\nYeah but I what I'm saying is I think Spanish started training three years ago and has it stops and you can't you can't get in three months and then match [noise]\nI Do get it pretty well guy I I think if there's someone who doesn't get it if you\n... why why do fans of this other radio personality why did they want you to give this guy praised for getting you back on the radio why it's so important to them that you recognize him\nI don't know I don't know and I am incredibly grateful to the people who have helped me and you got to go out of your way to screw me over for me to not show you any love her gratitude for forgetting where I Am\nI don't I'm just confused as to how he got you back on the radio because the job that was offered at Ninety seven X was not offered to you first it was offered to Billy Madison threat Billy Madison did not turn it down you would not be back on the radio here that's correct\nBut there's a revisionist history and I'm flattered that anyone would want to take credit for what I've quote unquote done here in Tampa I don't think we scratch the surface of what we can do I'm flattered beyond belief\nAnd I would I Would say maybe I don't know the truth I was only involved because I was I was working with whoever they were going to hire so I was in sharks office every day going what's going on and we are for the job the Billy okay that's fine well Billy wanted to bring his whole crew there they only wanted to hire Billy to keep Danielle and myself\nSo they went to Drew Drew was like hey just just hire me I'm good at several months so I just I I don't you know that's that's what I Know\nI said it helped me to have a of a fake radio show on some Internet thing somewhere to get to get my shops back to get on real sure to get into practice of talking behind the microphone yeah and access to studio by all means that helps me and I'll never forget spice helping me out with that it was wonderful that he did\nBut if you're looking for anything more than that guy you take one of these with you and thank you very much for helping me feed my family by listening to show you got to live a love\n...
