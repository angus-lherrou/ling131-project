I forgot him was that the guy we had on the show ... gray haze okay\nNicholas the top walking into grab alive and well dug into the transgender and I forgot\nAbout what's up Nicholas how you doing sir good buddy what's up with you\nUm are you have you ever seen the movie the house on haunted hill\nI have not uh\nI had seen that movie before the show came out or the hunting of el uh the hunting of El Al is or whatever it's called\nAnd in the in the show the first episode it took about halfway through I realized that the show is actually based on that movie is like a prequel and in the in the movie they have a name that crane those are the ones that are in the house okay or there was a girl named al right and she was actually invited to the house or to check out the haunted house\nSo if you watch the movie and then you watch the show I I've only been a few episodes through the show I haven't reached the\nUs occupiers yet right but it\n... if you've seen the movie you catch a bunch of stuff that correlates to that to uh the first episode the those the caretaker lady she says something we don't go to the house at night when it's dark and she said something like that that's a straight line a quote from the movie but like oh this\nIs kind of what it correlates to show I Believe it was a prequel to that movie and it was actually a really good movie\nWas look don't think that the ending is going to suck just because we didn't like it maybe you'll love it\nA lot of people saying this great show\nHorrible ending I was just thinking about that I didn't mind the ending to Dexter ...\nHow do you and that's their right I mean you you you want to leave it open\nEnded in case there is a movie or for some reason there's enough money to bring the show back\nYou either kill them off are you making disappearing civic northwest they chose the latter\nWe'd be talking about text or as one of the greatest shows of all time if they ended that series with Dexter walked in and found read in a brain agreed agreed to be talking about it as the most sought after greatest show ever I agree\nYou wouldn't say they left too much on the table\nI mean maybe but we'd be wanting more we wouldn't be questioning whether or not it went on too long or whether or not the ending was bad because that was the best ending of any season of any show I've ever\nSeen so you're saying they could have had this series finale when readers in the bath tub and as he hears\nThe phone well I mean you have to have him finish off the trinity killer I'd write and I I think that probably happened in the finale yeah right yeah okay yeah that's right okay he had killed pretty and then he came back it's either yeah I I think that should have been I I\nWe argued about this on the morning because I said the only good seems the ... were the first four I thought the stuff with Tom Hanks\nOn and the religious stuff and then what what was the what was that Julie style sushi ... looming blooming onion and it was just come on and what about what's her name ... ah they learn how to handle okay so cute\nYeah I mean that's the thing too because especially if the last thing that you saw was his son in the blood which is we've been told so long but that's where he came was from the blood then you've got the ending this child has now been brought up in blood like Dexter\nWhite area and so had an epiphany Dexter yeah All right I'd watch that yeah you're right that would have that would have been the most impactful because everyone who got to the end of that season oh\nThe I mean that was brutal and it's crazy because if you go back and watch it when he killed trinity trinity already knew that he killed his wife\nSeat I haven't watched that episode again because I Can't I was so I didn't know is going to happen and when he sent the tax I think\nYou could hear her her the author and going off and it's like hey where are we going to meet up with one of the world or whatever it was like\nYeah they they were getting out of town they had so she got\nVoice mail saying I had to come back from my stuff\nThe problem with doctors at trinity killer was the most the most ruthless killer that they had on the show he was the only one that I think even came close to challenging Dexter and then after that I think it all fall fall short when you're trying to find these new main characters and he'd see then\nGod that is brutal just thinking about that last episode I mean\nDoes that hold I feel like everybody seemed actually I don't feel like I'm like oh I'm catching up on Dexter I Love it\nNow and although it's like I think I have a is this the a\nAnd there's like the music playing and like he's talking about how he feels like everything's all good [noise]\nIt all begins when it got away or [noise]\nTime\n\nSo it was over a vending he's already killed or hurt\nYeah everything's all buttoned up as far as we things\nWe think Dexter\nOff with Rita into the sons that they're\nGetting away they're going down south of us are yeah they survive the killer the worst\nHe married her ready yet life doesn't have to be perfect\nInterest to be live [noise]\n[laughter]\nUh oh oh my God\n[noise]\nThat that that show gets you dude why oh man what's up Jay's augment you grab alive\nHey I'm doing good I'm Guy to emotionally tortures move\nYeah I never watched ... no no you do is still really good\nI got two things that I agree with John setting on the first one is blood line that was a great show too great seasons but I think the reason they ended up so quick is 'cause uh they got ... going to do with their season but the state pulled a tax break for filming down in the keys I think\nFlorida seems to go out of the way to dissuade people from filming down here which is just too bad because I I enjoy bloodline I thought I thought the casting was great it is a great show\nRight and then the second thing is is a I don't know this was last week of the week before when John studying was talking about how crazy women were I called to say I completely agree with him but like a a didn't like that so she didn't put me on the air so she's out there that I just wanted to call and say that I completely agree with you I got three sisters can be true\nAnd they can make a make a censoring the audience doing a little we know content screening throughout all live below\nThe rock rock what's up but I Love the show man um my girlfriend and I was on Nike wanted to comment on\nA hill show I just finished a series ... and um I couldn't agree with you more the last two episodes were terrible it was a terrible and then to a great show in the mall stupidly ridiculous\nYeah man is not too bad because they they took so much care what the character development and the plot twists and the the casting I thought was brilliant Timothy Dalton Eliot from E. T. and then the last two episodes just felt tacked on someone else had written him or something you know\nExactly the monologue terror all that stuff and they want to have\nSeen it I Would still watch it but don't get your hopes suffer are great and then when the ending was terrible\nYeah and I think you know if I hear that I'm not watching it if I hear watch it it's good but don't get your hopes up the ending sucks I'm probably not going to watch it\nSo then we have to talk about why we watch shows we we flew to just watch it for the end of the story because you you watched eight episodes of this yeah eighty Ninety percent of the show was awesome yeah they got a strong be so small percentage of the show you didn't like and you turn on the whole thing\nIt's a good point is it it's it's got to still be a good show yeah I mean what is it is like your final grade is worse at least fifty percent\nLike your final exam is worth at least fifty percent of your fire right that makes sense so we did our homework we got a good grade up until the final exam gotta gotta pee but then the final we got a twenty five percent of pulled our great down to a D. I'm not taking your class then\nMaybe ten percent of the final grade can be the O O not nearly enough what'd you even learn\nThat being said I feel like it was so bad that it made us forget some of the emotions and things that we said just about a week ago with this is one of the scariest shows were talking about not being able to sleep at night the way that they did the first few episodes were really really well better than a lot of horror genre stuff\nAgreed Seventy seven five seven nine one or two five and eight hundred and seven to have a woman that you just can't keep my eyes off of bone TV with the\nEffects are getting work these days\nYeah he um let's see was on Broadway I think his cancer came back he did but I think he beat it oh man and then I think he um he played had wig on Broadway and heck we had we can be angry edge but I may have gotten the cancer like the I think it might be back now I gotta look\nWho who's doing better Dexter or an anti bought one\nWho's getting morals are probably Nancy bought one I haven't seen her in anything I'm Mary Louise Parker yeah lessening Mary Louise Parker did ... love her to great shows by the way\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nYeah you and your crew [laughter]\nYou know when your crew right here I don't like to say crew crew a says Jeff get steam roll [laughter]\nJust literally I did I didn't even though I didn't think you would necessarily read the document to read the title of the the audio stuff gets seem\nRole that Renee barber I saw the hotline oh oh I started writing so\nMuch great or ...

restaurants\nOr media do die of less sympathy for like Tucker Carlson and set in his new book he's getting a little tired of people saying FU to him when he's in restaurants I I have less sympathy for soccer because he's a page she'll he's on Fox News I don't get the feeling he believes a lot of what he says\nHe's he's almost entertainer right\nSo you can understand where if you intentionally for the sake of entertainment poke fun at people making claimed statements people are going to have strong reactions and if you started to go out to eat you got to take it people are going to say F. you you shouldn't let it in ... you know ruin the taste of your flaming you all\nFor politicians I I don't I don't like it and I don't get it and it seems to be a growing thing especially Republican politicians who try to eat meals\nAnd then have protesters cost them Ted Cruz in a Washington DC restaurant last month was accosted by protesters there was some do just two weeks ago try and get a meal and protesters came into the restaurant and started taunting him while he's trying to\n... how do you get a hold of these people I mean\nThere are public servants right I mean yeah they're they're not going to pick up the phone if we call them so we we we got to go to where they are and they're they're eating\nAnd the problem is is somewhat prominent figures on the left Maxine\nWaters Cory Booker or even Hillary Clinton to a certain extent are saying go find your congressman go find your politicians\nAnd get in their face I Know we try to steer away from from language like this with the left is becoming more and more unhinged and it's not a good look when they're supposedly banking on this blue wave coming in the election I don't think that it's going to help them by acting like this\nLet's just realized that people are human beings no matter what their policy might be on something and if you don't like their politics vote them out of office\nBe vocal about it in the appropriate form of protest my opinion it is one hundred percent not okay to bother someone who is eating a meal on their own time because you don't like the way they do their job whether that job is politician after educator\nEntertainer leave people alone and let them eat a meal\nI Would never do that I wouldn't bother anybody while they're eating when there was a politician or celebrity or anything like that but\nHow are we supposed to get your point across how are you supposed to get these congressmen and senators all these people are you supposed to get them to remember you add your message unless you do it this way\nWell they'll remember you but it's certainly not going to inspire them to do anything that you want them\nTo do what do you do go to a rally an engineer hold your hand up and just hope that that Ted Cruz touched it no you've got to get in the face and tell us what your issues are\nNobody this to me this is the equivalent of you posting on your Facebook page or political beliefs to think that you're going to get someone else to change the political believe if you come and get in my face while I'm eating dinner with my family you think I'm gonna look you'd say oh you want to know what you're right limit changed the way that I think\nI Would say that you have a pretty good chance on Facebook of someone at least reading your point of view\nDon't you think a lot of these people in office they're guarded they somebody filters or emails they don't get everything they don't read their tweets they don't surely they might not truly know at all times how people are feeling whether they support or where they don't so I feel like it's just you're you're out there and these are the people you're working for the people the people in restaurants\nBut I mean you're off your time you get off time gee I don't think you're I don't know if you're ever off I think in that that that would be tough to try to explain to somebody hey I Know the governor but I'm off right now\nHave a two seven five seven I Would have survived so the governors never not the governor even when he's eating you're always the governor has true unless you're naked uh Ken what's up what would you do grab alive okay or not okay to bother people while they're eating dinner because you don't like their political beliefs\nIt is not okay and I also think it has nothing to do with the specific politician actual political beliefs just opposed to administer the will of the people and when they go back in the\nDay and okay go ahead\nAnd used it used to be a lot worse they actually used to get strung up you know we ... we were directed by outside and be there but they didn't do what people wanted them to do with it and a lot of situations they ... ... ... ... people there's actually a study that a document the whole\nSituation where people have are still watch the tuition to politicians completely no they have done it a lot after that so it's your vote really is a good day\nGoing across the only means you have to do people do it a lot less now than they actually used to it to get to the people's ...\nAnd I don't know dude I appreciate your point of view but that to me is garbage\nSome people's vote some people but somebody who voted for somebody won't have their candidate who wins right so that doesn't mean you have the right to go out and getting those people's face while they eat there's going to be losers that doesn't mean that you get to expedite the process or go around the system\nNow if you're a restaurant owner and you don't like Sarah Huckabee Sanders you have every right to ask her to leave like they did it that red hand the farm to table restaurant and New Hampshire or whatever it was they didn't they were anti Trump\nAnd they went to her and said we would like for you to leave where you are not welcome here stupid in my opinion because you want to make money but you want to turn your restaurant into a political debate awesome go ahead and do that\nBut if you're not even eating at a restaurant and you'll go into a restaurant to bother someone who's spending money there that is a problem\nAnd you shouldn't be doing that but don't
