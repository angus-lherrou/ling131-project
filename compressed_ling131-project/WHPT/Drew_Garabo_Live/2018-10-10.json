get the tickets to scream again so I can take her 'cause I don't have the orange right now the acre\nWell it's an important lesson I mean if you take her to places like that now and it's a new relationship then you're setting the bar and reasonably high and she's going to expect such things and you don't have the funds to provide them and I'm sure you have too much pride to pan handle every radio station in show and\nNot just ours [laughter] why we got so lucky so you know you you want to maybe drive around and look at Halloween decorations you know the the ... non announces aren't for everyone or just a moderately affluent I got a question\nI listen to you guys every day because I'm a driver so I listen to ride every day who am I Try to win thing from you guys and I'm not very lucky\nOh thank you very much when were you hoping to go Brad when did you want to go to scream again what date\nTwenty nine o'clock over\nThe twenty ninth of October I'm looking at ticket prices right now it looks like I'm John looks like you can get in the door to scream again for Twenty one Ninety five per person\nAt a less than forty five dollars for two non including tax of course oh yeah I mean forty five bucks\nI mean that's I mean times are tough but come on man\nYeah I mean they they don't advertise on her show or anything we've never had tickets to give away for string scream again I Would I Would steer you towards a who the Johnny B shows going to be a ... screen the Saturday Night they would probably have tickets to give away to that uh and then of course Halloween horror nights but if scream again as an in your budget I get the feeling Halloween horror nights it might not be\nIt's got one the Indy feel to it to\nHis hard at all he wants to legit like you you can be handed a knife outside and then stabbed somebody and actually kill\nNo this is where an actual murder Mike\nThat place yeah see I don't I don't want people actually tell them how do\nHow do we are the harder than I Do like sixty dollars if I'm not\nWell I mean it depends on what you do uh but uh but that's a that's not entirely an actor yeah I see you've achieved you budgeted the Halloween attractions what you know what why why not just take or someplace and uh go driving around and look at how many decorations on the twenty ninth which got John\nI got this one I found and this is I I think this might have a connection to something that you work with through All right is the hunted Angeles spook attack you or Halloween festival ten bucks a person\nI Do work with the angel is house every year a further Charlie Daniels weekend and uh and Charlie Daniels will not be coming this year but they are still having the weekend so uh I Would do recommend help out the the Angeles house a

station or no\nThat's fine one ... you know one panhandling episode doesn't make you a panhandler per se it just means that you panhandle wants\nTo see\nWhat I'm saying what can you afford how much can you afford for these take what's in your\nBudget and well in my budget what's in your budget\nWell the only thing I could do was like all the tickets were Nineteen Ninety five but that didn't November and nobody wants to go to a haunted house after all over because\nThe people don't put in their fullest or you know they don't owe it to it and then they're like they're bored and they don't want to scare people\nVery discriminatory do Nineteen Ninety five a person is in the budget Twenty one Ninety five not in the budget\nOr oh I Know I sound like a jeep tested but I you know\nThe six dollar different [laughter] I tell you what here's what we do guy assuming did you feel like this is the girl for you that you're going to be together for a while\nUh yeah I mean her family like me I

is down or doesn't hunker down you're going to do what you're going to do\nNow you have to judge those people because then the rescuers have to go in there and they're risking their lives to save people that shouldn't be there in the first place\nYou're right you're right when you when you hunker down in the face of a mandatory evacuation you are ah unnecessarily stretching the already fan

I don't I'm Upset with myself that I I don't have a problem with the wind\nSeventy seven five seven nine one or two five my thing is you got your entire life\nTo be adversely affected by alcohol okay yeah you know like he is the booze rarely does anything good for people it does a lot of bad and you got the rest of your life to be poisoned by it why started eleven\nFourteen even are you\nTaking away the forbidden fruit of it or you do you think oh well if he has won with me he's not going to drink beer with his friends\nI think this is different from being the the cool parent and saying hey you're going to get drunk or just get drunk at my house with your friends I think this is a little a little better\nAnd better but it is different\nSo so the fact that it's wine to Yusef is better because what if he said uh I like a nice Johnnie Walker and you know when the kids drink or daddy drink so poor I mean just shot right that would be where I think\nThe fact that it's a little line makes a difference for me I get that 'cause I don't like drinking don't do it I Will do what I don't know are they getting tipsy I mean probably yeah a a\nAn eleven year old has one glass of wine and and their little tiny\nLiver seventh graders stressful man I mean if my parents portray a little ... back in the day it might be a different boy\nStressful for a for a young stuff because you're not necessarily a young multi millionaire well they have to live up\nTo you know their detonate everywhere they go that can't be easy I Would develop a drinking problem by the time I was twelve\nSo if let's let's let's what if Wednesday I'm you know it's it's however many years down the road Jerry ... maybe ... eleven years old uh in in that done with a tough day of work and you pour some some wind for yourself and she says could can I have some you wouldn't say no\nWhich she's eleven jail and I just like bronze yup a child\nI think that's I think that's a tad young I think\nThink I don't know I don't have to answer that hypothetical question because I I Would imagine that a lot\nOf people are giving their kids wide probably beer I'm sure liquor Mm yeah I think a parrot might go you know what I'm going to make the rules for my children I'm not going to let this country the government throws I'm going to make these ...\nSo I think hey I really haven't been listening and I've been looking this recording aired I'd really like to ask your out what age was that that without your parent is experimenting with alcohol and marijuana like Fifteen sick for either one\nFifteen and sixteen so I even for my oldest is a native here so long and fortunately here the great cat and he never approached me wanting to have any curiosity has recently told me it's curious about beer but and he's afraid it's going to taste bad so\nI think that in a year or so it would be okay if he was really curious I gave him an here but I Want to ask you as far as the marijuana goes because I Hope they call it Tony earlier mhm you'd think Seventeen as a as a reasonable age to experiment with that and I and and it's just your son was ... I don't think my style I\nI started smoking marijuana nine and I went kind of on a flight which\nPassed away all the things that were going on if my parents would have intervened and maybe had a little bit more in in touch with me and\nAnd then a little bit more honest with me or even engage with me maybe I wouldn't have gone that way\nNine years old how did you get out to eat it with my father's [noise]\nOkay so so how did you get a hold of it I\nI saw my father's name yet at nine years old at nine years old with my older sister\nBut you're saying you might not have done that if he was more honest with you about his we'd use\nI I'm saying I Would not have been maybe that curious if they would've been a little bit more honest with me about the effect that things like that and how it affects their life and the things they do in the world and they would have stopped me down and said hey\nI'm an adult and that's why I Do that is not suitable for children it can affect your brain development it can affect that can affect that maybe\nI Would have listened to them but they were so disengaged and they didn't pay any attention\nTo a lot uh that we were just left up to ourselves to experiment like Enron experiment that with my children at the age that I Am I'm blessed that my children haven't gone there sure but if they were approached me with it I Would have to find some kind of balance to keep them from going down the house but I\nWrite I'm I Am very honest with my son about the current state of ... of marijuana and cannabis in the U.S because when I was a kid it was just don't smoke we we'd is bad we use the devil does smoke weed\nWe can't see that anymore because marijuana in Canada is our medicine for people so then if you say don't do it but it helps these people with their conditions\nYou're confusing living you know what are the kid so what I Do is I go look we're in an era right now we're this plant\nIs legal recreationally in some states legal medicinal ally and Florida and illegal federally everywhere ... what you want to put yourself in the best position to succeed in life can you succeed as an adult and smoke marijuana certainly\nCan you also be arrested at the age of Seventeen Eighteen for having a quarter of an ounce\nAnd habits sit on your record forever and prevent you from getting a really cool job unfortunately yeah you can\nIt's all about the decisions that we bake with hopefully the best information available to us lying to your kids I don't think it does any good when it comes to marijuana or alcohol or more importantly the tooth fairy and Santa Claus don't lie to your there and there's no sound absolutely\nSo it's ended where to approach it but alcohol what would be irresponsible\nOr he wouldn't but er but if you would I Would just say look you've been around drunk people you know what they're like ah they're idiots dumping idiot don't drink alcohol\nCould it's your routing children haven't reached that point yeah I mean there are those that were doing something right\nBut good luck type I just don't know how to handle it when it got\nSeventy Seventy seven I Want to do five men are very few people do\nAnd I'll say like in her situation I think that ah that older siblings are game changers in that situation because I mean your parents may have been like not good then they had to wait around in there smoking weed but if you've got an older sibling is getting you hired nine years old that falls almost singlehandedly army older sibling\nRight correct and the older sibling has a responsibility also to go hey look mom and dad are doing this don't do this like looking out for you even if they're not you might just seeing a nine year old kid hitting a blunt I've seen it all you on the video Facebook yeah I mean there's the they show ... six months old that are heading\nBlood what's on Wednesday\nYes then is not okay I have no idea what people are\nThinking okay so you're fourteen year old kid wants to have a like a nice glass of white them for a with their dinner you're going to say no\nGood she's absolutely not in my I have a six year old son and he just turned ... that's why these recon way right now oh my God yeah I said at the bottom no\nHe he like\nWe went to a gym or the other night with some family and I had a glass of wine who does not at that alcohol yeah and he no he sat there and he's like okay so you're going to get it you're going to get ... you're going to get that daddy has to drive he sticks and he understands how bad it is for you\n... yeah I've had the same thing or a we're out of universal a couple of years ago and uh we went to Cal fish for dinner and I I ordered a uh booze drink because I was going to sneak it by my than twelve year old news like that what's that so what do you mean so what that is that an alcoholic drink and I go\nYeah\nUm yeah so what are you going to drink that I said well now I'm not will mark [laughter]\nGive it to the girlfriend of the time so there are some pretty good for and I wasn't driving or anything but because of what he's been through and and because of a cause of the image that I Wish to project for him I don't drink it from around the dark I think it's by a\nFew tell us put a little kids come next time [laughter] I was ... ... ... but that is Seventy seven five seven I Want it to five when we come back or we will a man

when I got there\nI don't know what I mean actually like maybe they'd be got smack level you know because they've had more staying power actually who I see the Oh absolutely yeah there there are still making records are still touring they're having festivals and fields in Milwaukee that the bringing thousands of people at for days on end and they never had a hit John I mean they were never on the level and biscuit\nAnd they were never going to break through to the mainstream like limp is getting cornered icy Pete would always have its self contained jug lows but I I think even with the family
