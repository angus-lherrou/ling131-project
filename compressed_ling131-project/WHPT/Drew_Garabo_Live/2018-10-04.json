Johnson and\nThanks for having me was that ever one great power of radio program and we just heard or watch this show is really really good from Henry rounds to Bob Barker this shows got it all we touch everybody then we're about to touch you live from the port of Tampa Bay\nAs we get set to embark upon a five day for nine voyage into the Caribbean or Caribbean if you prefer it that way up to see we're going into I think\nSo I just know that we're we're in the Gulf right now I think if I went over to one of the sides I could see channel side and and everything like that but uh I don't know if it's too early to ... bring it up but I've been hearing rumors of some activity in the in the Caribbean was far as you know tropical weather this weekend\nI Love how you didn't tell me anything about that until the microphones were in front of our face that's how committed you are to fear mongering 'cause now I'm terrified well here's\nThe thing I didn't want it to negatively affect anybody's feelings about going on the couch cruised by the time people here that they're on the boat and they won't know the truth\nSo I'm too late to do anything about it let's just say I I packed a life is that a lot of it [laughter]\nWell I Hope they go over that and the muster a station drill that we're going to do is doing a live broadcast is that our excuse to sitting out the mustard drill\nWho I don't know but I've been having nightmares about the mustard drill because I've been going on a cruise is one of the the most fun things ever you do so many amazing things but when they lock you into this mustard mustard meeting in the beginning it is bad\nIt's an assaulting word nobody wants to I'd like a mustard meeting where they give me my choice of yellow or spicy brown\nBats actually the first time I went on a cruise that's what I thought I was in for\nYou about a bunch of days of eating and they just want to know your preference when it comes to you like a golden do you like a friendship\nAnd I'm a mustard guy Aryan horseradish mustard I like a nice stone ground mustard like with the big chunks in there\nWith you I don't like the land a pedestrian yellow mustard the plots men's if you will it's got its place\nIt does have its place I don't know where it is but every once in a while on a ... I Know you're are you belong to a guy I'm an excellent guy I like it I'm a baloney sandwich\nI haven't had a baloney sandwich in probably Twenty years but when I was growing up there was nothing better to me than my mom getting baloney this was before ... Oscar minority old reading what dachshund and we're all mixed together and uh oh there goes that account and uh and and and you know so I see bologna sandwiches with wonder bread and Hellmann's mayonnaise all day long do those things are great\nYou ever put chips on your baloney sandwich no oh sorry you did yeah that was always key for me\nIt would seem like such a novelty thing to be you'd every once in awhile see somebody doing it and you go ... ... why are you doing\nNow this is not a novelty thing drew this this thing that this is the thing that people are doing and have been doing for generations and are passionate about it\nWhat percentage of sandwich eaters would you say approximately puts the chip right on the sandwich\nTo thought provoking question thank you John this why they pay me ... I'd say forty seven percent\nWere were according so I could say well you know I probably still shouldn't say the F. word just in case it yeah you can say oh I Can't but that's forty seven percent put ships on that that's a grossly over inflated figure\nBut but but then I have to ask you what what validate somebody's being a ... put her on her I mean they do it once a week once a month once a year highly ever done in their life and\nPut it this way fewer than thirty percent of sandwich heaters have ever put chips on the sandwich itself ... eat like normal human beings and go I'm done with that sandwich a few chips to wash that\nThey're wrong no sorry this is wrong\nI think maybe this might be a generational thing because of my generation you know we did we stood for the damn anthem and we also we also at our chips in our sandwiches separately\nI don't know there's no way we can prove this or maybe I if there's somebody there running the board right now when you hear this year I put a poll on on the the one that you bought the bone page to a great idea and put chips on your on your sandwich\nAnd how we got to you regularly there should be a few options you regularly or have you ever because just because you do or wanted that doesn't mean you're gay\nI don't know any other way to to get answers on his other than pulling people online\nPolling people whether online or in real life is always enjoyable\nThat on the ship all weekend as well I can just go up and you know ask random people what they think\nI think we found a running theme for the spot test at the end of its own account it all up and we'll see whether or not what'd you say forty seven percent\nI said forty seven percent regularly put just on their sandwich I said forty seven percent without you binding me to regularly I said forty seven percent under the guys that that is enjoys it has done it which speak highly of it and as soon as he is of putting chips on them I mean the thing is is\nI asked the question how couldn't you'd be like I gave forty seven percent to me that's a low number I was I was a low balling\nSo now what's your preference be potato chips from the ladies would it be Fritos Doritos you ... what do you put on\nI'll tell you if you tell me I get one chip to ... to to put on my sandwich the rest of my life I'm probably going to go with a a this is my favorite what should
