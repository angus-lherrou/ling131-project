I saw about half of Tropic Thunder and I didn't really it didn't resonate with me I thought it was really good yeah I I Know people who thought it was really really good and and I I Can't say it was it having seen half of it\nYes simple jak is the name of it will jak thank you I guess it was a ... it was something they showed and Tropic Thunder making fun of Hollywood and how they'll have special needs characters to try to go after an Oscar nominee\nCorrect and there was the there was the repeated comment in the movie with the R word that said you never go full are black writer\nAnd so Shaun White for Halloween he said he is he said this was last minute this is not a last minute idea a new orders at a popular one I don't if you show if I saw that at a party I'd be like what in the world is that supposed to be\nBut there are people upset with him because he's an Olympian and they say he should be more sensitive to special\nI look\nAs an advocate for the special needs community and as someone who wants to do my part to kind of lemonade eliminate that word from our vocabulary\nI look at this and go I don't know that this should\nBe an issue what did he have the R word on his Instagram page no walk around saying the R word that night no\nNo he just dressed up as a character that Ben Stiller was in a silly movie called Tropic Thunder look\nThere's a lot of things that people do that are offensive but when I saw the store and I thought I thought about what a world I I I Would like to live in a world where I'll have to do is go through Instagram and it'd be offended that things\nYeah that that wasn't even the most offensive character in Tropic Thunder\nRight that was the uh the uh Robert Downey junior character who wore black face\nYeah that really slipped under the radar he really got through it the right time right before yeah but he started caring about everything\nAnd and maybe Shaun White did that to kind of say oh you'll you'll let me do this but if I were black face my cruise of like tomato would be over\nI guarantee you that's not it they probably think that Tropic Thunder is a very funny movie and they go let's let's be this character right ...\nIm again so special jak or semi simple ... that's it I\nI did when I first started I I don't know I I didn't know who he was being you have to read the whole article\nYeah and I did and I I just don't see the outrage\nHow about this he deleted the POWs so clearly he knows he upsets some people yeah probably won't do it again\nProbably got some ah some stern talking to from or his manager and agents saying look if you're going to endorse products this is not the right move\nBut I I Wish we could start looking at intent did Shaun White intend to offend anyone with that I don't think so I don't think he did did Megan\nOr whatever the hell her name is Kelly did she intend to fanned the flames of racial divide sure she absolutely I mean\nWe're looking to get mad at a Halloween costume with Shaun White did why don't we get mad at the the guy in Pittsburgh who killed eleven people on Saturday why do we show some real outrage towards that it's ever going to Instagram is going to oh this guy this guy he's insensitive we gotta do something about this guy\nRight we get distracted so easily by the shiny ball that is a that is right in front of us rather than these horrible genuine\nTrend I Know it's hard to focus on the real tragedy because how do we fix them we don't know we know how to fix Shaun White get off your delete that off your instrument don't ever do it again that's an easy fix can't fix we don't know how to fix what happened to Pittsburgh but that's what we should be focusing\nOn right and if you want to get outrageous something get outraged at the haunted house\nThat tried to have a swastika Saturday party the day of the ... in Pittsburgh you want to be outraged about something there's some outrage for you or the dad who decided addresses five year old kid up as Adolf Hitler I think there's outrage warranted there because it it again fuels the anti Semitism that causes\nA morally bankrupt an evil individual to go into a ... a a synagogue and kill the Ninety seven year old Holocaust survivor amongst others\nAre parents on the radio down if you are with their kids in the car\nWe gotta give Halloween back to the slots that's who it's for not for all these people trying to do fake controversies trying to get a bunch of ... for the ladies was lost focus on that you're right you're right\nLet's give it back to the slut and take it take it from us ladies run with that make this year holiday it's for the slots and the kids for us\nSeventy seven five seven nine to five and eight hundred and seven seven one or two five you're you're absolutely right I I saw not one slut at the Halloween party that I was out on Saturday Night there was one lady there who's using Halloween as an excuse to display her\nBody in a very risque caution that's a huge problem it really well except for my girlfriend but that doesn't go a that is a huge issue because we certainly need to give it back a little\nBit it's easy to get wrapped up in and being offended but I'm telling you there's other issues that we've lost focus on\nTrue let's take Halloween away from the adult male and give it back to the adult female and the children of course yes yeah oh yeah the children should uh but but how long he's not for us anymore fellows\nI think a lot of this stems from we as people love seeing everything taken away from somebody no matter what the reason we see Shaun White successful Olympic gold medal winner we wanted all taken away down to nothing because he offended me like that's like I don't think\nThat we as people appreciate seeing anything more than than people just ruined\nYeah it's true well yeah but the job I mean it's it's not what you want to see what Jane is you want to see it all come crashing down very excited yesterday\nYeah yeah yeah I mean that I think personally from what he's put on the football field and put out there and his real life if you're going to root for somebody you know to to have a tough

but here's the middle of the other way but here's the sidewalks they use the crosswalk whether it's convenient to employers\nWell okay sure will that guy that guy sounds like he wants to hunt down bicyclists that guy sounds like he wants to make it his life's mission to hunt down bicyclists on the road ahead and kill them\nI mean we'll let let's be honest here there's there's like we don't ride and pass the ride so low we go on the sidewalk we'd ready to do but there are people that have absolutely no problem slowing down All right I'm going hey we get to share the road to\nYeah we're not

what's up mark\nHey what's up to a great show buddy ... thank you\nYeah um I heard you talking about the bikes and it is crazy to drive like Florida but the craziest thing is you see those people were they lay down on the bikes and they like pedal basically with their arms ... you know what I'm Talking about\nYeah there are the that's a weird bike or like\n... feet off the ground and you know eighty five year olds running around like look that's basically like a suicide mission\nYeah I agree with you a sidewalk operation they person propelling a vehicle by human power upon and along the sidewalk or across the roadway\nAnd upon a crosswalk has all the rights and duties applicable to protest ... under the same circumstances a person propelling a bicycle upon and along a sidewalk or across a roadway upon and along a crosswalk show you the right of way too many pedestrian\nAnd given audible signal before overtaking and passing such pedestrian\nBicycles can legally be operated on all Florida sidewalks and cross walks unless a local ordinance program it's it went on a sidewalk you operators operating vehicle and must use helmets in lights if you're a policy\nThat is what it says right here I'm just reading and is subject to the DUI last seven to seven five seven nine one or two five what's up Matt\nI just wanted to say you're absolutely correct thank you back\nTo the uh the statutes states that if you're on the road you have to follow the rules of vehicles on the road if you're on the sidewalk you have to follow the rules of history\nSure and it and if it's bicycle versus to that street and you give the ... right away you tell them when you are overtaking them you'd be considerate person don't zoom up and scare the hell out of people and let's all try to get to where we're going to live you know\nAbsolutely and what you do is you just you say on the left or whatever you're going to say and then watch for their reaction and you slow down and wait for them to react\nYeah I mean I like to be a little considering give them a good heads up coming up on your left that way it gives them time to groups that are left to go see it was left and then go back and then I'm like thank you very much and they go thank\nYou for bicyclists had\nCritically injured by a car in Venice today\nCritically injured that to me says they might not make it it's an elderly

[noise]\nHey what's up I'm like hey man questions or yeah yeah I have such an IRS bags all your listeners [laughter]\nYour boyfriend or oh you mean that's a given time answer the question\nI mean I'd I'd answer it if you didn't pull the old post you move hanging up its foreign policy to all of them but if someone calls up I mean Dick at all of them but if someone calls up and gives erroneous information I have to correct that quite passionately\nAnd there were many people who called up today in fact Ninety nine percent of the people who call that well Ninety two percent of the people who called up today have not received an adverse reaction at all the question is if you don't like it why do you listen\nSeventy seven five seven I Want it to five those guys and they love it now tell giggling Gus next you there to call up and tell us why listen [laughter] you're told him I bet he didn't know it was a jerk to the people that come up until you just told the judge that's the way to go you're telling the son of a bitch what's up David\nHey what's going on in payment I'm doing very well thank you\nAll right so I agree with you I think it is safer in certain scenarios but I think it can also be very dangerous threat on the sidewalk\nUnless you stop on every corner because now you're not going to see people blasts through there on the sidewalk\nWhat do you mean I'm Sorry I like when you're crossing an intersection\nRight so if I have the right of way I don't have a stop sign or anything and somebody is on the sidewalk I'm not looking really I mean I like what got the call somebody standing there but I'm not going to be able to be a you know a bike with what you're\nAsking me by you know without stopping on the street so sometimes it can be dangerous 'cause uh you you do have to all\nThe all you know the rules that road hail your and like\nI don't mean to make it sound like in any way shape or form that you're a hundred percent safe on the sidewalk don't get me wrong I like my chances better on the sidewalk\nThen I like my chances in traffic with people who are distracted by their mobile devices you know what I'm saying like I Know the sidewalk can be dangerous to end with it comes a heightened sense of awareness for\nBoth bicyclists and car the thing is I'll take my chances on the sidewalks as opposed to a bike lane or wrote\n\nI can agree with that yeah I think it's up to the bike ... you know you feel comfortable on the side last Monday through the ... you know I think the problem with some of the bike or the bike bikers are you know you got these like scare bikers that don't have brakes on their bikes\nYou know during the intersection I don't know if you've seen those guys are pretty daring oh they are and they and they get by about\n... a bad name my yeah but over I'll just say well people thank you stay well oh yeah oh yeah they well yes\nSeventy seven five seven nine to five and eight hundred seven seven one one or two

I don't know who you got for me began\nYou well you guys had a big argument back in the day live on their all about ...\nAnd now he's back it still is on the bench what about just stick carrier\nPause [laughter] I could go either Winston battle it out I like I was listening yesterday I'd like to try to tell you their face like if they do they figure this out I thought it would be ideal match especially with all the Winston stuff yesterday the bench and everything\nLike John's right he can be all ski up in the wrong and John was right\nPlus he's a big bear of a man or I like your ideal I don't\nKnow I don't know and so that's why it all oh\nAll right good good good suggestion my man thank you\nI mean to me there were no no I mean I don't hate Justin plow ski we we have a fundamental disagreement about a sports team a justice is a great guy and I don't have any need or want to ... the fist\nFight him but I mean if you did you'd probably be a disaster I I honestly don't know he's a he's a big man I Know just trying to think he's a it'd be yeah no he uh he's these big better man yeah you maintain domain\nPlus at this point in time it'd be kicking them was down I mean this guy got demoted well no he's he's he's more of a\n... and I think he's a ... fan but he's very disappointed in the buccaneers especially if they're not making moves to the deadline so\nI Would be to\n... and it's well it's whatever is what we have to do here I mean you gotta take your side you got to make your pick in you know his picked just happened to ... at this moment not be working out\nUm I I've been having a lot of second thoughts about starting fitzpatrick this I mean you have to because they're trying to keep his job like you've got to you've got to but like why wouldn't you try this this third string guy who's a rookie\nWhy I don't know why would you\nWhy she skip past fits the go to a third stringer well because kids fits he's not the guy for the future yeah there's no future [laughter] and then they start winning there is no future for anybody there unless they start winning\nSo like them starting fits the is basically is basically a Jason light and uh and third quarter desperately trying to keep their\nJob I don't I mean I think they're just trying to win games I think when you win games in search stacking does yeah\nIt looks good at the end of the year I think we got to save our job who's going to help save our job I think it's all about wins and who gives you the best chance right now with the rate that James is turning the ball over you have to go with ... right you have to even get that fits magic back in you know energize the team I I don't know man it's this is a very very tough game on the road\nSo then they lose the Carolina Panthers on Sunday do you put James back in the lineup at fifty has an okay again to me it's\nNot about losing 'cause you know the difference is probably going to give up some points it's just about how the quarterback performs into fits the he's not he's not going to throw a reporter for the arts and for touchdowns every game you just want to make sure he's not turning the ball over in giving your defense just a chance they keep you in\nI've been I've been feeling really bad for James lately what I've been feeling bad flaming lately since yesterday\nYeah I just think man that's got to really feel crappy um see I'm trying to show sympathy and empathy whenever possible it's got to feel so awful sitting out those games suspended your teammate your teammates don't vote you captain you come back you haven't okay game you beat the browns barely\nAnd then you get out there against the Cincinnati Bengals team that you could and should be\nAnd you not only throw foreign interceptions but two of them are flat out bad throws and one of them is a touchdown and other one was in the end zone that could have been a touchdown for your team\nEverything on the field and everything off the field he brought upon himself so I have a hard time feeling sorry for people that that they they control what happens and he's throwing the ball he's the started all over and he's having this off the field stuff so man whether it's proved or not\nAnd I get that a little bit 'cause sometimes I feel like when you look through social media especially now you can't find a good word about the guy right so I get feeling a little bit sad that it's come to a point now where everybody is so piled on him\nBut\nYou report you saw oh man I mean like like all the all the bad that he's done off the field I can only feel it's a certain level if we want to believe that the things that he did were as bad as they were right and then you throw on top of that the lying in the field\nPlay or not if you're not wrong I feel I have a lot of empathy and I it it I cannot find any for dream as\nI understand that I saw Dan Patrick go in on them and just say he's not that good of a quarterback he's not that good of a person makes bad decisions on field and off he's he's he's an embarrassment to the Tampa\nBay community who [laughter] see I feel badly anymore [laughter] I mean I can feel bad even those embarrassing everyone to draw the line who are you\nTom and Tom what's up buddy\nLove the show thanking them on the ... you can have empathy but it to a point I mean this guy's you know like you said you just said it sure seconds ago it makes that decision on the field at all yeah oh really yeah listen you guys you guys you guys\nThanks dude I really appreciate that and as a guy who makes ...\nSuch as myself maybe that's why I feel bad for Jay because I feel bad for me when I make that decision\nTray we can go from ESPN who's one of those even keel like you know doesn't have too many hot takes her get to saucy tweeted

go back on the issue of aging drivers actually used to be involved with a two different a traffic safety teams a few years ago one of the things that we've talked a lot of course that never came to fruition and looked at never get\nA plus for the state level but uh we had actually talked about um\nMaybe getting a moratorium issued on where\nLike once you turn like sixty five or seven years old uh you go in for like a ... you know testing you have to be an beats like every two years later the four years or something\nAlong those lines were you know when you start age and everything kind of starts to slow down fall apart that already has you know they can put some limitations on your ability to drive or something along those lines I I think that's probably where are you know a possible solution is right there just have less sure when they tested every couple of years\nYet and those are on those things look real good uh until you are so you start to get close to fifty and you're like oh man was pushed that back a little bit and then you see your parents given their seventies like a chemical parents stop driving\nUm we're going to help save your life if you're the type of person who accidentally or unintentionally spoils things if you've had something spoiled for you\nWe'd like to confront that spoiler me of a TV show or TV show a movie or in this case\nTo sue rather shall we

his appearance at the comedy cellar last night you know he's been showed up for a surprise sets\nSo they promote it and people protested outside ladies protested holding cardboard signs like when you support Luis C K you tell women your laughter is more important than their sexual assaults and loss of their career\nWhere the guy's gotta get back out there and earn a living\nRight just decide make you uncomfortable Louis\nI Can't change whether or not Luis C K gets the comeback he's so desperately craves yet has done nothing to deserve says Mr McCray was holding the sign the legal director of safer campus is what I can change is whether or not he meets resistance and I feel it's my duty to resist\nOkay\nI mean it's it's great you can get a last second protest organizers suppose\nHe said he lost thirty five million dollars in an hour as a result of this scandal\nAnd my take is if enough people find it the testable they will not go see him and therefore he will not make money but clearly there's an audience for people who don't think what he did is that big of a deal well\nHe had a perverted abuse of power but if we're comparing him to all the other guys that got taken down during the me too movement he's harmless compared to those other guys\nRight Diddy abuses influence and put girls in weird positions probably am I upset about that I I I respect if you're a lady and you don't want to go see this guy do you think he's a creep you're certainly entitled to opinion\nWhich are crazy to think that all this has not affected him in any way right he's lost money he's embarrassed I like to think that he's at least ...\nLittle bit Seventy seven five seven nine one or two five I saw this story today about and uh a station in Antarctica now\nIf your station in Antarctica doing work

a regular practice to spoil the endings so books for the other person\nHeadline Antarctic scientist stabbed colleague on remote research station because he kept telling him the ending of books\nOkay well that's a fun activity stabbing that's more exciting than reading isn't it\nLike hey oh I I see are reading the joy luck club she's Asia\nThat's what you find out at the end I got rid of all my goodness I never read the by\nRussian investigators are probing a version of events in which both men's became avid readers to pass the lowly hours in the remote facility but a Mr surge a civics ski became enraged because welder Oleg ... fifty two kept giving out the ending to but\nThey had to evacuate him what country do you think they evacuated to from Antarctica man they got to save your life
