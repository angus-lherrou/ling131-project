definitely going to have that but I'm just saying hypothetically this is the scenario that icy possibly in existence right it's late Saturday but you know whatever night it hasn't been drinking causes Mel all day you're you're you're ... and then you know I\n... you're just getting friendly nothing too much and I come up with for a year man like\nLike whatever whatever I whisper right I could see you turning on me no I won't I promise you I won't but there's a silver me say that that's what I that's what I'm saying I'm concerned that that you after drinking when would turn on my wall I don't know if it's if it's gonna be worth it for me to put my feelings in life at risk would you like that\nWell here's the deal I Want to be the kind of guy that you guys are where if you were to go on a cruise which you are away from your loved ones and you get drunk you know you're not going to do anything with another girl I don't have a lot of practice in being a good boyfriend or even faithful so

your concerns that I ask him that I'm going to get mad at you were going to fight us yeah in the late hours you know three three for learning how to ... already largely by that on a cruise ship you know ... ...\nWhat's the scenario that drew is is arm in arm with a ...\nGoing back to his his cab and he'll not let that out and then you you say hey this isn't the best idea and then he tries to throw you overboard I mean ... ... ... well how do you see this going down there\nI mean I don't think he's going to try to throw okay let's maybe I should ask you questions or I go ahead what's okay well what should I stop you from doing\nKissing a girl that anything from kissing a girl and beyond\nAny of that stuff okay no okay\nWhat if what if I just see something like like like excessive\n...

I don't hold me you know animosity towards him obviously a but a ... you know I Try not to do the same thing with my son tried to be a good pair but that said\nThe uncomfortable role of disciplinarian is unnecessary one if you want your kid to understand boundaries limits\nAnd when it's time to turn off the electronics and that's my struggle because you talk to his girlfriend on face time he plays video games with his friends and we have a set we don't have a set bedtime but around ten thirty I go\nI go hey you know wrap it up ten forty five hey turn it off eleven o'clock shut it down\nTold him repeatedly how much I absolutely hate having to repeat myself because I see it as disrespect\nI see it as I should be able to tell you something because I don't ask for that much and you should heat it because I don't ask you for that much you should when I say wrap it up you'll be awesome if you could just wrap it up and I wouldn't have to say turn it off shut it down\nWell last night it was the worst it's ever been ten thirty hey wrap it up but ten forty five All right\nAnd it all off okay eleven o'clock shut it down alright Lebanon five I said shut it down eleven\nTen I still heard him on the freaking computer so I went in his room and I said what do you do it wasn't even playing a game he's like talking to one of his friends on his head set I live in Tennessee and I I Know sleep you and me both [laughter] so uh but that the deal is you get straight A's you you get you get leeway just like in life if\nYou're at work and you can achieve all your goals you get some leeway do you think about turning the power off to the home oh well it's funny you say that because I did post something on Facebook about it and uh and some people some dad said why go as a matter of fact said that he had he has to shut off the circuit breaker [laughter] for\nHis eleven year old that is going to be my move oh yeah well I'm I'm almost there believe me so so at ten after I went into his room and I said hey man\nWhat the hell\nIs like All right I'll shut it down I go shut it down right now was it at that tone\nNo no it was a it was a very annoyed like I don't want to have to do this town and then when he turned to me I don't know if this was in my head or if I really saw this but there was the slightest hint of a smart and that does not\nFly wait where he [laughter] when Denise mark\nWhen I said uh when I said hey man I ... I told them how I see this as disrespectful oh yeah and I said you know I Do everything you ask for I don't ask for anything and and you can't seem to respect me enough to shut it down when I ask you too\nAnd I don't know if he met just mark I don't know if it is how do you think adults American and then he's smart but there was a little and believe me I Know that smart I have that smart I Am that smirk\nOkay when he let out the smirk where are you wearing pajama pants because it's it's hard to take you seriously you on your mind the jama band\nWas the only ones with the with the Muppets on it with animal from them up and hardy animal what are you were in a tough just to pay picture or just to paint the picture I had my beastie boys awesome I shot that are sort of Star Wars fought smirk is starting to ... it started in ... I got to smoke now you weren't hat\nOr anything like an old ... hour after the gym I was a a you know end product and your hair and I do product ...\nStill still this work is not an inexcusable you got to dress up as you do your kids what's wrong with you about ... to yell at my kids [laughter] so when I saw the smoke\nI said are you kidding me right now so smirking at me he said no I said I can see smirking at me I said you know take me seriously he said I Do I said well I Would appreciate it very much if you would turn this stuff off when I ask you the first time\nAnd before I could see us Merck again I turned to leave and\nThe the door got closed a little bit more forcefully than I Would have loved him yes ... I Know it might have been me ... briefing by the door it might have been ... I'm not a ... a hundred percent certain uh who firmly shut the door so I didn't say anything I didn't do anything but is the first night\nOh man I Hope it will cry it was the first night\nThat he's been alive that I've been there that I haven't said I Love you buddy goodnight\n[noise] did you mean when you were thinking about that did you want to go back up there even text him or anything no where you are hurt or you just want him to have a space\nI was hurt I was mad and I could tell he was mad at me and I was like I hate being the disciplinarian it's so hard and I have a really good kid for those of you who have crappy kids I don't know how you ... can do it because this was a wants to uh once a once a year thing for me\nSo well what'd you say this morning okay\nSo last night I'm trying to sleep right and I have two nightmares involving what happened the first one\nHe's trying to drive a car and I'm telling him that he's not ready to drive a car yet and then somehow I ended up and shot gun and he drives and he doesn't know how to turn the steering wheel and he drives us into a lake he literally drives us a down the bank and into a leg and as we're thinking I wake up\nSo if I'm a dream interpreter or I look at that and I say ... you're experiencing fear that possibly if you're not prepared your son well enough for life and then you know him driving represents life\nCorrect you are definitely a dream interpreter 'cause you nailed that thank you and the second dream were in the penalty box at a hockey game together together he had I not even in hockey here but we're at the game is going on and we're sitting in the penalty box both of us\nI tell them not to push this red button and of course he pushes a red button and the red button takes us up like an elevator where we're going ascending above the Rick were stuck there and everyone's looking at us\nAnd I'm like I don't know how we're going to get down and then the penalty box turns into like one of those Ferris wheel carts where you start going like that and I think we're going to be dumped onto the ice and then I wake up in a cold sweat feeling like the worst at in the world\nWe should have never watched that damn terrorize our movie that's what's doing this to you got I got this one to ... okay go ahead John So\n... what what happens is you both being in the penalty box together right represents that you both are very very similar and that you know that you have a lot of the same traits you both in the penalty box so so you're you're you're like\nWhen he pushes that button that's him going against your ... your wishes yes and then you rising up above the crowd is used and being embarrassed for not being able to parent your child\nYou're not wrong you nailed it you're you're a dream interpreter thank you and says loves dreams on the radio and tattoo meanings um so I wake up in the cold sweat like four thirty I Can't get back to sleep he wakes up at six forty five\nI go out to the living room and he looks up at me and I said hey man I'm Sorry about the way I handled last night and he said it's my fault completely not my fault my fault but he said it's his fault completely\nAnd I said not completely I said I I have an obligation to treat you with respect he said you did I said well I ... I feel like I kind of lost my cool and he said it's my fault I should get off the computer when you tell me\nAnd I thought to myself why don't you [laughter] uh so you know a little a little understanding an apathy in in a in a night's sleep\nHopefully heal the wounds if you will I didn't yell at him like my dad would yell at me but then again I realized that this is karma for me so many times told my mom just to say how many times you tell your mom just a sec as a kitten playing Atari and my mom would go come on we need to go to your organ lesson just a sec and space invaders just attack\nSo that just a sec or hang on a sec has now skip the generate or not been passed down generation\nYou didn't tell him that did you know okay good I'll probably\nTell him tonight I I almost I almost put him on restriction I almost told him that he could not hang out with his girlfriend this week I was very very close because if you if you can't\nIf you can't execute the simple tasks that I'm asking which is turn off the electronics the first second or third time that I ask then we have to have a conversation if\nYou told him he couldn't see his girlfriend in the ... you're on the cruise do you think that he would he would not see his girlfriend now\nHis his his his mom who staying within would absolutely let him oh yeah so it'd be an empty punishment I'll be like hey you can't see your girlfriend she'd be like a hooker [laughter]\nSo is that is that what's next like God Forbid you have another episode like this is will there be punishment\nThere'll be there'll be consequences I don't know that keeping him from the the girl who makes him very happy as the right punishment but I don't know anything that would hurt him more I think if I were to take a Louisville Slugger to his electronic equipment his gaming computer as regular computers videogame system that would make me feel better and that would be more palatable to him\nThan me preventing Romeo from seeing Julie\nI mean you have purchased them a hell of a set up over the years to get every time he got ... you got 'em something new and I it's very comfortable chair and it's a looked like it looks like it's some sort of like late night techno club when he's playing video games I can understand why someone who started off me too\nMe too and and it's a social thing it's not just like he's playing space invaders lives off like I used to do is communicating with his friends that I get that but there comes a time in the evening when it's time to relax your brain give you give your mental acuity a break and uh and and get away from screen time we spent so much time on these damn screens\nIf you let them just go just free for all your charge what time what are you go to bed\n[noise] well I think he probably go to bed around midnight he has friends who stay up all night and day and ... that he knows that's not exactly what he makes fun of them for that but I but I feel like even during the week he would stay up late on the weekends he does stay up very late left to his own devices and sleep until about ten or so\nStay tuned to a podcast near you Seventy seven five seven nine one or two five and eight hundred seven seven one wanted to find what's up mark up\nAll the fellas all of the of the uh the last call that a chair that electronic device but I've seen on the Internet at one time\nOn your wrist ...\nJust to hold and then the other leg of just a lot of it the better go to ... go and get like a dollar sixty\nI live in the exchange rate to yesterday a ... like when you push

what are you wearing\nA a a let's say like Tampa Bay Julie ... good Will Shortz\nWho is is that cream circle where we'll see you\nKnow it's it's just all their life a little and a a contrast

greater than the loan perception of his talent that dude and somebody else who I won't mention on the radio is a is on another level\nMan I never got that guy But West Palm Beach seems to be like that right like I like that that market a lasso is hello nice to have marginal talent in these huge egos and I I don't I don't understand it but thanks man yeah telling us that he thought\nIt was the guy [laughter] ... um we they carried our show in a West Palm station was there a temp to syndicate real radio land out so they put us on but it was weird because they already at a morning show which was the love doctors\nDr rich and Dr somebody else and that Josh Coleman was there and I guide heat\nFor whatever reason could not stand the fact that they that they put us on that station so they took him off and put you on no he uh he was doing\nI don't know what his time so I was a time but we were supposed to attempt we're supposed to peacefully coexist\nAnd he would take shots at us all the

'cause I was looking up to ... I didn't know they made this movie did they set out to make a black anti or did they just cast the most talented actors for the part and she happened to be black\n\nOr they you know what I'm not going to lie on to that act it did they did not look it up so\nWe don't either I but but the the fact is what do we care it's a movie because this is this is a a fictional film involving a a rich dude who adopt\nA little orphan so so what if he's black ... why even let that rent a little bit of space in your brain\nYou know what it does is it gives black girls a movie that they can watch them feel good about and then you know what I mean like like what what is it what does it matter to you if they're going to remake ... bucks what\nWell if we're looking for a movie that young black girls can look up to why does it have to be a remake an identical remake of a movie\nThat was originally made sure that's not the right question the question is why do you care\n\nAgain for me that's the question why do you care\nFor me and again you already said it was ridiculous or or I'm not sure the right word you use for me that was one of my favorite movies\nRight so when they ruined it whenever they black neighbor and say they ruined it later on that is a good start\nOh sounds kind of like it you're not happy about it\nFor me again right I can only speak for myself correct for me it was a classic to eat right and\nTo redo a classical or at least for me either people in the movie and that might I'm Talking about from an individual perspective [noise]\nTake to based on sort of [laughter] sorry ...\nJay Z a thing it's a hard not was but I thought that my father\n[noise] from [noise] from\nUh from Miami that's on ... so so you don't want to see your lily white movies remain with a bunch of\nDark oh did you hang up on our no I don't think so you're still there right now here so yeah so I just want to ... I Want to cut through the BS here\nYou you don't want them remaking your white little orphan Annie and do black anywhere blaming if you will\nOkay well here's one thing that and again I chose that movie however at the other thing that I Want\nTo be you know is that if I had a favorite movie that was done with an all black cat the alternate it's true they have I loved the movie the way it was originally made whether it be a white cat or a black cat\n... she's got a highly which I Know she\nI imagine imagine if they remade friday with a you know Will Ferrell and John C. Riley I wouldn't say I'm for it and I love those guys [laughter] I'm just\nI'm just staying regardless of whether it starts out with a black cat for a white cat if it's a movie that's important to have someone whether whatever it may be for me it does take away from the original classic movie\nAnd it only takes away 'cause you'll like 'cause you allow it to like you're you're you're simply veiled racism is so disgusting uh and and I know that probably a lot of people would just let it go and be like yeah you're right let's go berserk crosses in black people's yards probably the people you associate with but ah but\nNormal people who see the world in probably a more evolved way they go hey I Love the movie any and I think it's great that they would really make it so that black girls can look up to any just like white girls looked up to any growing up you you're familiar with the wiz right\nYes he's on down the road and whatnot but\nDo you feel the same way about that do you uh do you feel like well why would they want to remake the wizard of Oz and allow black people in it\nAnd again I'll I'll go back to what I said and it's an individual statements that movie the original one I get it really it was one of my favorite movie\nI watched it I saw it but for me it was one of those movies where I Would say oh my God if they ... we make this movie with you know a while I can smell\nIt you know whatever it bother me you know only because it was in a movie that led much to me when it first came out\nI got you so you don't hear about a movie just it just so we could cut right through it just so or if you don't care about a movie it's okay to remake it with black people but if a movie is ... something you really really treasure you don't want any black people polluting your movie\nAnd and I go back to the original movie it was a black cat I'd probably be justice upset if they remain with an all white cat\nYou probably would not like the I mean no one believes that's why I bet if we're talking with a two thousand fourteen remake I mean it's Jamie Fox has camera dead as white people in the movie ... ideas [laughter]\nShe doesn't want any black people in and it gives her originally and he had no black people which is the way she liked it which is the way she wishes America was right now with no black\nGirl got better hairs of the original anti\nThat part is true I'll give you that [laughter]\nI mean when we when we look at what matters in this crazy world of ours my dear I gotta say Eileen a that's a silly silly thing to ... rent space in your\nBrain if you love the original any love the original any doesn't matter if they ... look I Love caddy shack and a couple of years ago they kind of made a black version of caddy shack with\nBig boy from outcast and at an all black cast didn't bother me one bit no I watch a movie and I laughed at some parts and I rolled my eyes in some parts but it it should if they were to remake the vacation franchise I Love court grows wild and I love Chevy Chase his car grows wild but I'll tell you if um\nIf the remake it I'm not going to bother me at all you know with a black cast\nUnderstand and I understand what you're saying\nBut like I said everyone has their own thing and then like you and again it's it's something that to get into right now like I I don't want to tell you that I Am I Am one of the minority and I and I'm white but I still do the other reference issue may\nSounds kind of raise this to me a call\nThis is a little Wayne ... knew a little while ago no Bill Clinton from that but I'm Wondering if ... they\nSlumdog drew yes ma'am\nOh hey it's alien again sorry I didn't know if I was supposed to hold on you or I Do want to thank you I Do want to let you do you want to thank you at the very least you for allowing the forum for me to share my\nOh I'm In Ohio I appreciate that and I\nI respect your your willingness to hang in there and and listen to me and give me your opinions and stuff it's a it's conversations like this I think that maybe helps us progress a little bit as a society Johnson ...\nI'm Sorry if I already missed this question if it was already asked you would you have had as big of a problem if they really made any modern day with the completely with an all white cat\nYes yes I Would and again I I'm sure a tree or not you're not going to believe that but I guess they would any of those for me any of those quote unquote ...\nAnd everybody has a different classic for theirselves I recognize that sure um for me yes they would um [noise] I I Would have yet but\nYou do understand how it sounds when you kind of said that the issue was daddy wore bucks was black and that back in the eighties there wouldn't have been a black character like that that's I mean I'm paraphrasing but that's pretty much the gist of what you said earlier\nCorrect that is that is that just that is they just do what I said I don't know that I came across correctly on the ... again to be honest with you I don't know what the climate was at the time there really was made I don't know how many black daddy wore budged there were so that may have been\nA um [noise] what's the word I'm looking for\nAn inaccurate statement on my part like I was just basically commenting on the way I looked at the movie back then and then the way I I saw the remake now that I'm sure\nYou know I I I think they did do a white version of friday and it was called the pineapple express um you know ... I mean it's not the same movie but the same flavor oh\nThat is that what the ... because they get high\nRisk could you make a white friday without it and I'm asking could you make a white friday without people flipping their you know what why\nAre we why are we calling the original friday a Black Friday now it's friday\nI think that that movie and I'm speaking completely out of turn here I think at the time\nThat was very big within black culture I thought that movie a in a funny way brought\nThat lifestyle in in living in that area to people a lot of people that hadn't seen it so I figured it would it represented can't be remain with white people that's a good point to be a it'd be a different way lesser impactful honestly\nLike boys in the same thing we're going to let you give me a ... the early nineties when that movie came out late eighties maybe I didn't know what that lifestyle was all about a job singles and made a phenomenal film\nSo if you made white boys in the hood actually pretty damn funny [laughter] I Love my I mean as a\nAs a young kid in a small town but there was all white seem friday was like kind of one of the first things where I remember like this has given me a peek into a lifestyle that I had never seen before and that's what it represented to me it was a great movie was very funny but it also was was a view into something that I wasn't familiar with\nSo I mean if you could change the remake of fry of any you one of the most treasured movies of your upbringing\nWhat ... how would how would we make that movie\nAnd then to be honest with you I wouldn't make it okay there are so many and again it's it's a different topic but there are so many ... and it's actually it's any shows and and what have you there are so many remakes of original ideas\nThat it it\nIt's almost like they can't come up with new ideas and I'm not saying that I I don't know that\nYou eat the truth but um [noise] I I I eat\nYou some way in which they have it's okay like yeah you put yourself in a corner today and I I'm not trying I'm Sorry\nNo no you're good I'm not trying to get you into a corner I I've I find it very interesting what you said I I think there probably is some bias\nTo what you said in the ... in the original part now you've got some time to think about it\nAnd and initially it kind of sounded like I don't like the remake of any if there are black characters now it sounds like I don't like remakes at all\nIt a little bit revisionist but that's okay you you you sound like a lovely young lady and I like the we ... we didn't have to yell at each other or anything and I appreciate that you're listening to the radio program and I hope you continue to do so I we\nThank you drew and have a great day guys\nAbsolutely Seventy seven five seven nine to five I mean what's up Alyssa welcome to grab a live\nBoy do I love your show and thank\nYou a list I presume that by the way our buddy my most drawn to it or just a white friday would be people in cubicles saying Happy Friday to each\nOther [laughter] that is so much [laughter] pretty good yeah\nYeah they're ready for you might say when I was going to say about it already on hold for like ten minutes so I had to\nWait it out anyway good what we're going to say well I was gonna say that the whole culture is changed this ... of the new black any um ... it's different it's modern day whereas the original was prohibition ...\nWhere's your social ... it's a ... black daddy were less but now I I Love the new Jamie Jamie ... I thought he wouldn't do any more but the Jamie Fox version\nOf any awesome brought me to hear that some of those is ... it was great alright yeah\nIsn't shows where our social standards are now a foster kid realistically could look at being adopted by a rich black dude like that's just where are our society I think that's great I think that's awesome\nGuy and look I gather you treasured that movie as a kid there was a it was a a part of your childhood but of all the things to choose the get earth than an upset about ... to make it a a a a remake of a movie that you love because of as a black daddy wore bucks I is Jamie Fox ... bucks for the new one I don't even know\nOf my main tourist black people what does that mean\nIn other words if there was if there was two sides to something you would be on their side\nTheir sides on your side versus their site in your world there is a white side and the black side\nIn my world no I don't think I don't think some some things are ever going to change like black people are racist white people and that's that's a pretty give it a shock\nTo think that you're a racist or not at all [laughter]\nYou think I'm racist because that's that's all you can say\nNo it's not all I can say I said money my man I could say let's see about you trust me on this\nAnd I can say plenty about your turn around and see what you look like\nYou've called me the R word you said that I'm black on the inside you think that these things portray you as an intellectual as an involved individual these things that you were saying to me\nWell I'm calling in a

was an Asian guy who was part of the er the Nordic God\nWhich um people actually did the outcry thinks anything you're talking about an end to cool um but I was wondering uh well how do you guys still then whenever a minority comes out that a Hollywood it's whitewashing I'm like for instance or the or Matt Damon\nOutcry they did for the great wall where um you know Matt Damon ... you know I'm cast with either an Asian movie yeah\nIt's on the losing their like Tom Cruise in the last samurai yes I'm here\nWhat are you guys but you've been going the other direction so to speak and putting white people in for a minority rolls\nI I'll tell you I don't get caught up and things like who Hollywood cast I figure producers want to put a guy in a role that's going to sell the most tickets and does it upset me ... certainly not what's up Ken\nHi there I just wanted to thank you for the entertainment I absolutely love your show you that guy called back four times he was totally your pitch\nThank you yeah no he was he definitely wanted to talk to me and I and I'm very flattered I or you know a guy who will be opposed to me a hundred and eighty degrees sees the world in a different way than I Do or songs or songs are gay and the guys in our word because he has a different opinion about things\nI'm intrigued that those people exist and that they choose to contribute to the success of a guy who fights against the very same principles that that guy spouses so I'm honored\nWith violence by prince you you have no fear your blood's would be that includes\nMm\nNow's the time to get ... by ...

know they all advertisers\nYeah ah they contribute to my success because they call up and they act as kind of a lightning rod for other people to come to our defense they make us listen longer they listened longer they contribute to our content so when you call up even your college stupidest question was and it was a stupid question\nAs dumb as your question was it'll make someone else go oh this guy trashing drew when he was a little bit more acutely so I'm not going to get into the nuts and bolts of ratings 'cause I don't want to get fired a but I Will say those who call up\nEspecially those who want to come at me with certain language make other people listen longer and some of those people might indeed be rated people if that makes any sense to your\nChallenge intellect yeah well I wasn't coming at you at all I just have some would\nSay you were just as it may be it was\nYeah I just if if if a lot of dying of the products that you're\nAt it as a matter of your calling in the

contributes to get so much that\nIt did you're contributing to the on air product of this show like you're giving us content for free I didn't have to pay for the caller I didn't have to do anything but allow you to call which will then make other people call that's making it appear as if people listen to our radio program\nSeventy seven five seven I Want to do five and eight hundred and seven

had no no no no one who ... says there are a good call was actually a good cause or no one who ... says hey I got something funny for you actually have something funny but do I have proven proven wrong\nSo so I just wanted to give some advice to the guy that was you know learning how to really get under your um ... you just get you get your ... on Twitter before game seven an eastern conference finals like I did\nHuh\nWhere yeah what what is a good call part\nOh I got I got it I think you you said something to somebody on Twitter you got suspended for twelve hours I'm guessing it was this guy they made the comment to what was that you\nYeah because yeah you remember what you call digital talked to a dummy right\nYeah oh yeah but at the site that you called ... and you just crossed the line and said that\n...\nYeah and in your reporting to Twitter yeah [laughter] I Know you don't do that your call it but\nI don't think you I don't think I called the guy who blocked me a ... for I think I just said that was a dumb thing to say and the and then the guy or the guy reported me I don't think that's really you\nKnow you really called me an idiot with what the\nReal worry so it really is him but I didn't say jocks never\nUh yeah you get a long time ago that's actually how I got a lot of them old\n... ... and that's what really got in\nSo I just love to see used to listen to the show\nI I'm not saying yeah but it's going to you don't use it once in awhile\nWhy if you're a fan why would you want to get under my skin\nBecause that's what is it good radio that you know that\nBut that wasn't on the radio that was like a that was opposed to you move to go to Twitter ago he use me he called me a ... an idiot and it hurt my feelings like I had it\nSet up it's set up a few times since ... you know later on\nAs he writes us I don't remember yeah you're you're not you're not remember you're not memorable at all\nBut listen thanks for being a fan guy I appreciate

human being possible the guy will call you a fan you report you for calling him a ... for four years ago on Twitter\nI think he he loves the show so much that he wants to be involved and he got involved with the show when when he block you are when he reported you to Twitter and you weren't as bad as it was something we brought up on the air I don't know if we made a big debate about it\nBut he feels like he could tribute to the show and he I think he wants to continue to do that with a weirdo but if you love the show so much why not want to make a contribution to a positive or negative contents content\nI guess but like reporting somebody I don't I don't understand it well they only put you in time off for twelve hours it\nWas a long twelve hours south it's wise is twice the
