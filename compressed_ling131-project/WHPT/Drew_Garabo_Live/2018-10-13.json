I mean I went I went I was like oh no no that won't cause the pool was the sizes some hot tubs and there was it was a ...\nAs a patriot to a gym and you know it's a real people they're not well\nHave you ever been to rehab in Vegas or pool party in Vegas now\nIs whether the ... so it does nothing to do with the people I don't know how I Would say they'll do that but for ... bit I'll tell you that experience what you saw it right there it's not that it's weird that's actually just what it is and for most people that that their deal that's their whole and vacation shot in the ...\nAnd I are they all nasty [laughter] cold\nAnd I respect that and I have a lot to do after you get on a vacation I respect that and I actually had a conversation\nWhere somebody is that this you know some people you know this is the this is their deal this is there like one trip or ... you know whatever that you and they have a blast they've had a ... but the one thing just not for the Internet was horrendous\nAnd the Internet on the cruise ships is notoriously\nOn purpose yeah you're not here to get ... I Would say this about a cruise last might cops cruise I went to I was leaning up against the bar and this guy walked up to me and he goes hey Kevin you haven't fun man this is great I'm just relax and he goes did you see this on Facebook\nAnd I go [laughter]\nYou wanted to disconnect the only thing I Want it from the cruise\nYou're not going to call me there's no expectation that I have to contact you and I just don't have\nTo think about anything for two or three days I'm not going to get the best food I'm not good I can but on the boat though I Will say this I mean I'm On a boat I can get the drinks I like that the lady knows my name for three days ago remembers the dream that I like and\nI could talk to my girl then to do that one thing that she won't\nDo that right yeah I mean if the vacate that here you go nowhere great great things have leaders room\nThe great things happening hotel room okay right when you go away with ... you know normally you don't do at home but I Do a girl or your\nWife you complained about the room do you didn't get the best room they had no I didn't complain about their own I thought oh I don't know I was actually\nSurprised that was the one pleasant a surprise about my expectations I thought the rooms were closing closed in and the the the the uh the\nBed folded out of the law and there was a little horn whole and like well there are\nI get it and I did but I suspect that I get it at the time this rock record and\nI don't know what you're talking about I Want on the waste this cruise and they had good food\nBut that's a big one at a Fort Lauderdale right there\nAnd they I don't remember where we left they were actually haven't days all of that\nOr do you want to do the seven days they medically but I\nBut I Do have to say the best thing about it I didn't like the way I could afford or whatever I Want it so I'd I'd I'd instead of being you know ruining turning back I just ordered something else\nThere were times there was meals I order three entrees to get one that I liked but their way to talk to you with the no no no no yeah you replace it with my count them All right\nRobin Kelly right and the machine right there were three entrees just to eat it all three entree so I mean there was a lot of food being so how did you get to show last cruise I widow when I co workers or less the who hot everybody well no no no I got it right [laughter]\nI feel cheated\nI was a comedy the comedy is over good ride yeah okay\nI mean those to him and those two are funny and ... and Mike and they did you know there's improv thing with the music and and they play a song a cover but make up the lyrics\nRight on the spot yeah talent but we're missing like Kevin ... come in there and like do take time now when when did I ...
