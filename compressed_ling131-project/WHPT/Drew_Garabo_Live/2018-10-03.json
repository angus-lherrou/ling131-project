University when uh [noise]\nAt one one national championship protect Tony ... was the best player on that team those while ago [noise] uh but I'm a I'm a big ah especially playoff hockey fan [noise] um no I mean I think the biggest thing is I um I Believe strongly that\nOne if you look at the the pundits you know we're not take to\nTo do all this year the Vegas has thirty one I just saw the other day or I was told that on uh ESPN at us and an hour raise each twenty eight I search teams and you know I think we can be much better than that but more than that\nUm you know we were allowed to September to have optional workouts and you can't make guys come a\nAnd yeah we had eight optional worked out since September ... all Fifteen guys made at least six of those and that's just don't get that in the NBA so I think it shows a\nCommitment a tricky to get any better or to make your progress both for our group group for for the eyes and as you guys know that's where everything starts at ... at the very least this year the thing I'm most comfortable with it is I'm comfortable that we can say that we're going to put a team on the floor that were to be proud of\nYeah and I think as a magic fan or that's all I'm looking for the team that you can watch and not pull your hair out and go man or what are they doing out there I Want a team that can be proud of a team that's going to be entertaining to watch and I think that you're the guy to do it I think are you a great guy to pick up where Frank Vogel left off\nAnd to to really fight and focus on a defense it's been nonexistent and it turned the franchise around no pressure whatsoever I look for you guys to make the playoffs this year Steve you're a great dude and I wish you the best of luck both with the team and and with your health and I and I hope it's a great year for you as a magic head coach and for us as magic fans\nThat's great I appreciate that very much yeah no problem whatsoever be good or right okay thank you\nYeah you bet Steve Steve Clifford everybody fascinating to speak to a head coach of any I like I Would talk to their head coach of the the well not the Oregon Ducks 'cause that's not a major sports franchise but coaching is such an interesting thing you've got John Cooper hearing in uh Tampa Bay right former lawyer former lawyer went from arguing case law\nTo coaching hockey players how do you do that I feel like NBA coaches getting run through more than any other sport\nThey've got the least amount of job security I think of any ... and it's an eighty two games season\nIt's like either you have control these guys are you don't there's really not an in between I think when it comes to the NBA\nI learned very early in a in the magic playoff run with Shaq and penny how the players can turn on you and get you fired even if you make the playoffs they did it to Bryan hill\nWhich depending hard away lost his ... whatever\nFor Brian Hill respect appreciation went to management went to ownership and Brian Haile a great coach in the NBA now an analyst boom ... or I think it might be a coach again that that's how they do by the way their coaches there analyze you have no job security the minute they go up Steve ... lost the locker room\nSteve livers lost his job isn't that crazy why is it\nSo much like that in the NBA and not so much like that in the NFL because we talked a lot this week about if they're cut her has lost the team or if they're playing with passion for dirt cutter why doesn't that seem to uh you know a quake to football as well\nQuestion I think the NBA is more personality based when it comes to superstars your bronze you're a ... it's so personality based that those players individually carry a little bit more weight so when they go hey I Can't\nAnd what this guy you know and also there's only one twelve fourteen players so if you lose two three four guys you know since the last you know twenty five thirty percent of your old team for sure and and those guys the NBA more than any other sport except perhaps baseball rewards mediocrity with astronomical\nContracts if I if you were six five if I was six five and you could pull down ten rebounds and put up twelve points a game you making thirty million dollars right now for some NBA team\nThirty million oh I've got paid because of the stretch machine we're gonna make sure he's six five and she's going to go play for the Los Angeles sparks\nWNBA they don't get paid but I I was gonna say the WNBA that they have to get one they were working at the you know we want them to be able to make a hundred and eighty two million dollars a year like Katie from his hold my breath for that to happen [noise] Seventy seven five seven nine when did you five anyway I just wanted to get Steve on because I think he's a fascinating guy that stuff about about not sleeping on\nI'm going through right now I don't know if it's a there's a shift in the moon or if it's because this cruise I'm so excited about or whatever but I I'm sleeping for a good five hours at a stretch get up with my son send them off the school sometimes sleep for another Ninety minutes and then my days here\nYeah I I I think I'm drinking more coffee or J. cause I switched from the the cure it to the pot suddenly being like a pot and every morning but it'll be one o'clock at night you know one o'clock in the morning and I'm not asleep and I pop right now for like seven\nYeah yeah it's a ...\nI feel okay do you feel okay right now\nI feel tired I feel more tired I think I've been maybe like have a ... or something\nSeventy seven five seven nine one or two five not an eight give us a bit of suck us one of those whatever's bad I've been possessed they're both bad they both possessed you yeah it's not good drink a lot of low\nPay day Joe what's up this is Joey bad hay joined I joined that yeah\nAs superheroes or like Joey man he's like a little baby kangaroo like you can turn into a Joey unhappiness miles pouch at any time it'd be ... capture man out of it\nHuh but um yeah it was just like ... like a superstar league NBA is like Jordan I Can't remember the coach before they'll jak Jordan got it bars and a ... or ... started late\nYeah it was so uh yeah but I mean it it got a great yeah you can lose your job like they do it well in the job that you lose a lot of room in the NBA anyway\nAnd and those guys those those NBA athletes they're such prima donnas and I don't know if it's because they've been told that they were basketball God's since they were twelve years old or whatever but these\nThese dudes that mentality is change man back in the day sure you Larry Bird could be a deck and I'm sure behind the scenes he was an ego just a cool guy wanted to get paid but all those guys had a working class mentality kind of like the NHL does now like the NHL they seem like real dudes with jobs but just their job happens to be\nSkating around and launching themselves with other players and trying to score goals the NBA ... it's ... for the most part and there are a few exceptions seems to be a league of divas who have serious serious ego issues\nI think but I like the bat boy than that oh yeah they do it for like ... era now but you all have fallen as soon as bad as they say\nOh thank you I Know those two are mutually exclusive we can't have fun and be safe but I appreciate it did you grow up in the Arab the motor city Mad Men the bad boys are the pistons\nIt was a little on my uh on the backside airing during the second coming of the pistons which on CNN and ripping everybody I was going to I was going to a lot of play off games for some reason we got them when I worked at Applebee's we got a lot of tickets yeah and a free tickets yeah yeah I was I was in with the manager\nRight yeah I Know yeah we got 'em at Fridays and bending and say like we hang out of bed and games and the players would come in and they give out tickets like nobody's building that was it that was a good time\nYeah that was pretty deep back in the early days the magic 'cause you go to the bending of the fashions Cornell and after any game

expectations that season welcome to the show and thank you\nThank you guys very much yeah I mean it's always tough to be one of the thirty teams that loses your last game and it seems like you know and this one was tough and\nI Know it's funny you go through the different stages of emotion right you're angry or shocked and surprised and all that I tend to live in the angry part yeah quite a long time in the summer yeah I watched the capitals parade just to state angrier wow longer\nUm but now we're back at it they just added a you know and we feel very good about our team and I think all of Tampa Bay should feel good about their team\nI think so too and I see tea buggy takes on the anger as well a a sudden or about probably takes a lot of that anger and and I don't know how that anger gets back out and and you perjure yourself the buggy but I Hope you can find a way for me it's just sadness I don't I don't know enough about hockey to get mad yet\nIt just makes me so sad like last year I'll just never forget we did that broadcast game seven and we're sitting there going\nOoh what's good producer weren't learning English\nAnd you watch the game and you just get your heart ripped out you go oh I couldn't watch the victory parade I could barely even watch the uh the the NHL Stanley Cup finals because it just hurts that bad when you see these guys that you root for all season long and it it breaks your in my case human or in your case bumble bee hard\nTo uh oh oh you did it again not above all be did it again I Know his leaving always leaves oh this is not good it's just not good I thought it by lightning bug I I met I met lightning bugs ... I Know I Know a lightning\nI Know it's on the front of the the yellow in the black you all all those bugs look alike to me I'm Sorry I don't know what I meant by that I just met the optics of it it it really uh\nLast time you are calling them costume freaks and today it's this I mean what what are you trying to do to the relationship that we built up over the years how does\nHe get so expression filled when he has no face like how does that he could sell me whatever's on march right yeah I feel you managed to remote without without making any facial expressions\nWhat a hell of a lightning bugs or he is now a I noticed that we have brought the Josh from capital tacos this is in my opinion marrying two of my very favorite things in the world which is Tampa Bay lightning hockey and the live experience that Emily arena\nAnd then capital tacos which just open up in ... in St Pete a little bit ago the original of course out their inland lakes and they're widely chapel if I'm by a my math is correct as well just thanks for coming in and out and tell us about this a relationship between you and the Tampa Bay lightning\nYeah well thanks for having us um we're trying to take the word capital back make it make it a positive work on a path right capital taco so yeah we got to court to put us our partnership with a lightning super excited about one is we are going to have to stand in the arena very and I am so yet section three twenty wanting to find this up there by the corps like between the pipes bar\nBut once I started hearing about who they are and what they're doing and how they're doing it I'm like\nThis is perfect yeah I was actually really hoping that something came together and it came together really fast yeah good um and now all of a sudden they're going to have a stand Saturday\n[laughter] man and I I tell you as a as a lightning than in a capital tacos fan I couldn't be happier three years ago I never had it and heard all these people talk is I'm In restaurants I'll travel anywhere for good food all these people talking about you know capital tacos outlandish capital taco so one time that coming home from Cal to south for the first time more than ...\nUh I uh I was like man I really got to make it a point to hit there and what I like the most about it is all their tacos are also available as bold so if you're living that life on sending you get any of those tacos in a bowl and uh you're not worrying about the way it\nShould be glad to know that after living three weeks of the key to life I'm about to break it with those very\nNow what about what do we have right there is that the ... chicken bill to I got to hear and ten more oil away after graduation or the ... I can I ask\nOne more question when you're coming in\nA and I don't want to cause trouble between anybody ... this is for you I'm Eric Blankenship mentioned that maybe the bug you needed some for breeze maybe ... was a was\nA little ... you have a little little funky Iran I mean you know I mean here's how I'm going to put a marketing spending all that common with you one hundred percent accurate by the way I Will take on that\nI Believe the bug has been working exceptionally hard over by a few weeks getting getting ready for use in 'em and may have skipped a a batter to to be able to make all these appearances which is a great sign of is a hard work and dedication\n[noise] would you rather have a funky throwing that they'll get or do I but I appreciate it because hockey equipment in hockey players they smell smell you can't ... the buggy is very close to that smelled [laughter]\nThe the unmistakable a robot hockey locker room I'll tell you that it's like any of its unlike any sport I've ever experienced before now do any of you skate like well enough to play on the\nI can I can get on ice skates you are yeah yeah I I'm no good or something or well no I was going to face it\nWe have staff hockey games where you know the one in the locker room yeah that is has that are um yeah but anyway you guys would always come out and a gate with a lot\nAbout this wasn't a roast today I don't know why I live that way or the best I Love you\nAnd one on one question from Twitter ah I Love everything go both describe hearing Eric Blankenship again another question after a win last season coming back in the locker room the song was shots the broiler remakes by imagined dragons will that stay the same and who picks that song\nSo they want the goals I Know I don't think they're thinking of fits in the tantrums I think after a when when they would come back out uh you know they they do the stars of the game and\nThe outcome and circle the I yeah yeah so I give all the credit card game presentation to a gentleman that we actually ironically called the prince of darkness\nWho was John ... amazing oh so you guys know job interview John has a great team of people and they go and songs slack for the season obviously there are some songs that you guys know are staples for the Tampa Bay lightning and then they're going mix and a few other ones\nI'm not sure that's one that gets changed um it's crazy because there was a lot of imagined dragging songs that really fit yeah obviously to the lightning and thunder song being the most prevalent up those certain songs

reason that they want to make sure they could test every American with the phone and and\nI mean that you have to test to see if it works so when the real emergency is on the horizon we're ready but the real emergencies here already what what's the real emergency\nI don't know yet but they had a job there was a there is a motivation behind hey we're gonna we're gonna send a group mass taxed to

to be to other people that I Can't I Can't tie down\nSame uh okay so here it is right here [noise] so there's there's Mike up job obviously you can talk to this is Mike ... got the G chat to\nAnd then um and then there's Burt and there's Robert Kelly right I don't know who that is coming out of the ship hold that might be John Brennan because he has a matinee like good looks are you looking at right now is that\nNo matter where I don't know where we're\nHere you go so you got you got hurt and he got a got Robert Kelly right I don't know who that is I think that's supposed to be John setting there's Carmen their Spanish there's gal that I don't\nYou think you could tell clearly who everybody is except those two guys so I don't know why that would be you would John and you're not really sure about\nIt yeah I don't think that's a I don't know who that is me either that's Pat Pat bright guy taught that was Pat Pat\nSomebody ... somebody probably Pete oh maybe I don't know\nAnd I think the guy who made that yeah Austin yeah you know oh I think maybe he's in\nOh yeah I don't know oh no no I feel stupid\nSo we're who which one would you be again if you were there\nI thought that was me between Galveston Spanish oh no it's definitely ... yeah that's definitely a I'll go\nNow I guess I feel better because I felt bad about myself but that's how someone sees me but if that's not that I don't feel so bad\nAs what one of those uh is that on the far right is that supposed to be geo\nOh what's your doesn't have any hair or does he have hair now I I don't know who's coming out of the boat John Brennan maybe\nCan't believe we're spending time talking [laughter] Seventy seven five seven nine five and eight hundred seven seven one or two five hangar is a real thing you are now is there anybody who doesn't experience anger right we all get it\nOh absolutely yeah some handle it better than others I don't handle it well at all\nWhat are your symptoms when you're angry uh pretty much how I Am all the time\nSo [laughter]\nOh that is so far I didn't realize until I got older that the you know you really needed to eat because it it ultimately does affect your mood\nIt does remember when you were a kid you could just go you you go like a day without eating and you wouldn't even think about it but then you'd eat ten pizzas and a day\nI'll tell you one of the biggest side effects of hang of hangar makes it worse is indecisive ... like if we're going out to eat somewhere or ... or we need to decide where to eat and I'm paying Greek oh I Can't decide and then the fact that I Can't decide because I'm angry makes me more angry\nI Will tell you there is nothing that angers me more than being hungry leaving my house and not knowing where they're going you can't do that driving around not finding any place becoming more hungry big mistake that the hangar becomes ...\nOr whatever you want to call you do not leave the house until you know exactly where you're going and you have to have a backup plan a case that that place doesn't work out for some reason\nOr another side effect as when you're angry and you go through that process to finally deciding at least for me what I'm willing to accept from the surface as far as if I'm not greeted right away if I'm angry and you're greeted me ... minutes I'm leaving angrier than when I got there\nSame and I will sacrifice what I Know will be a meal for an uncertain meals somewhere else even though I Know it's just going to make me angry or because you neglected me mhm I I feel like restaurants should have\nA crash course in how to deal with angry customers like we're coming to you and we pretty much got crisis going on\nLike this this vicious circle of I'm hungry I don't know what I Want to eat I decided on something you took four minutes to talk to me I'll kill you with us for\nExtra people who need a drink at the end of day they don't have to wait forty minutes to get their drink\nDo they go right to a bar and they get their damn drink\nWill see and that's why when you're ... like at the peak of angry at us and trying to find a place to eat Mexican restaurants are a great pick because you're gonna
