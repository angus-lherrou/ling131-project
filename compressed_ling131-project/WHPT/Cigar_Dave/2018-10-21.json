home grown with some friends and getting really into craft beer and\nHad a background in journalism and and writing and wanted to get more into that as opposed to a you know doing doing the salesman gig I was selling running shoes a for a a running company that is no longer in business unfortunately and and kind of saw the or riding on the wall and wanted to\nUm make a career change in this uh this opportunity popped up and\nOne thing led to another and I was uh on my way to Boston a shipping up to Boston as they say right um so\nI've been out here for almost eight years now and just a building redound and um you know trying to trying to grow this\nThing into the into the leading publication in the states [noise] so you're California guy living in Boston so you're not a patriots fan

other crew would die hard bills fed so I've been out in California what what part of California did you grow up\nSo they were up in northern California grew up in San Mateo just outside of the city\nUm and spent my whole life there went to college at Santa Clara university I'm stuck around Silicon Valley for a few years and that's kinda right ah in that area when I was living in that area is when I really started developed a passion for craft beer\nChris when are the editor of ... dot com joins us as we celebrate cigar October fest talking about the state of the beer industry and just kind of looking at trends and taste and what's going on so Chris so tell us about ... how did you uh uh how long has that been around in a ... I'll tell you the website is fantastic ... tons and tons of information\nWhich I enjoy it so I'm One of my book mark pages that I a scholar every week stuff's about ...\nYeah so a brief around as part of a large organization called ... ah we're a business to business trade company we posed a business conferences around the country we have three different websites one for a non alcoholic beverage professionals one for\nUm a food professionals in one for beer professionals and we publish daily or ... I think was launched um you know right around two thousand and two thousand eleven at the time it was just sort of a a pet project internally for a couple of guys\nHere um horse who were super into beer and they didn't really um you know how much\nDirection or you know what they wanted to do with it at the time um and our our owner John ah you know kind of took the project on and said\nLet's expand and into the beer space and\nUm yeah it it sort of transition from more of a a blog site into a full fledged a daily news publication um so I came on board I think my uh my first day was a gosh uh January tenth two thousand eleven um and I think that week we had\nI don't know maybe a hundred or a hundred and fifty people visit the site and now we're going to have over five million page views this year\nIncredible it is a great site tons of information and when we look at the explosion of the beer industry specifically it's really been the craft beer movement\nThat has really provided over growth and I think the testament to that is the fact that the big boys if you can't beat them join them and have CNN highs for Bush we should all the the big guys come in and start to acquiring\nA number of these craft brewers or or boutique brewers and ah they're there and and so it's kind of an interesting\nWay of uh what is going on right now and there seems to be a little backlash from some of the a diehard craft brewing aficionados\n[noise] yeah so over the last few years I'd say I mean you you can sort of trace back much of the merger acquisition activity to [noise] um I'd say two thousand I think it was two thousand eleven when goose\nIsland uh was purchased by Anheuser Busch um and that was really sort of their first their first acquisition and I don't think they even really new kind of what they were going to be doing I'm In the crafts face when when they bought the silent out of Chicago um\nAnd their strategy didn't really developed until a few years after that I'm so they sort of a plot at a course for a regional strategy buying breeze in different areas of the country I'm In fact in in Tampa where you are they a came really really close to a purchasing cigar city\nUm debt deal like yeah and and that deal fell through 'em and suggested he ended up selling to a different um craft brewery collective uh called can already um which was formed a by the founder of of Oscar booze out of Colorado\nOr as well as a private equity firm here in the Boston area firemen capital partners so\nUm you know we've seen a lot of deals says obviously Anheuser Busch has gotten into the states pretty heavily spent a lot of money and inquired about ten different breweries a Miller corps has a few breweries that they've purchased over the last couple of years that constellation has three breweries a funky Buddha and your neck of the woods\nUm that I purchased um Heineken purchase log Anita so\nUm everyone sort of has a their their craft a brewery horse if you will and the race um and then we've also seen a lot of transactions on the private equity side so\nI'm you know really since I got into this space or it's been sort of a flurry of a ... a activity it it really picked up um you know twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen slow it a little bit last year and it's been\nUm relatively quiet this year as well as everybody plates are pretty much full\nChris wrote Ari editor ... dot com is our guest of course it's interesting you mentioned the some of the company's cigar city brew enjoy reading or we do very well we've done numerous shows from

B. E. M. to soften the Buffalo News here's the headline from a two days ago new craft breweries have opened in western New York with lots more planned in coming months\nThey're looking at a one two three four five six seven eight\nAbout eight to ten new cap rooms and some micro breweries are and in fact what's interesting is there's ... house that they've been working on trying to open for the last\nI think I don't know three four years and getting investors and a batch brewing actually which is based in Buffalo they're opening their own ... brew house so it's kind of interesting to see how in in pockets of the country\nThe enthusiasm for beer and brewing houses and tap rooms is a is still still growing\n[laughter] yeah you know I think um it's to me it is looking more and more kind of like a restaurant business uh right you know if you think about\nUh just the way that these breweries are financed and you know the way that lenders operate to um you know they're they're lending a significant amount of money\nTo actually build out so they're spending on construction to build out the ... and to build up the tab rooms and then you know make them look beautiful and and that's not money that a bank has ever getting back um so it is very similar to the restaurant business right there's not a whole lot of\nAssets that they're that they're actually financing other than the equipment I'm so in in my opinion or any of these operations that started up I think that they should be trying to do it as lean as possible take on as little as possible\nAnd open as quickly as possible and start selling beer directly to consumers at the highest margin possible so that they can service that debt and get you know quickly get to profitability\nRight and and you know what's interesting is when you look at some of them look at some pictures of some of these places a they have a picture of community beer works up in Buffalo that opened this past summer\nAnd again nice or interior not overly crazy uh but that seems to be now the place where people you know want to congregate and hang out not necessarily a a a you know club where there's banging music and it's just loud and didn't you know crazy life\nIt seems there's been a shift it's almost like the ... of yesteryear and\nThis is what you see now it's more of a socialized social atmosphere\nAnd I think you are right on the head that if you could open up\nNot go crazy you don't have to be the biggest you don't have to be the best you don't have to have a three million dollar build out in fact a lot of the successful ones are the ones that are very cozy and quaint they they just make good beer and and people will go regardless of you know whether it's a three hundred thousand dollar build out or a third three million dollar build up\nYeah exactly I think the bigger question though for me at least is you know how sustainable that model is um you know if you have a two breweries on on a on a city block and then two more open you know you haven't created any new customers now there's just\nFor companies competing for the same customers that were walking down the street right so I'm ... ... on one hand yeah they're bringing a lot of excitement and enthusiasm the category but on the other hand\nYou know does the industry risk kind of turning it back on traditional bars and restaurants and if so you know what the ramifications of that you know five ten Fifteen Years down the road\nWhat we've seen a number of restaurants that have actually gone and within the restaurant creating a small you know almost micro micro brewery just to create some of their own beer and kind of as an attraction and we've seen that a number of restaurants here in the\nIn these cigar city of Tampa but I'm seeing that more and more where restaurants are looking saying you know what we want to get in on this action we don't want to go crazy\nBut they're still kind of a unique market to do that\nAbsolutely I mean I think you know we we talked about the opening and closing more breweries are going to continue to open for sure I mean we're seeing you know I think what like two two and a half\nBreweries opening per day is is the uh the clip 'em and and that will probably continue in into next year I don't know when exactly it'll slow down many people think that\nUh there could be as many as ten thousand breweries and brew pub throughout the United states here very shortly um\nAnd most of those again are going to be pretty small tapper and focused or like the ones that that are mentioned in that article from from New York so it'll be interesting to kind of see how it all shakes out in long term you know how many of these businesses survive I think you know the big\nThe big looming question over all of this is like can we get more consumers to drink beer at a time when beer sales are you know overall relatively flat because\nYou know if you think about it just like a bar you can stick more caps in the wall but that doesn't mean you're going to sell more beer you still have to get more consumers and your door right so the same kind of rule or theory applies to the to the broader industry yeah you can have them thousand breeze but if you're not creating new consumers than you know who's drinking all the beer\n[noise] Chris ... dot com joins us today as we celebrate cigar October fest Chris let's take a look at some of the breweries that are really starting to expand that have been successful in their own markets that maybe\nYou are are are a ton of stores are ... that are listening should be on the lookout for I Know for example Brooklyn Brewery started in Brooklyn they've now grown to ... were twenty nine or ... states across the country but give us some names of breweries that are really starting to grow\nThat we may be able to find their products that we haven't been able to the last number of years yeah for sure\nUm there are a few that comes to mind a you know if you think about\nUh now that the the trend is obviously more local right so a lot of these companies that are growing um tend to have tighter distribution footprint so access to their beers a for a lot of your listeners might be a bit of a challenge um", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Cigar Dave", "city": "Sarasota", "day": "21"}
