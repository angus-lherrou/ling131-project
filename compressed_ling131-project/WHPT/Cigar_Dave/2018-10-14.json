the cigar deep show presented by data of Tampa cigar lounge on one of those two point five the boom [noise]\nDoing cigar October fest here on the cigar Dave show the entire month of October combining cigars and beer\nWe'd every day reason or an occasion to celebrate but certainly October fest in cigar October fest is the perfect way to do so perfect excuse for us to light up a find cigar do some beer bearings and I'm looking for a magnificent beers here at avid route company downtown St Petersburg we're talking about home brewing water one the science\nOf brewing it is becoming increasingly popular hobby\nSo this week we're talking about everything you need to know about a home brewing the equipment you need to process so we welcome you back to avid route company downtown St Petersburg with Jeff color the owner and master brewer counter Myron I should say gentleman that\nThat downtown St Petersburg always experience day renaissance in terms of restaurants and and housing and and activities but it's really become a beer epicenter a cool little micro center of beer activity\nTotally it is it's it's grown over the past few years um we've been here about four years um you know green bench kind of started the whole revolution around here and bringing in some different unique beers and and uh uh you know cycles following cage no sale work seen the brewing\nUm they instill going\nAnd you know what ... will put up a map a cigar day dot com where we will put little pins on all the different breweries that are in the downtown St Petersburg area actually we're looking at one right now it's called the brewery bay I didn't realize just looking at the entire cigar city area Tampa Bay area the number of breweries\nBut uh there's a ton of 'em in downtown St Petersburg so if you're considering a visit\nDown especially between the months of like December and march perfect time if you're a beer enthusiasts some great places great restaurants the great blue pubs right here in downtown St Petersburg so we'll outlined now\nOne of the things that you gentleman mentioned that brewing is all about time and temperature and as we learned in step to mastering of the grains you basically steep the grains whether it's wheat or whether it's cracked barley in hot water between a hundred and forty two degrees and a hundred and fifty nine degrees and you both said\nTime and temperature that's all brewing is about crucial\nAbsolutely I mean if you if you don't go long enough it's not going to convert all the starches and then you're just going to have less alcoholic beer and if you go to long which isn't too much of a problem but you can start extracting slaves you don't actually want so\nNow or hour and a half as a temperature your one for the body are trying to find is really important to kind of nailed down and taking notes being sure you're you're repeating so if you make the same here again you can either not make the bad beer again or make the good beer again remember those composition\nBooks we used to have back in grade school\nWhere you write everything down they were kind of bound I Would say if you're going to be a home brewer that's a good investment to make because Everytime you make a badge I Would assume the exact amount of time the temperature so you could look back and take notes and say you know I liked that particular beer but\nLet me try one degree more for maybe another few more minutes see what that does and then you hit that a ha moment\nWhere you get exactly the formulation you're looking at the brutal fulfilling I'm sure it is in your head on and so when you were all your everything the exact same way absolutely have you know that I have an entire rest of you know book full of just notation\nThroughout the whole process and that is guarded I noticed a very large fault as you walk in here and that is garden nobody's getting near there in fact there's there's patrol dogs right right around the secret service [laughter]\nAll right so time and temperature key elements in brewing now after you match the grains and you said roughly what an hour mhm okay what's the next step\nSpar judging which ... is basically a fancy word for renting the grains out there who needs to rinse that sugar out of the grains that you've converted the starches you convert into sugars and now you're trying to rent although sugar's out into another pot or\nTake the grains outta that pot and runs the sugar side of the grains you just want to separate the grains from the show so you want the sugars up do you what the sugars in so that you can use that to boil off so you want you're trying to remove the grain\nOh so once the grain is don't you don't need it anymore you know my understanding is that many breweries when I was up at ship your brewing they told me that uh they show the remnants of the grains to various farm so they had continuous reviews in the area\nYeah you can make dog biscuits out of it too and I'm sure as\nMy chickens love it they'll go crazy after a while and then they'll they'll gorge on them\nSo it's like a dry just becomes like when you try it out it's just ... it's\nPretty empty of any\nGrant there's chickens like it and thought that our compost compost is another alternative okay so\nHere have a I met him angel we give our grains to for his coats really mhm\nSo basically there's no waste whatsoever constant recycling that's it alright fantastic so far junior reducing the sugar out of the grains you're getting rid of the grains your retaining the sugar and the water which is called war ... W or team now\nWe I've actually sampled the war\nAnd when it's warm tastes pretty good it's like a ... it's like a sweet tea rain T where we're at a did even brewing and and Mike Brian said try this I said boy the smell was incredible you could actually make a tea or a soup out who it was actually I thought it was just drink it in of itself we we bottled\nA couple of bottles of a I'm a black guy PA and it tasted just like a ... a a non alcoholic stuff because it doesn't have any alcohol in it um so it's it's a pretty good stuff\nSo the word is basically the ... the sugars with the water or after\nYou have matched the grains so the ... of the sugar out and then you create the war and that's going to be the base of your beer absolutely okay so that's you're basically that's your stock that's your your ingredients right there that's the that that starts the process so now that you've got the war\nWhich usually is tastes sweet got these sugars in there you next go to the boiling component what does boiling do\nWell boiling does a couple of things that sanitize it it evaporates things that you don't actually want to know jazz just few so things just things you're not actually going to need or just evaporate and also that rates water so condense is it so you have\nA stronger sugar solution got stronger war yes gotcha also what it does is as you add hops throughout the boil the heat and the temperature actually changed the hops\nInto more bettering so long as you have the hops in the boil the more better they become the last time you have more flavor you have retained because as you boil along or you're going to basically going to cook away all the flavors and aromas so you put in hops throughout the entire process to get different flavors ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Cigar Dave", "city": "Sarasota", "day": "14"}
