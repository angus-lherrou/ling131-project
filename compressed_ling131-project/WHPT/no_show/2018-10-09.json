in the news not again I don't know how I feel about this now you know Bill Cosby service three to ten years and I still have never I don't understand they should have just given a number like he's got three years\nI think it's a it's a it's an a reference to a his like his behavior in prison\nBut you never hear that with people's jails and it's always you got five years mhm they got up to for good behavior but I'm a probation but it's very I guess he could do no less than three years as Bill Cosby\nIs going to be out of prison a lot sooner than everybody thinks\nAnd I don't think anybody's going to be prepared for that a lot sooner as in like in a year with like a month in two years Bill Cosby will be all I can see that I can see that 'cause I got there I think within that through your market they say oh he was really good in prison he was a model in may he did you know he taught classes or whatever and you know jokes he told a joke traded aided at\nThe you know he did a stand up he had a class to teach stand up or something\nLike ... days long and it two years just because they were just having such a good time with him they didn't want to well they are on a release them [laughter] this is about uh his lawyers [laughter]\nHis lawyers have demand his immediate release which they could do that you get 'em out right now uh yeah they could do that\nBut this is ridiculous like how do those lawyers feel comfortable taking taking a pay on that uh what else are you going to say yes of course free my client is immediately\nOr do they have to go through a like um you know like a like another court proceeding or what is what does that close to ...\nThey want to get a hearing because of what they're saying is that there were a string of errors in the case in his defense motion argued that the trial judge Steven O'Neill\nAired in declaring Cosby a sexual violent predator who must be in prison to protect the community and lawyers call centers more punitive the necessary given the standard two to three you're guideline range for the crime though the guidelines say two to three years but they have it for three to\nTen and\nI don't know how that factors in that he's eighty one and blind and I mean yeah oh that's so that's the part that I really\nDon't care I don't care if they want to have you did it you did it have been convicted due to time mhm [noise] so ... so they eventually have to follow in the ... ... well yeah they're trying to file an appeal now it's not going out you don't think so you don't think that he has a enough power and enough enough money to ... I don't want to see a reverse it\nBut to a elders them to reconsider and open up the case and ... you know not unless there was something really it would have to be something really like for\nDid you ... ... that messed up or new evidence that wasn't available before like a high we have a video\nMhm it's grainy [laughter] like that that's the only thing I could think of yeah um it's just a\n... but you said you're you you think he's only going to do a few years for some some somehow some way I don't think that Bill Cosby is going to stay in jail for three to ten years that's that's that's as close as I can call it mhm\nI don't know how I feel about it in the end of the other than when you start to some of the uh especially he served those two years he served his time I mean according to based on this was when he was convicted on yeah yeah\nSo if he does serve a three uh two to three years he served his time I think I mean that's ... you have to you have to consider that he didn't he I don't think Bill Cosby\n... ever served his time to know you think he deserves more [noise]\nIt's a tough spot because\nSo many accusers ... but there are no convictions man\nOh man I'm we're going to take it out to China trying to ... and actually it's a at\nChina as a charter school a student in China was ordered to smash your own phone with a hammer after she was caught using it in class or students that\nChina has been ordered destroy our phone with a hammer um after a a teacher car her I'm a Texan on her phone\nI guess I got a strict ... they don't play around with no they don't play with a hammer and they make you do it yourself\nYeah they yeah they they they made or breaking a another instructor\nActually filmed the whole the whole incident with a camera with the camera yeah [laughter] it's like that would make them all\nYeah so I'm Wondering together China [laughter] one of her classmates us that told the new site that were not allowed to bring phones in our school classmate was caught using her phone and she had to smash it because uh they're they're not allowed in China to have\nA uh to to have a cell phone in class [noise] yeah\nSo I don't play no they don't play it also um there's a video of it\nOf her smashing the phone\nAnd I say we pay cash for videos yeah I'm trying to sell videos on the side I think that's that's how they make money\nOkay but this\nIs I I like that they make you break your own ...

[laughter] this is not real you know just Israel because here for the drug and alcohol fueled orgies after you pay ten thousand dollars and unlimited [laughter] unlimited sex you recording\n[laughter]\nI trade [laughter] rent for a buck off I think as a kid that's what he drank instead of breast milk you had ... shots of blocking fights bear [laughter] he actually did there's [laughter] do they only show than to fighting about to be like you know can we rescheduled here right hand\n[laughter] but here's the crazy thing so they have the fight gun McGregor taps out mhm\nAnd I don't know what's going on after McGregor type stuff he taps out\nAnd then the dude wouldn't let him go that was the ... he was talking trash to India then he let him go and spend at it\nThe thing are so the thing is though Conor McGregor was talking a lot of crap before the fight and that's what kind of McGregor die no that's the thing and I know could be it would not let it go 'cause I Know can be with training his whole life was training for this advantage actually justify him because he knew like ... 'cause ... knew that he can beat them because\n... not much of a wrestler so that's the he no doubt that was as we can count on the ground he's losing he's ... come to you because he did at one time we just watched it yeah it's kind of can't get you like ... ... the law only to fight the better chance you got against ... exactly right um so yeah the other than like you said when the economy has happened now he wouldn't let them go\nBut that's ... that was dirty that was dirty that was real dirt yeah and then he jumped out of ... he jumped out of an octagon mhm no security now mainly he thought he started a free for all\nBecause why what happened was I think one of the fighters on a counter McGregor side um was talking crap to ah they were talking about his religion has a devout Muslim yeah and then that's him coming out\nYeah he came out and then he has people jumped in the ... the guy that started hitting his got hit McGregor like sucker punch the hit him in the back of the head and I'm like that's\nWhat you owe\nMore than just want to fight kinda McGregor like he wasn't done fighting he's trying to kill him like he wanted to fight him some more do you want to hear almost won daily when he couldn't find them anymore they don't want to hear [laughter] that's how you that's how you can see our video and then he got out of the ... he got back in a ring\nAnd all of a sudden he's like where's my bills next the next day he goes on Instagram taught and Conor McGregor and then kind of McGregor gets on Instagram [laughter]\nWearing a really nice outfit rocket to shine or right over left or right under left a ... with a nice bottle of looking at what a nice bottle of a home I got a nice bottle of whiskey or a nice drink a west you there [laughter] after he got\nBeat in any and then this is what he tweets\nWe lost the match but we won the battle the war goes on we reached a new level here and what does that he didn't he lost and he's still running how's he doing it because he looks he's not accepting defeat look at it doesn't look like you\nKnow he doesn't look like he lost me he's still off the fight I don't think he thought he it's on video he had no but I don't think he like in his mind over matter he thinks yo yo got to witness my greatness [laughter] showing greater I'm so glad to lose now and still\nWin because you see as a problem or what is their problem they have one star yeah\nMcGregor he lost he still the biggest star even due to beat him last night he can be it's not a star like giving you what kind of McGregor\nMcConnell calmer Gregor is giving you a show oh yeah yeah he's giving you the whole package yes easily may well they gave you a show too but I don't think Conor McGregor is going to be able to give you as many victories if he gives you shows\nYes that's true 'cause he can't he can't keep that or I mean you've got beat Saturday Night yeah he got ya um even outside of that he had a a lawsuit pending against them because you know part of the show that he through like a chair at a at a bus and heard a couple of people I guess that's what happened when you throw you get the beats on you when you throw a chair in Brooklyn\n[laughter] and see how you put it was not so much [laughter] yeah and that's\nCrazy yeah everything that happened um I've never seen anything like that post a you know put like after a fight like you know a a fighter jumping out of the rain and you\nAnd they seem ushered them to the to the out of the rain back to the people was spent and throwing up yeah shoes yeah people yeah I lose issue now I live in a row exactly yeah home got an arena was like where's my belt\nBecause they're they're using to give it to them because of a a cause of his antics jumping out of the rings I he deserves that two separate transactions\nYeah buying them it's not gonna be given a bell he wanted to build but that's what they're saying that they're they're probably going to ... for that whole thing they're probably going to qualify them for the whole fight yeah from the whole fight because of that yeah yeah well that's what they do wind is talking about and what about the new stories and I was reading earlier today you'll see it's crazy to me because it's just something Dana White invented\n[laughter] like there's no governing it's whatever he wants to do in any other sport if your biggest athlete did what kind of did in Brooklyn throwing that guard rail or whatever he threw me out of here but you can't get rid of Saddam McGregor [laughter] and not you can have like ... ... do doesn't even speak English right so he's not going to be\nHe's not going to be a good star so to speak ... you gotta have\nPersonality it'd be a start America yeah that's true I mean they have a couple of other stars there like Brazilian and now they're out there now yeah that's not really give me a cyborg I Know huh [laughter] [laughter] that's true actually watching the women fight more giving it up I don't know man ah watching women find that kind of almost too brutal to me did you see the dude um\n[noise] did you see the fight before the kind of McGregor fight the black do to get a has a lot to do with the ... the toll I Do with the red hair\nThat ground impound bro ... if I get down to the pound I'm Out yeah don't not only the pounding mhm that Palin is crazy and they took his pants off [laughter]\nAnd I get a job or others like why did you take a pay us off he's like my balls hot [laughter] it's like the first [laughter] yeah I'm here to do is the ... before that we're both bleeding and they were like there is there anything on each other like loving the blood and I hear your\nThat did that that sport is really sad because you saw that like they had they had to stop them escalated leading so bad blood orgy\nYeah they're really [laughter] if they're all like that I'm here for yeah why is it taking kinda McGregor get me in the U.S the UCF I have some other names but man gave me that yeah the other thing I Want to ask you is\nThe way in this just slipped everybody's raped radar wait wait in total Gregory is weighing in and they have a little little fish because look pushing but did you go watch the way in again mhm Drake is their Drake is standing behind Conor McGregor with an Irish flag around his\nWell now what what is wrong with this age of shows up out of nowhere [laughter] drank like yeah witness Drake is the biggest co signer in the world he jumps on everything [laughter] that I don't know I I I thought the fight was great let's talk to Joe wants to talk about the fight judge you see the fight\nWas like oh\nHere's the thing like he was ... years old and then the ... is like you can lay wrestling and everything is good for him but the job of the kids the way he did and started going after leakers like like a lawn\nProfessional if that was insane but when it comes out to\nLet me ask you a question how professional do you expect guys in this sport to be like this is the zoo like if you expect better way we're\nKind of profession right back to a certain cutter see I expect hey look you guys are getting paid you got to go to those\nOf you know I don't think I mean you can't you can't cut back on and off you know why because they do just looked at me finding now we don't get a credit right here I'm a\nFirst of all is over happening you know what I'm Talking to\nWell yeah well I mean it's what it was expected I mean you got guys they're savages you did you see drinking a background in here why why does the everywhere UFC is the circus do it really is yeah\nIt's yeah these are like human animals you know like these are just bitches like they need to be professional professional that like they fight for a living like they beat each other up for a living drink walking off the stage with daylight\nHe's not even not even Irish heritage I that's why I drink is the go right against show up everywhere and it looks okay\nYeah yeah I mean you know they used to say he's being the Toronto Raptors in a locker room before the game just walking around oh yeah yeah I mean but he only in and out young enough that he has like the ... the city though like he's that that the city essentially he puts on the map ... elements Carter he did he did a whole but also\nHe also like during the courtside during the basketball game\nHe will get on the court and like yell at the ... like ... the court like a little bit too far oh really yeah I heard you used to take the red shirt and then actually rep the games are probably ... yeah you probably can it's ... not not anywhere else though and drink probably put money on these games\nAnd then all the players coming down and be like yo banging your woman\n[laughter] and if you you don't know if you're not yeah that's true yeah it probably I wouldn't be surprised strike front a such a nice do you he would tell you to the bank your woman it income says you a hug and it's

movie falling ... where he's walking and he's rapping him and I was walking around these rap and when he was actually somebody they start rapid oh wow I kind of turn into him and then um and you can see like it'll be a little girl and she kind of like eminent as you look like then I'm kind of like her is all demented\nUh I think what's with minimal was trying to do that's that's what Ben I'm does

them in them\n[laughter] I don't know about this of sucks they've them and have them in those ... ... and then like he's rapping but it's been a don't wrap but if you get touched by this they used to

Graham yeah we we don't even\nUse me oh what I Do want to talk to you and what I Would love to get some calls on our and and I've had a few uh women talk to me about this women who have sons who are scared that or you know in their some of them are pretty young like eight nine years old\nBut you know within a few years they'll be having their first interactions with girls and\nThey're really concerned about this you know how is my son it's supposed to interact with girls what if he you know it touches a like a like poke someone bought or something like that or does something that an immature maybe Thirteen or fourteen year old kid would do\nIs just going to bite him in his asked when he's older or are you scared what are you teaching your son's these days like obviously you're teaching them not to a salt dome rape I mean I feel like that's a pretty I don't even say people are teaching their son that you know if you're a a good person and you're teaching your kid to like not hit people obviously you know they're not going to rape anybody\nBut what are you teaching your kids in terms of\nHow to approach ladies like I Would love to hear from from dads and moms like that I have kids maybe in the Thirteen to sixteen year old range or what kind of discussions are you having with your kids are you telling them things that you know you wouldn't have told them a few years ago what would be the case\nYou got to be careful and it's funny I actually had personal experience with this the other day you're always supposed to ask right that's one of the things that uh is on the table to you have to get consent before you do anything I Am afraid [laughter] so I asked a lady you know within the past few months if it was okay if I kissed her\nAnd we ended up you know doing the day and doing all deal but she came back to me and goes in and like when you when you asked\nYeah and I go I Know it's insane but I feel like I Can't I Need to because I don't want to do anything inappropriate really understand I totally understand she said I completely understand I get it but just so you know it's not a tournament\nOf course and I would say the same thing if like can I can see because then you put pressure on the lady who is like a yes and then there's that awkward moment do I go in or what if she says no you kinda have to feel it out but here's the thing if you get wrong signals or you're reading the signals wrong\nYou go in for a kiss your rejected does that mean that that sexual assault now because she didn't want it scary and I feel like a lot of again a lot of moms have been talking to me about this the ones that have sons or like what if Mike with my son decided to go in for a kiss and\nGirl turns away and then she goes you know what I was sexually assaulted trouble and yeah I was made uncomfortable so it's it's kind of scary but then if they ask like well did\nThen the girls don't you know what I really don't like that it's not very high and it's not known when yeah for you just have to go in for the kids in hope she helps you liked it so are\nThere is also this um you know they say we need to teach boys not to rate right that's that's the thing that really people really believe and I'm like yeah that seems reasonable like but\nWe also need to teach girls that it's okay to say no to because a lot of it is they're afraid or you know whatever but we need to teach girls who say if you're not comfortable with something that say no absolutely there's a difference when you're doing some ... or something with a lady and she will know and then when she goes no\nYeah there's ... those are two different things I'm\nSorry they're you know and I think that's part of it too yeah\nAbsolutely yeah you gotta be gotta be careful and then you can especially with a lot of girls and I'm not saying that this is always the case but I've heard a few cases like this where girls don't say no they do the deed or they do something that they regret now they have regretted or regrettable sex they're not happy with themselves and then they say you know what I was raped yeah that\nHappened if someone is not that I Know but you know someone of I I don't want to see a friend of a friend 'cause they're not you know\nA friend but uh you know told people publicly that she was raped when in reality she just had sex with a guy and she lost her virginity and she regretted it so she said you know what I'm going to turn this into a a victim's story because it's it's the last shameful than the truth\nYeah and that's crazy you know one but that's also taught now at some universities where they're saying if you regret it\nThe next day that was right now as I said this last week but if I were to put the sexes I regret it in my life\nAs rape and I've been raped fifty aspirin I mean that that's just that's just the case I mean you're not thrilled about it but it's just so in your oats you know you make some mistakes right you'd do some stuff that you probably shouldn't do but it's not\nYou know force just you're you're dumb\nRight right and it was funny I was listening to Rogan obviously and he was talking about how if two people are drunk and the girl like wakes up doesn't know what happened in is unhappy about\nWhat happened then you know she was raped or it was sexual assault but if that happens to the guy then nobody cares right everyone's like okay well you shouldn't have gotten drunk\nUm but now they're talking about this like a case where is it possible that two people could sexually assaulted each other at the same time or it's like you're both drunk you both didn't really consent and then you wake up maybe both regretted what happened you sexually assaulted each other yeah is it just kind of like you know one for one and it just kind of deletes itself I'm not too sure but we are going to take a break I\nAm using and on the other end of this break some big news that I'd like to share with you

I Do like it although it makes me feel old sometimes because I have this little reason other than they are now TMZ stands for thirty mile zone right\nCorrect yeah okay uh if you know ah thirty mile zone if you watch the show you see\nIs Harvey eleven there's a black dude with the Braves there is a bunch of girls\nThere is a funny by do those words a T shirts\nThere is a little nerdy white guy a there's the Australian guy it was a bunch of different characters on show\nMike Walters used to be one of the guys who was constantly breaking news on that show he was a news editor for TMZ he has since left I'm not a hundred percent sure why we'll find out he's got a brand new service now called the blast which has got huge financial backing out of France from what I understand\nAnd really think about it what else do there besides TMZ you know it used to be all in choir and then uh once things went online and they went all TMZ well now you got the blast but it's a welcome to show for the first time\nFrom the blast Mike Walters Mike how you doing I'm ... I'm good how are you guys doing hey what did you do before TMZ\nBefore TMZ I went to UCSB in Santa Barbara and I was really bombed at in in college but such as\nLike how did you know I I Will kind of connection did you have like how did you know that you can get that info or is it a job in anybody at that time to do\nA good question to answer is a um my best friend from home who actually works for me now here at the blast dot com\nChad his brother worked at Access Hollywood\nAnd when we graduated college he basically said hey you know my brother both you guys are just you know ... wife is a space so you want a job you know in the industry I can get you your foot in the door and Hollywood I'll bring you up here and that's where it started I just the second answer is that my entire family besides me are cops\nAnd so I feel like it's a little bit in my bloodstream because investigating celebrity news as much as it sounds weird to say that\nIt's similar to investigate in you know just gathering information finding out what happened\nYeah people it's kind of similar I did that feel like maybe it's in my blood a little bit yeah I guess I'm a I'm a\nFormer you know I ... my own show for years now but I started out as a producer and I love doing that began and find that out some information and getting hot tip some work on that\nAh when we when they went on TV and we got to see what all you guys look like and when I I'm a married guy I'm completely straight but I Do remember falling in love with that gorgeous blonde guy that used to be on the show\n[laughter] Macs do I love I Love max and by the way I Would similarly in love with them like\nYou were one of the you know what a beautiful lady he was\n[laughter] well no cars so okay here's the greatest thing in ... and that's it I'm a fan of your show\nAnd and I I'm not sure we've ever done work together but I Will say that so I'm I'm a two hundred and Ninety pound straight married guy right and on the show and changing like a TV I wore the same black T shirt every single day for two reasons people go oh is that just you're like you're just breaking uniform at say no it doesn't show sweat\nAgain we've talked about it I'm doing it on my own is because I can make the decision right ... stop if it goes up on the blast dot com\nYou know I looked at it and I know what it says that I Believe are based on the people I Know that this is true um and I just think that that's something that ... was it done in the celebrity news gossip world\nUh up until that point and I think that the national fire and some of those magazines actually had stories and that that was one hundred percent true it's just that mixed in with the fact that aliens landed\nOn earth and you know ... you know ... states or whatever like you you can start to figure out that maybe you don't know if they're if they're true or not at the\nTime when I started doing this for a living we treat entertainment news like CNN treats and you know global politics\nWhile we love it and makes it makes the world goes on and made the ... billionaires and now we keep checking in the blast dot com that's Mike Wildwood new spot and you got the hotline that there's anything we need to get a heads up on a feel for the call\nYou to be honest I and and right back at you guys you guys have a good show and I'll tell you that anytime I'm this happens a lot I'm sure you get word on something and you've got to your calls and your previous jumped\nOff just give me a call I'll jump on a\nStraight answer you'll get you get the vote first and you'll get the accurate stuff out of the blasts are\nNot very good talk then good luck with the blast dot com\nBubble you got to\nSay about a a Michael Signer guy yeah a failure in college I on his own business\nYeah right and it's interesting because like you said\nYou could really do any kind of investigating if you're doing that you're doing celebrities stop whatever but you can also go and be investigating\nBigger things are different things not necessary celebrities we want to find out uh you know something happened or there was only out her or whatever you you know you're just asking people questions and finding the right people uh yeah it it it to me it'd\nBe kind of a fun hobby to have I don't know very few people make a ton of money like I but I Wonder how much does TMZ guys even the guys on TV are actually making you know what I mean right maybe now Mike as he was amused Basque achieve you know what I mean but if you see Harvey love and becoming a millionaire and you're like yeah I can do this\nAnd go to your own thing so yeah cause I Wonder like say\nYou were in that bar and you saw polls Malone and you saw Jimmy Fallon together\nAnd you had video and you're like yeah I have many of these guys totally drunken say Indonesia what do they pay for that yeah I Wonder if he wants to picture means you're jak just hanging out and I was ... was big news or maintenance I'm All right well good for him he clearly did not want to talk about the whole program [laughter] yeah oh yeah ... everybody\nSo that day he was on the air\nAnd I remember watching it and he and his
