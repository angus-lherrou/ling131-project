I was shocked because he is a super liberal guy\nNow is it what did he do black face or black body 'cause I feel like if you do the whole body and somehow not as bad\nOr maybe I'm wrong he blended in at least we're the shirt was down in ... and I think it's kind of did the whole thing with the ... I was shocked that I went oh my God dude like you're the last person I thought that would do this right what do you talk he had no idea and it was like ...\nThat's pretty offensive you know to a lot of people are just really\nHad no idea yeah and then one when the ... girl and she's a teacher now oh no and it looked really good but yeah you gotta look ... so not worth it was like oh my God what did these photos pop up you know and people see these things they could get like known things you do ... years ago can just pop back up you can get a lot of trouble\nYeah absolutely some of them are are hilarious but my favorite one that I saw it and it was two years ago when this was trendy\nIt was a sexy ... costume and it's like a girl dressed as like a fluffy gorilla I don't know how they did it and then she had like a baby like hanging upside down and I thought that was\nPretty cool but yeah I Want to hear you're\nCrazy costume ideas that don't call it if it's stupid oh don't tell me you're going to be a bumble bee or something but if you got a good one I saw Cosby one a couple of years ago that was really funny or like it was it was a Cosby face you know and then it was like it looks like a girl that was a life lived with like a drink in our hands\nSo that was pretty creative so I appreciate it\nThat you can get away with that this year at all no that was about it on the radio or you know there's probably about three years ago but you can't do it now\nNo definitely not one of my favorite my buddy did a\nA hall with Joaquin Phoenix on Letterman uh-huh did you ever see that have done a no oh he just dress like Joaquin Phoenix all that was one McCain Phoenix did that weird movie I'm Still here we're still here or something where you that's what I Want to cash\nOn no no it was like documentaries trying to be a rapper but he just got into heated method acting so he was just like this character that was him\nBut he had this thing where you're just going crazy and was becoming a white rapper and all this evidence was like the ...\nUh I guess kind of but he was acting but everybody thought he was\nReally trying to do this trying to become a white rapper and he went on Letterman\nAnd like a ... thing or where he gets into character and he doesn't break the character and yeah they do they're yeah let's call it but\nThey had to do harm or anything like that so Seventy seven five seven nine one or two five only hear about your really offensive harming costumes what did you pull off\nMaybe something he pulled off I don't know ten years ago but they couldn't pull off now on golden years man I was to use as a few years where are you or I can totally see that\nYeah that was fun I like her to turn the water and why so many nights at Halloween parties\nWe also got the punch out coming out in like two and a half weeks I'm so excited about 'em I mean I think I got over down there there's no way I Want to find parking is going to be first friday a door is open at five PM I think and we were talking about during Johnny B show the production that they're putting on they're going to be filming all these like a\nA free fights sort of I'm kind of like what they do what you have the you know they have like the law and what would you call like an editor or something like that a little video of like you shadow boxing or something like that but in ... promo video there you go higher videos whatever and you're going to see all the stats\nSo like the weight hide an arms ban uh you know a pain in his life whatever people are interested as\nWe got a lot of that we got the ten K. coming up\nPast and then also we have a I got an email and I'm sure you did too for the holiday party that I got the I saved the day yeah so although I Do not like the holiday season and I can't really explain why I don't like it but I just really don't I think I really like summer and\nWarmth and and things like that spring new beginnings and I don't know especially since I Lived in Detroit anything that has to do with like winter or our holiday winter Christmas anything like that just are right it just starts to depress me already I don't like it\nI feel like people are less active during those times and stuff going on I Know I Know I mean but again maybe just a weird association like growing up people would just be like I\nCan't go out and staying home and be all ... with my boyfriend I'm going to be staying home not to be going out\nSo it always kind of just like a quiet and lonely season but um yeah\nI'm maybe this year will be will be different I don't know I live in Florida is not so bad 'cause they're not freezing nothing like that but I Do love although I'm not a huge fan of the holiday season I Am a big fan of the holiday parties and oh yeah those are fine cracked out where your your fancy sweater and you have a God damn great time\nI really enjoy the holiday well so it's a love hate okay the Christmas season I like I grew up hating it well I grew up loving it and then you get to a point in your teenagers were your little ... and early twenties or you\nKind of just resent it a little bit especially 'cause I'm a product of divorce right to go to to house right right well they split family is just wasn't and now that I'm kind of on my own building my own home kind of you know life I guess you can call it or whatever so I kind of like the\nTogetherness of the holidays so you kind of hang out with friends that I like to put a little decorations go walk and see the tree but I'm also\nWho are depressed during that time because I have an auto loan but I I like the concept of it but I'm also super sat I got to make any\nSense hundred percent and you feel like you ... you have the potential to enjoy it and have a if your circumstances were different\nWhen you get together with friends or I don't know that there's just the lights everywhere like that all the lights are out people decorate\nTheir whole right it's very homey it's very cozy season uh your own stay\nWell who's this\nYeah it does happen I mean I don't understand I mean I never get offended when people say that there is God and people tell me stuff all the time and most of the time I'm just polite and I don't I don't say otherwise but I hear people tell me all the time you know if I'm going through a problem or something or something's not working out or life is just happening\nAnd they go you know on everything happens for a reason and I go no but I said I go I don't have to let it go okay yeah it it just polite but at that could very well like religious or spiritual belief right that everything happens\nFor a reason I don't believe everything happens for a reason I think that would uh I got it on land for me I don't know but it is something\nYou know and especially when it comes to ... to stuff that's really like minute doesn't matter like I Know I at your job is important to you and my job is important to me and stuff like that or or I don't know little things working out when it\nComes to just mundane life but it's like should we really be praying for things like that I feel like shouldn't we be\nPutting all our prayers if we're going to be praying at all and uh I don't know saving people who live in Aleppo and the kids with aids and kids with cancer and yeah ... are are dying\nAnd have no family and stuff like that sure versus just you praying for like oh I really hope that you know I get this bicycle for my birthday or I really hope that you know God gives me open the door so I can get I don't know free lunch of chick fillet I don't know stuff like\nThat about ...

lawyer now I can answer most of your questions but we'll let them handle it since she's a the one I actually carry law school yeah\nThat's why I'm pretty sure that before like um like medical TV took over you know what I mean like before Dr\n... and Dr phil and I was my wife watch this one channel is just a surgery channel over and over and over again and I'm positive that she could assist on a breast augmentation surgery she watched so many\nOf them because that would be the only one that really show yeah and she could walk you through the process of she'd be like now they started they do the incision clean and then what if George bleeding and pick destruction that they're going to the U.S all er yeah I knew I guarantee you I don't know if she could do it\nBy herself but she could certainly system of surgery if she was there just from watching the show now also I watch those shows back in the day when they were on like not public access but they were on like the the public channels like the government funded channels right and I watched one man I watch it for like Fifteen minutes could figure out what they were operating\nHeart couldn't see what part of was I'm like\nI don't understand because they think that your brain but then there is that a beer and why is their hair down there oh and then I realized what they were doing was they so they the person I had a a major bone deformity in the face ... so they were reconstructing the cheekbones\nAnd in order to reach it they made a huge uh incision that went over the top of the scalp\nAnd then to hold the fate uh as if it was a match ... under the nose I think what you mentioned said was he pulled his face off [laughter] they just put it down they bend to half they pulled it down they reconstructed the face put it all back together and then\nPulled the phase back up over the head ... because there was a little bit off for a a little bit of makes it a little ...\nAnd they put it back when they reach such it up and the guy who will face oh amazing crazy\nAmazing you've not you've not experienced um you know pain through others until you've watched them break somebody's ...\nEither tell you I like to watch those surgeries while I mean like ... or something yeah that I knew it as they're chipping away the bone out to eat some white tic tac\nToe yet I just got re help they often will show open heart surgeries I Do I think that's where they take somebody's heart out and then they hook 'em up to the machine and the heart still kind of beat him\nAnd they're like oh my God\nI I stay in\nTouch with people from my high school to your face but we're all like a pretty high group even though we're not all best friends we all just keep in touch with each other and there's a girl that lives in South Florida whose son goes to the U.S up\nHer husband just had a a heart replacement and I really thought were going to get ready to to go to a funeral you know because she lives here I might as well they've already bona another person\nWell I remember I had a Spanish thrown in jail one time and remember that when you you had a it was a traffic ticket but I had to bail just block you into the custody hold very uncomfortable just to give you the cats when you were young and I want to give you an example of our you know I don't know ... and but yeah\nOr I sort of ... and and but I I don't know did you it 'cause you had asked me but did you want me to do any type of judging this year for the punch out we don't know what's going on November don't ya ya I'm more likely\nMost likely I'm trying to coordinate my calendar and I don't want to you know it was a lot of different events coming up I don't want to not be there if you needed me for some reason\nYou have no idea I mean we don't have a free day\nFrom a Thursday the Sunday after this weekend until February it's unbelievable how many things come up my complaining about it I'd much rather be busy but yeah we'll we'll figure that all okay I just wanted to get past we got to go through when we go of anti at events and we I understand we're all coming up and one side's on there were all\nPunch out I hurt Debbie Victor Cheryl I assume that is that's supposed to be Cheryl criminal mind for yeah\nDo shower out uh Jason all please hold on a Dominic very yellowish here in fact let's take one called on before we go to break a loner let's let's talk to a Jason animal free up some phone lines what's what are you got Jason you're on with that Saddam\nHow're you doing guys with somebody a\nDumb had a question uh my wife uh she works with a bowl and uh last week on supposedly on a Wednesday Abbas said short text message was a nurse by text message\nA bigger ever got it and then now yesterday\nAll you got fired you're never going to discipline that she just had her ... away or wait yeah she gave me a raise and then now because she's supposed to be addressed by the tax base who's the boss called it a band the ...\nAnd she was terminated\nCheese it's not work phone it's a personal phone right here never contacted any other way where like tempted to conduct and the other way uh about ever tried to call her I forgot respond to it does make the respect or email or anything well how\nHow do they usually communicate which works at home it's usually tax to a personal phone or is there some other means of communication that as a normal course of her business\nUh was using email or sometimes does text or ... how to give me a call or whatever you know it but it like I said it's not a worked all they don't pay for the fall they don't care for the service of the old you know\nHow long did it go unanswered how long did the Texaco announced\nSupposedly the boxer as whites day and then in a wet and then\nYeah they're ten o'clock the Marta ... never stomach that message ...\nWell I don't think that is is correct in the sense that it's abandonment in the sense that she's a band that her job that however however you I I don't see any legalities and her being fired I mean that you're she's calling it something I don't think it is\nHowever she still has the ability to terminate her uh if if they chose a you know and I mean there is no discrimination there there there's nothing that is deemed inappropriate other than she's just labeling it's something that I don't think it's classify that\nUh but I don't think that there is a legal recourse under labor employment water go after the boss because you were terminated that might be a dumb reason\nYeah I mean I I've been fired before yo for dumb reasons you know and and your things that are outside of my control unfortunately if you didn't get the tax\nIt's outside of her control yeah that's a conversation she's having her former employer maybe they re hire her back then he looked I even to get the message of support signal I'm sure if I got it I Would have responded or maybe she should be a little more diligent return call it well if she didn't get the signal man I don't believe that you know I mean\nShe was in her mother was having a short period of time okay that that was supposedly say she was at the hospital so is that hospitals singles or not that reliable\nWell there you go there there's a great reason but that doesn't mean that that's over robots Dexter respond then why did you call or email or whatever\nWell you got to stay on the other herbalist her boss doesn't have to give you an answer for right\nAnd also if if you're an I look I'm not talking about specifically about your wife mostly talking about Spanish here if you haven't heard from a usually go outside every once in a while when I was going to have let me just make sure that personally important calls\nThe Irish when idol return my calls I ... a so sorry sorry about your wives or beer and specially in this state you got no record\nI mean there's I mean there is no legal I mean she can call and explain what happened yeah maybe get back and good graces maybe look boss is getting bad moods maybe they do things that the next day they regret I have a conversation and I've seen where people come back yeah you know and that's what I Would recommend if not you're going to\nYou know she can get unemployment for a short period of time where she'd go out back in the workforce\nSo good luck to you sir I alright look I got one phone line

you know I was concerned that the guy's gonna turn around after the fact that say it wasn't his fault but guess what he did exactly\nA ... ... was it was all this data but the top\nBecause I spoke to him on the phone my daughter was the one that was an accident I was just almost all of a sudden Norman note in the police report itself like day instead of a ... ... ...\nHe said I'm not that the guy he was said it was his fault it was like I could that works for sure\nWell long story short he used to work it out he doesn't want to get insurance and I knew he was ... ... but when I called it of course he denies that was ...\nUm soon as he did that I called his company to try to go to claim it well now they said because it's a lot of police report is no spoilers they're not the only thing so I Know I just I got to go to small claims court though\nRight um my question is I think I'm going to win I don't see why not always got to ask about everything else\nCan we go after the killing of damages for him cause among those headaches\nAlliance that shows ... a little bit not as old even though he did say\nOh well I don't know if you're going to go for punitive damages because he's lying I mean he might have a well founded believed that it wasn't his fault so we we can't assume that he's aligned or the insurance company with the accent in a parking lot was on a road where was\nIt was it was it was a seminal and basically just to make it real quick\nEverybody was stopped at a red light my daughter was stopped at a red light she was making a left she look only could make the left with a light but the green light\nMaking the arrow turns a nurse so she can make a left when he was shot to wait for the actual our soldiers going so she was in the right away he was ... the opposite direction they write it was on the trail\nPony even to get over to the left\nTurn to why that is what he did\nWell no he didn't tell you why they were good what happened was he doing that because the way it is an old political waves below to clear equally hard to get exposed to it all the way all the\nWhile well let's not let a gate the case now on right now I'm not designed to you insert okay a ... let me\nLet me answer your questions right yes you can go to small claims court\nUm ... the law enforcement should ever written report because it happened on a roadway at an intersection that to me was laziness\nA humbling I Love law enforcement but sometimes they they just don't want to write reports when they could have they usually don't write reports\nTo defend officers now when it's in a private property private residence or like a parking lot but usually on the roadway I'm surprised there isn't I Want you to look at the report though if they know to the other individual driving the truck and trailer as vehicle one\nAnd your daughter is vehicle to vehicle one predominantly as the at fault party it may not say at fault\nHowever you go on is usually do notice the ads that fault and then what you can do to further answer your question is when you go to small claims court you subpoena the police officer 'cause technically even if there is a report in this case there isn't but if it was a report is here say that a court document\nSo you need to have the officer there anyway and then he can testify to what this individual the other driver said to him and then you could ask why the hell do you put in a report and why do you make a report and all that for the court so those are the answers your question as you move forward with the small claims action which by the way is or is it about less than five thousand dollars\nYeah yeah and I both both of those like the caller lady out\nYour well in your Whelan small claims look at what the report the vehicle one versus vehicle to and some of the officers and go\nAhead you're on the ... five one five five five zero or ask Saddam that was a good call those requests yeah ah let's go to I like it when it gets to see them Jennifer in Rio Jennifer your own as about ...\n[noise] Hi how are you my son got served a domestic violence restraining order he went to court because he didn't do anything and they just left it because she didn't show up\nA week later he gets another one and he goes to court and he didn't get a Chinese 'cause everything nothing on there with us or able to be true proven that girl shows up\nAnd the judge tells lifestyle I pretty much made my decision what is it safe or stuff like that now that it's true I haven't had contact with her at large twenty night and the judge says well she looks believable and eat eat granted\nThat painting or ... years for how long and well it's really weird for ... years I'm ...\nYeah what's really weird as my son was in Marion County she lives in Orlando\nAgain I even have a text from her that you know they split up blah blah blah and he hasn't had contact with her and I know for a fact 'cause he lives with me and since then he has got to the other two children but his name on the restraining order not as real name is Robert\nWhatever junior and that's not his name and all these things that they are not out of that nine eleven happened\nShe how old is he how old is\nThat it's a thirty seven\nThirty seven All right now and what county was restraining order in orange\nCounty or Marion County\nWas she found it in orange county earn that Mary is that right up to her place or\nWere you know what the problem is a man you know your problem a zero his problem but he went without a lawyer don't that\nDon't go there are some cases are always on ... the judge when she looks like you I Will live side with her I Would have gone crazy I mean all you're I as a ... well first of all I don't\nThink a judge is going to say that if the wars there uh yeah I mean quite frankly uh and I used to practice in orange county I on which judge there haven't been in orange county near but you know first of all a judge says that\nTo a a ... with a lawyer president before they hear testimony from the other side that is going to be ... I mean that's that's a ... I mean that that's that that's going to be a war that that judge can be a removed or you know we we requested new court\nA new judge or have them or it's called a motion to recuse a if a lawyer was there and heard that but of course a lot of folks don't know these these different terms the courts as fair and ... and unbalanced balance and they have to be unbiased right so they have to listen to both sides they can't just say we're now at the end\nShe looks like well at the end of a ... at the end of it once the court has heard both sides right a lot of times in an injunction hearing you're going to have two people saying the exact opposite well somebody's not be a hundred percent accurate so the court has to go based on the credibility and the veracity of the department\nSo in that particular instance a court would say listen I listen to both sides if the he said she said situation and the court has to make a decision to my going to grant an injunction or am I going to deny it and it comes down to the truth ... who is more believable not that this one looks for sounds better but based on the other I don't know what the hell of a sudden the hearing\nHowever thirty seven years old he should know better you don't go to an injunction domestic violence restraining order hearing without a lawyer for this reason now here's the answer that you need\nShe he can hire a lawyer in orange county get one in orange county and it knows the judge there and it knows the ... there was no prosecutor put the nose the process over there and have them file a motion to re here or a motion to dismiss the injunction hearing\nThat's what he needs to do with a lawyer they are if he wants to give it to your injunction removed lego\nRight I I just didn't know how the judge could cause she's saying that he either in the police\nCan I don't know what to say well listen I don't know what the facts ma'am I don't I don't know there are photos might have been introduced there might be ...
