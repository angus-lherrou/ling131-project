wine I [laughter] but but see you on the phone with me\nA check this out Kevin I Love you may have heard of ...\nBut uh I got to tell you man I have paid more than once a have a conversation with a woman I've been married for almost Thirty years and uh be able to talk to a woman who is not enough like my wife means a hell of a lot to me to ask some questions and just have a nice conversation as long as that may\nNot know what you want to talk about so much\n... said again it's\nLike what is it that you talked to these women about that you can't talk to your wife about\nWell I just talked to them by sensible things because my lady's not sensible if I start to say something she gets crazy how may I checked with this lady who who might have been the now for almost four or five years to uh to see listen I'm not crazy at my nuts why would you handle is what should I say and more than anything I get it right\nNow I'm cool with that okay not by by your sleeping with this woman and gives you advice\n[laughter] I'm a yeah yeah I make an El Al ... is now I'm\nAppreciate honesty now\nYou're still with your woman though and when and when you go home no matter\nHow good of a time you had you still got to go back to the reality that you just try to escape you got that right man if you're not let let alone at Denny's in the morning I I have and all of us thought that bubble if if you're not going to leave your woman I mean if you're going to stay with your woman thing you need to get things right with it [noise]\nWell not really man I got to be honest I think this woman is the only reason I'm Still with my woman to be honest with you I don't think I'd still\nBe married if I was with this woman because she's only want to talk to me she's the only one who understand any and it's grown up and listen to me I think I Would be the end and I got married real\nQuick and I get that she remembered this remember this a bubba when you marry your ministers you now have a new vacancy [laughter]\nAnd that's part of that I heard when I\nI've heard what he said yeah from various sources or he's getting some kind of risk fight or you know rent out a little rest these cheating on his wife I ain't got so bad but what I'm saying he has no we would be better served talking to a therapist\nThan some woman who gonna tell you whenever you got to tell you to get you back over there has to bang again to give it bubble TV [laughter]\nBut I'm I'm Still getting that cool cool in the oval if I got to tell you right now that name is more than anything because she's listening to me she's respected me and she's taking care of more than any\nYeah who flew into ... so she's doing the doing things that your wife wouldn't do it all on my dog very period means you don't have anything to what she's doing\nAbsolutely I mean you know a first incomes in the minds around Jeremy swing but there's a whole bunch of things that she can do for me that my wife would never even think about doing then why watch the ... my wife's a missionary woman I ended up\nAbove him why are you still with your wife ...\nUh she makes a lot of money man I gotta keep real money man spent most of the bill fast [laughter]\nI'm a man I Love you may have but you know above above ... you're not a good dude right now man\nI I'm Sorry I'm Sorry you feel that way but you know what my babies out of town around now making all that money gets going oh\nGoes only the mama bear so cool I tell you what I Love your show man I Love your show but I I think\nBob has got it all figured out ... going to start working on you know what I did is we commit\nCrimes against the pay they ... the\nMama Mary mama bang all let that be die\nAnd the man that was a horrible call [laughter] there's no\nReason I made it out it was a guy that he's he put it right out on the law yeah no but I figured I agree with him but I understand well you know I don't know how you can love it and don't agree [laughter]\nAnd I just think I mean there's got to say a big fan of mind maybe or something in me that reflects themself in either strains combat that's what\nYou go that's what's going to ask yourself what what you just\nAsk them how do I like him and I'm just saying man it's like oh no\nMore than likely and I I wouldn't want to be done like I Would say this more than likely and I don't want to drop real talk on Baba and ruined his time with mama bear which he's headed to but I promise you\nHis woman as has got to roam the and understands that the relationship is what the relationship is now you know how ... how can you live like that remember that song know who's making love your lady while you are making law that's going on there I'd has it as a guess\nI don't what he's doing is not a long term solution\nI I agree what I Would what my question would be is okay we understand why he's in the mayor's but if she's the breadwinner\nAnd they're not really so she's not happy either he writes he can't be happy if he's not even talking to her and my question is what is he bringing to that relationship that she remains with him we don't know if they have kids right yeah\nRight but like here but I have young kids because the only way to momma bears is in like a total separate relationship it sounds like the yeah yeah yeah\nI don't know man you gotta do what you got to do but what I'm saying is that are\nWhat I did uh we talked about it I heard that before living to laws it's it's a hard thing I Would never do it\nHe said if it wasn't for her he wouldn't be with his wife well right well what is that why are you happy that you're with your wife because of the patient paying the bills you know but he said he wouldn't be like she talks ... like you need to stay with Iraq right because that woman knows if she don't want you full time\nAnd if people 'cause that's what it is yeah oh yeah here sweetest thing I bet you as soon as you just get with that woman this she becomes all got to get away from ... well\nYeah if yeah if he leaves his wife for her she will inevitably book come what the wife wants to ...\n... it happens all the time right I'm going to tell you and this may sound weird there's not um I I haven't heard a lot of stories of people who've gone through a lot of their relationship and instead of looking for way out they found a way to pull it back together after it almost seemed impossible right I'm always impressed by that\nUm it doesn't take that much more effort to get things back on track with your woman\nAs it does to put all it's easy to put all that effort into somebody who's just going to be there for the good times and just come on over let's just have a good time right and you could talk about problems and\nStuff like that right but I Believe it or not bubbly be less than\nIf you really if you were really sincere and you try to get your relationship back I think you could make it even better than it was before if you really tried if he were sincere about it but it doesn't seem like he thinks he could ever happen he's given up on it there are relationships never irreparable irreparably\nBroken like what what what is it will remain together yeah but what why irregular broke like would be no way you can get you find out\nAfter a certain amount of years that you're just two different people you always went to different people yeah but you're you're two to ...\nThe right one is at home the other one she [laughter] I mean come on what do you mean vastly different people I think\nSometimes one person grows and the other one does it sometimes both grow into different people then the word that attracted them to each other I you know I have\nI had people stay together for fifty years everybody's grow and evolve\nTop sometimes it's kids sometimes it's not it's sometimes because they grow together sometimes you do grow together because they choose to or whatever you'd that person grows into is still something that you like sometimes you become something I\nI've been living example of become so I'll I'll give you an example I I Am divorced and I can only I'm going to tell you this because I think she feels the same way\nThe person my ex is now I Would have never married and she probably would say the same thing about me by the less salt but I Would tell them in a New Years later this though a we were together for Fifteen Years

I saw somebody on Facebook posted a picture of it before the news even had pictures coming out on it I'm somebody who I guess showed up right afterwards is is like five six o'clock in the morning or whatever\nAnd it said don't take our Franklin this just happened and I saw the picture and I was like that's a dead person 'cause that car is mangled absolutely mangled nothing left of it uh and you think wow how did that happen my first thought is how does that Rick habit\nAnd then when you see how it happened and why it happened then I don't know about your reaction but I immediately I get enraged I'm just pissed off because another idiot\nOr as calls directed should never happen um and and this time the wrong way driver died where a lot of times it's a you know the the the innocent people but there are still wasn't in critical condition that they're not all people really a step over this man it's like\nI don't understand how you get on\nA regular enter standard across town at look at look at the yeah yeah that's what I'm saying yes but how do you get on the bridge on the wrong\nWay and I I read it and it's sad that I guess he was taking he did a U turn\nIn the middle of the ... ... no not in the middle of nowhere um so we're just here how it happened\nGod he could have been going the right way slow down and then maybe you turn to go the opposite ...\nSays the reports say that the guys in his last name as McGrath completed a U turn near the center portion of the ... yeah that\nHappened and traveled southbound in and then north bound lanes for approximately two to three miles before the crash it is and is there a median I Can't remember isn't their median all the way down the center yeah ray you're on the ... the other hand artery between you know then how did he do you turn near the center portion of the branch\nI I guess there there has to be connected part and the ...\nPound I don't know the north bound lanes I'm telling you what he did was he was going the right way and maybe you turn to go the opposite way\nRight on the right on the same side of the bridge that's the only way you could have done it I see yeah he he turned in the middle of the phone ... I think he thought that he went all the way over my when I got you I guess how ... that's really odd he drunk he was well if you do it after\nThe water you know when you get onto where there is a grassy there's a grassy area on on the right side I could see where you do it you\nGet over it kinda like separate I got confused because he was drunk and then made a U turn within our own land man yeah\nIt's a shame because this is the bad thing is like a we almost got hit by a car we're coming back from home was asked to a couple of weeks ago for that gig\nWas one of those deals where it was a two lane road in the middle of the country but the car was going around the car going slower than them um and they were coming around they didn't see us coming the other way\nI had to get off the side of the road I had to go onto the grass a void being hit head on by a car and it was just driving you're very Harry Harry or anxious an overzealous just driving like in like in a whole so but at least we had the side of the road to get off\nHer Franklin there's a wall on each side so somebody's coming out you\nYou don't know when you're trapped on this bridge with rice and cutting head on with you you have to try to guess last second ... do I go left and they go right because it's a guessing game at this point because there are probably last second going to try to avoid you also so you got to say okay well I'm going to go left and hopefully they don't go to the same way and\nYou know what I'm guessing because of the bridge is pretty uh there's a lot of traffic on the bridge at that our parents had happened around just before six am definitely people traveling back and forth unreal man when I'm thinking is when he turned around he probably didn't have a lot of time to get a lot of speed\nFor someone probably coming at him like Seventy miles an hour and ... barely even moving and that's why he was demolished I don't know and the other person was critically injured but you know survive it's\nUnbelievable I Can't believe some of the other one of the other cars in flip off the side of the bridge that was not very tall at all and I've seen\nI've seen ah cases on our Franklin where people with ... side of the wall into the water last year a couple of years ago or something that had happened yeah I was underway here in a leader and I were on the way here on a friday night and saw the Saturday Night we're on the weekends but we saw a\nCar like dangling off the side of the hour Franklin like two wheels were holding it on as I was like oh my God how is that even happened it was a couple of girls teenagers on the side of the road waiting for help like how did they get off the side of the bridge though yeah it was like a look at like a single car situation but\nMan that is so so scary to me that that this is why I don't drive but it was a guy we anymore because they had the or the wrong way driver on on the skyway\nAnd I all I can think of how helpless you are when you're when you're sending and you can't see what's on the other side right and all of a sudden you see headlines coming at you and your I don't know how many hundreds of feet the skyway is up in the air like your dad you're dead you either get hit hit head on the dry lopsided to bridge you plummet to your debt by\nEither way you're gone ... it's just so scary to me to have that kind of a a helpless situation\nUh it it just it just it makes me sick or Jeff what's up buddy\n\nI worked for throwing a trade or company when you wrote but there is a great we bridge and I'm\nUp to a certain point on either side if you're going to North or south on the little service road you can get All right you go down you can you turn around underneath the bridge or you know what you get off or whatever you can actually turn around and go back in ... so that's a bill that made you what he did\nYeah that's got to be in that so it's kind of what I was thinking too I did that you see people pulling off on the side over there to go fishing and everything else so they have played out there are plenty of time to do it you turn there so a male grows man All right man will uh hopefully you don't have to uh you know get any crash cars off the bridge the night so\nI I'm an idiot every single\nDay for me to do that's a part of a taking phone calls not yours but other people think like a\nGreat show you guys keep it a ...\nFine man good see just when you think the world sex somebody like Jeff causing you allow it OK guys it's okay\nUh Seventy seven five seven nine one or two five eight hundred seven seven one one oh two five\nI mean one of the things I hate it when I'm On the interstate and the alert comes up on the sign yeah sad that we even have to have that but you'll see wrong way driver reported terrified I'm dude I see it probably once a month on the cross really yes\nYeah and I go oh what do I do and I've actually gotten off the interstate\nBecause I'm not going to stay on the interstate I got off the interstate a while the cross town I got off like Seventy eight street which is like in the hood and Clara Mel way before Brandon but I got off and just drove back streets to brand but I'd rather go out of your way to add more time you drive to stay safe you know it's just so\nNobody ever seen that oh yeah I seen like silver alerts an amber\nAlert I get those all the time to look at it it's not it's you know like Johnny maybe once a month you might see it it's not often but I've seen it a couple of times ... ... I'm On the interstate constant light so you live on the interstate I'm I'm On the road more than I Am home it feels like so but I see it all the times like oh my God\nAnd I I actually saw a silver alert\nAnd like a half hour later a wrong way driver and on my man grandpa was driving a wrong way he don't even know where is that that's even more scary you know and they're not going too fast\nActually saw a well this happened or the day job a of probably two months ago and I followed this kind of a funny idea for a bit on stage and I might have to work it okay but a a silver alert went off on everybody's phone like ten minutes after an Amber Alert\nAnd I was I managed to check that old man strong you know\nOr the kid's toy box somebody is guilty\nSeventy seven five seven I went up to five eight hundred seven seven one one oh two five it's work in\nProgress I got you know and there's something there you gotta you gotta dig oh yeah I Know that I work at it and then you got to work at\nWhy don't we don't want to live [noise] we\nWant them to voice\nYou know and previously least furnishings writes huge saving course furniture clans and arches I'm a wide variety of new and previously in these furniture and whoever you're home run off and you'll find so fed from one Ninety nine Ninety nine animal and everything in our nine thousand square foot she'll run its course started by guaranteed and in\nFact many for delivery or to take 'em to visit our handling cost furniture than center at one three nine for sixth fleet taxing memorial highway or go online at ... dot com mentioned radio twenty and get twenty percent off\nOne of the reason we invented things like same day delivery and PBS Jay in the same jar we love convenient and which is what makes Kaiser Permanente so special we offer health care coverage together rather than having your doctor over here and your insurer there we provide quality health care in coverage under one roof and\nBring you up for other important tasks like making a quick sandwich Kaiser Permanente together we thrive Katie dot org slash integrated customers and hopefully in the mail and that you can predict when when it when he starts to run them onto that way but you\nMetro PCS is now metro buy T Mobile\nNow you get new plans with unlimited high speed data a months long all under the mobile network check out the new metro but she mobile today and discovered the smarter way to get unlimited metro buy T Mobile\nDuring condition the fraction of customers even greater than thirty bucks for a month later this reduced immature customers men do just re speech versus some customers to the extremes of forty percent of their own some areas the store for details in terms of conditions\nHi Jamie progress is number one number two employees leave a message\nHey Jamie Jamie [noise] this is your daily pep talk I Know it's been rough going ever since people found out about your archipelago ...

scratch off\nAnd uh she almost cried afterwards when she found out she was really still broke and ah I I Believe I read where somebody looked at a lottery ticket that was a week old and the numbers matched up the week after a and they went into work and was double birds every body and then found out it was not\nRight you got a double triple or quadruple jak that that is accurate and now you did

oh you are situations so or work or law enforcement and I'm new to start now secure\nYou know did he was pretty harsh right or is out the list of media and most of the time to get shot down to a careless so yeah I think if it was the most severe penalty I Know people like stage but there is no excuse now we have all these technologies that are out now there's new shoes to drop drunk\nI agree I agree I was a I was with somebody or for years that had to DUIs both drop downright reckless driving and she's still drives every day I Will say this\nAfter the second one I didn't see her drink and drive ever again I guess you learned our lesson but you're right you can get out of it if you got enough money to pay a lawyer and get a drop down there shouldn't be stiffer penalties I agree\nI'm not trying to get their drinking to uh you know came of issues or I Try to start the conversation but you can sort of almost life in jail for having candidates than your drug drug to kill people and say okay surely\nSolid point Jimi solid point he's right man there's so many people in prison or we'd right now and that's the thing is in Canada they are trying to do something else that they ...\nThey were actually talking about that on the news the other day I was listening in and they were talking about it because they're gonna weed is legal there now or is it out to be\nAnd I think he I think you can have like thirty ... people in prison over wheat offenses so I think they're going to be releasing people it was thirty grams or less good and I'm thankful recall Jimmy and thanks for doing the work at ...

this thing called the undue run which was a fundraiser so basically\nYou go to the library dressed in weird close because you're going to donate them every one's trips down you're now you're skis right bra underwear whatever running shoes your hammered by the time you get there this is all this was during finals week pop a homeowner about\nThis uh no windows no probably shouldn't be so shame\nAnd I did it multiple times and I wanted to every single time and you everybody throws their clothes and a pile and then you just go around you probably honestly probably about a five K. and I was like ... like I was running my ass off because I wanted to win the on the run and then you run through the library and all these kids are studying and you're like\nBasically nude it's a good time was the ... if you want Laurie\nStewart or just knowing that yeah I did watch a little drawl yeah but I thought I was going to pass that gets bad you should not be running at full capacity when you're hammered not good for your health\nKick balls a little less intense of a there's a lot of down time maybe for you when that was not the series usually run around in the ah no not\nNow me tomorrow and I'm going to be pretty chill it'll be a good time last year was really fun I was hanging out with a with drew you're drinking Moses and stuff but I got to be I got to be safe and I got to be careful because I'm driving and I got precious cargo on my car 'cause we'll be right in together without coming over\nEight even if it were were eight let's shoot for eight so if you get there at age ... okay you have to understand you got to factor in parking and\nThe whole hullabaloo summer noodle okay yeah I Do at school or get on and get on it All right uh\nOther updates going on in our sphere in our on our daily lives\nPunch out punch up update this morning I heard it did you just heard on the top of the day actually spoke with you ... a ...\nThere's been a little rearranging in the main card uh the title fight is no longer Spanish and Danny doughnuts it is now Spanish versus our very own Mr Right Adam\n[noise] now this is a big now I Want to break the sound I Want to unpack this now I I'm definitely no expert when it comes to fighting I Am an expert when it comes to barbecue obviously [laughter] are you sure it's easy to see you once you learn to just not that hard you know\nIt's something that takes eight hours you see you look at it you pay Steve you're paying some stuff on it you walk away come back you turn it over doesn't seem too difficult to know that but anyway\nBack to a back to fighting back to boxing let's let's kind of um let's unpack well we have here we have Ryan and Spanish now we're just looking at sheer\nAt their share of their ... dimensions here\nSpanish is he said he's a hundred and forty five pounds\nHe's five five five five six someone that range\nSounds about right okay uh Ryan Adams is five nine five nine and a half maybe Mm we could be maybe say five ten of her being generous or how much would you say runways I'd say what two ten to twenty to twenty okay to twenty to ten in that region in that area um\nThat's a pretty significant weight difference right at least what sixty ... fifty five sixty in that range but then you also have to take into account that Spanish they train fighter and he's been this is now his third punch out he trained seriously think fourth\nYear right he's been in every single punch out this will be his fourth punch out uh this is\nProbably his second real fight the first two didn't really count too much um but finishes an animal he is he's really really good he's pretty fast he's very agile aisle and he is very very aggressive in their last year in ... with ... I was actually shocked like how much energy he had\nI didn't know what I don't think he was on any sort of a you know extra substances but he definitely had a crack heads amount of energy out there and he kept that energy up and maybe just in phenomenal shape I Know he trains year round so it's not like he just started trying to think that he's been doing\nYeah and that's the thing that really I thought Ryan was going to ... ... s I thought it was in bed yet and we had plans for what he was going to do afterwards and I was really starting to get excited about it uh and then when I heard this I was like ... a media was like ... and again it handed to him\nBut here it but here's the thing ... Francesca was much heavier and bigger and stronger\nYes so but the differences is that for instance we can't fight Spanish can fight spent I and I watch I talked to run a little bit here on on break before we did that last segment ... and Ryan is confident or he's talked to his coach and he thinks that they can devise a strategy to kinda\nUh get around the fact that he's been training much longer\nA size really does ... difference does it does um but like I said I don't I don't know I I don't I'm not betting against Ryan just because ... my boy\nOr you can you can be in favor of someone winning but still think that they're going to lose\nOr not I don't even want to put it up okay All right I don't want to say it's okay I'm going to just keep rolling with an R rhymes going to do his thing we're going to see what happens\nI think he's a big underdog everybody thinks that he's going to get yeah everyone does the French was going to beat them but then I think when people started watching the tapes of him training and really okay Ryan kind of you know\nMore athletic they want us Arctic than people thought yeah he's he's more a he has a more ... more athletic prowess than people thought\nAnd I wondered if that was the catalyst for changing Francesca editor was that Ryan was looking pretty good you know in the ring\nThink that that was not the catalyst for it I think that it's because this is more of an emotional fight now apparently there's some beef going on I really don't know the underpinnings of the store\nThey really are fat and they know they look fat but they feel like they need a little bump of confidence to know that there man so want the ban\nYeah yeah there's there's I guess there's been both of those occasions okay what about if you were your partner gain weight right yeah and when you were with them they were you know smell yeah\nWould you say something to save the relationship say listen I don't think I can be with you if you're at your current weight\nBy being like super honest here and and he got out of control not like you know ten even if it ... it went for like let's say fifty pounds again fifty ... in in a in a year\nA and they weren't sick or anything if it wasn't like oh I got cancer or like an injury or science got lazy oh yeah I I I Would say something you would say no you know what I Would I Would just break or you will break up a hundred percent\nAbsolutely adamant no that's really what if everything else was great everything else like everything else ... is not going to be great\nIf not going to be if I'm not sexually attracted listen the whole difference between an intimate relationships in friendship is is sexuality is is the sexual connection the intimacy you have with that person and I got plenty of friends all the time but the reason why I chose use because I'm sexually attracted you were having\nSex we're doing sexy stuff for it if I don't want to bang you you've now got me in like I don't know sex prison where I don't want to really paying you anymore because your gross looking but what about and I have no other option because I'm not an a whole not going to cheat on you\nYeah but what about if you love them you wouldn't just suck it up you know maybe figuratively and literally\nIn some occasions and just you know because I Love I Love you and I'll I'll just\nWell I don't want to I don't know I Would maybe I Would give them all of a warning signal how would you even if I don't know I don't I mean I feel like it would be even worse if you were trying to tell a girl to lose weight than if you're trying to tell the guy to lose weight and gosh what if I was trying to tell the guy to lose weight and I wanted to you know try to do something before just breaking it off\nI Would say like listen how can we get you back I tried to make it more about health you know\nSo I think the way around that would be to say why don't you come to the gym with me now that stupid what do you mean that stupid why you don't have to be that way you don't have to say hey fat so you know\nI don't even if you're ... you're implying that you're implying that but I just want I Would say listen like\nI I Want to get you back to a place 'cause obviously they're not going to be comfortable with how they're looking I doubt it you know if they've gained a bunch of weight and they looked really good before they're probably unhappy they like listen I can tell you're unhappy you know you've you've set a few things let's try to get you back on track\nBecause if you don't I'm leaving how fat piece of asked no I wouldn't do that but I I think I Would have to\nListen life's too short to be stuck in a relationship with someone you're not attracted to\nYeah forever and I know and especially if there's no a strenuous circumstances that like that they got in an accident or you know they have an injury and even many if even if you're getting an injury you don't you're not you might get a little bit looser can again fifty pounds well if you're looking at ...\nOkay let me ask you this saying if you're not physically attracted that would be it for you let's say something to happen really got an accident and their face got all this figure or a chimpanzee ... and then they had to replace their fate yeah for somebody else and just looks weird yeah we're going to look yeah\nAnd but everything else you love them before yeah you madly madly in love but yeah I can gauge yeah what would you do\nUm I think at that point that you get would be too strong and I have to suck it up for like ... yeah because that's how I feel guilty like if you're just being oh here's lazy and you could do it now that I'm not attracted to that but if something horrible happened to you and I love you stick with you if something\nHappened to me like that where I got just figured it would be if I Love that person I Would say just go I Want\nYou thought about that before is often saying yeah yeah don't stay with me this is an I'm Sorry you didn't ask for this\nOr you're on stay well 'cause this is Josh Josh ...\nOh you're a hole in the X ray [noise] Ah yes\nThere are asking why she would study eaters as we are

Seventy less Jewish their children are you studying about\nJesus Christ alright\nI told her I actually do a lot\nOf it is not good for you know she doesn't want me\nTo chase her well she might really Leonard she she fat hold on and she ... I'll be honest with me\nYou know she needed a hundred and five pounds that's only because she's from New England so he can\nReally hundred and five pregnant five now so she's ... years old she was also one okay All right wow\nSo she just likes I mean some girls are into like the big you know husky do so when she and as you just into that I guess clearly she got a little bit of a federal um\nShe didn't she likes me ... ... ... okay uh this is just trees for I I even older to city and sometimes you notice when he when he didn't study found you knew that\nOh yeah yeah yeah I I think you should continue to lose weight to a point where you feel like you're really you know well that's that's the thing if you got a baby\nCome in I mean you don't want to read you want to be alive for the baby to watch I graduated high school or whatever you don't want yeah up dead you know\nWhy you know wait a second child I I\nDon't know I Love the little girl and I wish there was the wages for some time\nYou can always do it this time yeah man keep keep at it even though you're you're a girl or is going to try to sneak use them you know candy bars and stuff don't take 'em donated I [laughter]\nI Want to let you go there are some girls they they don't want you\nAll right nice All right well you know if [laughter] All right I have a good night man All right Bye bye I I Do\nSee your phone call we're going to take that call after the break because we do really have to take a break and on the other end\nOf this break more of these types of people are having babies William and I can't decide if this is a good or bad thing find out who these people are after the break you were listening to it will\nLose interest do you\n\nWant to do the book\nBack to school time to time of year you look at\nThe parents were listening to the bone and for your kids [noise] pointing to point\nYou savings anew and previously least furnishing that writes huge savings I court furniture plants that are just from a wide variety of new and previously in these furniture and a quarter for your home run off you'll find so far from one Ninety nine Ninety nine Anwar everything in our nine thousand square foot she'll run its course certify guaranteed and inside\nReady for delivery or to take on today that are handling course furniture than center at one three nine for sixth fleet Jackson memorial highway or go online at ... dot com mentioned radio twenty and get twenty percent off\nOf the reason we invented things like same day delivery and TV and Jay in the same jar we love convenience and which is what makes Hauser Permanente so special we all for healthcare coverage together so rather than having your doctor over here and your insurer there we provide quality healthcare coverage under one roof\nBring you up for other important tasks like making a quick sandwich Kaiser Permanente\n... dot org slash integrated customers and hope when the when the trickle British when when it when he starts to run into the ...\nMetro PCS is now metro buy T Mobile\nNow you get new plans with unlimited high speed data all month long all on the the mobile network check out the new metro by the mobile today and discovered the smarter way to get unlimited metro buy T Mobile\nDuring the ... direction of customers even greater than thirty bucks for a month later this reduced immature customers men do just re speech or something that will customers video streams forty coverage out on some areas the store for details in terms of conditions\n... lounge present any\nClasses a what a great uh [noise]\nLet him know like for this next one\nToo much they're going to get things just write like or dresses name your price to tell us what you want to pay and we'll find coverage options are budget\nAnd no way for like a back on again drink and you know it's completely dark because of the insurance company in price and cabbage match limited by state law\nOptics move crazy amounts of data at even crazier speeds and fighters by rising as the one hundred percent fiber optic network with ... gigabytes connection you'll get the fastest Internet available download speeds up to nine hundred and forty ...

movie over the weekend [noise] that\n[noise] I Love the original but I also love the remake Ghostbusters know what are you\nBy the way did you see that Ghostbusters the female while a musician I watched it on to shut it off you know and I like I think Melissa McCarthy funny I think uh they Chris awake very funny I got on yeah\nCame a hidden camera Jimmy ... it was I I I didn't watch the whole thing I just went oh my God I Wonder if I saw Ghostbusters now if I Would enjoy that\nI don't know but that's a whole different thing you know what I mean like you can go and take a movie from what forty years ago three thirty some years ago and watch it now and be like oh yeah especially comedy that's hard yeah it's hard to do but you may you may like it I mean obviously the fact she'd be like okay well that's\nPretty bad but it's still a great movie a prominent\nAh one of the greatest movies you could probably have my team is Arthur with Demi Moore me\nBuilding more plays a British drunk on television\nOr but they remade that movie a movie that shouldn't have been remade because he was so good but yet I watched it anyway and Russell Brand is a fantastic Arthur I thought I enjoyed that movie and I enjoyed uh what's your faces hops and I thought it was great I thought the movie could have been a little\nBit better Russell Brandon is one of those guys that I like as an actor I think he does get a job as elders now and uh you know yes all that whether I don't think he's a funny stand up comedian I never see on the stand up I don't think he's funny I've heard him in interviews I've heard him on Howard show and I've heard him do that he\nCan be very funny he's a great he's a great a person to tell stories and stuff but uh as far as him doing stand up I don't know but him as Arthur a role that you normally would think I shouldn't be re made it shouldn't be that he did a pretty good job I was very impressed\nIt just popped up over the weekend\nAnd I you know I'm One of

dozens and dozens of studies maybe you can pull out and highlight a couple of your favorites\nFor sure so Dr Mark Miller he's a PHD a biomedical research or he explains that well he's talking here about how free radicals\nI'm from eyes and undermine function and sell you the performance in the body he says after that than it is simply superb at negating this\nAs evidenced by clinical trial showing improved performance and accelerated recovery in fact research published in the journal of medicine and science and sports and exercise found that those who took four milligrams of after that the daily over twenty eight days scored better cycling times with greater output than those who did not take it\nSo they fight factors\nMay remember this after that that is one of the few\nThat ... accidents that can actually neutralized free radicals even at the site of the mitochondrial membrane\nIf like sailor body armor protecting yourself your joints blood vessels brain heart and organs on

sports\nNutrition November two thousand and alive and this was another study done with cyclists they took four Nelly ... than than it was a small study but very positive showing that cyclists\nImproved their trial time by two minutes and twenty kilometer bike race\nI mean that's a meaningful improvement in a race like this and the researchers said that they also burn fat more efficiently which makes sense based on this research purity can actually make the claim that asked FX will promote and improve power output in your muscles\nI mean I tell people asked us effects in\nStrength and power out it it's a transformative if you like energy and this was found in other studies to like one that looked at hand grip strength\nAnd so much great information just tuning in

saw Ninety three percent boosted hamstrings that people who struggled with well a tennis elbow now that's a big deal but our listeners might be saying well okay maybe I don't play tennis or what about me what does it mean for me right\nRight so so think about this uh Ninety three percent increase in a person who has some repetitive stress in their elbow it's an almost doubling enhanced strength so just think about all the\nThings that you do in your daily life picking up groceries your kids your grandkids gripping the steering wheel of a car playing golf for tennis gardening or riding a bike a doubling of grip strength makes a big difference\nI mean when you take after that then you get stronger you feel stronger you have more energy insurance if you play sports you play stronger so to me
