do give it don't give him a lucky dreidel\nI Will\nNot true because if we had our expert we would have won that case I'm not saying that they all have to travel the lucky ... anything but like in this case we have our expert that case we didn't have an expert so that that's the result in habits are are you going to be All right I'm going to have to throw things out you at this at this trial what what's going on here where you probably [noise]\nI'll I'll miss it first chair when you got to try it has been a long wait we got back yesterday we got back\nFrom the ship I was up early Monday morning because you went to church I was trying to get everyone off the ship owning up ship he he he woke me up at five AM I said I Want it and I'll bet it's yet work what do you do have how did he get into your room I was going to be ...\n... they began to get this is getting a little bit creepy I mean it's all about it doesn't last we're getting older than you and I mean how many bedrooms\nOne day and it might ... with my ... me my pro is getting really creepy built in all three of us were laying in the same bed and then when we each of us had a pillow\n... we had an rotate until you have any on on you know I don't even want every other night I got a pillow every other night you know so I don't want to know anymore and we have what's called us and Sony sandwich\nNo I I don't understand why we left it sounds it sounds like a scene for why he's raised an automobile ... my hair and it was it was close to the\nNight is what it was real and I know I I got to get some callers back in on the phone lines eight hundred seven seven one one or two five or seven to seven five seven nine five bills a former prosecutor yes Michael you've been a defense attorney ... are very very long time you had\nCases in trials against that air stand sides right and one that stands out in particular yes I did and I have another one stands out actually\nWe uh we we went to trial we couldn't come to agreement we went to trial we picked a jury\nYou know back in ... this is years ago it was before the ... since the listeners probably don't know what that means for leflore ... well we we picked the jury in front of judge jet ski okay and I and left her took\nThe trial but back in the days before the portal now if you file anything everybody knows 'cause you know the the it goes directly to the state goes directly to the judge and say hey I mean everybody gets immediate notification so we picked a jury we came back on the day of of of of of the trial\nAnd if you had some last minute motions you just bring them with you mhm right so I so\nThat that those are kind of stayed turns office actually does something that that I've I disagreed with for for a very long time and that is when they when they file a a charging documents for enhanced breath or blood test above point one five\nThey only alleging the charging documents the point one five they don't allege the underlying crimes are the only state attorney that man corrected no they still do it\nEvery other state attorney's office in the area\nA Pinellas pass to go everybody they always charge\nThe the the underlying crime of DUI by a point zero point zero eight and they also allege because the person had above a a point one five they allege the enhancement Hillsborough County does not allege\nA zero eight so I show up to trial with a motion to dismiss claiming that the information is defect bill's case on bills case and\nWe didn't wait even though we picked a jury we didn't have\nThe right to challenge the the charging document because my client had never been rained on it\nSo I doubt cell phones with a rainy or in a Raymond is is where you are in a replay and so so when the original charging document was the citation so when we went to trial when we went to trial or they file an amended are charging document correct alleging the enhancement\nAnd so that automatically know process the original charging document you can't go back to it\nAnd so if they char if they have filed an invalid charging documents the charge can stand\nSo now we we were just leflore stepping in pretty good ... and I ... I show up by their their right you know the jury's waiting out in the hallways as are there any last minute issues like they always guys and actually there is and bill started scrambling and\nI had never even seen that charging docks and and it was it was the breakfast was above a point when eight ... it was a really really high breath tests and they absolutely refuse to to do anything\nAnd uh they they went to a supervisor and they came back they say you know we're going to resolve it and they drop the charges down a reckless and ... instead of jury home is that the\nJury ... I actually try to case against him Michael where the breath was like a point to hide my God that's right and that was a not guilty not guilty not guilty I forgot your you sat in on that talk and we had an eyebrow high talked about that trial with Dominic this morning because\nGuy calls it's brand new case and he has a really high below and I said you do field sobriety exercise and he said yes I said how did you think he did he said actually I think I did perfect and I my friend was there and said I did perfect and I said well\nWe might be able to do something even with it was a point to for blow I said we might be able to do something because then you ... you told the jury um\nThe best evidence was the video what you see when you're older how has that guy performs in the states trying to say that he's four times the legal limit there's no way no way he's our times are legal limit and they came back not guilty and I I actually had the distinction of winning the highest\nThe lowest blow and losing the high school I lost to nine and want to point oh for\nHim that crazy [laughter] yeah county I lost\nThe one you might call your your your your your lead a drunk driver go and you are convicted at heart [laughter]\n[laughter] well I I never knew that\nI lost it I ... I lost a point to nine in one but actually I ...\nMy ... my clients sounded as sober as a judge and and the story there but the client was actually he's unfortunately he's he's got addiction issues to alcohol he drinks every day but he drinks between three and five and he told he took the stand we can talk about because he took the stand he says I drink every day\nI drank a one of those a pipe bottles\nBetween three and five o'clock the last time I drank was at five o'clock this is at midnight seven hours later and he was still he was like a point to nine we brought in an expert witness who said there wasn't enough alcohol because he was over two hundred pounds not enough alcohol in the bottle\nTo even get to that result they had the bottle I mean they found the bottom of the car it was there I Am and um and\nAnd we had anomalies on the breath machine he's\nHe was begging for Brett test\nHe's in the back of the police are saying please I Hope you're taking me to a place where I can give you a protest I haven't had a drink it's seven hours\nAnd he sounded sober looked sober acted sober and uh so yeah we we had some some issues some legitimate issues about\nWhen I went back to the office all anyone heard about the case is guy blew a point to nine he took the stand and it made it to drinking a bottle of vodka which they found in his car empty\nAnd you are [laughter] I I yeah I don't think about what happened [laughter] hours earlier seven hours earlier I Would have loved to yeah yeah\nA real real quick Dave from Sarasota wants the thing I Want to thank me there you're on without Saddam go ahead\nJohn good it's good to talk to you I'm I hired you a couple of months back for a car accident and I just wanted to say ... praise\nBecause when you say you get back to people you and as far as called not say Keisha and just to get back to me and I don't know where you are you ride it out of state but um I really appreciate it I I highly recommend to anyone that\nThat needs a a a good lawyer that actually cares about you you're not just the you know a dollar signs so I just wanted to say thank you\nIs this cholera I'd pay pay paid advocate no light on it [laughter] you know we all know that but not at all\nI ...

I don't have the time I'm In I'm no longer license in federal court or we used to be like an application\nWell I I was licensed in the middle district for for quite some ... and I did two federal cases and I just you know if federal laws ... as you very different than state law\nWell not not for the cases that I Do because I Do do you watch and there's no federal DUI statue so they have to follow Florida statute but I just the the the ... dealing with the\nThe personnel in federal court is a lot different than dealing with personnel in state court only deal with the jag officers jak guy swelled ... well I mean I don't know whether you turn it off well I Do I Do represent folks they get in trouble one big deal but that's that goes to steak or I just don't have the time to actually\nThe the the state court DUIs that are from MacDill or the people who actually don't get on\nThey get stopped at the gate I've had a few clients who are on the on the base and they got pulled over by a by MacDill police on base by the military police and then the bad guys and girls Moore I you know they keep they keep those cases or if they are military but they get in trouble off base\nThan I represent them in state court because they were off base but [laughter] but I'm saying if they get caught while they're still on base then then the jak jak goes on to and they get prosecuted in federal court yeah but I don't I don't handle that comes out and that's why some or bill don't does that\nI actually liked doing a federal court or do you watch\nWell it's it's it's just a different [noise] I I don't know it's\nI used to do it as much more formal I actually prefer the formality I I don't know if I have the temperament for that anymore and and the reason is for a federal court yeah and and here's why you're there isn't that the judge\nSaid to me years ago Mr ferry yellow your your Fonz is not to point to whatever the ... supposed to be there what's the fun you know I don't know the\n... you know they got to be well on ... supposed to be a a new times Roman uh fourteen\nOkay well whatever it was they said well it's not this and I'm sitting there quietly and they said well it's not it's not this is not lined up here and I was there a while and it's not this is not that I says well your honor is that ... and he says yes it's an Englishman can your honor read it [laughter]\nI mean when you say that to a federal judge a ... there there was a time where I was you know a more honor\nAlright um [laughter] you buy me All right who's who's on line one there is that\nA A N\nAnd I can't I cannot see I don't know my eyes I gotta go get different eyes a intellectually did I say these things are federal judge what's the matter with you I Can't make a admissions on air you are right\n[laughter] I have this and he's like this that and if if they asked a dime how can I help you she's calling it a pass go just so you know I saw that I can read I cannot I gotta go get my eyes I get my glasses on that I Can't see what's going on with you might hear how can I help you\nOkay do I my question for you as I Am out on a medical disability but that being said I was told that I had to file so\nCuriosity disability which I have done that last December I did go we go to court to see a judge the judge it ruled my rule my age unfavorable\nSo now they're telling me that I had to appeal that and it only goes to one core number one is that correct and never to shut them I possibly be looking to getting\nA new lawyer being that I'm working with the aid group they're called the advocate or group and\nI'm not really sure what I Need to do at this point\nAre so ... you're on medical disability and then you filed for um I guess government disability SSI around since the ... yes yes\nAll right Mike what are you doing with the microphone dramatically fixing it out when I Am I I'm trying to talk to and it sounds sounds like your bill nominee shipped over there [laughter]\nYou know the guys my kid here because there are over there on my own business [laughter] athletic don't be don't be in the ... ... there'll be an ...\nUm the the folks that you are hired here [laughter] and and I go right back the folks do you ...\nDo you hired or is this like a pre paid legal group that they represent you if you get into some type of legal issue\nWell what happened is the medical insurance that I was receiving through work or elements medical disability told me that I had to file for those security and this was the great that they worked with\nHer and get their money back if I win the case the insurance company does believe it or not\nOr what was what was the reason if you know that you were denied from the judge what was the ruling based on\nUm it was a favorable and it was just a there was a couple of several things several things\nThat he basically took my words out of context like he would ask me a question you know what do you do during the day the U.S well yes that is do you take care of your pet well\nLet them outside do take it for a walk no I Do not you know and it it turned around that I'm at home and I'll take care of the pets I don't have any problems taking care of the pets which is not true I mean I can open a door let them outside you know I Can't take them for walks I mean\nI I Am disabled was this in federal ...\nThis was a Tampa it's only and uh so that from disability this was the first you don't ... if you go the Social Security and get the night the night the night\nAnd I do not yet right or so after\nI did I did not deny so many times they they give you a court date where you go in for another the judge and I went to camp but it wasn't the court house it was like um that's neither here nor there but I didn't do it for the record it was just the judge myself this lawyer that I had never met [laughter]\n[laughter] yeah right there it is called me up the day before a bless your heart me up the day before and it yet I'm an ... an hour long conversation\nOkay so the answer is yes you can appeal it uh I just don't know what the basis of the deal is going to be a if I have to get a better understanding as to what the judge's ruling was outside of maybe taking your statements out of context I already mentioned him earlier in the show I think last hour\nOr attorney Richard Osborne wonderful he's been on the show before going to ask Saddam dot com we'll give you his animation he can certainly talk with you about your options moving forward as far as an appeal\nOK okay thank you so\nYou're welcome and I was I was very sweet and you know and I asked Saddam dot com or any information and if I don't know if I don't get back when he can always call the office that he won three to five one five five five zero ... up to the next break\nHow much time you man yeah slip through that now\nOkay what are the ... run inside what freedom and then we'll come back and then we'll come back with um [noise]\nUh he's down and down there we go law officers and then we can ramp up with the Michael and his campaign I think that'll be nice to nice I mean right Johnny bid from students but I'm going to come in All right this was brought to my freedom bail bonds freedom in Modern Family owned company been serving the bay area for over Twenty one years of experience\nThere

org all one word is the last show one segment laughs when we were up actually\nTo\nBe on\n\n\n\n\nStreet you loan all week for updates on hurricane Michael\nReason we invented things like the same day delivery and PBS Jay in the same jar we love convenient and which is what makes highs are permanent tastes so special we offer health care coverage together rather than having your doctor over here and your insurer there we provide quality healthcare coverage under one roof\nToday you know if if I Would have posted on a on on my Facebook page hey I'm going to address for success right um who knows I was the only candidate that was there I was the only one I\nHad a captive audience of ... people and uh you know here's one here's Ronald Josh\nMy response that sure is none of this stuff is hidden I I mean all these people have everybody has campaign managers and advisers are salt and they all know that this stuff is out there so whether or not you posted or not or go to or not I don't think I don't I don't think really makes that big of a difference I don't know about it or any other candidate\nBut I think you would be neat if someone could go to a website and again I'm just as my suggestion I just thought of it\nIs is if you have a a a a calendar and people say okay well where's the Michael going to be in so I'm going to be at this lunch for him to be at this breakfast I Want to be at this meeting ought to be at this town hall or this Rotary Club or I'm going to be a disc\nOr charitable function sharp and they say you know what I didn't know about that journal function or I didn't know about that lunch and I like to go meet the Michael but I also like to see or I'm interested in where he's going what those folks do\nUh I I mean it just seems like I'm a widow across the board\nI mean that's just again I literally just thought of that\n[noise] you know I'm no I I mean it's not a bad idea but you know a lot of the functions that we go to um [noise] uh\nYou know the the their their cost of a goal and then sometimes you can get very expensive you know we've been to some uh some a charity events where\nYou know than a hundred dollars a person you know and it I mean it's all for charity but you know still I mean yeah I I don't know that somebody who is following the ... my campaign would say well you know I Want to go ask a Mike Isaac few questions so let me just you know go over here unless they want to be very charitable and that that that's awesome if somebody wants to go ... no\nI just suggest shouldn't just less died yourself more of a well I mean you have gone everywhere that I think a candidate go\nI go someplace pretty much three times a day you know morning noon and night I I Try to do suffer the campaign three or you know\nYou know all all day

no way you know and I became paying now for a year and a half\nAnd I didn't even come close to meeting two hundred thousand people I didn't even come close to meeting twenty thousand I'd probably somewhere between ten Fifteen thousand in Eighteen months\nSo uh you know I I didn't even make ten percent of the people who voted and and that's that's just kind of challenging you know when when when you realize that that so many people are going to vote 'em and they've never met the candidate\nNow have you ever come on the cruise you mean six hundred people that my cat yeah but how many how many people do for a wire bra county them if they're all from hills [laughter]\n... what are you doing over there why so quiet out just listening I didn't want to interrupt you ... did you miss me\nI

want me to be in the same about addiction which made me laugh\nSo yeah I mean that that if I was there they wouldn't want me there if they had like a fitness guru yeah exactly yeah and I was eating IQ layers of my eyes wide waving at people\n[laughter] they\nGive you already started direction like hey don't wave at the camera they just gave me the breakdown of the show what is going to happen but

calling about the emotional quite thing no actually um I have a medical service out uh-huh and emotional for animals actually don't have public access right so I agree with you about the whole of using the same\nThing right now why why why do you have a service dog Brittany\nUm for medical reasons I passed out and called pot so he can alert to my heart rate and make sure that you have and everything like that right yeah yeah I agree with that either the other real you know how much sugar and\nOh that's nice oh I'm Sorry I suffer for it I'm I'm Glad you got a dog you know ...\nYeah they don't have public access right and so a lot of airlines are actually trying to crack\nDown on a commercial for animals by having to go out the farm from our doctor stating that we need 'em and stuff like that\nBut I agree with you that ah it's cheating that that that will cause that most of poor animal or supposedly what after my medical or service dog last week\nAnd I tried to bite him and the grocery store\nWow wow it's messed up well I'm Glad I'm Glad that you are you got your finger and that's good information and now now I'm not nearly as men are actually cracking down on the ... ah thanks thanks Brittany ... and uh you and your dog call back anytime you want\nRight take you to I feel like the doctor's note would be a good way of getting around that but then you know what's gonna happen and they just like just like with the marijuana doctors you're just going to have the dog doctors reviews rate you know twenty five bucks in there and got a service dog\nSo for punch them in

your dancing with the band on there I just put it on the stay will page or you can watch it there how long you know but it is it's about a minute long you're just kind of a waving your Grover arms around me and I could not that was unreal to me that was so CERN so last night just a quick refreshed\nI was making fun of on a last night and saying that she looked like the Grover ... did you see this on the air or was it was not I think it was off air to Johnny and Ryan and you've just messing around\nRight and I I don't remember I didn't remember who Grover was like Grover a little bird like they're all the same ... so you pulled you literally pulled up a picture on your phone your like this is Grover and you show\nMe and it says like lanky sort of mop it or whatever with a big nose and like okay I see the resemblance thank you very much and that's why I started laughing yeah so this morning I get to the show and I'm sitting in the green room and freaking alive sized rover walks by and I go mother ... well that's what I'm like\nJesus and raised on the return of him because what is what are the odds of that I got to buy a lottery ticket or something this week I when I saw that because I was like oh maybe I can find I wasn't up maybe I can find the show on Facebook or something to watch I wanted to see on TV and stuff\nAnd all of a sudden there's a picture of the lady the host Kendall\nFor life as\nI Know I Know I I was uncontrollably laughing and obviously couldn't explain it to everybody 'cause that's too long winded up a story I think it's funny so I'm just sitting there just like murder or a while like laughing to myself I'm like of course it's Grover than Grover was in a few segments with us and he's dancing with us and\nUm yeah I was looking at a mirror must have been weird for me it was it was just like looking\nAt stuff and two seven five seven nine to five or eight hundred seven seven one one oh two five alright so today is world mental health day\nI got mental health issues will got mental health issues I thought it was a good topic to talk about um it says here that uh it was entitled and you send me this article well ... has the world's gone mad a mental health disorders on the rise\nGlobally and here are just a few quick stats and not going to read you the whole thing for you to tears but it says uh who the world Health Organization estimates that around three hundred million people worldwide have depression and fifty million have dementia okay\nA lot of people living severe poverty and there's a lot of old people okay so we've covered that schizophrenia is estimated to affect twenty three million people and bipolar disorder around sixty million so it says\nThat a mental disorders are going up there on the rise I don't necessarily think that that is the case number one there are more people on the planet now than ever before so that just looking at the sheer numbers obviously there's going to be more people with problems\nOr number two people are getting diagnosed with things that they wouldn't have gotten diagnosed with a ... thirty forty years ago um and\nI feel like a lot of those people it situational problems right if you're family dies in a limo crash and your sad\nYou don't have depression your human and you've been through something traumatic that's perfectly normal your normal person\nBut um it the thing about those sorts of things is that I mean they can be very scary because even situational depression yeah I'm sure you can become suicide almost instantaneously\nFits your situational depression is just being fat yeah and you're supposed to be said sometime it's a human emotion at all you got to feel the bad with the good and it makes you appreciate\nThe happy when you're sad for a little while I was just one of those things and then they just try to put you to be on these you know drugs as us our eyes very common there's a huge percentage of it was a twenty percent or something that people in America on some sort of\nDepression though is that true I feel like\nDoctors almost prescribe it to just get rid of people like I don't want to talk to you and I want to deal with this just have some paint or some uh anti anxiety anti depressants um it's it's\nIt's crazy to me how many people are put on these drugs every single day and more than anything else and I know will like you've been affected by this yourself you talked about it on the show but children being given these drugs especially stuff like Ritalin and Adderall and stuff like that\nIt really really rubs me the wrong way when they're like oh my kid as like ADHD and like your you have an eight year old boy like what do you think was going to happen\nAnd here's the thing though is like you look at the human brain and look at other animals forget about other humans but a lot of other like up primates they do a lot of rough and tumble play obviously you know the the young ones are constantly wrestling with each other\nUm were were really no different in that regard that's why kids are always they have so much energy the running around\nAnd then we force kids to to being in a classroom and sit still and be quiet for eight hours during the day and they're like oh man it's not working out to me won't shut the F ... well yeah no kidding he's not supposed to sit there for eight hours and concentrate I wouldn't even say adults are supposed to do that sort of stuff\nWe just were made to be focused for that long and people with ADHD it's not a D D whatever you have hyperactive or not\nPeople think that it's the inability to pay attention but it's it's literally the exact opposite if that they pay attention to everything they can't ignore anything to the hairs on there they get distracted the here's down there they get distracted so I just feel like kids especially they just get over diagnosed because parents and teachers just don't want to deal with these rowdy kids yeah\nPart of its just laziness on there and for sure and it's you have this easy fix you know but the doctors you know we talked about this before but it seems like pharmacies pharmaceutical companies\nAre particularly nefarious with a lot of their business practices they operate there's a that family what are the ... or something like that or owns ... cotton and now they're coming out with a drug that gets you off off the cotton southern up their profits are stuck in that paper big time yeah and it just seems it key\nFor some reason it seems like these kids to just do the same thing just get them on pills get that papers back it up and and that's all it's about the money back get him out of your\nHair unless the kid is suffering from\nHelp me accomplish something that I couldn't do in is in you don't really yeah like I feel like I'm cheating the system like I'm like I'm In the Olympics and I'm I'm taking I don't know I'm doping or something like that and that's why I Won the gold medal\nOr but I Will happily take arrow when I'm party hundred percent I've done it before but I don't want to take out are all if it's like oh you know for if I was trying to get a you know pass the final exam or something like\nThat I've heard I've heard it described as its you you're still you what do you take it but if you got your covered and you saw where you're just poured over morning it's just more you if your body or even a little bell rang okay I see what you're saying yeah yeah\nIt doesn't it make you a laser focused to say that uh I mean the appetites but there was like it and I read it and it's really hard to eat on it uh so that's the only I think I'll do it but I mean if you actually need it I mean it really\nIt really does make you focus so if you are a little kind of\nDistrict easily or you do have eat eat eat\nIf you're just to show you that you're not supposed to be doing one task for twelve hours I Know a lot of people who are all grown adult to take it for work because they have very labor intensive jobs where they have to be super focus for long amounts of time a lot of them take out on a regular basis\nGet us out\nYou know I work in the field I call it sometimes I I work overnight stuff like that but you know so if your state of ours that with that but it's a bit of me not to let them do that to me that she goes to show it doesn't show up I looked at 'em\nAnd you

I mean it's one of these you could sit down and proudly read it in a couple of days and it's basically the story of how when we were kids in grade school\nWe were taught so many myths Druze and so many lives all of it because it was propaganda to build you up as an American citizen to prove that all people are winners this chapter that they have on Christopher Columbus will open your eyes to where he went to the natives of the land\nDown in the Caribbean where he actually invaded it was an invader\nAnd cut the ears off of women and children and held him up to them in and said he will go to the gold mines and you'll bring the queen gold or this is going to have in the ...\nAnd at that time the enslavement of people out of South Africa and Africa itself was going on there was already enslavement going on at that time read your history it's there it's true loves things right in front of us see they don't teach you that in grade school you're taught he's a great exploring a man who discovered America when he discovered South America\nI Hope the same people that don't believe in global warming that scientists are telling us is that help the people don't believe in that uh I Hope

Caucasian okay thank you well you're the one that's at it but how would it Asian people come where where Indian people come from I'm Sorry Jesus wasn't white either Bush one\nWay I mean I'm not from there in every book I've ever looked at you Scandinavian looking in Africa so obvious we're supposed to believe that and then after that\n... or so and then all of a sudden the dinosaurs popped out of where I Know I seem bones of a dinosaur I Know I've seen it somebody built up a dinosaur where is that dinosaurs in the garden of the things that have been much much much different if there was a T rex and and the\nGuard members remember [laughter] that news story we had a couple of weeks ago on a friday about that radical TV preacher he's a YouTube creature that believes that dinosaurs were around during the civil war and had had pictures\nThat [laughter] because you know you might be an ... way of uh [laughter] so we have a A R T rex ... with a Confederate flag shirt on us when we

uh we're going to be doing that supply hurricane drive a coming up tomorrow it on a serious\nNote I mean do we joke around a lot what really amazed me and I think a lot of the forecasters a meteorologist with the system you always hear everybody said it's the east end of this storm it to the east side of the storm and we're normally if they're in the Gulf of Mexico obviously on the east side of things that really catch the brunt of it\nDid you see the west side it was actually worse on the west side than the east side we're going to go which yeah I mean I was sitting there watching this whole thing yesterday and by the way you mentioned Steve derby over generally\nEarlier and I was watching the TV channel up in the Florida Panhandle and their tower got knocked out in the middle of the storm so they went to their affiliate up dose in Alabama and was doing coverage live from there\nThey lost power and their generator didn't work so they switched over to the nearest affiliate which was news channel eight or so yesterday afternoon at two o'clock I'm watching the derby the great ... you know a great guy I knew him when he worked at Cox Orlando's along dude oh he's a tall man ... yeah yeah the big all it was like hey\nI'm Steve in Orlando a channel nine years ago when I was working over there and I was looking at you know WFL like coverage because people in the pan handle that still had some kind of TV feed or some kind of electricity was trying to get some information\nIt was our Tampa Bay affiliate that ... actually helping them out and uh I was watching the intensity of the west side of this storm and I'm just like my God it's usually the east side that choose everything up and it was the west side where the winds and a lot of the rain was coming from\nWhat uh I just like to look Steve\nDriven them do their thing 'cause I I sit there watching uh I don't know I'll be books are reading and all those kind of terminology and directions\nAnd it's
