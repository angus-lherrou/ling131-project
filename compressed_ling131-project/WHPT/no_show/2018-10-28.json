didn't want to tell him that I barely a heterosexual\nAnd think that would go over too well each Google rebel a\nWe've got Kevin Smith on the phone with us you know him from clerks mall rats you directed and wrote those movies you also play silent Bob in those movies\nAnd they also something to talk about a Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan\nYeah he did I think that's probably I mean if I ask him

okay in that movie he was in the movie right oh I don't think I mean those\nDanielle for them in your ear [laughter]\nMan alive anyway we got Kevin Smith on the line with us we'll start with a question from Seth\nKevin I follow you on Twitter I'm a big Walking Dead and I saw that you you're involved with a show called comic book men that premiering after Walking Dead on February ... how are you involved with that show\nUh it's it's our show it's about ah our boys who work at a giant found by figured stash back east in New Jersey are complex store\nThey record a pod cast on a smart kids dot com that network I got online we're all we do is ... it's kind of like what you guys do but just a short once a week as opposed to like you guys get up to a deli\nThey want to do what you guys are doing I Want to stop what I'm doing do you do anyway [laughter]\nThey've been doing these pockets we've been doing all these pockets and that show telling Steve they've kind of translated well to to a TV AMC was looking for something to follow the walking dead with because they liked the fact the walking dead brought in kind of like the guardian for sure\nAnd you know it's a long time between seasons as they were in production and they were like man we'd like to keep them around what would keep them around\nAnd the dude from original media named Charlie corps when he called me up and he was just like there's a aims he's looking for a showman do you have any ideas for TV show might be cool for the gate crowd but now I don't do TV I don't really have anything I said but if you were going to do anything somebody should should do reality shows that in the comic bookstore like upon stores or something like that right\nWe shot him to the working title of secret staff of the name of the store but AMC wants to call it something that was a little more uh you know generic\nTerm you get a feel for everybody not just to pick her stash I guess as a connotation of some of like it's all about we are\nSo they went with comic book man and I've seen two episodes already is go to if you're in the geek culture it's phenomenal like we sit there and it's like it's like a combination of clerks and mall rats as a ...\nI like what I'm hearing\nIt suits behind the counter so there are interacting with the public um and then like we sit around the ... instead of doing like the one on one interviews on camera\nLike most reality shows we do it a ... of the podcast so you see a sitting around recording the podcast and that's where we talked about kind of what happened at the store that week and then cut into the reality footage and stuff it's really really cool\nSo check that out on a static because it's on AMC man which is like in terms of networks that that's the network of the moment man that we're got everything I watch got\nMad Men Walking Dead Breaking Bad so suddenly could be a part of that it it's phenomenal but at the same time you know you feel like oh man such quality programming I Hope we're not the one that I Hope we're not we're AMC jump the shark\nKevin Rachel three shows you last mentioned from from the very least favorite Mad Men Breaking Bad Walking Dead\nI go I go Mad Men are Walking Dead and and Breaking Bad wow breaking avenue at least favorite though that's like it's not like oh man that one thinks it's just like those are three heavy choices so if you have to put them in an order that's murder\nThat's a good order we are talking to Kevin Smith whose lives from behind between Jay and silent Bob get old will be selected theaters that re second at nine thirty several of them here in the Tampa Bay area you guys are doing some interactive stuff using the hash tag live from behind tell us what it's all about Kevin and how people can get involved\nWell we do another one of the ... that we do it's my guess is called Jamestown about get old and it's kind of about Jason muses life really it's about his battles with drug and\nHe tells amazing stories now you could go listen to it they're all free over its markets dot com chainsaw involved at all you hear it do it every week\nSave his own life essentially it's like an intervention podcasts where every week we check on him go how long you been clay and he tells the amount of days\nAnd we kind of a tell stories about uh you know the drug abuse in the past and making movies everything it's kinda like this is your life and it's shocking and wonderful and fun and it's sad like you'll you'll sit there and your stories about\nYou know due to being locked in a closet in a
