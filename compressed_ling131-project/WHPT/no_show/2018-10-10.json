I'm not scared of storms but you know you got to be leery of storms I'm watching them listening\nYou don't really hear this tone a lot like I\nKnow I one guy was above the storm was forty forty five thousand feet above the storm I was flying and something and they were showing that just points to the other storm and he he's a guy that gets chasing storms he knows about swarms and he was there a storm chasers they go go into the mouth of the storm and this dude was a storm expert\nAnd there were like have you ever see the store by disease like I'm not sure I have\nHe goes I'm just telling you I'm not seen something like this I let let's don't mess around with this so if there if we have to be leery of something that's not even gonna hit us not even close\nThe paddles in big big trouble and I don't know anything about global warming and all those kinds of things and uh but it seems like the mother nature is is out to get us\nAnd I'm Scott what's ... I was going to do forget about a may worried about Tampa Bay area I'm really not no\nDo you know like I mentioned the forecast earlier we're going to get some gusty winds of course and you've already ran into some rain coming into this warning let on base or late ... and there's already some flooding on bay shore right now I was just talking about that a minute ago we have flooding reported it between swan ... and the same as the law it happens\nEvery every thunderstorm ... correct I'm or afternoon correct same thing was shore acres that area of St Pete and then coffee pot by you and then we saw yesterday afternoon even some areas of the Pinellas County coast but\nYou got to look at citrus county citrus county is right on the tail end of these bigger bans and it's up to the north of us in citrus county where they're really worried about a storm surge possibly I think ah four feet of water possible for the citrus county area and that's more for the coastal areas than inland\nAnd that's why they had that evacuation into school closing ins in citrus county which was a wise thing to do because some of the the schools are now being used a sheltered so you said four feet almost like it wasn't that big of a deal while when you're looking at a twelve feet\nUs what I'm saying yeah but four feet four feet is ... ... is whom\nAll it takes is three feet of water to actually live to car up off the road and floated down the street when you when you put it like that three feet of water will lift the vehicle and move it down the street\nYes we've been watering and that ain't what you what you want to be mess with that's for sure no end with all the debris and everything like that and what amazed me yesterday when I was here I was here till seven o'clock at night\nAnd uh I was sitting here watching the local coverage of some of the flooding we did see in this area which again we get during a storm\nAnd folks don't think about this because they're driving through it the danger of getting stuck in that water number one but number two you're not driving through rainwater you're driving through salt water that that is coming in from the mouth of the Tampa Bay\nYou're basically driving your car over a salt lick that you know what salt does to metal and to the under carriage of a car or if you suck that up into your engine I mean the engines to put any way of you suck water up into a but salt water\nWhile I forget about I mean what saltwater does to anything yeah I mean I wrote yeah I was a him being from up north I don't I didn't know anything about salt water but I got here and I've been fishing my whole I've ... my whole life\nSo I remember fishing in the bay and especially with a buddy and got my pliers and I'm I'm dipping into while he was doing I go I'm cleaning my pliers goes done [laughter] and what I mean they they're shot\nI mean just from dipping them in the water like I didn't know that's what salt water good to things salt water air stuff up\nOh yeah that's what you come back from a day of fishing and got to clean the boat\nBut you know what else tears things up just the air from salt water yup just the air from salt water will tear up\nEngines corrode things uh you know it's up north you get tore up for the winters and the salt and all that kind of got one day throws all the roads for the ice and we had it in the air it's in our air our stuff grows way faster nobody else\nBut I imagine a twelve foot wall of water this storm surge know it can add up in North Florida that is salt water just so not only is is the wind and the water just going to totally devastate structures and people ... you've got all that salt water\nComing into Harriet down physically and in the long run it's going to tear it down to 'cause once the salt water hits it after that it's absolutely done All right let's say let's take a quick break come back in touch a little bit more about the storm because there's still a whole lot more to talk about\nAll right brother and we do have traffic to talk about no accidents but let's get to this guy way\n[noise] another [noise]\n\nAll right I've already received a lot of Facebook messages this morning about the skyway bridge is the bridge open yes the bridges open remember\nIt's going to take wind gust of forty miles an hour I usually say thirty five is when I started getting worried but the official word is forty miles an hour\nAnd we haven't seen does get in the Tampa Bay area so we do have a high wind advisory right now for the skyway bridge again I Want to reiterate that bridge is open new are not going to have any problems with that yet we'll keep an eye on it\nI wouldn't advise remains just use a little caution\nAnd make sure you leave some extra space for those big profiled vehicles the box drops the tractor trailers those guys\nThey're going to be on the bridge with your back off their bumper give him a little extra room or I Know rags to report right now and traffic is up to speed on my waist traffic math\nIt's five twenty It's Wednesday morning this is the ... by many in garden\nMany in court trials on one of them to fly them blow\nMyself show and we live we\nThinking of that you got to keep this in mind and we saw this last year with Hurricane Irma uh the reason why is not so much because of damage and flooding that the kids are missing school it's during an evacuation we use all the schools ... you know evacuations so last year with the power\nBut it does and the damage with Irma and was more to the south and we did see a lot here in the Tampa Bay area a lot of schools were still housing people\nFor an emergency personnel\nAnd you can't reopen the schools and you can't reopen the school if the school was out power and the generators not working and we saw that in some cases or so it sometimes may take a week do you go to school back open depending on the damaged the storm and how many evacuations you still have inside because you just can't kick somebody out and go hey\nShelters close go home you don't have a home to go to ... I mean eventually you got to work something out\nBut they don't rush you out of that shelter\nNo I Know ... obviously\nBut listen everybody's preparing them in different ways uh I don't know if we're in preparation mode because he can you can go places I don't see anybody frantic I Want to remember last year was frantic storm a season and that one blindsided me a little bit like I was like I didn't I wasn't ready I wasn't right as\nThese October storms those through the Gulf that tend to be very dangerous but they were hip ugly go up into Biloxi in Alabama you know maybe a little too this is one of the biggest ones and we're talking about small cat five making landfall this afternoon around one still Panama City ... Appalachia cola in that area\nFair to say this is this is horrific\nI said yesterday I think it was just about how it all seems to hit the pan handle they say it wasn't one hasn't hit there since like oh five right\nAnd and we haven't seen one of\nThis magnitude ... and I mentioned ... which was huge and this is bigger the noble into\nTo run some numbers by you right now with this system one point eight million people under a hurricane warning and that includes residents of Georgia because as we heard earlier as this system moves through the north once it makes landfall it's on a path to go to Macon Georgia\nWhen it hits making and look at your math or Macon Georgia is\nIt's still going to be a category one hurricane has Macon Georgia would ever seen a category one hurricane\nWill be too much inland and then but that's how strong this system is they're still saying it will be a cat one when it hits that was a pay as it goes to let it it's it's it's getting writes a weekly wow but still on that path to dump at least possibly six inches of rain in northern and southern Carolina\nWhere they just had a massive hit and a lot of flooding and a lot of people haven't even started rebuilding their so that's ... that shows you the magnitude and how big this storm is that if it hits Macon Georgia\nAnd I think any time anybody has driven up north they've gone through making [laughter] to see a category one storm\nSitting over Macon Georgia unbelievable so this is something I don't think the Florida Panhandle as long as we've been keeping records of seeing the storm this big I could be wrong I don't have the stats in front of me but I don't believe they've seen something this huge\nYeah if you read redoing your your place in another storm comes through I think that'd be enough to say you don't want ma\nMa let's pick up and go somewhere else will love making that much the way\nYou know what I mean it's like you just ... you get swamped just like the people of Puerto Rico and some of those other places you get hit Haiti you get hit by rebuilding and then you know as you're halfway done the next storm so you can come yeah like who got\nGot pleased do something else his Puerto Rico they might as well just say let's just get rid of it\nWas that's one thing that we've seen here in the state of Florida is a lot of the ... from Puerto Rico to ever left they came here and said we ain't going back well with it because the majority of them already had an employee here and say well we're not going back\nYou know for what are you all got good stuff over here we all have electricity over I'm not going back there no I mean you know loyal is good but I'm not going back there not not for that\nWell throughout another number ... for a million Americans right now under a tropical storm warning now the Tampa Bay area is still under a tropical storm watch but from citrus county north in the tropical storm warning you look at Florida Georgia or that area up there in Mississippi for point four million people\nUnder that warning in a warning means conditions are favorable it's coming\nSure what's all that when I was ... that goes ... it spreads out a hundred and thirty something miles right of center the ... the tropical storm force way from hurricane donors from the center that's a Big Mac\nWhooping tail or even on the outskirts of that thing is whipping tail but in the center of it do they say the center it's come oh yeah we I've been through the eye of hurricane before in the middle of a calm and everything around good war out yup\nAnd a sky is clear out and it's blue that are very blue sky an eerie I'm sure and it is very eerie and then the next wave the back wave comes in on this call before the storm\nWell yeah that's what you had already a storm yeah and then the eye comes through and if you are right dead center of that I it's actually amazing to be in a situation like that and I have I don't want to be and you know what's come and do you know they don't let a fake out\nOr that you would take me out you know what's coming because you you read all the books and stuff I read the book is all I Know it was clear out and I'm tired or so you just cut off kicking his all clear you all night you're outside mon your lawn and all of a sudden you know it's going to come out it should get maybe it won't be mon you're long ago oh let's take a quick break we'll come back and we'll finish up with some news this late\nAlright buddy let's get another look good\nTrap [noise] another thing\nI Know rags to report in the Tampa Bay area and I'm checking out my waist traffic map\nAnd every body is up to speed keep in mind if you live in those low lying areas that typically flood during a Florida afternoon thunder storm and high tides as you could see some of that\nThis morning and throughout the day the only major traffic issue I have right now is a high wind advisory for drivers on the skyway bridge to bridge is open don't freak out yet just a high wind advisory issued by the Florida highway patrol watch\nYour speed and give those big profile vehicles box drugs tractor trailers little extra room to move\nHits five
