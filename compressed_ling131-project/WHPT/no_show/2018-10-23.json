seven people that just keep on winning all of them so we want more winners most or All right let's do our we actually got three big stories of the day because I couldn't I couldn't decide you know why should you have to\nI you know it's my radio show and he pretty much do whatever I Want it so I was like you know what oh it's three of them [noise]\nMonday you know we've got a lot of stuff to cover weekend true ah the big story of the day\nIs the caravan\nImmigrant caravan of migrants yeah yeah this\nIs a when I saw this all the big deal everybody wants to come here but then\nAs a developed over the weekend I go whoa gaining steam it looks like there's over seven thousand migrants traveling\nThrough Mexico trying to reach the U.S for I think they're over a thousand miles away from I think they're trying to get into the the Texas crossing yeah I saw one of the videos I saw it looked like one of those comedy movies they just kind of cheese they just kind of\nYeah they just overtook offense to just walk through it and they're\nA rally that last for the thousands and thousands of miles yeah and people\nDidn't even try to stop him because it was such a big heard of people are like look man just collapsed the fans are we can't do anything about it they're common so it's like the walking dead when you know there's a giant heard zombies come into these aren't zombies or humans\nAre yeah but what do we do like we have to protect our borders like\nYou have to go through the legal process to to be in this country\nAnd I'm not trying to sound like this big mega Trump's support and like a you know crazy hers an immigrant or control is not as like a Trump issued everybody thinks it is yeah no it's not yeah it's not if this is something that's good for our country look I'm all about\nComing here and uh but you got to take the proper channels\nYou have to well of course and again these people for them to go through that like for being honest for them to go through the legal channels would be nearly impossible yeah they just don't have the resources is is there like Hail Mary they're traveling I mean essentially I think they're Fifteen thousand miles away\nSomething like that or maybe that's where they started and they're just walking yeah a lot of a well here's the thing though I'm of those seven thousand I'm not quite sure how many reached the most of them are her\nHonduran yeah so there from Central America motor home or not Mexican on cell only it looks like six hundred and forty of them were let in on Saturday\nSo a lot of them were jumping into the river on raft like trying to buy\nAsked immigration on the Mexican border yeah by the U.S they were just trying to get into Mexico\nWhich is such crap country so they are trying their best to get into a less crappy country you know not not trying to use the F whole country thing but\nNo they are they are absolutely listen if your own people are fleeing by the thousand you live in an asshole countries are a are you know and it's not it has nothing to do with the culture or anything like that but just the infrastructure\nUh the politics the government that the dictator herbal you know the gangs and MS Thirteen is insane I heard something like the men between the ages of like Eighteen and thirty like the er the homicide rate it like fifty percent like any and all these\nCountries are pretty much lawless in so many areas it's like the the police are corrupt the government's corrupt absolute militaries corrupt so it's like nobody's really safe and I can understand why you want to get the hell out of here and I can understand why America is the dream you know what I mean like we we really do\nTake for granted just how good we got some times Oh absolutely yes we do we have social injustice of course we do do we have a you know corruption in certain parts of our country of course we do everybody does but the end of the day\nGood lord says this is such a great great place to be\n... it really is and it is really sad the situation that they are and I mean they're hungry they're scared for their lives the way to live some of them have left children behind some of them all up their parents behind like it's a really really sad situation\nBut then you have to ask yourself what is the role of any government right I Would argue I Would say that the role that the government is to protect the people within its borders that is that the job there but ... does not to be you know this on world humanitarian force taking in all the refugees right now I feel terrible for these people but\nI mean like we were discussing before before the show\nYou know what if every single referee refugee on the planet decided to come to America tomorrow yeah we're done we believe that it didn't work you can't do it and can't do it you can't accept all of them so then where do you draw the line\nOr do you draw a line so it's kind of like you know a ton of your heartstrings because these people are are destitute and their desolate and they have no they're they're seeking asylum course but on the other hand\nHow many are going to die on the way here oh I don't know yeah I don't know um but a lot of them are kind of it sounds like they think maybe some of my break off while they're in Mexico because\nAt that Mexico is it's a lot better than the countries that they've come from so we'll see what happens\nYeah I mean you know you're from a really bad place when you number one you're breaking into Mexico just to get through it and number two ... you're just you're all in like your this is it just as a last ditch effort on any kind of a life they know they have nothing if they don't get outta there they're going to die\nThey just they literally have the clothes on their back and that is all yeah and\nIt's basically a loss screw that you can't have that the only way it's not a law says if somebody else in your vision ties also like that's not going to happen it's never going to happen so\nI go for the win every single time and that's what they did a cutter pulled the trigger and\nThree and three after six games which if you would have said at the beginning of the season hey how would you like three and three after a you know the first six games after facing a that that dominant in the first three games and all that would be like dude I'd be static and I am I'm happy with it the defense or the show big time improvement and I yeah next time they they were\nFlying around the ball or five sex yeah five sex or they were a a dolphin or was was calling blitz packages I'd never seen other was a safety blitz on a third down I mean they they were all over Baker Mayfield not only that but they were playing press coverage there was no no more the wide receivers just why around catching balls or willy nilly\nPasses or being contested left in writing or is it possible that the browns are very good no thought the browns or they're not that bad at all they're actually not that bad at all they won one game and like seven years now they want to this year already I mean they want to and I they they lost the game in overtime I think twice I mean so hey they're\nThey're ... so a congratulations Tampa Bay buccaneers very very happy with the guys or this week we traveled to Cincinnati to play the bangles so uh I think it's winnable game but it's not a pushover to the Bengals have a powerful offensive\nA pretty decent defence but I'm excited to see where the bus to go from there I just want competitiveness and that's what they gave me yesterday and they actually pulled to the the went off and uh yeah I uh\nI I had heart publications I get really I don't know if that helps me well it's probably the day after all that pick Jake I told him yeah I was a lot of sodium is really really good though I'm\nSo there you go congratulations buccaneers uh do you do you ever predictions from the game handy dandy because uh\nWe oh you know what no we did it with like forty seconds left director mine yeah I said uh the bucks at one twenty to Seventeen I wasn't too far off twenty six twenty three and the guy

Want to hear from you guys Seventy seven five seven nine one or two five or eight hundred seven seven one one or two five cars that two hundred people's no joke ought to\nBe a lot of people now imagine vetting all those people and he just like blood amen obviously so you've got to detain I'm not going to take tax dollars the how these people feed these people they these people like it's going to cost a lot of money now is that is that something that we should be doing as\nA government of not only the American people but I don't know I like trying to be a humanitarian superpower safe haven for people that need us\nBut then I just keep thinking what is it every single refugee wherever be Sudan Congo or Vietnam or Honduras or whatever if they left their their countries of origin and came to America tomorrow\nWe'd be smash there's no way we take all of them and so do you feel if you feel you have to draw a line and this and say okay well we can't take all of you we should take note of you or do you think that we were crossing a line we're coming to a lot we should only take this many X amount of people each year\nThat's the thing with with me is we already taken one million people a year on immigration or the United states asylum that's not counting\nThat that was just people is okay again I wrote the world okay and that's not counting illegals that come over the border from Mexico not counting not OK okay so legal immigrants we take a million a year you're saying one million people I mean I one of 'em when you're a you're on the well because this\nIs Darryl what's
