Bradley Cooper charming guy guy's awesome\nIt's dark it's a very dark store is dark at times you can't look away and it it's like oh it's so just awkward\nBut there's something very authentic about it and it was weird because like it's going to the movies like they show the production and like\nLive nation production and I'm like lot nation so it was a little bit weird to see that but it's probably a good thing that law of nature produced it because all the musical scenes like in the venue that they probably use through their look really do it don't look like CGI\nYou don't read as like you can see in a lot the musical ... the music is really well done and Bradley Cooper you know I Know child has talked about this on the air and the more than what you said you know hey you know it's not fair that he could say I I totally agree with the ...\nThing and writes dogs but it's just not fair job you\nKnow I Know I Know it's not a and M. course Lady Gaga I liked that she's able to a kind of spreads her wings ... and kind of you know show or the other side sue her to her ... everybody just knows her as this\nYou know kind of edgy pop star does all the crazy makeup and wears meat jackets and you know does crazy rolls on like American horror story and things like that but\nBut she's actually a really really talented actors are of course she's a great singer a musician but I think this is a this was a role to she needed to really put yourself out there like a mega star\nYou're not just a a you know a pop star\nYou know not to be funny but she was really born to play a role like a sin my friend DJ Marino he's a fellow critic loves Lady Gaga and he brought up a good point is that\nYou know the old Lady Gaga I think she's kind of act it's kind of an yes subways you know it's this persona so it's not like he or she hasn't been acting it's something she tried to do in the beginning\nIt just didn't work out for and then she got a second chance you know what you Ryan Murphy in American horror story got show up and she'd had little cameos here and there but this is something totally different I mean she's so great in it I mean this thing and we know she can do it but the singing is amazing end up the songs are really good at it and I want to tell people it's not a musical there is music\nHeavily in this movie it's very involved in the music and the movie\nBut it's not like Lala land or Greece where they just bust out right yeah they are musicians think about like what a lot of music and thought of that but what's it called walk the line and\nMusical it's more of a bio this feels like a bio pic except their fictional\nDoctors and yeah you should believe the hype when it comes to Oscars I I think I think she's I mean I think she's getting nominated for an Oscar I Know that sounds crazy\nI Do think she's in she's that great in it and you just are taken back fire or Bradley Cooper Zen and Bradley Cooper you've got a good chance of winning that's a good reason as good as Lady Gaga guy as Bradley Cooper is\nWatching all week and I know yeah ... ... when when I Lived a rating doing rotten tomatoes is ah it's Ninety three percent which is pretty good um and then I Am the ... seem to be a little more critical when it comes to the ratings 'cause it's a it's a half point rating system up to ten they have an eight point five which is really strong Ryan db\nAnd now when you go to a ratings they have a Facebook rating system now are you aware of that\nYeah but don't trust the Facebook rating system the rate of ...\nI saw four points out of five for Facebook radio I'm like okay I didn't know Facebook was wrong and I like that but either way it seems like there is a there's not a lot of negative around a reviews for this movie so that that's exciting to me it was my saw the trailer\nAh I I was blown away just by the trailer and I was like All right we got to see this and we've been we've been hurting all summer camp for something like this 'cause\nI mean to be honest it's been kind of a crappy summer for movies\nI saw this movie was this whole year was front loaded with ... I mean we're really front loaded with infinity war Black Panther a quiet place all the good stuff was in the first six months I Would say I'd say right around Mission Impossible\nIt started to slow down take time and it's been that way ever since but that's how it goes sometimes sometimes we get those ... gets an August like a guardians of the galaxy straight out of top then\nSometimes quiet and it was quiet for the most part this year but yeah it's going to come back in a big way this week and I think\nA star is born is not going to win the box office I still think that to go to that but it's going to surprise some people and it's going to have a lot of longevity in terms of money it makes it how it sticks around people are really going to see this\nAnd they're going to see it again again take people back to see it it's like I said it's more of an experience and also besides Cooper and guard or a terrorist here so people in the supporting cast it just\nIf I'm right now there are there all day to sell Andrew dice clay I mean and and these are serious roles that they're not playing like goose bumps\nDyson Chappelle both play knock comedic role wow a dice plays in a jar guys mother or father [laughter]\nI'd\nGet over here and give you a momma oh [laughter]\nBut I don't see the guy who believe yes she does show off I mean it's really going for a reason I mean they are ... movies oh yeah\nYou see stuff yeah so you're definitely the stuff\nAh how about a\n... you\nKnow you'll see mia Hamm but there are some like ... I think it is kind of a sexy movie too and and listen I don't want anybody to get any false pretense about this movie\nIs a romance movie yeah but I think it's a romance movie everybody would like because it's not formulaic it's not some chick flick right it's just a very authentic movie and also stay a mallet and it's really too I think he could sneak in the best supporting actor he's really going to to the wall is limited but when he did it he's awesome\nHe's awesome and everything I saw him I I watch some movie that was one of these ones that kind of slipped through the cracks with a a brain foreigner name of that in a closet hero knows my grandma or something like that but it had a\n... I'm bringing fighting right now but it was it was this one is a like a super like off the radar movies but he played a a small role and he was phenomenal and in that too I was like damn I said some Eliot Kelly in this role is really really good so I think of it in\nA minute I I'm Still not woke up from a nap so yeah it was good All right so you're ready to get to the bad news oh a Vietnam\n[laughter] man I mean I held out hope you know I was like\nMaybe they'll have something cool maybe they can get this together because this is my personal feelings come they're not my critical side I Love them I put up a TV today on Twitter of me dressed up as Ben I'm as a kid I mean I I Love that character I hated what happened in Spiderman three\nIt was terrible what happened to him yeah I've been wanting to see him get a second chance\nI was very wary of the second chance\nA because Spiderman wasn't involved in at the end of the day you can't have those in a movie without Spiderman right it's just the characters go hand in hand the you're you're definitely getting ahead of yourself you change the whole origin or Tom Hardy set role is just wacky\nIt's another movie just like the ... where it did make me laugh or a couple of times but I was like I shouldn't be laughing at this and you know they couldn't this out they wanted to be like a superhero movie you're like almost even like a horror movie Tom Hardy this week in the press that that they cut out his favorite forty one minutes of the film like as long as the actress taste up like they cut out my favorite ten minutes till he said\nForty one [laughter]\nWell I mean that's and it's a hundred and twelve minutes and it feels law\nLike when I got out I thought man was this was this like\nTwo hours and twenty minutes\nI looked down on my pet it's only like nine twenty two we won't we won't even there two hours and and there are secret themes in it so if you want to stick around\nAnd they are secret things but I got my enemy is a I got my been um\nTicket for here [laughter]\nIt's going to make some money Johnny there's no doubt I said before that marble logo can make a church on sometimes it can it's got the power to do it\nSo I think that it's still going to probably when the box office but I think it'll be wanted done and like I said a movie like a star is born is going to hang around a little bit and really make some money in the long run it's disappointing to see this because Tony wants to do this whole spider ... thing and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA number ten lovely Molly two thousand eleven I like mine\nThat girl yeah I Know\nLovely Molly how about that on\nWhere the hell yeah makers the Blair Witch project and we were going there now my\nHand them urban looks freaky\nNineteen sixty three I have seen this movie\nScientist doing research on the paranormal invites two women to all hunted mansion one of the participants soon start losing\nFor God damn mind\nSee my favorite horror movies or the ghost ones yeah paranormal stuff hunting movies are my paves hunting of hill houses a good one at the classic yeah\nHave you ever seen a American haunting now\nHere's the scary part of that movie for me it's got key uh Nike ...

be super super success one radio and we we can be we used to work hard at it absolutely yeah and it's like you see the people that are successful but you also know that they're road was also a very long road and they had to do a lot to get there\nBut it's like you get to see\nThe fruits of their labor so you know what could be down the line for\nYou absolutely and now there's this new element where you see the great people or people who have accomplished so much made it to the pinnacle of their career and you just see this massive\nFall yeah you know with one stupid mistake looking Roseanne because of\nSocial media because and I'm not saying me too is a bad thing but you know because of me to leave lose you know you can lose everything because of of one thing he did in your past that maybe you shouldn't have done obviously or something that you write or or you even say you make a statement like nor McDonald and he got kicked off in like Conan are saying\nSo to me it's just like obviously with with great ... of what they call it with\nGreat writers wants voted comes railroad power losers hide Herman yeah anyway but ah\nYeah you know no money more problems sort of stuff yeah that's the thing\nToo is where do you find a balance where you're successful you feel accomplished but you you're not bored with it\nWell here's the thing and this is what I've done is because I'm I'm kind of a little bit obsessed with this whole like self development stuff millennials the kinds of hours and I was\nPretty a pretty uh enthralled with your conversation I actually sat in my driveway when I got home and kept listening you didn't like killers off almost right no no no I hate it all over the ... on the ground anymore and with my car right now\nAre good but what I've learned us far is that you really need to celebrate the micro goals yup you know like even if it's just it's it's one little thing it's just one step and you have like twenty thirty forty fifty\nLittle steps you it makes you make huge progress yeah yeah but you need to celebrate the little moments instead of being like this isn't good enough like if you're going to pound the back to like\nGet some perspective turnaround be like wow I host a three hour yeah you know show on on the number one rated station in Tampa Bay right we have the potential to reach millions of people yeah globally even with the app and everything that is pretty freaking cool yeah it\nIt we're we're we definitely are at a level that people would love to be here\nAnd I I had this conversation with somebody a couple of months ago\nAnd um I said yeah I said you know I Want to make in radio one day is all is what I'm really my goal is right now\nAnd they were like we talking about you you you are making it you're on the radio every night there's guys I I struggle with my pod cast sounding like even listen ... and I can get in my car and listen to you every night you've made it and I go walnut financially and he goes but but there's bigger the bigger things in finance he goes\nUh what about stand up comedy I go I haven't made it and stand up comedy goes\nYeah you have because\nYou headline shows all over the place you get paid for it he will pay you ... a bookers call you you don't have to go out and put yourself out a idol well I Can't I Can't sustain everything from a comedy I mean I could if I just one on the road again you know but\nI Do it you don't do that level that I'm comfortable with it I still stay home still do radios stereos\nBut yeah when you look at it like somebody that doesn't\nHave the level of success that we have a then they think we're we're\nThere we had at all and they look at somebody else anything they have it all males and they think they have it all so it's that perspective it's about your interesting\nWhen you really break down and think about it like how everybody has a different perspective\nYeah and another thing that I've learned from all of a self development of BS thing to be as good as just in the ... is gratitude that's like the main thing and I watched so many breaking videos about like how\nTo be happy and happiness is a choice and all this stuff and there's a there's some a lot of uh triangulation there's a lot of things at multiple people are saying yeah and it's always about being present\nAnd gratitude yeah thankful for what you have because you can't be upset you can't be mad you can't be stretch when he would start thinking about all the things you're thankful for what you want to different had space for mental state and then from there you go okay this isn't so bad this is actually pretty cool by life isn't so bad yadda yadda so\nYeah yeah in a ... this kind of get brought up because we uh we're looking at social media will look and all this stuff and like I Can't speak for you guys but\nI'm not mad per se that we're not on the cruise bottom after major formal right now like I'm watching I'm going oh\nI look so much out of the burger I heard that crack in real life well you know what I mean like I ... I was ah was on the cruise in two thousand Lebanon it was one of the best times ever had it was so much fun even Ralphie almost died\nYou know on the cruise and he ended up with that but er which are really bad um spend almost exactly a year or some type of I remember but um but man just so much fun hanging out with a ... I wasn't even in radio at a time I was just a comedian um but now I'm looking and I'm like looking at all of our friends I'm going\nMan we have to get to the next level we have to get to where we are on the cruise I guess it's automatic you know which is just ... it's just more dry forces more\nMore reason for us to get in here earlier prep harder and and uh in and put out the best shows we possibly can\nAnd it just motivation so but yeah I'm watching I'm going oh man\nYeah so uh it it that's what kind of made me think about your conversation what will the other day so it's like you know you can uh you can be us our bus or you could lead to motivate you to\nDo better to be grateful for what you have their stay hungry you know ... that's where you find the balance humbling Hungary bad yeah so you're you're happy with what you have but you're still you know reaching out and striving for more\nSo I wanted I wanted I oh I'm Talking about social media we tease it as before we went to break I don't want to laugh at these people but\nCome on\nI didn't realize how many times as happens in a year but people are dying\nFrom taking selfies dying now deaths\nAnd look I when I read this I thought okay it's like those Russian kids that run along the top of buildings and do the videos and all that stuff yeah you ever watch those on YouTube park or stuff yeah though it's it's not just park or they're like walking on the ledge is of like\nNo I don't or not if teens ... building opens their stupid yeah there was a Japanese kid died of ... a big famous YouTube or last year he fell to his death in front of his fiance\nA but but this this is what's happening I'm selfies uh where people are like doing something about the side of cliffs things like this uh people are dying from it and you would think the United states will be the ... country for this but it's not\nThe funny part is India has the most selfie debts\nAnd the reason why because India has this big trend of mass ... where are you trying to get as many people into the photo at the same time\nAnd they're dying from being hit by automobiles and ... and ... [laughter]\nIt's just crazy man\nI'm One of a one big social media influence or a was a killed actually trying to save his girlfriend from falling over to the side of a waterfall\nThey were taking selfies she fell in he goes into saver he goes over the side of waterfall that happened this year um but yeah people are just they're they're dying they're taking their own lives and it's been documented so where do we find now\nThe pitch black what do you call it the the not the black the oh they are what the dark wow yeah yeah\nI don't want to see him die I just want to see like the picture that that happens right before you know what I mean like there's a picture of life for guys on the side of a clip but one guy you can obviously see is almost out of the brain because he I don't want to see that ... times ... [noise]\nI mean do we feel sorry for 'em or is it like a you know it's a sorry if it's like a legit accident natural selection they know the risk man well yeah if you're like it was just standing on the edge of a volcano of it all the or the fall and\nRip up by um I Would think that the demo\nOf the people that are dying are probably ... I Would say mostly male maybe females well by probably between the ages of like Eighteen\nAnd thirty twenty five\nA well in regards to the two hundred and fifty nine people that have died in the last year a highest number of incidents and solving debts were in India like I said and followed by Russia the United states number three Pakistan's number four and loves her\nApparently the average age of those killed was a an surprisingly pretty young twenty two point nine I got almost twenty three years old\nA chance of you reaching death by selfie dropped off significantly the order to get by the time someone it's thirty just over three quarters of those killed taking selfies were men also of course yeah so how men typically engaging more risky behaviors yeah ...\nSo don't feel bad if you take a lot of selfies Ryan a because at least you're not putting yourself in harm's way and killing yourself also one of the biggest ways of dying a firm solve these people on the train tracks\nTaking us all the what the train coming like\nHell is wrong with people I've I've done that one but the train coming not real close by where you could see the ... probably a couple of blocks away or\nIf you're an idiot I just I I could step off the train track now they want to know vast now who's a name or city now me and the chicken get off get off the train track I did hear I didn't die\nBut there's people like I guess the old bullet trains are coming in you know hey and they lay down on the track you know I so down\nSo that that shows you how powerful those hit the doping mean are and how addictive they all the all those lights and stuff you want people to like you and notice you and comment on your staff it's powerful\nOr headband bill either one bad either\nOrion got khakis where are they all had well he's an Iranian right and you have the Adidas I while I mean that's if I go home grandma sweater and yeah that that's what I have thrift store chic is what I Would call a\n... right yeah yeah it's yeah it's so poor it's so bad it's yet\nI saw these shoes on Nordstrom a racket the Facebook ads you know where she do they are they looked like hobo they look like Marco shoes I was the one with like big table on them like their tattered ...

I wouldn't say I'm\nMasculine and that way but I just don't have a lot of female typical interests and it's not even that I don't like fashion or any of that stuff not only do not like it but I don't know anything about it it's equally as I'm In the void is as equal as like sports right so I don't have any like male\nTypical interest but no female typical interest either\nIs fashion feminine because there's a lot of like gays in fashion or men and even\nFootball players I ever see football players walking out for Monday Night football they all have these weird you know suits on they're all in the fashion\nSure absolutely but say run of the mill your average Joe kinda guide your average Jane kind of girl I Would say most women know bit more about fashion are more concerned with it or find it more interesting than the guys would on average\nMeaning ... who designers are\nYeah designers and stuff like that or they get really excited about it I I I don't think I've ever had a conversation about fashion I it just doesn't interest me at all and I I feel like it's just it's so important to me in my life like obviously I\nI just I to me it's it's a functionality you wear clothes because you can't be naked 'cause you go to jail you know I I've said this before I Would I Would use a plastic bag is a\nPurse if it was you know socially acceptable it's just not um but yeah I just I just don't care completely one hundred percent apathetic to it so that would go so but it's\nNice 'cause then I when I work with women and radio it does allow me to kind of try to do different things you know and I don't I Try to be a chameleon you know if someone like more like wacky slapstick stuff I Would try to do that sort of thing or if people are trying you know we had to run this year come in you know that\nIs yeah yeah yeah she came in and she has a a clothing line so I have to try to relate to her\nOn some stuff so it's good to kind of um\nPut yourself in a push yourself out of your comfort zone and try anything so definitely that's what I have to say about that Seventy seven five seven nine one oh two five I'm so bad at fashion last year I had a call ... my best friend my Persian since I have a and I asked her I said do red and brown\nMatch and she was like yeah\nI didn't know of neutral color yeah she was like yeah red and brown absolutely match I'm like are you sure I have never heard those two go together she's like yeah I'm like OK center patron like these two things mastermind just like I\nI couldn't tell my eyes couldn't tell if two things match or now clashing was it going together and then maybe some sometimes clashing is like off on guard you know like is that like a cool thing like girls do that thing with the with the nail with the not the index the ring finger what do you call it\nThe ... what's the finger well some of the ring finger on both\nYeah it is okay well whatever the ring finger yeah on both of them they they do the different color nail polish so you have like yeah you you know what I mean like this ring finger like blue the rest of the things that are paying ...\nWhy do they do and what happened with us or I was just like the head but why not the or I Want to do like a coke\nDoubt like long pinky finger nail and that was ... just one\nYeah why not suit up being in a leader innovator and it'd be different trend setter trends that are like it um I also have a surprise coming up yeah\nStill teasing it but I don't want to say anything about 'em really really excited\nAbout this is it confirmed ... it's a yes and no like even if it's confirmed like a week and a half ago but they told me they were going to give me like a confirmation closer to the date which it it's going to happen next week if it happens at all so I I don't want to say this is going to happen and it doesn't happen then they look like a jackass and toll lose\nYou know I I think again I talk about being judgmental all the time but I\nAbsolutely think that you can be judgmental when you look at people's career choices\nI mean you look at a doctor you're not going to think that they're lazy procrastinators with no goals you're like these are ambitious driven diligent working people you know and with strippers you gotta say\nMost of them I don't want to say oh but oh man I'm happy to daddy took over yeah bad person

you ever seen his wife now his wife is it's very similar to George Bush senior and Mrs Bush\nWhere his mom books like his model and er and they've been together for a long time until recently I think and then ... like he's gay and he doesn't want to say that he's gay because clearly country music and all that kind of in the way I mean you can't you can now maybe in two thousand twelve\nKind of him but you might be gay but you're going to still be shut out of the country ... even Ricky Martin he's living will be the logo didn't want to say he was gay right you turn around and everything\nYou

trying to do the market out there trying to make it up still well that's the league manned yep yep oh\nWhy did I understand they're going to create a safer game but if you're going to make it to the point why play it\nWell you play by play because they make a lot of money\nAnd everything is money up into a product and it really doesn't that also doesn't care about the product people are going to watch it regardless they're worried about litigation and their money that's it I'm Still I just got a letter yesterday from the NFL disability thing for that for the concussion thing if you don't care\nIf you don't they make it so it's so you have to go out of your waste so much that the average person will stop doing it okay they'll say if you don't keep on getting tested you won't be able to you you could never get this money\nAnd you recently but three or four months away that long ago yeah way down to Fort Lauderdale first yes has the other people know that you and I go down to South Florida\nAnd I just I don't know if I failed or pass because they don't give you the result well yes they do get a result of the thing is if you get the money and that says it really means you failed okay so you don't I don't know if you don't want the money though so that's what's the ... that's the weird part of it but if five years down the line\nI still get a Google for cocoa puff than if I don't continue it I'm not eligible for it\nBut what they're going to do is they're gonna they're gonna style you out so now they're like all you have to go do some more testing it's in Columbus ohio
