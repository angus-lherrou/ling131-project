I was a prosecutor like Nineteen Ninety to Ninety three Ninety four twenty five something like it was it was it was like twenty\nTwo twenty two years ago yeah so I mean it's it's not that they they'll start out by asking if\nThey did ask if anybody's been committed a convicted of a crime or arrested they ask you to have been arrested and I said yes and then they are trying to get out of their ... on the front of you asked me what it was four I told him and uh I tried to do everything and\nThen they said they ask if you've been convicted right yeah yeah and then I'll tell you there's a funny story or you might hear and I were co counsel on a DUI case I was out of town on vacation and he he starts picking the jury but I'm not there is co counsel\nYet he tells the jury will die as my co counsel how many jurors\nStood up and said that there were a couple of Jersey set up that I listen to the show and it might influence my decision to have you with the heart of cutting out\nSo so so\nThey were all this qualifies as a dollar ... says where are\nYou I said I'm On vacation because he got to come back and tried to escape I got a lot of good like this one day I felt like that\nBut in all seriousness I wouldn't say you're not telling everybody that you promised you were gonna try to get high promise just six months ago when you've never told me when I was actually ... now Travis show every week you tell a lie that not drink some water [laughter]\nAll right this second was Roger you by about ...\n[noise] your family and now you're not that I Need a turning the center of all comers whether it's divorce alimony Sean support visitation its emotional go with your receipts and then he won three five one for one zero five eight you can also email season Jason at Vulcan bird lore group one word\nVulcan Berg law group dot com if he has his own show don't touch the dial it is illegal\nSo she has a show on one of two point five fill little real proof\nKeeps coming to live\n[noise]\nWaiting for my ... number four\nGood\nDay November second agendas line\nTuned to the Mike jump to show and one of those two point five doubled every day for all the latest fighting to get into each my counter punch ... number for November second agenda is lying in my\nBud Light and metro by the mobile when diamond let her have the ... you know it's a real deal and\nThe weekend and I can't get a lemon get savings door why finding all year play dirty money hero interest financing I can get into this election with all the industry designers lining their entire collection for anything on down three days a million dollars\nThe holiday leading certified diamond next week and November ...\nFront of his credit if your windshield break glass doctor first they'll fix the fast and they handle the insurance claim for you asked about this zero cost you your windshield replacement service in all ten bay area counties ... glass started dot com for informational repairing workplace in your when she saw the\n\nAnd um\nGreatest have got Jason bottom that evening\nReserve teeth on video now\n[noise]\nYour local ram dealer is committed to giving you a great deal and right now during rammed power days well qualified growing less use of competitive vehicles get a ... some of the all new twenty Nineteen ram Fifteen hundred big one group ... by two\nOr three Seventy nine bucks for thirty six months with three Seventy nine to assigning tax cut elections extra\nAnd when you go against that that is spectacular law enforcement al ... and and credit not only your department but also defined troopers and also the ah the police department as well and I think my understanding you guys all worked\nVery well together oh yeah we have great relationships and I never knew then I went to the FBI National Academy and and ... some of the different uh\nPartners around and I grew up with it for twenty seven years we take for granted here however works with state local and federal partners and it's not like that around the rest of the country a lot of places are made me ever true appreciation for how well and how great the partnerships aren't here in Tampa\nI question I have a question for shift roster and so if if there's some event and\nThere's going to be multiple jurisdictions for the sheriff's office T. P. D. F H. P. and everybody comes together who's actually in charge the sheriff is the chief law enforcement officer in Hillsborough County there's a new sheriff in town [laughter] good example as the seminal a shooter\nThat was in Tampa but that if if the FBI working together and\nAre in a city capitals in charge of that investigation now we lent some resources to them um and didn't need to be in front of the cameras at a cheaper brand new condemned and his men and women there\nAre there were a different uniform but at a conference the same goal and that's just to keep our county safe where you live in a city accounting no one is more concerned with anything else than just keeping us safe and that if anyone else there's there's a different priority then they're the wrong person I'm\nThinking about it think about what the sheriff said earlier giving people an opportunity through education through earning certificates are accomplishments of skills or or crafts or trade that can allow people to work and so our unemployment rate plays into it our economic development in our growth plays into it\nSafety plays into it we want to keep our kids safe you know but we also want to get to and from work and an efficient way get our goods and services back and forth so we can continue that all and I and I just think that you know my opponents out there saying that\nIf the GOP ... maintain control of the commission Hillsborough County will not survive don't don't don't talk about our sound effects\nAre kind of depends on the front and count down on us [laughter]\nSo it's like wait wait a minute what planet is she living on when we're looking at you know record record growth and were were things seem to be going in the right direction and I think it goes back to that old you know feel good test the what was the Ronald Reagan test what was the quote you know where you\nAre off today than your yesterday and I don't trust that verified I ... that was the same with Alexander ... No Child left behind that's a Reaganomics and Clinton quotes here [laughter] oh that's so back to the phones ...\nLoading or London Bob and Joe a lot of our from mispronouncing that please correct me you're on live without Saddam go ahead\n[noise] hey guys thank you for taking my call gentlemen and uh this is Lowden hum what my issue is is I received a check for money is at ... at the positive it and then it turns out that the check was from an act of the count basically\nYou know a not a check and I are charged a return sexy and is sure to seize on top of that so not only did I get ... get my uh my came it but I got charged\nThings on top of that now I was wondering I said already know the answer but is there any like Kelly or is this going to be a civil case\nWell you can take that down to the state attorney's office as they are worthless checked it but they have a special division worthless checked division and uh that is actually a a a crime that can be charged by the state attorney's office or I represent a lot of clients he Michael I think you've represented clients for these these I had a I just\nTell those clients don't pay by jak [laughter]\nWest county was [laughter]\nIt's funny I I joke but I actually one did pay me by ... they pay me cash initially they paid me by check\nA check bounced I became of victims of the same issue I was in front of the judge hold their heads I saw this as Mr fairy tale your withdrawn for what reason\nNah like I had I I I can write a book or I Believe and blaming the victim in your native for taking the chance I'm paid initially I Know there are still\nAround her she I Can't remember who it was they're going to bounce it back to their lawyer representing them for a worth checking and it was a conflict I\nHad to withdraw and they're real nice folks and you know the the court understood my predicament I couldn't continue but the carriage I told you got a good laugh\nIt was the only me that this stuff would

the other two you know I\nWas on the stand I was on the stand for three hours last week 'cause I'm I'm a witness for the state and the pending case but I don't know worthless jak now on the other thing that All right let me let me let me jump to buy that answer his question he can't go to the state attorney's office and then he can seek restitution as a victim of the crime or Bob you have a question about a bar complaint\nIran without Saddam go ahead\n[noise] [noise] yeah you get two minutes alternative tart\nReal fast let me know if I'm going to ... okay All right so I had a paternity action we moved to modify you know a year later a the parenting plan a we never made it to court but we did make it chambers\nI'm I hired a new attorney\nI'm paid as much money we went to chambers\nObviously I was there uh I personally I recall ... well on our behalf harbor side uh\nWhen was the issue I mean I just tell me what the problem is\nOkay so the parenting plan was modified the judge\nA to my recollection told us\nTo you know ... format reward adjust whatever the parenting plan and then re submitted for ... from both parties and a year later that has not been done contacted my legal you know my my attorney\nOr he said oh the other side was supposed to do the other side says oh you are supposed to do it and a year later it's never been done it's not on file a the fact that we're in court is on file the court orders not on file 'em and you know\nHaving a hat in an office appointment meeting with your lawyer\nA emails and in ...\nSo you know I Know you look them in the guy and you said what is it a problem and then they tell you whatever it is they tell you and then you leave ...\nA year and say that you know the other person was supposed to do it but there's no traction and there's no so currently I Am a bang laws of a modified parenting land that has never been filed with the county\nMhm I don't know if by following the rules that again I was there\nWhen I heard me 'cause I'm short on time and I want to get the job here here's what you need to hire different where if you're not happy you can complain about the lawyer you can't you go to afford a bar you know it's all regulatory authority you can certainly lodge a bar complaint I don't know I'm going to be sanctioned or not the number one\nUh area of practice that it leads embark complains is what I thought that well I'm sure it's family ... the biggest issue in those complaints as what lack of communication correct lack of I mean I'm not\nSure I think it might be public defender clients who are in prison died I'm telling you if that was the leading a if it's now you know what you're suggesting gets its overcome but I Know for the longest time it was always family law

I was at the vigil last night with a moving moving surface I hate that we live in a country where there's where there are still so much\nAnd it's not going to be tolerated here in Hillsborough County is is there special training now that that uh you're deputies and other law enforcement or going through so that everybody on the road is prepared for these active shooter situations because I think that you know people are thinking about him I going to be in a\nLike on a crispy cream and all of a sudden you know you know or or\nI think well some you know went into certain places probably a lot of people are carrying guns don't every every every year they go through\nExtensive training in our school resource step but he's they go through a week's worth of training and like I said now even the court house so absolutely that that's important to have to be able to just stop that threatened they have one goal and that goal is just to do whatever it takes to stop that threat and that's involved in Columbine\nThe training was you waited for their tactical units to get there then they said okay that that's certainly a is ridiculous you go in once you get three or four people and you go and now it's just it doesn't matter if it's you ten five five hundred people go in and stop that threat if you're by yourself you're gone and you're\nYou're not even at your own peril Hugo stopped that threat if you could say one child and one person you've done your job\nThat I think I I I didn't see all the news coverage but but I seem to to to recall hearing that I think for law enforcement officers went into the synagogue and and or or maybe more but I think four of them got injured without\nHesitation they they they ran and they're not going to make sure they have they gave all of them ceramic vest plates that they could throw on I gave him a long long guns or air fifteenth and make sure that they could match the force of the threats out there\nBecause if they're prepared and they have the proper equipment\nThey're not going to hesitate going in and stopping that threat what does a ceramic yes ceramic plate it's actually a ceramic ... played that can stop a much higher caliber of around and that's different than the than the regular army right they just do this on top and go you know our our our vest won't stop I think more than a forty five caliber\nYou know so they gotta they gotta have a better ballistic training and we make sure they had that so that ... that ceramic goes over the vest they already where ... they ... they can throw it on a ... I mean two seconds to put it on offer running ago\nAnd when you came on the show a A N I don't know if all maybe six months ago nine months ago now and I'm times fly on Halloween is tomorrow I Can't believe that you talk to us about\nImplementing a policy on having a deputy or along with the school resource officer or a deputy at every school or in Hillsborough County I Know that there was some you had to your budget issues yet manpower issues how how has that process gossip protect our children\nGoes back to the partnerships you were talking about and we weren't the first ones to go out and you know there's a lot of different shares were out there and blaming the school board the school board was blaming a county commissioner was pointing fingers\nWe sat down we worked out a very realistic plan or light years ahead in Hillsborough County we already have deputies or police officers and every middle school high school so it was only the elementary schools that we had to contend with\nWe have a great school security system so what we did is I can bring them in under the um the guardian program I wasn't I wasn't interested in bringing an administrator or a teacher or a janitor and under the guardian program I was one hundred percent opposed to it\n... our teachers have too much to deal with already now we're going to make them tactical operators\nBut now I felt comfortable with the great service that school security provides they go through the extensive psychological testing we were talking about the background check and having a turtle fair so you have that compliance and there's not Joe security guard hires his buddy Andy messes up no one cares you have you know there's there's no recourse of any type of action\nSo with the six point seven million dollars in additional funding we got from the safe schools act it covered a school security officer and every elementary school and and we trained them and I had to encourage the the cost and the manpower of giving them providing them a hundred and forty two hours or train\nBut I think we have a phenomenal option they're already there are a couple that didn't didn't make it through the training we just say hey listen it's automatic if we didn't feel that that ... didn't feel that they were ready to protect the schools and protect the kids we've asked the school to the school system in place them somewhere else or do what they want with them that we didn't feel comfortable\nBut uh we have a great plan I we thought it would be a whole entire school year\nAnd we think by the beginning of the new year that all the all the deputy sheriff super temporary sign there the Tampa police officers they will be back to their a normal tours of duty and we will be up and running\nI'll tell you there is a police officer unit a three doors down from my law office every day my offices in Hyde Park I Am three doors from Goree elementary and every day I see that squad car there are all see the officer at there is a sense of\nA of a of calm you know when I drive by say and I always think to myself and I remember our conversations on our I remember what what we're talking about now we were talking about the way back when when you came in to this administration and I always think to myself\nI'm proud feeling to have them there if God Forbid anything like that happen at a school here in our county\nKids have so much to worry about these days they don't need to worry about being educated if they don't feel safe you know if they're hungry or they don't feel safe they don't care what's being taught to them\nA same with teachers you know we we have to make the the school rooms are safe and I think it's my biggest priority I had to make sure that the children this county are safe\nIn in regards to safety uh at the time he jumped to you real quick as a candidate for a county commissioner has this issue come up on on the campaign trail and how you've addressed it with with those issues\nWell actually my opponents been critical of having school resource officers and I'm a extra security in the schools and and um made a comment about our schools being pipelines prisons and things like this and\nAnd there's radical groups that have endorsed or that you know oppose this as well and you know my position as you just started the sheriff\nHe and the officers there for us and and really the the times that no one else but the officers could come in and really do what they do and they keep kids safe\nSo we need to be there for them it's not just talk her rhetoric it's kids' lives it's true um sense of safety and security and I think that's part of what the sheriff has done to do a fantastic job to help Hillsborough County continue to be successful\nIn around these different schools and then some of these elementary schools\nThese kids can't come to school or at least school without hugging the school resource deputy goodbye I even saw someone posted something on social media the day\nThat the little boy had to get the same haircut as the air so you know I I Would certainly contend that\nThe kids feel safe you know I hear some people talking about yeah but there's a there's a gun on campus the kids that you know it's not about that they see that safety and security they know they come into that school when they're say matter of fact they tell their parents I Can't go to class until or I Can't go home and so I I say hello or go by that definition well you don't want it as\nA job I mean of interacting with the kids on their level they're not just their\n... their training that that they are taught how to deal with children and that's a part of that block yes a lot of it's active shooter but the uniqueness that comes along with you in a child and and they're doing a beautiful job\nBut you know it it's really the new norm when I when I went through a to a a elementary school and I was in the ... ah public schools at that point um we didn't have a any any law enforcement officers\nUm I felt safe but you know I don't think the kids today know what it was before so so it's the new norm but you know I I think it's it's it's one one thing for for the kids to embrace law enforcement I think there's a level of\nCuriosity you know that they see law enforcement they see the gun they see the handcuffs they see the uh the the squad car there's that level of curiosity it's the same thing with any social monitored or you know a fire and rescue were paramedics the kids the kids are inquisitive\nThey want to know um but if I'm the flip side is it's unfortunate it's unfortunate because you know it just I'm ... I'd like I like I like my kids to be able to to to go to school and know that they're safe without having to have an armed armed officer there and\nAnd and the third largest security has evolved and I don't think any of us like it but think about going to the airport to travel you didn't walk through magnet magnetometer as you know then you had to after nine eleven then someone brought a shoe bomb is real sick her shoes off\nAnd then someone brought a different bomb in a liquid so we all had to carry deodorant that we could put on you know one slight and had to go buy some more you know security has had devolved I hate the fact that we're in that type of you know security minded a society\nBut you're exactly right we we have to acclimate and we have to evolve to and it was time for our school system to acclimate involving we still have we still have some work to be done you know with with\nIn security single entry and exit points and I hope we don't get to a point where our children have to go to the magnetometer is it get to school you know we none of us want to think about that but if it's a step that we have to take her up across precaution that we take to make sure that uh guns not introduced into the school you know show me the person that's not going to be a proponent of that\nBut one of the other aspects that I've heard is including veterans are retired police officers are especially if there's a known threat that's on the radar because you can bring in through a cost effective means an additional group who are trained bonded or who are approved by the sheriff for example\nThat could bring an additional level of security like some of the shootings that have happened there were intense\nUm levels that the ... of awareness and threats and things that could have been helped by bringing additional like an intense focus that say for two or three weeks and so that threat levels addressed so to provide additional security I think that's something that\nAnd they found out there's no reason for this person to be corrected\nWell so folks in Italy and that's that's where there's only one day left you wouldn't want somebody to our laws and\nIt started and one evening and then it carried over through the evening to the second that well\nYou can certainly though they can retain council to challenge the the Baker act uh if if someone is a danger themselves with the community I Know a march men act is also a different type of act that they can do you can have a ... a lawyer ...\nDoes do those I've ... I've got Baker act but you'll have to go you know it's kinda crazy it 'cause it's not Seventy two hours they will 'cause all the hearing to six or seven day and you can't you can't get them out no idea until you have a hearing so so they'll hold them well beyond seven or eight hours oh yeah yeah um well they can\nThey can also released some earlier if they find that there's no\nYeah no and that's where we're at now\nAnd that's and that's typically what the what the hospitals are going to do that they're going to do evaluations they decide that they they don't need to be bankrupt or they're going to let them go after a couple of days um but if you want to hearing 'em you gotta you gotta get council and you've got to ask for the hearing and they'll give a hearing about this and what have you ever had\nThan I Am um we're we're in the second day right now and the two people that have done the interview a calculated that there is no\nReason for this it's basically a lesson desirable person is called about an X percent and said hey this person said that they claim that they were going to hurt themselves and that was never the case\n... to your forty eight hours and there's people that evaluated him in the hospital that says this person probably shouldn't be there to the hospital folks recommend release\nYes they did\nOkay so that that point in time that needs to be parlayed that into the the courts or it's a law enforced\nWell I ... ... ... what I tell\nYou the theoretical well I I Know but ... but Bob straight it because I understand what he's saying yeah I understand what you're saying because you're you're going through the legal process you still have to abide by the legal process all the legal process may not be the most efficient\nBut you know you know I had to deal with ... with my dad\nAnd uh uh about three years ago now and I'm\nThe moment they they they realize that okay he's we don't need to hold them then they let him go\nSo the question is are they going to do that here or is there a process where attorney has to be involved is\nProbably have Bob wants to ... well you know fortunately for me you know I told him I said I'm going to ask for hearing he does meet the criteria like no you're right he doesn't meet the criteria you can come pick them up tomorrow so that they were by the way that say hey and that doesn't meet the criteria let them go you know the hardest thing was I knew he was there\nAnd I called up and I said you know I Need to talk about my dad like whoa who's your dad as well I gave him his name\nBut ... we don't know who they say well I I Know you're doing that for example but actually I Do know that he's there and I'm I'm his lawyer so who can I packed my notice of the parents too so that you guys met that he's there and and they told me here here's what you do I backed him a notice of parents and sure enough then they would talk to me and that's what so Bob ... a different\nThat's looking at it from a different angle what I'm Talking about us let's say Joe slow as thin they corrected by his ex girlfriend and there was no less for it what it what recourse does Joe smokers that's not me but Joe slow has\nFor fall super them into you're talking about or some type of like you know if they oughta ... right well I I mean you can ...\nCourses and actually actually you could probably be because they'll turn around that there'll be a medical costs associated with being Baker act that you could probably turn around and sue them uh for the uh for the financial aspect\nOf having to pay the environment of defense would have to be there was a well founded believe that the individual is going to be harmful to themselves or others he's saying what he knows independently that he has to prove that this is the other person was I was actually I haven't heard of it on ...\nI've never heard of a statute for false a Baker active and might exist there's certainly a false report to law enforcement sure but I've never heard false bay correct I've never know about it that's a great question I don't know the answer the call call call call legislators all everybody that's been coming on the uh the show and tell them to to to put it in the\nBill out of similar to that question was attorney general Bill McCollum back in the day about the same issue was false filings for injunction isn't it takes multiple false filings to even get to the point where you can get to somebody that is what I was wondering should be for\nFalse accusations from another party was over and over and it had happened three times before I\nEchoes of the importance of protecting people in that situation in public now Amazon yeah sure exactly so then they err on the side of caution and nominate ...
