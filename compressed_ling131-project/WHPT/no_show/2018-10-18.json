folks know if there is an ongoing litigation I've talked to I cannot comment on it but I couldn't understand what the hell he was saying it [laughter]\nI'd be honest I don't even know what the hell was that question number three you are [laughter] so what what county are they from close to right the cowbell she's she's getting it down [laughter] yelling at screams any on a on a second look we'll

the next caller which is which is you\nOkay great thank you appreciate you guys taking my call absolute um so I was I'm a ... a well let me see her a friend of mine was\nA luxury [laughter] I'm not really a friend of a friend he's got his ... or my second and our other [laughter] yeah and somebody\nHe was recording guy there was acting out in the mall and I'm a may or may not have grabbed his cell phone and throwing it on the ground so my question as a sort of my friend is illegal\nOkay well I Want to I mean as my friend going to get in on me now I mean not me not to my ... going to get in trouble for that I\nI Will you'll to my a guest in Studio before I answer I don't even understand the question well what happens or someone grabs someone cell phone allegedly and threw it on the ground because they probably got past that they were being videotaped it in a mall yep\nA here they are they were videotaping them doing something that was whatever they were doing so the question is\nIs that in essence a crime and then I'll be able to you Mike and then I Will follow up absolutely okay so absolute looking at probably a misdemeanor if if the value though as less if the ... well ... it depends what the water\nInterject here and ask you if you're alone it man whoa oh was it a police officer [laughter]\nIf they took the phone the value of the phone is greater than three hundred dollars and the damage that um it could actually take possession has asked poor patient it snapped 'em if they damaged the phone now you're looking at uh the uh whether or not it's\nA misdemeanor value to to fix the phone or a felony value\nUm for for um a criminal mischief so there there there's a number of crimes there that that are potential there was a a\nUS Senator who grabbed the phone or South Carolina senator I think a Purdue who grabbed the phone to the student threw it on the grounds mass wasn't that reason there's yeah two days ago\nBut yeah so but I remember a ... it has to be damaged you know sometimes things can you know be shoved in someone's face and you you you're violation of one's privacy ones you know we'll immediate area and if you you know move that out of the way you know there is also has to be a criminal intent men's radio\nThere has to be involved there with the senator in this example of course I don't know really the facts in that particular case but you've got to look at all of the the surrounding circumstances to determine whether or not a crime actually committed or not\nAnd would that being said now moved to Tom who's our DUI color of the evening Tom ... as to what county are you in Tom\nSo Hank you don't know about ... hours and hours county fire take part in Iowa that I I've been in ... county for the past two days dealing with a DUI matter so what what's your question that you have for me go ahead sir\nSo I have a friend who has gotten a DUI about it's about ... came up with an ongoing um DUI battle and it was because that's you know marijuana was involved as well\nOkay so my question\nYou know get an apartment of my own get a car that actually worked because when I went to school I drove this Ford fairly and that had like a table cloth over the front seat\nAnd I called my um my two gallon challenge because I Would put two gallons of water in the back seat of the car\nUm and I would drive the ACC and eat more campus and I would by the time I got there the radiator was overheated\nSo I Would go to class I Would wait for the radiator to cool down lift up the hood put the gallon of water in and then go home and I did that for six months because I just didn't have the damn money to fix my car I mean that's just the kind of life I Lived and so\nWhen I passed and I went for the state board and started making real money or not real money but certainly a living wage and um I was able to buy a car and start making car payments and live in a\nA place that was better and you know lifted our family and then I'm working for this provision center in east like mall if anybody remembers east like most been gone a long time now but I'm fifty in Hillsborough\nAnd they decided they were going to franchise their store so I went home I told them I'm I'm like oh I think I'm gonna lose this job I Love this job I loved the store but\nThey're going to sell it out from underneath me so my mom that same woman that worked in that ... that factory for Thirty years she'd put away\nA stock from her company for like twenty five years so she had this stack of stocks that we went to the bank and she put that up for collateral and they gave me alone and you know overnight I went from\nSigning the back of a pay check to signing the front of the other day and feeling the San Diego's a damn good job and I also learned about inventory profits and losses I learned about paying others before I paid myself and I learned about struggling but I loved it\nI Love being in control of my own destiny I knew that the harder I work the better the results and um that's where I got my START I just worked and then went to work in health care and always worked on campaigns\nHelping people get elected I did a lot of judges races I did Baba corns race I did all a buck horse races I was his campaign manager and never thought that I Would be on this side of\nOf campaigning but a seat came available I'm Mike ... was a soldier and he had this seat in the house and he was picked to go in and he was appointed to the Pentagon for big position so it left a seat open with a two month election cycle and I thought well heck\nI can do this for two months I've been campaigning for others for many months so Iran and I won and it's been the most rewarding job that I have ever had in my life but I just wonder do great when I go on to that house floor and I\nSee all the majesty of the house floor I think of like my grandparents and my great grandparents who sat in rural tobacco for ten hours at a table the sacrifices they made they left their homes and came to this America became citizens were very proud never asked a dime of anyone\nSo when I think about them and I think about working families across this city I'm In this county I always vote with them in mind because I Know where I came from and I will never forget where it came from\nAnd now you're taking a bad experience growing up here or else you're taking your time in the Florida House you now are running a campaign for as a group Eighteen in the Florida Senate\nYes okay it's district Eighteen in the Florida Senate I well I'm not finished you know I Am just

[laughter] I like ... [laughter] you're\nReally going to be there really means that house that has the least amount of member\nBut you know when you're the leader of alpha dogs because none of those members got to Tallahassee because their followers they're all alpha dogs so if you can figure out how to herd alpha dogs and convince them to follow you that you are freaking amazing and that's what I did when I was\n... I I've I'll tell you what before I get to the calls 'cause I Know I've got gene uh Dave in air and they're holding\nIf I Know there are a lot of issues and I know we have some more time for you is there a big issue that is on the forefront of your mind as you are are waging this Senate campaign that your your all your issues are important so I don't want to diminish no your care\nBut I Will tell you what it's at the forefront in my opinion that is public school funding infrastructure funding I had a teacher a Tampa Bay elementary that sent me a picture of her thermostat today\nUm you know she has third grader sitting in a classroom to eighty eight degree Omar and none of us would want to work in a building and then I hear people tell me they say oh well I went to school there was no air conditioning well so did I but the school that I went to\nUm had windows that were open and a big fan in the back these guys are sitting in hot boxes the windows for security are closed shut\nSo there are no options when the air is not working and we just have diverted to many dollars away from our public schools we have to get our priorities straight we got to fund these schools we got to fix this\nUh we got to fix the infrastructure a an air conditioner replaced in a high school is ten million dollars we just don't have that money because we haven't made um education of priority we have reserves we should be\nTaking care of our structures taken care of our students we allocated a out of an eighty billion dollar budget we allocated forty seven cents per student increase last year\nOmar ... well ... that's a very a very good a primary concern for your campaign or I certainly hope that resonates with voters a cat where where are we the order of folks\nAh we we would go top to bottom but I'd\nPrefer if we could just go to break records a short break from right wing okay well just got to keep me straight on the time\nAnd the sun was brought to you by ... specializes in treating patients that have been injured divide high yield imaging open MRI X rays cat scans aired ultrasound their social located here in the very to serve you you can reach them and he won three eighty six\nNine nine nine nine or ...

representative a jak cruises with the house now looking to get into the Senate a so question kind of for both is there any issues as far as school security you know pushing for more budget you how are we looking on that front ... representative here first\nWell you know there was a Parkland bill that passed in that are provided some money although it would be somewhat of an an funded mandate it said that we have to fortify our schools and um\nIf you think a lot of us don't think about the rural areas but some of those schools in the rural areas don't even have\nYou know they don't have fences around them the way we see them here in the urban areas so it's some of that it's a lot of 'em for defying schools and it's\nIt's a sad state of affairs that that's what we're looking at um especially since we are forty seven in the nation for\nUm funding our public school I did not know that like we we are at the bottom I'm for teacher pay and for funding our school last year um eighty billion eighty three billion dollar budget and we allocate it forty seven cents per student\nUm increase and that's less than given inflation rates that we had in two thousand ten\nYou know if we want to be a thriving community where corporations\nAnd bring good paying jobs to our community and opportunities\nThe first thing they look at our ... is the quality of the public schools because they know that they cannot attract talent unless there are public schools that are thriving and\nHave a ratings and you know we need to take a look at this we're just not funding our public schools the way that we should and now we have a referendum\nThat says because we had diverted money to for profit corporate schools now we're going to go to the people that ask them to give us more in a referendum and and I hope that it passes because there are lots of I I Know there are lots of schools that are ah\nThat are unfounded and you know people want to blame eat Jess ... and they want to blame the Hillsborough County but listen he was handed a pot of money from the legislature and ... and says do with it what you will this money for salaries is is not instructional\nAnd this is for um repairing schools now we pay a millage I'm a which is a tax of our taxes and the ... and in two thousand test\nAnd we were we were giving the public schools to mills\nI'm On a county bases and the state said look we're in a recession so we're going to take a half a male away from a structural you know dollars and we're going to take a half and all of that and put it towards salaries so that we can make this budget\nAnd when you say half a meal you're talking about a percentage point not half a million dollars so folks folks listening you thought five hundred thousand it's the ...\nNFL we're going to take a half of a point of mental edge and we're going to move you move to salaries and instructional salaries but we're going to give it back to you when the economy recovers so the economy recovers and we never get that half a mail back to the schools\nTens of millions of dollars that could be used for air conditioning repairs structure repairs taking let out of our schools and it was never returned\nSo once you get you lost it because of the circumstances they get better you can't gain it\nBack yeah and then they they hand our superintendent a this budget say make it work\nAnd then some people want to come back and say well you know they're not managing it well well they're doing the best that they can they're they're working at funding levels that are\nTwo thousand three two thousand four it's just we really have to refocus we need to refocus legislature on 'em enough money to educate our kids well\nAnd that's why I'm Glad you folks took the time to come on tonight real quick Barbara's been holding out of Sarasota Barbara thank you so much for holding your on without Saddam what's your legal question [noise]\n[noise] barber are you there [noise] uh yes you fasted\nDom thanks so much for holding how're you doing sweetheart\n[noise] good uh we got a question I'm Adam ... got a letter from the state I didn't take Les ... how long have we seen the kind of a PPO and you can take a clash\nOkay so you have a business purpose only license and your your question is are well do you have well a little more information you charge which something what was the reason you're white\n... oh okay what is pending like I ...\nI had a I have a lawyer and like they pulled me over for eating and like they had like daylight but I didn't do anything [noise]\nOkay I argue pending is are pending any ... blood results breath resolve lab results\n[noise] um any any of this stuff so I don't know there's nothing there just waiting like they keep pushing it off\nWell can I ask you this do good my great sounds to me like she refused everything did you refused the breath test [noise] yup\nSo she got suspended for the refusal that and so she's driving on a beep you or the question is did she wave her right to the hearing did they request to hearing it the DMV and she's on the forty two day permit there are some other questions we need a\nI have whatever it's like ... ... because I had to go down to like the board or whatever and\nSay you have a hard if the ice and she said to me it sounds to me like she ... she doesn't have the ... when I was like what he waved end of the condition of the Web or you have to enroll in to the Y. school but you've got to\n... go to they had in ... and how long\nYou got to get well you have to enroll in that and then you've got to take the first class available is what I tell my quite well in order to get the the permit ... she uh she already had to have in ... in rural show show should proven role night she was supposed to have a pre determined de da de ... de\nI like what the Bible as like I had a lot of issues going on and I couldn't get there because they have like you have to have a role and you have to like go down there and like extra AOL okay however it worked\nWell you got like you got a complete now it's not as if you're not an admission you've got to complete the level one do you watch ...\nIf she does in complete denial that you complete the school when she was supposed to they'll notify Tallahassee that you didn't attend and complete but how long\nDo you have in between\nThe ... the casinos are her question her cases laughing so long\nAnd it was nothing to do this her but but the suspension the beep you or nothing to do with the criminal case this is simply a condition of of the waiver she had to sign up for DUI school and she has to attended and she has\nBut it will answer six months is it nine months of the twelve months to question and I how long it takes for that and here's an I don't know if we know the answer because it depends on when it's reported from the local DMV to Tallahassee the department of I was ... and then back down before the waiver before the Web or used to\nBe a couple of months hold on hold on one second okay oh we used to be\nThat they had to enroll in completed within Ninety Days\nBut now with the waiver typically I'm In I don't know if this is in Sarasota so that's why\nI'm I'm the policies from went off to the next or actually a little bit different in Hillsborough County they make you come in with the date that you've requested Sarasota is controlled by the ... county office and apparently they don't have the same requirements are issuing the ah\nThe temporary permits or the BP oh on just proved enrollment without coming in with his best by date\nUm I Would say that if you don't get it done ASAP I wouldn't even wait the Ninety Days I say if you don't get it done um tomorrow sign up and get it done you're going to\nBe and here's another short answer Barbara call the folks down to the DMV being served so to say hey guys when it gets to spend my life there\nAren't going to say oh well you haven't completed it that you're going to do they're going to send it up there\nAnd then you know the clocks gonna ride sometimes you don't know the answer you just run right to the source but my actually mine was good in in in the post office or they're they're uh they're they're just spoke to live there was a very nice folks actually I like dealing with the county or the deal they listen to the folks are are you ready to sing

of course a is Janet Cruz two thousand Eighteen dot com is that glass that is correct so if you want to learn more about those campaigns\nAnd of course about their platforms are outside of all of the information they've been so nice to give on the show tonight you can go to those Web sites I wanted to ask you I Know why we're off the break you were talking about some topics here I'll I'll jumped you real quick here filled with your\nA district fifty eight you were talking a little bit about some things that were concerning about schools and obviously you're histories and educator or any other issues on the forefront at least for your district as you campaign to those folks listening here tonight\nMy big another big thing in our district is since we are our district encompasses temple terrace in Plant City so we are of a tale of two cities in our district and another issue seems to be going around that I hear a lot of um the campaign trail is the top down\nAnd the big footing the those are smaller government and if you're a victim how Tallahassee will try to dictate to them or what they need to do or if they want to do something like temple terrorists want him to outlaw plastic bags and Tallahassee told them they could not do that\nUm for the fact the Tallahassee is always trying to step down and tell the smaller government always what's going on and what to do [noise]\nUm I I think that that needs to go way with me they need to have they're making their own decisions for their own towns around through these so there should be able to do\nThat well that's an interesting point and I really appreciate your bringing that up I haven't heard that one very often or talked about that issue on the show which is one of the reasons why I was excited to have you guys come on tonight then you had a question I think for our um our representative here about an issue that was on your mind\nYeah and I think it's just sort of a a smaller example of a bigger problem of when you know Seventy percent of or Seventy plus percent of people in Florida vote to ah legalized medical marijuana and expand the licenses but\nUm since the past they have an extended one new license or to a organizations to open a stores um uh I think the only ones that had were the ones who originally had it for a kid seizures and in CBD but what's the holdup and what\nWe know they created a monopoly and they did that intentionally um they're only X number of licenses and X number of growers and that in my opinion it's wrong and I mean it's [noise]\nYou know we are moving this is the first step toward legalization and perhaps recreational use it may take time in Florida for that to happen but\nI think that we're moving in that direction and I think the problem here is let's take an ABC liquor store for example you know we put ABC liquor stores and they follow regulations and they do what they have to do to be regulated but\nYou know I hear people talk in Tallahassee\nAll the time about free market I hear them talk constantly about free market free market free market and the truth of the matter is is rather than all this regulation um\nLet the market ... itself I mean you won't see you know we we see a CBS in a Walgreens across the street from each other but somewhere along the line at a club rates I don't know who we we are to think that we should regulate to\nA specific number of dispensaries and they could be many miles away from someone who has a license and you know now the excuses well we can deliver it's ridiculous I mean it is a monopoly created to make more tight millions of dollars for just ... episodes\nIn a matter of crony so it was it a matter of holding up licenses who uh give new licenses so those who had license who spend millions in getting those license get a head start in the marketplace\nBasically exactly\nEverything they're always talking about capitalism and how capitalism will make ... make a product cheaper how will make it more available and here they are capitalism is all about but yet it with this issue or not about being\nTrained just like me to Seventy percent of the people voted and because of the voter sure what about the concerned that there might be some sort of abuses we are talking about\nUm\nIllegal drugs ... and ... ... talking about a very large\nPotential um um financial a\nArena here I mean there's obviously if it becomes legalize will be a lot of money involved I mean is not always legalize recreational you're talking about uh but but just it seems to me that a lot of the the regulations are in place because of the perceived abuse that that that's going to go on if if they let the free market take over I mean I I don't know\nWell you know there we have a lot of work to do on this before we look at marijuana on a recreational basis you know we have to address\nIn the same way we have to take a look at someone for a DUI [noise] um we are going to have to figure out effective um affordable testing if we told someone over there so\nMany pieces of this puzzle that we need to put together but the will of the vote 'em that are in the state of Florida we voted\nOverwhelmingly things they've been ignored for medical marijuana and and it's been intentional I mean you know we we have had\nA a a governor in office that has that has continued to under fund that department intentionally they are so overwhelmed and under staffed and it is intentional\nI had a client that came to me not a client a constituent that came to me in the office sent in his went to see the doctor sent in all of his paperwork sent in\nA money order um cold and cold and called for months and they were like well we don't know where your money order as we can help you know\nI'm again did it again again couldn't you know it wasn't until I called in intervene um that that that that individual's medical marijuana card\nFinally was moving forward and if anyone needs help they're welcome to call my office because I Am happy to call and apply the pressure we actually um\n...

investing and things and then made even more money but he's not stop he hasn't stopped working even though he's a billionaire now he's still works and then drive so yeah he came up with that one great idea I Know you're saying he worked for that I get it\nBut it's kind of the same concept but he got I don't know how much from pay pal initially but it was quite a bit and he turned that into billions at this point\nYeah but again he started that himself that was his own enterprise it either if I've made it if I did it had a business that made a million dollars and they turned that million into a billion like at that point it becomes a game because you're just challenging yourself but if you just suddenly become a billionaire overnight\nI feel like you're really not going to appreciate that

chase or how is that like you got that she wanted and now you're like OK well now I Do\nI think though that I initially I'd be like screw this I'm Out but I think I Would come back to it\nI think he would do I think you would you I mean you've got to do something what are you gonna do all day just stuff that like what just jerk off all day like I I don't know what would you do\nI I I think I Would just hang out\nFor a little ... you would hate that I Would join anybody would hate that he ... maybe like two weeks ... done I mean honestly if I Walk into a lot of money all of a sudden like

there's something about it that gives us purpose\nI don't know if we're biologically designed to do work I Would say actually were probably more of the opposite that were designed to be lazy that were designed to conserve energy we don't want to work but it was like in order to survive you had to chase the heard you had\nTo gather arm sure that's hard work plowing fuel actually were most of our ah

I don't want to say I steer clear of the whole like social movements stuff I'm so sick of hearing about like me too and I'm so sick of hearing about like toxic masculinity\nBut it feels like I'm more masculine position because he's dealing with a car crashes the gunshot wound right he's in a really series in the ER as opposed to being in the geriatric ward or the kids or where you're kind of just wiping but sure you know it's a little different would that make any difference to you\nYeah absolutely and it's funny because they interview the wife of the male nurse and she says when she tells people that her husband is a nurse they often ask if he has some sort of specialty\nI I guess that's more of like a a dog like a hierarchy thing like oh and she's always in cardiology and they go oh okay like they think he's like more qualified or more closer to the level of a doctor or something like that\nUm but yeah if they were ... ... if it I guess it's sort of depends also what they're dealing with perhaps like you said he said a lot of it was very similar to the military and stuff like that because he said when he was working at the hospital this is the male nurse it they feature in the episode he said his first day on the job working as a security guard at the hospital\nHe saw two people come in on PCP and he had to like hold them down and the nurses that old him down and the doctor had at the data and they said there was a lot of action and he said this is this is kinda fun this is exactly what I'm looking for and this is what being a nurse is all about than everybody else has it all wrong because it's\nAction packed yeah I think it's just because it's one of those you have to be carrying and compassionate and that's just not really a a male featured trait you know that's kind of more being a mom be carrying about ... care of something in a in a direct fashion so men kind of indirectly they'll provide resources\nRight income not so much emotional ocean all yeah\nJust feels a not inappropriate but just not it's not just the it's not a manly thing to do I'm I'm\n... I'm trying to be careful with my words it 'cause I'm not sure if it's like ... ... inmates Li like that or if we've somehow sort of a sign it's\nYou know through socializing I'm sure it's a bit of both um because like if you are to talk about like say men cry do they cry less because they have\nLess or just a cry or they cry less because their shamed if they do sort of a thing maybe it's a combination of both sometimes I think it's like I don't want to say runaway selection but it's like you're more inclined than men are less inclined to cry and women are\nMore inclined to cry but say that they're the averages are pretty close to each other but then if you're socialized to go in those opposite direction the averages are much farther apart\nWhen in reality if left alone without socialization there would be much closer together which I feel like is often the case with a lot of sort of female male typical behaviors yeah\nThat's why when they say all this stuff is I don't know taught the systematic and we're taught these things I just feel like it's just in us that we just do the ... naturally let's just what we\nAre again it's it's it's both I I Would say it's both I say the absolute they at wow absolutely there are biological differences and they've even showing this was um I forgot the type of money that they were using I Want to say given 'em but like even female monkeys are more inclined to play with\nDolls than the male monkeys or and they're not socialized to play with or play with dolls or without dolls but they gravitated more to those sorts of things that were soft and things that they could play with in touch versus the male monkeys which I think gravitated more towards the sort of ah\nLike I don't want to say like like the the trucks and stuff like that\nThey are maybe like puzzles or at your own stay well 'cause this\nWell\nHello you're on stay well would you like to say words course okay go ahead sir you're on the ... ...\nWhat you guys with male nurse\nWhat we would call or are you where are you a nurse or not a nurse\nYou guys are nurses two thousand okay how do you ... can I ask if you were a straight man of course\nOkay um how do the lady folk yeah how do you how do you feel about yourself have has your\nMasculinity ever been in question by your male friends or have you ever coming into trouble or problems with women not finding your old very masculine have they had issues with it will tell us a little bit about your story\nUm well no I didn't marry the hold on a ... okay I'm I'm never had any issues with that but of course you know you you you get the uh oh you're a nurse\nMhm here died from\nDo you are just not care anymore or\nHow to do that are okay like whatever I'm making twice as much as your earlier there you go girl who is a full year a hundred percent I looked at it\nAnd you enjoy the work do you actually like you enjoy being a nurse right the actual care yes okay then that's awesome see just kind of ignore the haters and just enjoy the money\nYeah delivering do you think your for you to work in a year or so you\nMight see some action or their how many other male nurses do you work with\nA man the emergency department is probably about seven eight thirty mostly goes\nWhy okay is it a ... I guess it's just more like a physical labor intensive sort of thing\nThough I just think it's your most guys that go into nursing end up and you're just because of ... care unit is\nKind of stuff just because I don't know because it's more than just you know when or\nThose kind of things you know K I understand but as far as like\nYou know ... ... you know to go stuff\nRight I got ya All right well as long as you enjoy it and you're making that money than who the hell ... paper son with Meg Ryan you so much for calling him and we appreciate it\nRight by\nThe recall it was all [laughter] I'm like I said here do you want to call her my some of the new what's going on a Seventy seven five seven nine one or two five or eight hundred seven seven one one or two five it's funny 'cause it ... it really doesn't go on\nThe other direction like I don't feel like guys would be weird it out or they would think a woman is less feminine if if they found out she was like an IT or an engineer or something like that you'd\nBe like a mechanic if there was a woman and I'd be like a winding women yeah I Would assume she was a lesbian I write for 'em but I but also\nIf you were to look at her and she was super hot whatever it doesn't matter what she's doing as long as she ... she looks feminine doesn't matter what her job title is or if she's a mechanic or if she works at home depot\nAren't you a mom you're you're hot mom and take care of you oh jeeze [laughter] I'm just kidding ...

like I Need to know more no that's the that's the first I Know but I'm just saying like I feel like I Need to know more about this guy would need the\nThe last episode I liked what he did at the very end with the other guy out I was hoping that was going to happen I was like\nOK respect you know what I mean yeah it's a it's it's a good show it's called Mr in between it's on a FX\nSome people told me they didn't like the first episode and watch I watch all and they're only about forty minutes long\nAnd I think they're half hour or so or they go quick but there it's really enjoyable and some people have said that they had to put the subtitles on does their Australian and they're actually I didn't think it was that bad now there are a couple of things where you're like man I don't know a a Jim good morning or the Mike how the show\nHey like a I think that the Lakeland city commissioner actually all of that story\nNow duty on there I asked a day when we talked about the fact that he can do this unless he owns a store if he owns ... but even in this case he's wrong he's never going to be\nOh hell yeah I think now on my thing that you're reporting it that he doesn't own it and he didn't stop and all that stuff he does all this story all everything that's in the store\nAlso it also makes jokes funny or that if you didn't know I ... a here's how I use or a\nI Would imagine that on his lawyers gonna say I his lawyers say shortly before he tried to exit he was swinging the hatchet and\nWhether or not they can prove either way we'll find out and I think you're right but also and and I think it was an extreme and I think that that's a necessary but at the same time for yourself and Mr done situation\nAnd he's sick of being robbed and he got to deal with these people and he's had to work and he's got all the alarms installed and he's done everything right and you had people are still robbing you see where the frustration comes at a\nAnd you know I just say thank God this guy was in a black because then there's the world would be All right oh yeah yeah why all white man is huge black guy who tried to steal eight dollar ... I'm ... I I think it's a matter of\nOf human a respect for the one is saying I don't respect German stealing the other ones like respect my stuff respect my family respect my wife has come in there's still no matter what it's worth you can't do that and this guy gets frustrated me get sick of all we've all been there and I'm not making excuses for him and he can't\nAs much as I'd like to join our fantasy world I'd like to shoot all about road guys my head to try to steal well a pack of gum from a store you can't you can't do it now listen gallon if you think people are laying about an icon gotta\nIn third grade when that guy pushed me I Wish I could go back to punish people live with that stuff forever you know at this guy should have done that post blown come in undercover and market has started nobody would ever I\nWrite about an ad on an island that I don't know you are your ... going into Danny good morning on the show\nYeah the other guy kinda stole my thunder as far as the you know hey

I live I get creatively where you're coming from but how scared every new audience I loved it and what's the point I mean you're not how do you know when you have\nTo you know what it did you think it's counterintuitive to have not have an audience and they wanted the bus an audience out they were going to build bleachers around me and I said no you're missing the point\nAs much as I Love the audience an audience can be a slave when you're doing comedy because when you're a comedian you're always listening for the laugh yeah that's your cue that you you did a good joke and then you can move on\nAnd I put myself in an arena where I have no barometer I have no gauge\nAnd I'm just gonna keep rambling I'm going to go off there's no one to stop me from saying what I Want to say if I Want to keep expanding\nOn a theme or a joke or a line I'm just going to roll I have no barriers yeah so it was very liberating and it was very free to be up there was an uncomfortable and it wasn't at all I loved it uncomfortable to watch I don't think I mean it's hard for me to watch it myself like I'm really happy with it but\nIf this last gentleman call is an indication yeah it sounds like they got really got it yeah and I I think we did it right and that's why you know it really went out on a limb to do it and take a lot of chances and and to hear that gentleman say what he said just that validates it all makes it all was until\nThey owe you a gallon this okay yeah listeners are ... like like no matter how much they like you they specifically say bad things so that makes it ten times better I think that that guy specifically called the compliment\nThat's amazing yeah you know I Know there's probably people listening to CNN go I hated it sucked in and I expected that but to me that's that's our that's\nOur you got to push the art artists like pushing the boundaries if people hate it I still am happy because you get ... move the needle and moved the needle and I hope\nI Hope that the sound of sounding kind of like I don't know ... ... talk to your pretentious\nI Hope that maybe somewhere down the road the new generation of comedians it inspires them one of them or some of them to to take this medium that is so great out of the little box of a cedar and and maybe you know who knows\nI I'm Diane hopefully Kelly TV could put it on during the break so I had all of them look like and I wanted to Johnny and looks real I mean if you hate the comedy you love the scene real you know what I don't like that you know\nWhat I wanted vacation there how much she wasn't prepared and how much did you just rambling\nIt was I really worked hard on the act because it's kind of a theme I worked it up in the clubs it's kind of because I knew it was going to be out in nature right the special is about the human race in nature and how we're overpopulating and how we are squeezing the real world out and\nSo I'd say it's it's like eighty percent prepared and then twenty percent of me just winging it and going\nOff Pepperidge Farm Sally ended up you know that's that I have a lot on that [laughter]\nSo you do it so they are and how how long were you out there for like how long did you do and then cut it down or like yeah we did a we'd spent three days out there because we did a little intro movie at the beginning and then we did a day of this that we had to do another day with the helicopter\nAnd then we had to do another session where we did a few pick up where we thought we missed the little pieces and then that shirt I drew just for them yeah I actually drew with sharp he's on that sure because the special yeah I Do all that and if you look at the shirt when you're watching the special\nIt's all these different elements of life it goes all the way around the back and got fetuses on it and the ... of it\nBut it's all about like the whole journey human journey of life and death I Love I Love that you're so passionate about it I really am and I I'm not going to tell you what my next one's going to be but I'm I'm you know space I'm going to push the boundaries again and and my next special I'm going to do something\nThat people aren't used to seeing as well so how is that how is the was it received\nIt was received really well like most of the almost all the reviews were positive I one bad review the rest are really great was a better view about the the set up or are they know the guy hated everything he actually said there was a one funny thing in the whole thing but then in the same reviewing goes\nAlthough I did like a bit about Hannibal Lecter uh\nSo it doesn't bother me that people don't like the comedy but\nTo do not appreciate that it's you know it's it's kind of so much chance taking that it's like you got to at least like that dude I hated it I mean he's not going to be a guy's never camped yeah [laughter] I Love those phone calls coming in Harlem William ago here [noise]\nDon't go home at three AM Patty
