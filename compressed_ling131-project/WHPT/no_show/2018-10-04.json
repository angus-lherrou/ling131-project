last\nWith a judgment as long as the judgment has been issued accurately and legally incorrectly if it's going to be there indefinitely unless you file some type of motion or action to challenge it around and do it and I'm not quite sure what the legal arguments are at this phase 'cause this is something from\nA about five years ago or so give protect\nUs or I I did file a motion a\nYou know for them to go to court so we could talk about my finances\nAnd the whole thing I never heard from them that's been over a year now and then all of a sudden this letter has come up it isn't on my credit I just recently was on my credit history for all three bureaus or it isn't on my credit any well we're not I don't understand\nWhy let me stop you ... if you filed something with the clerk of court and

wouldn't wait for the collections folks go right to the ... maybe I can probably check the status on line he probably couldn't go online you can go on line or if you want to go because the thing is is\nIf you find something on line he doesn't know what the hell it is it's easier if you go down there and whatever he finds then he can go to information that the Clark has offices do go to the

little bar you you're the the judgments gonna last for Twenty years that's what the Florida statute says and if you got to fact information sheet from your creditor\nA venue have forty five days to respond to that and you can usually requested an extension from the court have you got just a letter and it's not a fact information say that's a form that's prescribed by the the civil rules of procedure\nOr then you know you're you're that that's not a formal discovery\nDevice so um check and see if that's a fact information seat or not and then ah you know you proceed under the under the rule in terms of a terms of responding to that there you go there you go around and find everything on line at the er\nAt the sixth circuit a third of court or you can look that up or at the past go past county clerk of court for\nSmall claims matter they could hire Michael ... Michael ... a year you could but at the adult channel All right and we don't we don't want it we don't want to burn up as a as fees on that but you know you can check out himself on the on the carpet for it for Pesca\nAlways a possibility how we are on time here cat we look good\nLet's take a leash a she was the first of the last of the three R's\nArrow light and I was rear ended in the rental\nI I heard in that accident jak no no I'm not mad if only one for three now I'm On a day I'm Tania right now maybe you got the worse locking you're depressed than me man I'm On vacation tomorrow may\nMan I got a job all coming back around\nGood ... well who did he hired as a first acts while he's not he's not injured in any of the accident but I'm a you got me last do you have a specific legal question on some of these things that have happened\nIt was it was it was out of sorry I was playing in the uh events but um yes when I was fired from the job the practice manager actually hold me that you know like I said she's no longer allowed interview men\nWhen will you said that five minutes ago so I mean if your if your question is whether or not that was a discriminatory\nAction in labor law and I I think Mike and I both agree that that is problematic it sounds like you were potentially discriminated against because you're a male\n... when I was about to tell you that you might have a strong cause of action for wrongful termination you stopped me and you said I've got another job in a very small industry and I'm kind of happy and I don't necessarily want to rock the boat so\nI and then you ... you go into some of the bad stories and the bad luck about getting into accident he just wanted to be on the air which is fine I was a guy an adult it's but I Want to make sure I I I ... I don't want to run that was on the radio a lot of uh okay\nHere's what I Would do is if you want to avoid the publicity just try to settle with the practice I mean you got what you've described as a slam dunk gender discrimination\nYeah but I think he's concerned because it's a small industry and if it gets back to his employer is that going to cost him problems within and I don't know what industry\nYou're making the same amount of Eleanor just\nWord of mouth that's what I was wondering about is you just word of mouth it's not like I have anything recorded on tape\nDay Mike Mike wants to know you're making the same amount of wage salary\nI actually took a job for less but it's a better position\n... damages their right and you were probably out for a week\nWell it's a more level yeah I Hope he has to make a moralistic decision if he wants to go after them because he's making last and he was discriminated against my center litigator he wants to follow along and I and and the truth so that you got a course of action whether or not you want to ... whether or not you want to engage and go and attack\nMode you got to sleep on it\nContact me before I hit that Cruz tomorrow you got till eleven am going to ask Saddam dot com or get somebody does labor law thanks so much Jay James you're on without Saddam tax question\nOoh sign and get out the Google Sarasota [laughter] oh\nNo no I'm actually veils guys love your show thank you so much about taking my call thank you I I you got a couple\nA um I was on the show that are running for all\nI heard there oh yeah it correct to Michael Michael I think is running for county court judge in Hillsborough County or that his group eight and then Michael Bell trend is are running for Florida House and that is group of fifty seven which is the ah fish rock uh I don't wanna say brand in part you said part about Rico a kind of\nThat ad reading about it in places are there gotcha so did you have a male is good um I my question\nIs are we going to do anything as anything happening about red tide\nOh that's a great quote Mikey all I'll take that you take a stab at that so so we we really we have\nTo I Know you're running for office as well as I maybe I'm tired of it I Would love to have an educated answers we're glad it worked in a service industry yeah and I got nervous tourists and people constantly talking at all I Would love to give them a\n[noise] you know an answer that came from someone like you\n... ... I mean we really have to environmental problems at Florida one is the green algae and the other ones the red tide and the red tide largely happens out in the Gulf of Mexico and the blue algae largely happens in the inland waterways\nOr the bad news about the red tide is that it's it's harder to control because there's a much larger volume of water in the Gulf of Mexico than there is in the inland waterways and\nThose are the way that you address the green algae both of these are microorganisms and they feed on nutrients are and the nutrients come from a variety of places some of that ad agricultural run off some of that are the some of those are septic tanks\nAnd then some of those are naturally occurring\nUm for a sediments 'cause we have a lot of phosphate and now is it\nIs it truly from the big sugar everyone keeps saying that the runoff\nWhich should run it through the Everglades instead of dumping it has that ever going to change or yeah\nWell the legislature has appropriated over a hundred million dollars in recent years and they they're reworking those waterways and there's a lot of difficulty because the Army Corps of engineers which is a federal agency controls the damage Lake Okeechobee\nAnd then the uh Florida authorities I control some of the other waterways and so there's the Army Corps of engineers is preoccupied with making sure that that damn does not break and doesn't get too much pressure so they'll release a lot of water and that will actually reduce the salinity\nOf the inland waterways which actually allows the um\nThe blue green algae to grow as far as the red tide we have to keep that in perspective I may try this because remember the ... the doors in encountered red tide so long before there was industrialization or or a massive farming or any of these uh fertilizers and we had red tide that the countries that are from\nA have a you know it seems that the red tide really only a has a a a it rears its ugly head from about Sarasota\nTo pronounce county you don't really hear about the red tide being north it's going north ... is hey Michael I don't really hear on a lot of episodes of red tide further north than the oil and also passed soon as you don't hear about it in Collier county well here's what I Want to know\nAnd and and I don't know the answer and I don't know if you know the answer not Mike I'm James asked was because of big sugar or I guess companies putting\nA I guess overflow or whatever's coming from like what the hell started do we know that do do do I have no idea\nWell there's always there's always microorganisms and very it was a combination of that yeah maybe agriculture\nThe microorganisms or and then the way that we're managing that locking system\nAll of that is a combination of what the origin of this is one of the longing system has nothing to do with the with the red tide you also as well but that's the the that well that would be the free flow\nOf more or less water that blooms the green algae writes them forms red algae so I guess in one way it's it's ... it's it is in some extent am I wrong\nWell there there's also I Know you're not wrong but there is also a lot of the septic tanks along the waterways uh that you we don't have sewers in all of the areas along the waterways and so we have the septic tanks and septic tanks sometimes leak and what some of the research I I'm told is found is that\nThey're finding in these waterways they're finding trace amounts of saccharin and\nUh these other artificial sweeteners which gives you a little disgusting but it ... it leads you the inference that some of the nutrients are coming from human waste from the septic tanks and that's another issue a though you know we have to deal with it and that's another thing ... these communities you got to put in sewers that you're not having\nA that's another\n... well I have Michael as far as any of my gas that's probably the most educated answer on the red tide algae bloom that I'd had on the show [laughter] I mean I I mean and I I don't know something I say I don't know it but I think\nThat the average James's quest shelf real good yeah I'm just ... it seems like I let\nYou buddy I got to get to a guy who's next is Amy holding their yes a James thank you so much but I got I'm going to try to get to everybody here that's been holding Amy you got a rent question asked\nAnd now let's see Iran without the ... go ahead Amy\nHow like Iran and just recently our house and wondering landlord legal responsibility for it I probably\nI don't know okay my mouth shut that Michael\nThat is a very good question and um I'd say yes Okay Michael Belgium which I guess\nI'd say yes you have to look at the contract language in the least most leases will say if the premises so we\nHave anything in the\n... yeah but but\nBut it was a provision that says if the premises are not ... if if the premises are uninhabitable for a certain time than you are right the right and usually there's a provision if you have a sufficiently detailed least if you don't have the least then you're essentially controlled by by the common law and the statute so that's you know\nYour your phone is breaking\nUp so if you want to if you want to just hang up because of the connection and then we'll give you the answer you can just tune in and listen I I think we just had a bad connection here with Amy but a Michael go ahead as Amy hang hangs up there's about ... what it was hard to like five seconds we got ... second delay so if you answer her question now she'll probably be able to your\nOkay well that the ... the first thing you look at it as in any legal dispute as you look up a contract between the parties because you can contract around almost anything so you you look at the contract between the parties is probably a provision if you used a detailed resident foreign lease and it was just a one page lease it probably doesn't address that and and you look at the statute a common law and\nEssentially if they're not providing a the premise is for you for X number of days and you had to go to a hotel\nOr or or stay wherever the you know the rent should be pro rated and\nYou know you could even take the position that you're entitled to your consequential damages yet to go\nNow that I'm starting my own business and now ... okay ... what can they do to protect my assets when we get married\nAll green lush and yes there are two house why\nSome aren't in the morning girl oh man I Am so excited because usually these calls happened after they get married and the masses already been traded let me let me do this I'll use them I guess a ride jumping my Belcher I wouldn't say you hear from his Monica\n... what one thing to remember with your student loans a student loans or non discharge and bank right now this is his student loan student loan correct to say so you you pay your student loans like everything else is discharged if you know if push comes to shove you know you can go into bankruptcy and get a discharge student loans other than federal taxes\nOr one of the hardest things to discharge and bankruptcy there'll be with you and the cost of the mystery trip [laughter]\nI got to make sure that that's a priority or in terms of you know I I Would get your ... affairs in order um you know before getting married if you can but uh getting married in of itself\nIt does not constitute an assumption\nOf the the debt of your spouse you know that they that they contract it up before getting ... nonetheless you know you all should you know you're going to start a family by um get a car do whatever you're doing this student loans especially if they're in default are going to be an impediment to that so I Would encourage all to uh get that worked out and\nPay down your student loans as as soon as specially\nThere's credit issues or if if they want to qualify for a house or a mortgage and ... they might rely more heavily on her credit than he is you know depending on the amount of these laws the Michael what do you have any comment on this anything wow well I mean you got it all excited and then out of shape over this because typically who's I'm not been\nOut of shape I'm excited about it but a motion but typically you jump out of your seat because they don't have a prenuptial agreement and a prenuptial agreement is not going to save the situation\nOr not it's not it's not going to help a prenuptial agreement I think is going to clarify what assets in that are coming into the marriage that is not going to be part of a marital asset or a marital debt I absolutely think there's gonna be a distinction here\nNow is she going to be on the hook for a contract that he signed before marriage no no but he wants to have a clean record coming in and why wouldn't a pre not articulate that\nBecause they're going to have to use marital assets to pay down\nThey're going to be married they're going to have marital assets and and he's going to be paying on these student ... they're going to be using Merrill assets well wait a print outs not going to help well wait a second how much is the loan\nAlways like two hundred thousand to lock in ... to help it's not going to help\nThem or not how she's not going to the ... it's a it's a pre marital either asset or debt that that supersedes no no a pre three ... a prenuptial agreements gonna protect is going to protect the pre marital\nAsset unless he has sufficient or a pre marital money we're talking about debt\nI understand that so but but you're missing the point dumb well what's the point not marry the guy no she can marry him but ... not going to save the fact that it's not unless he has money specifically how he can pay it down\nHe's going to use marital money not if you like that in the ... that says you cannot use marital money you have to have a separate account funded separately put that in the arena and where's he\nGoing to get my I I Can't do that hey Monica is calling on helping him in her unrealistic I Know that okay so yeah there are ... not going to your option is\nDon't have a pre now for contracted any kind and good luck\nNo you can hear your answer you can have a clean up but it's not going to help this particular situation because what will help her particular situation where with a debt a a pre marital that know you get married and and your your marry or if somebody comes into the marriage with debt you're marrying somebody with that so that's\nGoing to be the ... they don't marry marry you don't let a debt not a\nPerfect prevent you from getting married but you just have to understand is that it has to get paid I I think that there's got to get paid with metal money there were some realistic argument here in the sense that you are going to be connected to him as well as his that much like if he was a multimillionaire\nYou're going to be connected to him in his wealth much like in his debt especially if there is no pre ...\nWell the print up would protect someone if they had premarital a asset oh asked them ah Justin Bieber but they're they're talking about the ... and his and Haley\n... he's a hundred or what what eighty million the million by ... ... three they didn't find nothing out of love a prenuptial agreements gonna gonna protect someone who comes into the marriage\nWith a ... with assets that they've hired prior to the marriage what we'll do it if you marry somebody with debt you gotta we'll we'll that's going to get paid with marital after ... Monica talk to the experts when she goes to ask them dot com I'm gonna give her ... and that way you and I can stop scaring Mr ...\nTrent [laughter] at least look at me he knows I'm right oh okay ... if you're right then don't bring up and do get married\nIf you're not getting married but I say that highway she's got her get her pre no way she ... the parents aren't going to help is what she's going to do I say the Bible and help I'm In happiness and your [laughter]\nParticular only joking or Theresa you're out as Saddam or husband in jail manatee county what's going on how can we help you young lady\nOh well he's actually not ... I'm not ... he ... down but when he was ... it was a good thing that you get to listen to your program they kill the how the non ... cool to get an accounting\n[noise] when you get a child and next day he played on a farm dollars which was really tight now don't we didn't really seen anything back from Neil ... well so that we actually had to go out ...\nTo find out is that enough to nine months to come to me oh\nThis and end up deals last name and we pay five thousand dollars and then we went to the cold is found out and get to the job search okay yeah\n... ... people say I only have to get another lawyer unleash just filled that and we have not caught any from\n... from ... and we many filled up because we have to leave China now loyal because we didn't get any response from is that we should being tied to our we kind of back we just look far\nWell first of all I appreciate the call and if there's ever a problem on a a referral but I recommend I Need to know about because if I'm not aware of a problem I Can't fix it what probably happen here on\nTalk of the office several times okay well let me know several a lot of time ...\nBut this is the first time that I have received notice of the issues so when you call the office and my office work recommended you to build sand Sony that air sand Sony\nBill handles manatee county I don't go man I Am now but let me let me on that but we reach I well I got to get it out to ... I got to let me get it up [laughter]\nSo bill is not in my office bill has his own company he has his own separate line so if a message goes to him I may not particularly see\nHigh so that he's not a city I think with yes\nHe is but he has his own firm so he he's in the same building\nHe's a sponsor to the show he and I are going to be on the cruise tomorrow we are affiliated but I'm not in his office he is a separate office he's on a different floor I'm not always privy to his emails and his message is because we have to separate firms but here's what I'm gonna do for you mystery so\nI'm going to have you on hold and I'm going to get your personal number off there and you're going to give it to will I'm going to talk to be all send bill attacks tonight and I'll ask him to contact you so I can find out what's going on if there was a mistake if\nSomething happened if you do a refund Mr sand Sony as well as my office we'll refund when necessary but I'll get to the bottom of it for you and will certainly figure it out the does that satisfy you as a solution\nI definitely appreciate your house and the twins Shay someone saying they'll do something to help like\nAbsolutely well don't hang up wheels going to get your personal information off the air or he's going to relate that to me I Will set attacks tonight to build sand Sony\nI'll ask him to call you either tonight or first thing in the morning he and I do not leave until tomorrow afternoon so we're going to be at work tomorrow I promise we'll look into this before we get on a cruise ship okay Theresa I put her on hold\nOkay you know just as you've said something very interesting what did she say did you know that uh the prisoners in in the county jail or listening to your show\nYes yes uh uh one of my biggest fan bases humbling is orient wrote and phone number\nBut but there are there and I didn't vote ... again even ... well I'm not running for office [laughter] when I was in jail and manage the while I don't mean I I did not know the folks\nYou can find on my website it out Saddam dot com [noise] so uh\nI'm gonna jump to Craig Jenny in the coal in one brief minute sewing anybody ever calls when they constructive criticism I always welcome I'd never hang up and anybody unless cat with his bat fingers hangs up on somebody with the button but that is not the case with me\nSo history is it called was she had a complaint regarding a an issue at a manatee county which of course she was referred to Mr ... communicate over the break as I promised mystery so\nThat I what so what has happened is this was a a matter that bill or did help with a this individual was charged with a very serious crime a higher and selling a\nVideo with the ... job bill says that this individual pulled a gun on somebody stole weapons charge I Do know that specific but that we don't know if it's true it's only an alligator ... was an allegation\nRight at the time I'm waiting for treats his name to come back up on the board [noise] well I Do not here to argue with you regret because this was something that was addressed a six to eight months ago\nOkay All right if this was something that Mr ... spoke with her about on numerous occasions he said he had several phone conversations with her OK okay\nAnd there was a quote that was much much higher than the initial retainer in fact a it was much higher okay well and that added a serious charges it was dark should be and that Mr sand Sony it's back\nDespite you didn't necessarily need to do so given the work that he performed on this when they decided that they were going to go with alternate council\nHe did refund a portion of the thousand dollars\nLast whatever time or energy and effort that he had put into the case so mystery says issue has been discussed with Mr San Sony wow a it has been addressed with his office and in fact in some part has been refunding\nNail she didn't realize that a refund had come by so I don't know where the miscommunication is maybe her and her husband I'm very thankful for both of them for listening to the show\nHowever I always get to the bottom of issues and questions and there you go there you go and he ... he did what he was supposed to any further problems she can go ahead and contact bill and anybody has any issues I'm always here I don't hide from anybody I mean you could find me Fifteen different ways social media from your wife [laughter]\nAre crazy [laughter]\nCall ins on her send her back to stop the stuff that I'm All right Craig your I Would ask the job you out a wire fraud issue and pass go how can we help you sir\nYeah lower and I bought a house or at the end of August and the equity company was going back and forth with my wife was emails\nEmail from a a Wells Fargo Jell O ... a\nA a fraudulent account for the closing costs to be wired and uh the money was wired and it was too like I said of fraudulent account mhm and we ended up closing of the house anyway was some extra money we had\nHow much how much was wired that was a was lost or by fraud\nSeventeen thousand dollars okay you know the ... weren't weren't lawyers about this\nThe floor are far as I'm closings radical yes that that do just came out within the last year year and a half\nA I got notes from the floor to bar saying that uh the bad guys are monitoring\nThe a title companies the real estate agents the attorneys are who are holding on to the uh the trust by I Can't stand why endurance for and and they're sending out emails they're sending out emails um to uh to the uh\nThe seller saying uh oh we have a change in the information instead of wiring it to the title companies account uh you have to to send it to this new account at the exact\nA scenario ... will let me ask Greg where he is that you reported to law enforcement did they investigating a cyber crimes unit I assume with the state attorney's office is that where you are\nNo uh we uh we were actually directed to the FBI\nOh well yeah there you go\nYeah their side wicker chair that but uh yeah just like yoga so said there you know it's I looked at Google that lower sitting at closing and it's a billion dollar industry this is closing costs fraud\nWell let let's let the FBI do what they do a ... and that you're in the right place you know those guys and girls are highly trained\nProfessionals you mean you got the federal government and they're now they're they're ... they're they're going to track down whoever it is you got to do the very best you can to protect yourself and uh you know you're just you're staying communication with law enforcement yeah\nBut is there is there any records as far as going after the title company\nWell if you ... you know the question is ... and ... maybe or or both my ... if if the title insurance\nDoes that cover it would that not encompass the transaction itself ... and most closing the\nPurpose of the title insurance itself is to make sure that the titles that there were any conferences on the title that they didn't find that was an address procession or some some kind of problem with the title of the property\nBut the title company or if the title company got hacked or if you called\nThis is kind of comes back to what I was going to say is anytime you're doing a transaction of any size if there's an extra step in the transaction or there's something unusual about the transaction you need to make your calls and make your inquiries and find out and ... that that's a that's a suspicious thing if they're switching the account you should've probably called the title company and said hey why\nNot be the title company's fault if they got hacked as well I mean you gotta have some type of negligence on their part which I don't know outlook you may have been negligent to get act that means some right and that is true that's very true statement absolutely right that there may be a cause of action against who ever whichever person involved in the transaction\nAllowed the the email information to get out that well that they could be contacted by the bad guys let let me do this thank you so much Craig ah I got Jenny Nicole David\nTheresa wants the hollering scream at me and Mr ... she's back on with exclamation points but I just wonder what they want us all I mean I I told I was waiting for her name to come up with you or if you watch the on screen that's fine but I got to do it in order so let me get Jenny first year on where they asked the dominant deed restriction Hillsborough County go ahead\nI purchased a home um and I did not want to live in a deep restricted area or one of the nature way um I did not know and in the lifting of for the property it said that there were no age restrictions or H LA specifically\nAnd then after we moved in probably about four months later I got a notice on the dealer I'm from the neighborhood that said you know we're aware that some of the new\nPeople that moved and don't have any idea because it's an older neighborhood and um it wasn't in any of the paperwork that I'm In closing site I didn't know that the first time on line with the district that and the only in really why is the problem is that the um\nThe the gators that they're pretty lax the destruction so all in all it's kind of a big deal that we would like to build a garage and indeed restrictions the garage I'm an ex your garage or or detached and a cat\nGarage door I cannot faced the streets and the way that that property as um\nIt makes it difficult to try and build a detached trash you have a nature way there\n[noise] so um yes it's a voluntary H. I. L. A. in a ... ... yes\nAll right so the eight or ... in the weather and who is going to want to force the deed restrictions [laughter] right I was\nTold that a neighbor or what would you um take me to court and that they're enforceable\nBecause they're tied to the land and that the neighborhood as such that they probably somebody probably what ... Iran has that space yeah I\nDon't know I mean if they didn't need to disclose yeah All right you hear a great question talents and belts your guy but he does a landlord tenant H always deeds or might you do any of this stuff is in in your actually\nOn an ACOA board and I just did a a was a condo association case I just uh just dissolved last week actually\nIt does is there any good credence to what she's saying that she's the best thing attaches to the land was was not disclosing the sale I think that that's the misrepresentation\nMother yeah so there's there's two things going on right so that they had the MLS lifting or whatever the listing was right by the realtor for the purpose of math and then the second way the second piece of information that you would have been on what we lawyers call inquiry notice that if you could you could have found it if you looked would be checking the um\nThe recording that with the clerk of court that you can see that these deed restrictions are recorded and so\nFor example if you were going to sue the realtor or the seller for not disclosing as they are going to say that it will you you know you you had a duty to check the public records and at the end of the day if they put an MLS in it said there's no dangerous direction they're going to have some exposure there and you'll probably be able to settle the case against\nThese people just want to build the garage you got to deal with the ...\nHours I'm getting to that but the the second is there's if there's anyone to communicate any counter party you can deal with and the way I Would try to get a very emphasis especially if it's an H A way that's not super active but remember that the age away statutes\nUm does allow\nUnder certain circumstances a neighbor to sue and there's an attorney fee provision in at ... which means that you're the prevailing party would recover not only\nAnd you got that did they do they I guess they ... they said you're defaulted right so you you need to you know\nWell I even called the office and that lady's like I've never heard this happen here before and I'm just I might a lot they don't know what to do I've\nNever seen I've been dating for a decade and I worked in a court a courthouse and now that I've never seen that happen either as a very unusual rocks or you're just\nJust add some mistake I Can't imagine what the court will fix ...\nYou have you noticed you saw you on the approval of the continuance I Can't imagine them not not sending it aside and if not I mean there are other open themselves up to litigation left and right I mean you're going to have multiple claims your in your favor you may not never need a job you just if everybody that's horrible\nAnd that's a that's what I Need to find out because um when I did contact and the person I spoke to she says well I'm going to she said she was sent an email to the person who held the hearing uh let's see if they can reopen it but I still haven't heard from them it's been four days and you know I'm kind of I'm kind of concerned that you know they're not going to reopen it\nWell here's what we're going to do go to an Saddam dot com [noise]\nA very good friend of mine who does labor and employment law his name is Scott outward and he's wonderful I'm gonna give you his information or go there tonight I'll email you the tonight or tomorrow morning before I leave for the crews and make sure we get you in touch with ... and he can assist you with labor law\nThank you so much ms Nicole uh I Know somebody wanted to say something nice that hung up about ... percent Sony but before and Mr sand so he's on the hotline\nWhen I showed her hair you you know it's unfortunate that uh that that the caller hung up because I was ...
