he's ... he's a report to\nDo the cigar Dave Chappelle presented by data of Tampa cigar lounge found one of those two point five the bone\n\nGrowing one on the science of brewing we're whatever group company downtown St Petersburg with Jeff Keller the owner and proprietor master brewer counter Meyer now recapping here\nThey're eight actually nine steps to creating beer first is your ingredients by the way all these rich cigar Dave dot com the second is matching of the grains deepen grains in hot water for an hour between a hundred and forty due to a hundred and fifty nine degrees ... wrenching the sugar out of the grains creating the war boiling for about an hour\nNumber five is adding the hops is where we left off and counter you just gave me and Jeff you just gave me a half a glass here\nOf cops and these are what\n... ... this popular up very okay especially among the idea is\nThat what that was one that sold out because everyone wanted it last year\nI'm getting notes of planning this fruiting is floral little ... very credible now these kind of like little pellets is that how they're grown or they've created and ... they're they're grown\nIn these little cones but pellets are easier to transport because an ounce of of a holy hops can actually go out a lot quicker and that it's about you know a lot larger so they said they just pulverized them and put them through an expert or that and put some of the pilots gotcha so this is an assistant and even in about them all to this is what\nGives the beer a lot of flavor a lot of the various tasting notes whether it's real happy those bitterness units or the other case that you would get on the ballot right now we go to showing show the beer is boiled for just about an hour you're adding hops Rob you're adding the hops okay then you go to\nShow you know as I say about earlier or with the hops the when you add them changes whether you to get ahead bitterness from it aroma from it or a flavor from it so if it takes you an hour or two hours to chill down all those Roman hops you put in have been in hot water for long enough where they become very hops so the quicker you can chill it\nThe more you can retain the flavors that you want also the less chance for infection you have\nArt and below eighty degrees mhm what's the rough temperature each other I usually go for about Seventy five Seventy five ... ... if it's too high you're going to kill the uses to cold is just going to keep these to sleep you got to your friends you you will you want to make the environment for them really uh I'm\nHappy well and it comes to beer obese does your does your friend none of that data like know however All right so the next thing is pitching the ... you get life here\nThis is where it becomes ... well yeah that a living thing I mean east is is is a beautiful thing and you can make alcohol you can make CEO to show me it's just this is where the the life comes to comes and there are different types of east there are there's different\nDifferent strain yes range from different regions and they have different quality you know qualities each each one might produce same with water water water in the east or or um you know related to the regions they come from [noise] okay so then you pitch the east and how long is the only time after you've\nCool down sanitation is a very key okay you don't want to infections of other bacteria is a wild nice it's where you can get really bad off flavors so once you show that you sanitize everything that's going to touch your beer at this point it's still considered ward until east is added but\nSanitation is absolutely key okay so you ... then what happens stepping you close it in for for ... for mentor and you add an air lock or a year yeah you you should have been drinking the whole should address\nFor you make it so there's nothing you can get into it so this law to basically or an airline which just lets the CEO to the east is creating come out but nothing coming okay so fermentation how long about a month\nMonth so basically you you when you pitch to use you then are you're putting the east into a new container into the ferment ended up from mentor gotcha so you take the work world wars that has the hops you show at them and you put it into the ferment\nAlong with the used for thirty days no difference between a lawyer and a nail involves\nThe field back temperature temperature temperature um loggers east typically ferment around fifty five degrees and alleys typically from EPA tweens sixty two to Seventy two degrees\nAnd one of the top fermenting and the other's bottom fermenting for the most probably for the most part okay gotcha so thirty days is now going by now I'm looking here you've got beer ale sixty two to Seventy two degrees two to three weeks logger fifty five sixty degrees two to three weeks\nNow the term logger actually longer ring is aging and cold temperature ... a logger you'd ferment at fifty five fifty seven for\nTwo or three weeks and then you would log or it for up to three months and that's actually the process of law growing is about thirty five degrees and you maintain that for for two or three months now she clears the flavor it clears the beer out for clarity\nShow loggers or longer ales about thirty to absolutely ... require a lot more patience to correct so thirty days have gone by with your ... your ... now what do you do comes out of the perimeter so you\nPut it into another container that's also sterilized or you as a set amount of sugar and then you read what now a set amount of sugar a landing on how much carbon ... so this is this on the east so a lot okay so you put it another bucket you add sugar\nAnd then you put it into each bottle and cap it okay and what that sugar to the east will eat that sugar inside the bottle in creating a C. O. two okay and it'll naturally Cartwright carbonate inside of the bottom ... and then you wait about two weeks if even a week and a half\nAnd putting your fridge and you enjoy your nice tasty

Saddam or bans I mean they know\nThe personalities they know the shows they know it's it's amazing they knew where you had been where were you when you were back on Ninety eight rock I mean it was ... then the lawyer there ain't actors have dominance speed though that's that's what I don't know what are the people back in Tampa wasn't ...\nIt was a ... you got to get out there is some fans out\nThere and they're great people wonderful and I were on the cruise or well without our group is about five hundred and fifty\nWow ... ... five hundred and fifty listeners plus the radio personalities that came in the morning show you the afternoon show and you did Santos while you're on the on the boat that they did some pod cast yes and then they had a ... and Robert Kelly said well wonderful comedians the comedian shows on there\nA ... was on there so are your other other people affiliated ... drew was married in the afternoon I might get a triple turkey\nA no no we didn't know they don't have a bowling alley on their uh let me jump real quick to George George around without Saddam you've got a question on who's a veterans' benefits\nIf there are a good deal\nNot only going from you what county are from George\nAre currently Hillsborough\nAlright wonderful or you go ... read just over\nA year or sure I'm Still trying to keep this question as quick and breakers like as\nA so I was discharged for active duty back in April medically discharged uh the guy that was a firefighter and develop that um I was a in for seven years\nAnd obviously\nAll all that training and everything like that all the certifications that I went through and everything like that is now no good I I Can't do anything with it because I Can't be a firefighter on the outside because of having as well\nI Am currently receiving only ten percent a disability compensation for that as well my question is how\nWell do I go ahead and try and\nClaim for more and if so how do I do it\nAll right great question let me ask you this has your asthma gotten worse\nYou know okay when\nWere diagnosed with with this condition what year\nOctober twenty seventh last year of last year okay now I'm ...\nDid this cause you I think you said you were honorably discharged medically discharged correct\n... medically\nHonorably and the whole first of all thank you for your service to our country that's a no ... no matter what I Want to say thank you for that now\nHas the the disability at at ten percent was that determined by the folks at the VA ... is that the Veterans Administration disability that they gave you\nI I Believe that was the Air Force's determination\nThe air force okay now\nAnd the air force determined it and the VA took it and decided they are the ones who is going to pay\nA nap and that's to be a firefighter obviously a firefighter you smoke you have those type of conditions and if you have asthma that's the condition that will prevent you from doing that task is there any other task in the fire department\nThat you can do that does not put you in any harm's way or risk with your asthma have you have you inquired as to that\nThere were other jobs so when I was ... when I was in I was working at the by section\nWith and the fire department and I was able to do the job without any risk whatsoever I never had to put on the gear and never had to put on a master at our pack anything like that similar jobs exist on the outside however for everything that I understand with\nUh the way that Florida or does that does the city fire departments or county fire department as a\nThose jobs are filled with firefighters in which case you have to go through the Florida training um there's a new program where you can transfer your DOD search a with a forty hour class um but it's still going through the same training from the beginning which\nGoes on back I have again seven years of training\nI don't want to start from the beginning again All right with because this is an important call and not only are you a veteran but you're also a first responder these are two groups that we are we highly are appreciative to in respect here at the station\nSo if if you if you can't qualify so I guess the problem is the Florida regiment you will not be able to pass I assume the physical or the test because of your condition is that your understanding I'm from the folks there from the state\nYeah okay All right so let me answer your question now the answer's yes if you cannot do what you are trained to do and you served seven years doing this capacity but you've developed this condition you certainly can have that disability percentage evaluated and potentially increased higher\nAlso you might be able to have a straight disability outside of the folks that the air force\nWith simply the the federal government if you will much like folks\nAh get disabled they're not in the military but they file for SSI apps FDI with the federal government you could also do that track\nI don't know which one would be better I don't know if you can do and simultaneously I don't know what percentage would be however I can tell you who does and that's going to be Richard Haass ... great he's been on the show before going to ask Saddam dot com telling you spoke to me but\nYes you can have your disability percentage evaluated and possibly increase acid dom dot com or Richard I was born for disability and longshoremen act\nMore are letting us participate in that question [laughter]\nIs the microphone not shoved in your face all you gotta do is this open your mouth and starts saying something I didn't want to interrupt you do have lived the\nAiry well reasoned where it was very early ... do you have anything else to add for George\nThere's too much music coming up you know I could just wants to bitch about some who is that fair Sony I heard\nBack we've already [laughter] I I I thought that was a wonderful answer because he's the first ... and ... and

I mean how expensive or the Rolex is and is he gonna get try try to get a blood out of Iraq I mean if she doesn't remember maybe\n... I mean what what you do with the ... is there any way to get them back wondering do you have the money to pay it even if he says are as arrested\nShe says she threw someone show no issue as well I mean if I made that down I mean like you can get I get them back\n... well first of all of his witness is going to testify that he observer stealing\nThe relaxes I'm surprised that a report hasn't already been filed if that's true because he has an independent but now the problem is is that witness credible and so if the witnesses as his friend and the two of them don't like her then won ... going to vet through that\nRight up but I think what Michael is saying is if this person doesn't have any money she doesn't have any assets that she probably discarded the items\nWhat the hell are you gonna get from her anyway I just wanted to get her and he's just trying to get harassed it where you can do you do which you can and then he's afraid that she's going to turn around and say oh I got you I'm going to go and follow you know originally a false police report\nAnd yeah you know and so so now you're laugh with well what do you do I think that\nWalk away [laughter] I think Mr than than any of the correct I think you say you know what is the bad life experience\nDo deal with her anymore I Would the lead her number from your contact information and only Rolex is sitting around especially when people of this type of ... caliber and move on is probably an hour and that might not necessarily be legal advice\nBut it's probably going to be the best life advice are going to get on this show because I don't want you to have legal trouble if you pissed her off\nI don't want to have her legal trouble if you pass her off so you know you'll buy or she ... vice versa you're probably best has to walk away and with that\nI give you the dominance ...

about a permanent resident I was born in Canada but\nI've been here since eighty seven to tell us your kid I'm what I'm Wondering is now on the paperwork it says that I'm not considered a fell into it I'm not a good leader of the federal they can be held against me and I'm Wondering now I Would be able to carry a firearm she'll get my conceal part of it\nAll right well I I Know the answer to that question but I'm going to go to the field first and they'll circle back to you Michael\nAnd he's had his rights restored yeah okay that's an easy one yeah that's what I think to alright\nUnless there's an issue because he got out in the immigration issue\nWell there's there's a couple of things ... and what I Want to ask for clarification did you get your rights restored a in Georgia or did you do it from a from Florida\nActually from Florida I didn't step forward and Georgia and I left on my probation and\nA ... a few different it's hurting each got custody of my daughter down here right and uh that's hurting for Georgia\nUm I didn't even end up skipping for the Georgia when I left a probation or I was worried that with immigration they pick me up and everything but I have ever creation attorney so now I got my permanent resident court that of good for ten years old that okay and I'm also\nA also Georgia hits that said that you know on my way to work state or private sector

trial brief case has the snacks are and I just but I I\nI Am so much stuff in here I Want to hear that title [noise] now that's not at that guy do it at All right I'm gonna have to find it here in my message and somebody take it out All right here's the problem that\nHe has he has an adjudication but he got his rights restored what he said is he wants to go and get a concealed weapons permit correct that's what you want\nFrom or just carry on a you know I Want to know that I could legally I don't really need to carry on a daily basis but I Would like to be legally allowed to have a firearm in my house ... family\nThat's different that that is different okay house up\nWell I mean just possessing a firearm and having one of your house is different than having a concealed carry permit where you can take it out and around with\n... so if his rights had been restored\nHe has his constitutional rights for Second Amendment\nRight oh he was convicted that has been corrected in Georgia he can certainly possess a firearm does the panel would I I agree okay you got three three yes votes you're on your way to Hollywood okay with that is also now wait a second and now let me ask

of a group of people and we all went and got our ah stuffed together in a mine came back declined because of what happened in eighty nine I had a couple incidents when I was younger in Texas and uh I have yet to investigate or exactly what happened I mean I Know what happened but I guess they've they've\nCarried over All right well I don't remember them being shown aids or anything where\nYou need a lawyer in in the county taxes that you had these children you know for them to determine whether or not they can be sealed expunged or modified or whatever they need\nTo get a a a license in Florida eventually I that has to have to have a lawyer and the jurisdiction of\nWell I Would recommend you consult a lawyer in that jurisdiction to clear up the problem that's preventing you from getting a sale weapons license in Florida because that's why Florida said no so if you if you\nViolate again without fixing the Texas stuff they're going to say no to you a second time so you need a lawyer in

I think that's probably\nThe problem in society now is we complicate things that don't need to be complicated\n... everyone has a different love language and I don't know maybe you guys have read the love language the five lung love languages or heard about the\nAudio nuke you might have if you have and it is such a great book and it's just it's simple it's easy and I think if we all realize the kind of love language that we have Monica ... is the gift she doesn't want slower she's [noise] she's more of an access service she wants someone to give her a\nCold glass of milk after right\nMm and I think\nI don't know I think everyone's ... language is different so if we can understand that but you understand each other and I think Monica is great you guys are all great\nWhat data all you know we didn't we think Monica's agree to um I Know what I Do\nBut here's the thing you know guys don't speak women and women don't speak guy\nWe don't that's not true we are wired completely different the last thing in the rain\nI Would think about that would like make her happy see you guys get happy when we do stuff around the house that kind of thing\nUh when we see ice right when he was ... that gets us and doing things for you know what George I listen if having sex means I got to wash dishes I'll go walk in the basement\nOf washing dishes or whatever [laughter] to go right to that and\nI Know I was going to think you know what if I give her a glass of milk is really going to turn around you know and love\nLanguage that the thing and I think we'd have a lot more successful relationships have people understood how they feel up and how their partner feels love and guess what sometimes if you guys don't share the same love language it just isn't going to work because you're not compatible for me I was engaged almost got married\nTotally dodged a bullet thank God but his love language was to buy me gifts are taking you to fancy dinners that's not my love language

yet but alcohol or drugs or not the problem and the problem so I mean that's a fact\nWarrior problems can you tell me and my problem with alcohol drugs going I Want to have a did you have trauma as a kid you know I I probably born and my mom was an alcoholic who died of\nIt the young and and I think I was probably born that way yeah you could tell when I was a baby in the crib and you could see my legs were shaking you know the I have a hyper thing and one way to deal with that\nIs a great way to start drinking you know I was twelve we we'd start drinking a football field and I thought well guys feel good about myself yeah this is how I Want to be in so it's very you can pick it up pretty young\nAnd I never used ... out of high school because it Iowa ...\nIt was the the ... and the the athletes ... there was no you know this donors you don't they smoke pot but we just drank all the better but at that out after high school like you know I moved to start to a comedy and if someone gave me some cocaine in Nineteen eighty four so\nI said oh I gotta I gotta get some more or less\nSo you only early out of ... a five year cocaine ... yeah yeah and then they'll lay that's on\nI Know it it started Minneapolis ah and ah and then it continued in Los Angeles when\nYou on the uh the roast and you are you you were you a great job on the road yeah either that because that takes a lot of balls and I and I can honestly see you kinda sweat it out a little bit I don't think I was I don't think I I you know I just you catch a lot of stuff that you're facing for the first time in a long time right out there in front of the world you know yeah ... ... and you know anybody's\nBeen divorced can relate to this you know\nBeen literally Eighteen years since I've seen her in person or talk to her or whatever and I and uh I I\nYou know I wanted to say something genuine and I wanted to\nBut I had to go about thirty or so when we had an apple it or that but I really meant that I thought well what I have to offer here that these other people on the day is don't have to offer well I've known her a long time so I wanted to go back to I didn't want to think about all the things that have happened in the last Eighteen years are all things have been said or all the legal stuff yeah because then I Would have done it because they don't want to just be mad at the only way to\nDo something like that for a divorce person is to forget about\nAll the crazy stuff that happens it's hard to do it in my ... and it's hard for me well you know that forever it's a you know ... it's I'll do it again in Eighteen years yeah you know it's not something I wanted to do on a regular basis I I I saw sweet for me the other day well first of all I Want to ask you when you came on the side of the
