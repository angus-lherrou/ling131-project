I mean you four years in four years yeah but you got to occur that's a whole career for some people\n... but you know what it's because you're in this city and James is so friend of mine because\nHe's in the paper ... it'd be Cam Newton if we were in North Carolina but I think that I'm James is not ... he's not as bad as people think he is I just think that this situation didn't work out for him here\nI think there's other because if this happens all the time you give you give a ... you get somebody a change of scenery you put them in a different place and then all of a sudden they can do all of these things that you knew they could do all along it's all about matching up the talent with the right opportunity\nI I I Do agree with you and that was well I think that I think that he's one of those rare situations and I don't even know if it's all that rare where you take a player that's under performing in one city you put them in another city in the next thing you know the winning as\nYou can also put somebody was uh was doing great in one situation with him and another one and now they don't look so good because they don't have the right support around in decline and just all depends man I Want to talk to Kevin Kevin wants to talk possible trades for James Kevin thanks very demanding on bone\nWas I was I Love the show guys but I had a two man and a gay guys call because you mentioned in the whole ... like you know trained trade you're talking about okay they actually gone out of shape from yesteryear and check out set that I'm Around the league the only thing that change or you are willing to offer is nothing more than ...\nSo there's there's no way letter for that but if you anywhere in that conversation\nI understand it at this point in time there is no leverage with James so\nRight and he's only got that one year left and that so that's an issue to light in the contract to like that because they don't want to stand up our quarterbacks struggling\nThrough so like I'm always up here at all this stuff so yeah change there's a there is not generating any interest outside of maybe ... ... ...\n...

dressed\nIn blackface uniform for a Nazi uniforms\nI saw I saw this man I thought yeah they're they're equal equal levels of bad\nYeah yeah yeah I don't think there's one that's worse than the other\nAnd I have no reflection on the kid right now yeah not at all on for a photo circulating on Twitter showed a man dressed in a Nazi soldier uniform standing with his five year old son who was in a green sue a and the two ... mustache and justice Adolf Hitler yeah that was rough\nYeah so there are reports that demand and the children attended the Halloween event in Owensboro, Kentucky a and a in a Facebook post golden back ah which which was his last name he defended or\nHe [laughter]\nMan I mean like I don't want no cost to suddenly change I don't know him by even died as more now on [laughter] so what\nThey did it was a historical figures costume or so he said he said quote anyone who knows that we love history and us often just apart as historical figures are tonight we walked and we saw people adjusted murders devils zero killer's blood and Gore all sorts nobody batting a night\nBut me and my little boy and I dressed as historical figure in American people not only making snide remarks but approaching us\nThreatening my five year old little boy but what what was the ... the dead so they both stressed out what was the father yeah the the father was here here's actually the Philadelphia he dressed up as like a Nazi soldier and his son which they brought his face he he's actually um as as a little baby Hitler\nHe had like a little a mustache and everything this is a horrible\nThat this this is a this is someone desperately seeking attention and showing the no ... no regard for his child's wellbeing safety okay mentality\nUnlike Megan Kelly this guy knows what he's doing right okay All right the other the other people's latte or anything [laughter]\nKnow [laughter] I Know this ain't right of\nCourse uh yeah he was of course he does and it's going to be like that material here to claim spot or do you know like you got a full all costs not a costume for Halloween like that's what I read I Am either that that in his\nCloset for a minute for yeah he probably has like other colors to he tried to pull a fast yeah yeah he did ah so yeah people are starting to threaten him and his kid and he said yes liberalism is alive and well well um and he's like you know where I'm dealing with this from the tolerant left so\nSo yeah he's you know he was a long and that's that's the way he feels like he didn't do anything wrong\nHe hates liberals and he just wanted to get up in a position where he could have a more yeah and that's exactly\nWhat it was yeah plus the timing you got a guy going into a synagogue killing eleven wound in multiple others and that's the look you want\nAnd I think that if you want to do that that's cool but you're irresponsible as the father to take your kid in public dressed like ... and you wonder why people say and stuff you well that's because you're dumb ass got although not unique to\nThis day and age where a photo like that will never go away and bad kid has\nTo a day or the the root of his father's ill seed yeah forget that oh yeah absolutely\nAnd now let's do the father who's actually and last but not least we are going to\nMichigan a NATO mission was a real big blue a new now that are just like go to a break you said [laughter] I'm not really true blues clues just happened to be talking about this [laughter]\nA man who ... who has allegedly been driving on a suspended license since Nineteen Ninety nine\nAllegedly or illegible of allegedly [laughter] problematic yeah yeah\nI've since Nineteen Ninety nine has been arrested again or do you want to guess how many times his license hasn't been suspended since Nineteen Ninety nine [noise] I'll ... he's not under the jail\nRide a Nineteen Ninety nine Nineteen Ninety nine is twenty teens going into twenty Nineteen I thought they would lock you up after so many of them yeah yeah I mean yeah they probably do but I mean okay well I'm going to say yeah twenty five twenty five I'm no go forty forty\nOkay I hear they learned he was an ... an eligible to drive due to over three hundred and eighty current suspensions and forty five active warrants for his arrest she\nGot lucky that law and you know yes I'm going to have some people get lucky and they just like never get pulled over by police have like some reason it just kind of spend their whole life just kind of drive yeah you're right you're right you're right you know they should be like that but I Know that you know they should be lying is laughing\nYeah exactly or a record also indicate his driver's license has been expired since February eleven Nineteen Ninety nine and there are about forty WON Awards at that time\nSo you're talking about a ... like I say you like I got out of that yeah well\nAren't interested in something that they will keep you but now in this article he's saying that when you have the like button that that is keeping people from further dialogue and they want to ... they want to do things to push more dialogue on Twitter as opposed to yeah I like that and I keep going\nWhat do they care how much time I was on Twitter because\nIf they don't have dialogue you got nothing you want people on their interacting and talk as much as possible\nWhich will result in more revenue right what okay\nRight but you got to get to the conversation going first I don't think they've been profitable yet at Twitter and I don't understand why and understand\nWhy I mean you have a president here he's our first Twitter president\nSome people say that he is he a\nKind of brought to the back that Twitter was kinda fledgling into president embrace it so much I could see that that it's become relevant there's people now they're in tune to Twitter men ever even they heard about it but didn't care about it until now they want to see what Trump saying they got a direct line to him so there's so many people jumping on social media bandwagon they've never been on it before\nBut I think the fastest way I think the reason why it's where it's kind of making a big comeback while as a that's like the really quick is the quickest way to get what's going on around the world news coverage\nWhere everybody says that the Instagram has taken over and Instagram is I Can't I Can't get in the great I Love ... ... ... ... yeah but there are all of these social media platforms are almost pretty much just tagging process I don't know it's just weird\nI mean there's any way the tag yeah I mean and it is kind of\nAnd by the time line is you the timeline you have no control over I don't I just don't like it\nI don't know a true yeah you can only look I was one thing at a time yeah yeah it is it's\nDesigned for your phone most Ninety five percent of people that say oh I saw your website I was on the computer they are they talking about the phone yeah you're right though there everybody's ... strolling up now ... that's what it's going back to\nI don't really care I'm actually kind of concern in a sense of I Want to know what's next it seems like we've maxed out these social media platforms and I heard ... the other day where they were saying\nThat Facebook is desperately looking for a new way to keep this relevant or what can we add to it to tweak it and make it hot and relevant I don't think you get I don't think even if they just want to stay the way it is probably for the next ten or Fifteen Years that the advances are gonna be like marginal God really yeah like yeah the\nGuy that who who is it that owns ... that's I guess I if I'm ... I take the money that I already have\nAnd I divest myself fully a Facebook I sell it let it become somebody else's problem and I go and enjoy my life that's what I Do I I get rid of it before it becomes my space because to me Facebook is headed towards my space\nIt it can't be because there's nothing they replace it yet is that Facebook was that for my space right but there's not an airfares one not yet they goodbye like do you even argue even hearing about something else that people are on the size\nFacebook Instagram and Twitter Twitter doesn't know that ... which I mean isn't that streaming either like pie ads are games yeah\nYou too I think a YouTube could be the other format that it's going to or not only transcend the video the like the video platform but it could also be like a social media platform where it's like Facebook\nWell actually you can use you to\nYou to want you to know also that they were one of the original social media platform yes you can use you to like that like I say I can friend people and they can talk to you that has nothing to do with the videos and then I'm like the message you think of social media but I think\nI think that you two wants to like go up against TV and cable ah as opposed to trying to go more the social media platform and I will tell you I have replaced Ninety percent of my TV watching with you too oh okay um\nI don't think that's a good thing per se while on us or when it comes to stuff like information\nYou're just like my reading I tend to not\nInclude many works the fiction as an adult I have not consumed a lot of fiction I've always consume biographies or autobiographies or truthful stuff and I don't look I never looked for my entertainment that come from books in that sense\nI 'cause I always felt like their stuff I needed to know for real as opposed to goofing off on some story\nIt it's interesting we're all most in padded coat when that I I Do watch a lot of fiction I I watch a lot of documentaries and stuff on TV knows a lot a lot of fiction you watch the trash [laughter] [laughter] but ah books any book that I read as an all is an autobiography a biography or a true life a bit I don't read any fiction I and\nI don't think that's good sometimes I think that in the mix of the non fiction that I read that I Need to throw some stuff in there just kind of take my mind somewhere else right I just feel like if I feel like it's a waste of time and I wish I didn't feel that way\nIt's like I feel like growing flowers or waste the time why because I Do a lot of gardening and I don't see I don't see the benefit I but I Do now I Do now\nI didn't see the benefit of growing something that I couldn't consume\nSo uh oh it's all in how you look at it well look at it like look at his rose plant right I'm hungry [laughter] look at his tomato plant I can eat that right\nBut you consume beauty and the you consume beauty\nAnd the lights off they'll probably ...

something outside the rebate Bacardi together tried doing crossword puzzles or other working or have your child read a favorite represent\nThey read you measure that chocolate chip [noise] encourage a\nIf the gift that pays off around\nThey'll go read and how much how a message from the floor that education is ...\nAlways receive Sarasota CPAs are now and now these are the only way she went to ... to holidays you ever seen the\nShow and no one else looks mostly most\nOf the same [noise]\nNobody that's friends with him nobody can see this and go and and call the FBI go hey you might want to look\nAt this guy Robert Bowers because he's saying some silly ass man like he looks like he may do something like he may he may be up to ... to no good even put on his social media posts I'm I'm tired of the optics I'm going in\n... when you're ... inciting that you're going to take action on something that's like if someone is just a racist\nI Know this sounds strange but I really don't have a problem with that as someone is just a racist on their own I talk yeah yeah you're saying words that's fine with me I felt it was like it doesn't it doesn't really matter but if they're in inciting that they're about to do something violent\nOr they're suggesting that other people joined their cause the something violent or ... ... then that's when I think you need to notify authorities yeah just\nPosting racist thoughts is any legal well I ... when you start threatening that is one action needs to take place yeah and I immediately people are up in arms or gun control gun control gun control and my first thought was this one when I got the new Saturday\nIf this isn't a cut clearing dry argument for mental health is the problem\nThis guy if he wanted to kill people in the synagogue he could have done it without a gun he would have done it without a gun this isn't about guns this is about crazy ask people 'cause you got to be a certain level of angry and crazy to do\nWhat is it is sick yeah he's got a broken brain\nRight so yeah you can't use the excuse that this guy just was angry and because he had guns he kill people know this guy would a drove his truck in the synagogue like if he didn't have a gun and he was a sick towards the ... is a sick twisted bastard he shows up in court today in a wheelchair because he took some shots\nFrom the police um how did he not kill more people because the police showed up luckily one of the the first\n... well I I I probably should have been more educated on yeah weapon use was it a A R he had and they are Fifteen\nAnd three pistols but from from you know if I if I had to\nIf I had to you know I think the pistols or or more deadly than the AR in that kind of a situation you can use them faster you can reload and ... you mean like I think the AR to me is just a scary looking weapons so he's trying to scare people you know what I mean\nSo he did the police came that fast cars while he was for a guns on you here's what happened a lot more in\nTop wasn't called he heard the gunfire from a couple of blocks away happened to be in the area wow so when he heard the gunfire he responded um and he he got shot first so he went down um and of course he he called for backup and that's when all the other top started showing up and everything too so it's just a it's a six six situation\nThat you would think a place of worship would be one of the safest zones you could be in that seems to be the target for a lot of people\nYeah the Texas church last year with a guy came in and shot up every body\nUm you know of course you had that uh that was the south and North Carolina the south Carolina roof filling roof with the with the black church where yeah yeah I went in for racist reasons and and killed those folks to like and they were just having a Bible study it wasn't even a a good normal service uh it's it's just so gross to me\nThat somebody can hate a group of people so much that they literally go insane and they have to kill people\nIt's nuts and nobody saw it coming like you could look at Dylann Roof and know that he's a nut\nLook at his hair cut I think if you're a hair cut like that you should be on the watch list [laughter] just cut\nA but this guy Robert Bowers he's the he's obviously not going to get out on bond he's obviously going to at the very least there has been for serving the rest of his life however long that might be in prison and you know what\nGood luck in prison because you got to think there's some Jewish bad actors in prison there's got to be a few of them yeah that really are seeing not but businesses I sure I'd ever you've never seen a glorious bastards\nNow and it was an awesome awesome so good bringing to bear Jew I feel like\nIf if you were and not obviously I'm sure there are some that committed violent crimes a forest but you know part of Jews are committing crimes it's usually white collar crime ... tiny liar and you might not look it up by Bernie made off\nI got as sort of stuff yeah I just don't understand and um I don't understand why people hate Jewish people so much and I do [laughter] I don't though I mean I guess if it for religious reasons if you have a difference in in a you know I mean what else views\nI mean what are we looking at I mean in terms of like the whole Islam ...\nJudaism sort of thing I yeah I mean that is a little cold that's religious store called yeah when it comes to people like this I mean I don't know Jews have been very successful pretty much everywhere they go okay so that could have something to do with it they seem to thrive they work really well as a community Jews are very very tight\nKnit you shouldn't like people like that like that makes me respect you that makes me want\nYour level headed normal rational person clearly this guy is and and then also just rhetoric maybe he feels like he can like his Nazi brother and his where he finds you know community where he finds\nCommunity so I don't know so goddamn annoying man I hate I hate when anybody feels like they're better than a whole group of people like ... who the hell are you you know what I mean like ... who\nPut this in his head I guess he was raised this way sure it's just insane to me\nAnd I don't know I I I Can't wrap my head around it\nI just don't get it Seventy seven five seven nine one or two five eight hundred seven seven woman up to five but there's really nothing\nTo get and I feel kinda bad that I don't know all the details but to honestly this weekend like I heard the news and I just I ... I just didn't want to our eyes you know I I honestly block it out for a good twenty four hours are going\nTo pass on those high because I just couldn't take any more pat and if you were one of the first people I thought of obviously you know yeah um you know and that's the first thing I thought it was a my Jewish friends you know I Know you don't practice you don't go to ...\n... and I I read the first thing Saturday morning when I woke up and I started watching the news and I just I just put it away I was like I this is just so heartbreaking rental I I Can't deal with us today I I\nIt it angers me and saddens me at the same time and I know I'm I'm not like a some sort of anomaly everybody feels this way most people feel this way\nAnd it's the only thing that's nice about it is when you see communities come together and there's\nBeen a lot of ah a lot of other churches and you know like I saw that yeah all coming together and you know and and pay and respect or I even saw a Muslim like a a church of ... or whatever the mosque thank you uh are usually the salt [laughter]\nEver call it that again\nI saw it was a I think it was in Lakeland but it was a mosque that was doing something to pay tribute which I you know of all religions are sure of course yeah so\nUh but I really I really feel like it's time to start focusing on mental health\nIn ... you know I think that's the number one problem here I don't think people people just want to pass it off and they want to use this as a political battle ground to a you know for the gun control and everything else and then you get Republicans and Democrats like this isn't a Republican or Democrat situation because both are killing people ...\n... it has nothing to do with your partisanship it has to do with people are nuts\nAnd and people are blaming Trump I was watching the news is when\nI was watching the news this morning and they're like why is why is there suddenly a rise of hate crimes which I don't know if there is I don't know if there are no reported or under I don't I don't know we just had more outlets now sure absolutely um and\nThis woman who was talking about the fact that she didn't say his name but she's like our leaders and their hateful rhetoric come on and I'm like are you\nKidding me right now no you cannot like Trump that's fine but to say that he and he incited someone to shoot up eleven Jewish people and then a God it's an ... out of your God damn I just\nSee what a Huckabee Sanders said today I Would say uh well she made sense she came out that he does what she defended she's awesome so good at it or ...\nTo try to look good yeah\nLook when I say she's the best I'm not saying this as a supporter of any girl she just good at her job when people are getting a job like I Know who's going to be at work in a while and\nWho's not you know what I mean of course she's awesome she came out today and she goes look guys\nIf you want to blame the president for this ah it's ridiculous because this happens across the board you know nobody wasn't Bernie Sanders fault when they shut up the softball game you know because it was on the opposite side of the fate or insure you know so it's like just shut up this is not a political thing\nBecause it's happening all over the place it's happening for religious reasons happening for political reasons happening because for racial reasons it's happening for just people just nuts they're just nuts\nUntil we figure out how to better tend to the mint mentally disabled then we're going to keep having people get shot up because nobody's saying is doing this because there are Republican or a Democrat\nAnd there are always warning signs clearly hear when he's talking about even when he got apprehended he said what does

I had a blast and\nUm you know and then I don't and then I also\nDid a you know a lot of travel for the federal government to other countries to help them resolve their problems with you know an security ammunition an secured weapons and stuff like that\nBut the thing with the gun control it's [noise] it's gonna take both sides you guys are right\nIt's going to take both sides to sit down and come up with common sense right legislation that's going to look at the whole picture but people have to stop holding on to this thought that well if if they make any law that dictates any kind of\nWhatever you you name it that now that's the slippery slope that we're going to lose our guns frame\nAnd then their argument\nIs kind of found it if we look at at Great Britain\nAnd the gentleman a earlier about a half an hour ago had said well you know guns are are the worst thing since sliced bread and\nYou know these are going to these are designed to kill people and so easy but you pointed out people with you know loose brains are running down the crowds yes you know so what's gonna happen we're going to lock up all the vehicles and you know you're going to have to do a breathalyzer at a urine sample and all these other things before you can get behind\nThe wheel I just feel like if somebody has somebody is on a some sort of twisted sick mission they're going to find a way to accomplish and it just loosely\nAbsolutely Timothy McVeigh you guys were talking about it earlier ... Oklahoma City bombing rent it was his was ideologically and politically\nBased right his his thing with remain rich what happened when we are the rich and is that there was a family up there but the gentleman that the father of the family he's a ... special forces US military and that he just wanted to\nDisengage from the from the world he didn't want to check out he wanted to live off the land and support his family and do what he wants to do but in in\nUp in Idaho and Montana in that area there's a lot of groups out there that are anti government\nAnd that's the that's the social network\nThat's what they do um I served up in that region and everybody thought black helicopters were flying over everybody we can go respond to an area where there was a pipe bomb and we get potshots at us because we're driving in the military vehicle yesterday trying to help 'em freaking out but that's the way it is up there they think that\nThat there's a lot of folks not everybody they're great decent God fearing you know\nYeah and they just are not only don't trust the government they're paranoid and they they want to live on their own you know and it's a yeah that's a whole separate issue but yeah I mean that's why it's another aspect of what we're talking about so yeah I got with\nHim what happened with him is that he had actually he was known to make his own weapons he went to one of these you know anti government meetings\nAnd a guy approached him and said hey can you make me a weapon yeah uh well you know where he want he goes what I Want a shotgun with the barrel shot a sawed off he's like sure anybody can do it get a ... knock it off you're done rent he did it turns out that that was a federal agent\nAnd then they served a warrant on him he never actually got the war I mean there was a whole bunch of mistakes I got him at the McVeigh saw this and saw that this man civil rights were being violated and and actually very sad that ah the gentleman and his family\nAre well his family were was was murdered his pregnant wife was murdered at their home by government um\nYeah 'cause they ... storm there are a little a little ... against the ... pound yeah compound the skin worthy resolved\nIt could have been easily resolved have they let the sheriff just not go up there and say hey man you might let's talk about this\nGuy was actually very rational right yeah well you know I guess after I think that was a ride around the same time as the Timothy ... stuff and all that stuff so they have a ... or David correct yeah that guy yeah the guy that thought he was another instance\nAnother instance where he was he was wrong David ... well\nYeah he called himself ... what do you wear glasses you think of the you know to have the honest guy would

Seventy when I got a Guatemalan now so damn good\nAh look I'm not going to make to plunge Amos 'cause I think that he's also been on some bad some bad buccaneer teams has met her running game the first the first year he was here he didn't have receivers at all like he had nobody but now he has the weapons any stats are good on the positive side the turnover is of course our problem\nUh my my issues are\nConsistency we ... if you're going to be a franchise quarterback and and look if the bucks keep him\nAnd they have to pay him they have to pay Twenty one million dollars next year they have the pan that they have 'til march to decide and then they have to within the next year decide if they're going to give them this long term contracts that he will be up or it'd be a free agent and quarterback for something for a hundred million dollars now huh yea for how long ten years four or five years\n... million dollar\nSo are you willing to give James once in a hundred million dollars I mean that's the big question and and you gotta look at a there is possibly going to be a whole new regime because they don't turn things around in a dramatic way they're cutters not going to be here Jason his first name was\n... cause I Wish that every day cut her I'm sure somebody has named get cutter yeah the good about the third person entered the church that are\nReally nice uh so that's the big story it just seems to me like people that have hated James forever just to hate him today was Christmas for them they were just like\nYeah everything we said validated it\nEven if it despite their team losing yeah you know they'd rather see the team loses and yeah\nThe only thing that came in today at home this is a thing for me I I don't I I Love certain players I Do love certain players for for their character for who they are\nBut but at the end of the day I just want the buccaneers too when football I don't care who the quarterback is I don't care if it's Ryan Griffin our third string quarterback becomes that looks like the mixed a coming of a Drew Brees I don't care I I've been a fan or way longer than James has been alive\nYeah family Jamieson is retired hopefully I live that long I'm saying it doesn't matter I Will just fan when many types of radios are quarterback on Trent ... who's our quarter back when a\nJudge Johnson Jeff Carr C. Erickson Josh Freeman\nYeah everybody I was a fair when God damn seems was our quarter back\nWay back then yeah it does it matter I Love my team they represent my city that I Love and I want them to be successful what takes up a fire everybody and build it up from the ground I don't care loyal to anybody but my city I'm a team they're still\nTen games left so let's see over and we have no easy games coming up yeah we got the stupid forty niners you to talk of giant giant\nI mean we have one of the games but we have to win this week against Carolina and I believe sadly fitzpatrick probably the best he probably is\nA it is sad in in in ways but then I look at a statistics he's he's done well he's done better\nAnd I still I still think James wants them to do the fickle player and he seemed to play I just know Fitz Patrick Patrick's inconsistent right yes he's either like on fire or he just garbage ... hot and garbage really that bad yeah\nHe's in a whole it's just a matter of time category four wheels come off and it's already happened twice this year right in front of us had a really bad habits\nI mean it's just going to happen that's that's the player he is you could trust him as a back up but you can't trust him to be your fulltime quarterback to be your ... you just can't\nMan I like the guy and I love the whole hoopla around the fits magic and I love how he hyped up the team my thing is and this is the point that I haven't made yet and I I'm going to make it fast we can move on my point is\nHe inspires the team to play better so when he's on the field and it's you could say oh you do is watch yeah when he's on the field the other ten guys play better than they do when James is on the field it\nJust like their expectations are hired they're more things are going to win more they have more confidence betcha they really they believe me how much that makes a difference in how easily done maybe they don't like James because of his off the field stuff you know what I mean sure you never know you do you know of any\nCan be so offering and meet him an awkward you're going to be shown\nAlley it'll be awkward and when he\nMade me he's coming into my town my turf\nYes oh you're just big uprising a giant R. and B. superstar\nI ...

[laughter]\nUm but it says you're crowd funding campaign foreign by two Muslim groups has raised over a hundred and fifty K. for the victims of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting which killed eleven um so that's fantastic you know\nThat's the one what is happening in our country every ... every other day no it's it's it's it's even if it in something\nTerrible that that that the people killing people for four in St Louis is it's it's it's just it's just awful\nYeah I Know but I Know and it's it's very disheartening but I mean there's we have no choice but to just keep pressing on yeah yeah I mean do you can't you can't you can't do any\nI mean you have to realize that this is a very very isolated incident Vic about all the interactions happen on line every day either in person or on line\nThat people say terrible things to each other this is one of the freak occurrences where some this guy actually you know went out there to do something I it's so rare and this guy I'm sure we're going to find out more about um\nI'm not going to be surprised if he was a a loner like this other bomber guy was ostracized from society and just felt like you had nothing to lose at that point and went out and did you have to have some sort of mental illness to do something like this I mean\nBut you everybody bad when you bring up ...\nLet's bring these incidents like this off the ... the topic\nOf the others that whether a great point I Want to okay I'll let you finish I'm Sorry go ahead\nOr just after incidents like this you have\nDoing I agree I agree I Do think that those those stores you get a lot more attention thank you for calling and we appreciate your phone call\nLove you guys stay well ... thank you I I think the reason\nWhy I'm Sorry go on ... please hang up images that were all that stuff um\nI think the reason why and and I think there is an evolutionary reason why we pay more ... a close attention to to drama and conflict and threats because those are central to our survival\nYou know if if we want to pay more attention we're going to be on a high a vigilant alert around things that are stressful or things that are potential threats because those could harm us yeah and the media knows that so nobody nobody wants to hear about a good news story but those are clearly not as captivating as something that can incite fear paranoia\nAnd anxiety those things draw our attention because they incite more emotion when you see something nice it's like you see it it makes you cry for that moment and then you're over but something that's negative something like this I mean\nI was thinking about the synagogue you know on yesterday like all day just thinking about people dying they thinking about people like the guy Kentucky on people just getting blown up all those sorts of things obviously attract a lot more attention\nAnd draw more attention to those situations because people are afraid that it's going to happen to them\nYeah and then in a twenty four hour news cycle with the twenty four hour news NOW News never stops there used to be washed up five or six and then over yet yeah CNN came along and then the Internet came along and oh my God forget it and then it became not only did these you know CNN and Fox just report what's going on\nIt became part is and they had pundits starting to speak on these things and then they would not only\nTell you the news but why this happened and that wasn't really their job to begin with they were just supposed to tell you what happened right and then the commentators right arm him and I think that's part of the reason why we're in this debacle now we're we're farther apart than ever\nBecause these cable news networks on the Internet just points to fingers at the other side they talk about toning down rhetoric but then\nComplain and say that you know our president's Hitler for example but then when I was to tone down their rhetoric and said you also need to tone down everybody needs to tone it down which is true we do everybody's got to relax and really focus here on what the issues are and get your emotions out of these\nNew absolutely and you have to be aware of the fact that the people who are the loudest often times or the people that are most most extreme and often the people that know the least\nThe ... the solution seems so clear when you only have a few facts no\nCare okay great yeah everybody like when you just have a few facts that you're basing your decision on this the conclusions and the solutions seem crystal clear but as you begin to learn more and I mean I feel like then I Would speak for well as well we're constantly look him news trying to learn the facts\nTrying to get to the truth and I feel like the more information we take in the more we understand how complex these issues are it's not just an a or B sort of writing it becomes there's lots of gray areas and once you kind of get a grip on that\nYou have a lot more sympathy for the people on both sides of the issue I understand why you're afraid of that\nI understand why does make you uncomfortable where can we kind of meat in the middle and when you become more understanding understanding you become more compassionate to the people who maybe are a bit different than you and not just different in terms of skin color because diversity needed to go a little bit\nDeeper than skin not just because you're black you're white you all think the same you're not very diverse ... to me is diversity of thought absolutely alright I'll ask all before we go to break 'em stay well 'cause this\nUh this is not that Matt\nI'm I completely agree with what you're saying about the people who are the loudest usually the time it will like go out there\nFor the number yet at the cost of Koran but with the the whole race or things like that and then it's really sad\nWhat happened in like August ... and I believe fully that the guy desserts and he's crazy out of his mind but um I I feel like the world that we live and yeah they put out a lot of negativity arm idiot stuff like that you guys do you just\n... or what's the ... of course like that from time to time and voice your opinion um but I I feel like you're much that is put out more good that's put out\nMaybe we'll get a little more um I grew up in a small town I was saying there was segregated literally Blackfoot on one side of the highway and like look on the other ... and to this day it's still kind of like that but\nThe the racism has gone down and I feel like it's not just to change it arms because every time I feel like racism is is more than ever and I feel\nLike it's a choice to disagree\nAnd I I chose I Choose to love everybody the same regardless I feel like people if if there is a bad person if you have a reason to not like someone there shouldn't be could be because of their race or religion it should just because they're a crappy person\nAnd then I don't I don't know I I just feel like that I agree I agree that they should we should learn to love each other more\nLove each other and we'll end on that note for this first segment that you so much for calling and we really appreciate it\nAlready\nAnd like you don't want to continue this we're going to move on but I Want to talk about what this woman said about blaming the rhetoric of others basically this woman is saying I Want to say\nDonald Trump caused this event but his words his rhetoric is possibly part of the problem and part of the cars that leads to this rise in hate crime so we were going to play that

picture\nA sexy picture of me from Sunday's paper where they were the not for the shop capture that says I'm handsome now knows right in the paper I saw a then there's some pictures on the air from the uh from the pub crawl and of course advertisement for the punch out and then the random pictures that are\nThe ... century the photo shop pictures of climate and Spanish teacher my favorite Spanish as the little midget\nYeah Peter ... guy by the way than anybody see the uh Peter ... movie no\nIs it out yet I saw the other day I guess it was like an HBO movie or something oh really I don't know what I'm watching\nIt it was actually pretty dumb but pretty cool this how you actually watch it yeah so it's called my night with Hervey and it's about this reporter who stayed with him for the whole night and they fail no a male okay and then he tells his story to this reporter as\nAll night goes on about how he was on top of the world with um fantasy island and then it just all fall\nI'm yeah I'm looking at it to see where it is a word is playing into that but I saw like a preview for it and he's painting a check who's a little thick whatever but hot and like big bugs and stuff and everything and he's painting or any\nDoes that and then he just feels like this and he puts the papers down and then runs in John ... and they just back there like jumping in Iowa so the idea is that a Hervey village\nShows a midget and he was a French committed he was born in France and he was an artist and he never had the acceptance of his parents certainly not his mother because he was a little person she always kind of\nAh she I think she was more worried that he was going to be treated unfairly and he was always trying to get her acceptance and he ended up leaving he's inspired to come here inspired by television and movies to come to the United states and become a big star\nSo he comes over here and he makes it into the James Bond man with the golden gun movie mhm and he thinks at that point that he's a big star and then he's living in his van after that gives you can't get my work\nAnd then his agent tracked him down and says we've got something else for you and it was fantasy island and I didn't know this fence was on the seventies and eighties so I didn't I did certainly didn't know any of the behind the scenes stuff so I guess tattoo had become such a big\nStar and that you know the advantage island that they wanted to do more with him but Ricardo multiple on was the star so he was like constantly like well I uh so they would have conflicts all the time and he ended up drinking and ... and girls and then\nHe got married and he cheated on his wife and then there was guns involved and he will crazy little midget man and he's going to strip clubs to spend hundreds of\nDollars or so that was on HBO came out on October twenty as a also in there is a Jamie ... who I Would imagine probably plays the or the reporter guy yes ah he is in a great show did you ever watched the fall\nNo it's really good I've watched the fall guy no you should watch the fall it's a really good ...\nAh he is he was terrible and Hervey saying oh well he's great and there are Gillian Anderson is in there and she is a detective he is I'll give you a little bit he's a killer oh like people don't know if you've had a family and everything is\nThat right yeah it's
