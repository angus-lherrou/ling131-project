US soldiers that oversees the fight against terrorism and cheer any\nIn other countries I think we should definitely more in the last of someone who was almost as Americans and get a doing so without teammates without weapons or rifles and she was just doing it with him and he went to a country where the U.S is afraid to and it's too greedy to stand up to\nA Saudi Arabia a country that still has many slavery that still will cut off your head in the street in a public execution\nFor something as petty as being a gay or thievery a and I I think it takes a lot of guts to do that especially under the threat of debt and I think it's a terrifying that it happened to have not in Saudi Arabia lot of people are getting killed in Saudi Arabia huge building just bull church and none of the civilized country that as a tourist destination city\nAnd it is it's frankly terrifying that a country that we're in bed with like that that still does these terrible things could be so brazen to go into a civilized city like dissemble or there's American tourists all over the streets and they could go in there to\nKill the guy really and then burn documents out in the back of the video of that happening inside a lot about you know what I think for you know what he essentially you sacrifice his life for a cause that I think is incredibly commendable and I think as Americans\nWe should seriously mourn his last as we would any soldier of us are\nAll right Elliott appreciate it thanks for sharing that with ... with everything you said All right I think he's right on point what we have

[noise]\nBig story today more moms and their bombs in their gun in their moms\n\nSorry [noise]\nWe need some sort of like a bomb checker like no pun intended but like where we can keep track of how many there are and we're like Penn right now they're popping up all over the place yeah\nBite in with that one today or his address them Robert De Niro data and she says more right in our backyard the whole county sheriff's office\nYeah yeah yeah it's happening uh luckily nothing has blown up yet [noise] ah but yeah all these uh these pipe bombs that seems to be the same kind of a device they're not real I don't know elaborate a but then again they're not blowing up either\nAnd I said this or do you guys earlier the scary thing to me is\nIs they're gonna have to they're going to have to keep up in the game like if these things aren't blowing up what's next somebody should be like you know what they're not scared any more one of these ... going to have to blow up challenging them I'm not challenging no I'm just saying it's about terror right\nYeah and I'm already kind of like a another bomb showed up you know and it's only been two days that this has been happening\nUh it looks to me like yeah it's it's scary not like asking for anything right you know so it just scares hack threats where\nIt's scary but if they do this for two months and nothing blows up we're just can be like All right we get it you hey you know you have liberals we get it you know like just stop with your stupid bombs and then somebody's going to go oh\nRuth ... did you know certainly\nMore than a psychopath is gonna really blow something up and that's certainly they haven't caught whoever already they're gonna have to I mean there are too smart they have to do that sort of picking manual you're talking\nAbout this last night I'm thinking if they don't catch anybody that it was an inside job ah what I mean\nIt's great to look more and more like me but we were generally have the capabilities to define whoever this was and find them quickly especially if the FBI gets involved but if we somehow can't track anyone\nYeah I mean probably sending it to themselves I don't know that's what that that is a theory yeah\nSo uh I don't know Seventy seven five seven nine one or two five eight hundred seven seven woman oh two five I mean I Know as much as you know we read the same articles we watch the same I watched a little bit of a\nA different news outlets to try to get a different angles on it or if I was I watch CNN and they were talking about a lot and then I flip it over to Fox\nAnd they were talking about like something completely like light hearted and different and I was like may Kelly in blackface different like even more now I hardly now and say well\nWhy don't you let me set up the big stories better by [noise]\nAs on already spoiled his or her next big story [noise]\nAnd this is crazy 'cause I was listening to the my Cal to show this morning\nSuper agent Tony burden called him\nAnd they were talking about the Megan Kelly thing and it's I don't know if it's just like minded people are are just I don't know sensible people\nWe were kind of like on the same page with this thing\nTo like blackface is wrong\nBut blackface is not what Megan Kelly was defending\nWhen she had to go and apologize I don't think she was I'm not saying she's totally right but I don't think she's\nWrong either I don't think she was saying do black female mocking like menstrual sort of way ... like yeah you don't want to do that what she's dead\nOr not verbatim what I'm ... paraphrasing here but what she said was if you go dressed as a significant character is a black person yes and you decide to dark and the pigment of your skin with makeup\nHuh that there's really nothing\nLook I don't think there is either no I think it's a gamble I think if you do it you\nGot to know that there's going to be people that are going to be brought her you've\nGot to know that it's dumb don't do it for those reasons but I don't think that in just me speaking obviously the case by case basis for the most part if you do it like Megan Kelly said I I don't I don't think that's very ... it's a\nGamble like you don't want to offend people so it's all how you present it\nLike we're out of the ... last year if some idiot white dude came by a with a giant afro on and he had shoe polish himself and he was like flavor flavor you remember him yeah I remember ... was a horrible like he looked like a racist a whole like he looked like an idiot like\nYou all by like let me\nAnd it was like legit she'll polish all over him no no Whitey no\nThat's wrong you can't do that and that's what my capitals same as when he was like look you obviously can't do the al ... Amos and Andy thing yes\nThat is mocking people especially your mocking a time where white actors were doing this\nTo just brutally brutally\nStereotype black actors and black people which is why there were no black actor what it was just black people are worried and they would make them where I Know I have that as well yeah so but they would they were basically mocking the entire race\nTrying to make them look stupid and looked like ... ... it was horrible horrible horrible so yeah I think that's what you do for Halloween\nThen you're jerk off and you deserve the repercussions like you deserve it likes to my kids dress\nGood you get fired from your TV show\nGood right but I I really I mean of course we're talking about making Kelly she didn't even do it she was just kind of Jimmy

I Want to say she's very reasonable Persia\nAnd absolutely I'm not to say that everybody on Fox News isn't reasonable or CNN is a reasonable but she's she's probably in the middle but kind of hangs to the right um but she kind of can hang with everybody and she even said that she's not really a PC type of person and so she was very candid\nAnd honest on the show about how she found she was like listen if you're not being if you're not making a mockery of blackface and your impersonating Diana Ross or you know another prominent black figure and society then that's that's fine\nYeah and I even heard of this morning saying even talking about is like I don't really see anything wrong with what she said and to be honest with you I don't really either\nUm I Know that there are people who have been calling for racist\nNow she I don't again like we talked about before I don't want to assume I Know what that lives in in people's minds but judging from those comments alone I Would say that making tally is not a racist and at the very very most at the very most she could be\nMaybe she made a racially insensitive comment at most that's\nThe thing that's what I think that we're not racist right racist\nAnd something being racial involving race race specific and people just get lazy and then they call it racist yeah no I don't I don't think it's racist which is a racist I'm looking at the dictionary definition go ahead as a person who shows or feels discrimination or prejudice against\nPeople of other races of\nOr who believe that a particular race is superior to another\nDefinitely not begging Ali or what she said again I don't want to pretend like I Know what lives in people's minds ... right so we got it obviously we can never know I don't know you might be racist I like ... you don't nobody knows but judging by her actions and judging by her words which is all that we have\nI Would say they're making Kelly is not a God damn races she said something that maybe could have been perceived as racially insensitive or you know but that is the that is it you can't say that she is a racist based on those comments but people are calling her that and she got her show can\nOnly or were you guys think about it Seventy seven five seven nine one oh two five do you think the punishment fits the crime honestly I think this was just a cover up I think the show is\nGonna be tanked any ways apparently ratings drop like thirty percent or something crazy I'm so she wasn't doing very well as it was and now she is gone by by so I Want to hear you guys have to say about that um do you think that\nBlack face is a big ... should we even call it I feel bad calling a black man they feel like there should be a ... I did not a discrimination but I'm a difference between\nWhat they did in the ... and those sort of performances and then like darkening your skin to look like a prominent black\nPerson in society you know what I mean there's definitely I mean once a mockery where you have like a horror on your face and others like your your you know putting a little bit more pigment on your face you can closely resemble she looked like Diana Ross and so you don't look like share basic rights you know what I mean it\nSort of thing well as like the guys are just be white or Jimmy hendrix and Jimi Hendrix isn't white and re in my mind it's more offensive to appropriate Jimi Hendrix as white than it would be to just kind of I don't know but some makeup on your skin ranger or just don't be Jimmy ... if that's what makes people feel better about the seats move\nHate it I don't like it or not worth it at our fire\nIs not worth it and especially in positions of like Megan Kelly or I'm it's so sad because it's like you want to be edgy you wanna she wasn't being Eddie she was just answering a question candidly and she got it on for a yeah I think that's ridiculous I I\nHave trouble and well not that she walked away with it I think sixty million dollars a okay I don't feel so bad so I mean if the bad but she can just ... I don't know just go retired live on an island or something you know blood\nJohnny and I were talking a\nWhere we think that all the people who've been can whether it be from like me to or or this sort of thing I I feel like they still do podcasts like Roseanne Bill O'Reilly Megyn Kelly Matt Lauer Charlie Rose they'll just get together and like hang out and do a pod cats\nI I'd heard I'd watch Roseanne on Rogan she wants to do that when she talks to other people have been publicly shamed and you know pretty much banned from pop culture because she wants to do that yeah maybe she will she looks really good for age yeah she\nDoes all that are looking better she lost a lot of weight in the last Twenty years probably 'cause she you know smoke so much which is disgusting habit you should quit I'm your and say well because this\nIs Josh Josh oh\nHuh well well my daughter so\nWell Rachel dolls there were only about ...\n... nobody was out of our own horse or the ... ... ... people were much she kinda got offers of I don't know what happened was she kind of ended up bouncing back and she's still\nLately he saw her face some where she was mentioned somewhere in the last year but no she she was like one of one of the top leaders of the N. double ACP and she was completely ostracized she lost her job she lost everything yeah I Wonder how she how did she get how did again that's so bizarre\nA question that but the thing is to me that what I find to be so bizarre thank you so much for the phone call um what I find to be so bizarre is that the cultural appropriation has such a negative connotation and in my mind\nLike when you mix someone it's like the highest form of flattery ... you're not memory like when I see like how I was watching Instagram videos the other day and there's this really really amazing a Filipino hip hop dance or that I watch and she's she's on another level like the best of all the answers in the world she's like\nA heads but they're in their late twenties\nThey came out of your body right yeah ... alright alright alright mystery solved thank you so much and again thank you thank you\nI don't know if that was due to disillusion it is I figured it out on what it is if you want to go as a celebrity right what he wanted to go is Jimmy hendrix Hugo whereas zombie Jimi Hendrix so that way you when you paint your face you paint it like a zombie and you'll get his army mask or something and that's your way around it\nAnd write darkening your faith though maybe but you it's your ... your green you're not brown or anything your green and like you just you know you're not black you could just be white you know do you understand what I'm saying and I\nFeel like you're trying to play devil's no I've I've I really don't understand why it has to be like a zombie yeah I get it either so ... yeah and you get the afro on ran the bell bottoms and the guitar yeah and then ... Jimmy hendrix so you can still be Jimi Hendrix and you can also still be scary for Halloween alone and you know scary no ...\nNo no no it's it's if you want to but this is a workaround because this fulfills my idea that Halloween costume she'll be scary but then you can also be someone that you were here like my friend when he was ... All right I just I thought you were talking about the getting around black face like painting your face but it's not black and green\nWell kind of you are but you're you know you're you're still being the person they want to be so if you wanted to be beyond say on a you can be zombie young say so you could you could paint your face like a zombie and I like girls\nAround the world girl at such a song and I'm actually embarrassed to be a growing there and I thought oh it's horrible so I'm young stay well because this\nGuy do this\nRule calling you guys in the crowd you'll Alassane or doing\nSomething about people oh I have an idea so called yesterday about the whole black Tracey I call it will actually call it ... the\nWhole thing off color okay you're ... you have to say all those words or you can't say like you know the first word and then just a faith you got the coloring your faith\nOr ... or ... or ... or if you're doing like a race or a marathon soon\nOh we're doing it they have well I Do a tank can and will give me\nYour ears night do you I I think you don't have a problem doing a color how about this how about you how about you dress up is Diana Ross and run the barest are\nYour what motivates you know why you want to get to see people chasing the motivation of ... going to pay to play to don't don't you feel as though\nI like it I'm going to dress up like zombie Jimi Hendrix oh\nAnd that will be the last day well okay [laughter] I don't know if I Want to take that chance man I I'm not ...\nIf I were to put my my ... my career on the line it's definitely not going to be for doing blackface then I'll play it on a\nNot has not worth it [laughter] to how ... what is your again I think you told us that I forgot I Am Puerto Rican that's right okay I feel like you can get away with a lot more than willing I can or you are you lighters miner darker skin\nOh I'm\nA little skin or they're black Puerto Ricans yeah\nYes I Am afro Puerto Rican cook a blue eyed blonde hair cut\nYeah they had to run the gamut my old neighbor used to be or she is Puerto Rican but she looked like she was from Ireland she had like red hair yeah there's people that immigrated there so you know\nAnd the racism there too you know black Puerto Rican you said like by the ... or blue\nOr share on their women I I've heard that everywhere\nThat it's like it's like Asian they don't like other Asians Puerto Ricans like hate all the other like Caribbean countries and vice versa\nWell look well treated some porridge an outlet for sure you all the world we are the children\nAbsolutely absolutely but originally quote what what's your honest opinion row of Mexicans not good right\nNow you know what I have no problem it's\nJust humid yeah what about you and I ... ... ... works\nI just said hey are you looking to in order to bring up their jokes and you're listening to you know a joke of the I'm like you know what role ...\nYeah I work I tell people can what's your least favorite of the of in the territory Raul\nAt least as far as what ethnicity let me see I don't like a a among look let me see um [noise]\nUh I don't know eighty\nNine I got a crew for I hate to say that's probably the worst one and just say why people telling you know no ...

is it three the gambling the government was right around\n... voters in charge which sounds like a wonderful thing because voters should be in charge boaters in charge of gambling you will control gambling and big casinos but I'm afraid of any amendment that has backed over twenty million dollars by Disney\nAnd the seminal hard rock hotel and casino right they're both backing this and they don't even try to hide it they're not a shame you know you have an organization that wants to sway an election they create an el Sisi or something like\nSuzy's queen cookies doesn't like child abuse and you're like oh wow wow I'm I'm was suzy's clean cookie I'm no I'm I'm I'm because even them money because I'm against child abuse and then you find out Suzie queens cookies is this special interest group\nYou know and then all of a sudden you're bamboozled hey at least Disney and that and the some of those are going yep we're having money as we don't want any gambling in the state of Florida except what we've got and the easiest way to describe this as as the way I did on the bike counter show\nIf this laws passed people in South Florida people on the east coast people up in the panhandle will make a decision on what's good for the Tampa Bay area for example\nFor example let me put this into play hurricane Michael just decimated the panhandle of Florida for the last four years they're fishing industry up there and especially the oyster industry\nHas been really rough and they used to be the place to go for ... was the Florida Panhandle bay county Walton county in Santa Rosa county those areas now let's say there's this small town in the Florida Panhandle just lost everything to Mike\nAnd their oyster industry has gone fishing industry has gone they don't get the tourist dollars that Disney gets no they sure as hell don't get the tourist dollars that Daytona gets with Daytona five hundred bike week by Tobar fest\nNumber one European market outside of Disney for tourist in this state outside of Canadians coming to our west coast is Europeans heading to South Beach ones with the money they got a lot of tourists dollars down in South Florida you know and a lot of them coming up from South Africa spending their pesos and Tampa Bay area does pretty good when it comes to raking in detour\nAll dollar dig without whales tour as AIG money we ain't got no we we were in trouble yes\nWhat's the panhandle guy not a whole lot of redneck Riviera maybe a little bump during spring break but even that has gone down in the last couple of years so you got this small town let's say Milton in Santa Rosa county\nAnd they set up there and they see and I'm just going to pull the number out of my as\nThey they do it as count and they go into what we're watching five thousand cars a week\nDrive right through our town go into Biloxi to gamble and not only cars charter buses because charter buses do run from the old folks homes here in Florida to take them to play the ... and you've also got special airfare packages the fly out of the airports like St Pete\nAnd they go up there and they have special weekend packages you get room for wanted the boat ... above ... I've done it and it sounds like you've done it I've done it yet and us Galvin he lived in the panhandle he ... he and his brother used to drive over all the time to play blackjack invalid what you do so that small town in the Florida Panhandle says\nFive thousand cars going through here but they're not even buying gas here they're not stopping at our restaurants they're driving straight through you know if we had a casino let's call it a bit defensive line okay and we could keep that gambling money in Florida and have the state of Florida tax it and race in revenue keep it from going to Biloxi\nSounds like a winter sounds like a winter for Santa Rosa county the small town of melting if they wanted to do that it would have to go on a statewide referendum\nDisney in Orlando would have to approve it do you think they're going to do they have the money to run an ad campaign to defeat that casino sure as hell they do to people in South Florida\nAgree that the panhandle should have a casino up there because they are also going to be the ones making the decision ... what about Jacksonville what about Daytona what about the big cities on the east coast all the way down the line but that's the ... but that's the American invasion somebody in\nThe illusion county should somebody in Miami Dade Broward decide what's good for the Florida Panhandle they decide what's good for the Tampa Bay area if we decide down the road\nThat we would like more than one casino a little competition maybe\nThe word should is not a great word because there's a lot of things that should happen incident happens out that ... you're going to happen should know it does happen\nBig companies squash a little company yep that when this is what they're trying to do ... I'm Sorry and I'll tell you right now they're trying to do what they're going to do it I Will tell you right now they're going to do in a lot of money to fight\nThe Florida Legislature has after ... when it came to any gambling in the last ten years that I can remember it earlier in the state of Florida they've him didn't hard they've guidance committee are they still haven't signed a new deal with the Seminoles and I'm not knock on the hard rock I'm not knocking the mourners weekend yeah I'm not knocking them\nI'm just saying I Am for competition and I for opening the doors but I'm also for freedom of choice if an area of Florida has the need and says we want it here I don't believe that people of South Florida should make a decision what's good for them\nBecause I don't want to make the decision what's good for South Florida because I don't live they were wrecked\nCorrect I don't know well ... does have our problems with the people making decisions in our community and other communities have no idea what's happening with the news they really do yeah I mean that's that's I think that's a nationwide problem and it's it comes down to money\nThe way this has written and the way that the ads run on the radio or all written it's very confusing and I've I've heard I've heard people say well I'm for gambling here in the state of Florida I'm voting yes and there was like well then you just squashed it it's all you have to just watch\nIt all worth the money you could make something sounded like whatever you wanted to sell my\nAnd another point here this is not just casino gambling my friend there are some groups out there that run charity raffles that are keeping an eye on this how is this going to affect our charity raffles especially the ones that are for the ... the American legion\nHuh is the fact that Yes sir alright ... U.S Supreme court ruled last year sports book should be nationwide shouldn't be held to Vegas latest ads are\nFive billion not a million five billion a year taking in in Las Vegas sports oh yeah nationwide Americans that one hundred billion dollars that leave feeling that means Ninety five percent correct\nOf gambling on football games baseball games college basketball all done through offshore accounts and bookies\nAnd let me tell you what really out of scarier Biloxi is working on setting up their sports book they've already got the casinos urban because that's another reason why cars will be drugged driving through the Florida Panhandle leaving money\nIn the pockets of Biloxi and not leaving it here in the state of Florida that could be taxed and put to good use\nOf those people care I don't know if it goes off enough people know about I don't think enough people are doing their homework and studying every one of these amendments you know and it's amendment a six year this Marcy law\nThis victims rights the scares the crap outta me in\nBecause it's first of all set up by a guy whose sister and if you read the story it set up by a guy named Nicholas out in California is a millionaire started with nothing and created an empire and his sister when it was going to college in California was stocked raped and murdered\nAnd her name was Marcy and that's why this is Marcy law and this is something this guy has been pushing nationwide just not the state of Florida it's appearing on many ballots\nBut it's this victims rights thing and it scares me because\nWe already have victims rights in the state of Florida we already have that why do we need enough and yes you do oh yeah of course with All right yeah you're notified of parole hearings you're allowed to voice yourself and your opinion and parole hearings you're allowed to appear in court you get all the court noticed as as a victim you weren't notified when somebody bonds out of jail\nAnd that's what that says it's going to do but it also adds a lot more to it that will squash due process and if I\nThe defendant I'm accused of something in either a civil court or a criminal record and I want to process all ... and what's going to happen is it's going to turn our courts into courts of emotion and not courts of law and that's a bad thing\nThat's a real bad thing and it also makes up the appeals process\nI and it also ... you've been a good boy you did get in trouble but you're behind bars and you went out for early release and you haven't got in trouble behind bars it ... let's see this is another one of these bundle amendment and I'm voting all these bundles amendments I think are unconstitutional I'm In my opinion I'm not a lawyer I think they're illegal well not only my opinion\nI think there are that's the goal ... and I agree there are that's a cool 'cause you can fix bundle up to things that are in two totally different sides of the spectrum but you have to make a decision and that that's not right you shouldn't be making a decision about", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Sarasota", "day": "26"}
