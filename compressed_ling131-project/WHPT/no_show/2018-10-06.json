that was very very sorry I'm very sorry uh yeah so apparently there was a vote today and they call it a cloture vote is that right ... I don't know how to look up what that word beds\nI it just a it's a procedural vote eventually does it the vote before the vote what do you live oh before the vote so for some reason I don't understand why they have like a preliminary vote I imagine all the people that are confirming him today will also confirmed him tomorrow for the final votes\nSo it's kind of like a I think of it is like the the the primary almost like they're going to vote for who they are going to vote for sort of thing and we got you on and so apparently there were four\nSenators that they were kind of uh making the big decision okay just turned out okay we're back there were four senators that were kind of like the uh the key players here in terms of if Kavanaugh is going to get ... ... not necessarily the nomination but if the process was going to continue\nDefining moment was today it was actually the defining moment of her political career Senator Susan Collins of Maine said friday she will join fellow Republicans in voting to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court and they move likely to clinch president Donald Trump's second nomination to the high\nCourt columns has been under immense pressure since the Republican presidents nominated cabin on August it heightened last month after three women came forward and accused him of sexual assault so uh the nomination\nIs pretty much secured and then tomorrow is the final vote and we will all find out if Brett Kavanaugh goes to the Supreme Court\nI how do we feel about that I'm highly even care\nI'm I'm okay with it for the simple fact that he's not been charged he's not been nothing's been proven if if it if for some reason something came out and he was guilty of this\nThat I might side with I N o K maybe we

I don't know that I didn't think you can get her ... okay let me stop talking about thrilled with direction you baby style do quote hello daddy okay but [laughter]\nI'm not that people are fed issues that's not what I find bizarre I find it bizarre that people are making money off this when there's so much free content on the Internet [laughter]\nHow was how many minutes well paying for porn or for pictures of feet you can learn really look up sexy feet and like a million images will show up on Google Search why are people spending money on this how how are they doing this and how can I get involved\nCould it be possibly because this way yeah you can just look at random pictures of the but the speed that they are paying this lady to see are connected to a body\nAnd brain so they can kind of get to know this person as a whole as opposed to just you know there are obviously interested in the feet number one but there are still more to the feet\nIf that makes any sense there is something\nI Know there it's it's something that's called a fin Dahmer financial domination Mm oh yeah it's it's a it's a it's a culture actually I have a whole you're All right I have a few friends like napping right now [laughter]\nUm it's it's like we were on and I were talking earlier it's it's this woman is it's a sub Don type thing okay she is dominating these men and women who want\nTo see

financial dominant I have a friend that\nThat's to actually it's funny you bring this up they must be pretty common more common than we think and what I Do my friend doesn't want anything in return he

have it I mean yeah you have sexual relations with women at all\nAh yeah he does and he's even some of the girls that he is taking care of he has but not all of them I don't think anyways I don't know how how prevalent he tried to explain actually on a cruise last cruise you when I tried to explain this to me I was blitz thought in my mind is then does he get ...\nHe's a very good friend yeah one of my time I don't think you I don't think you know you have to use his name in fact I asked him about it before if he would and he's not\nJust free money like you know young enough to do anything

yeah I mean I guess you could set up like he's just sort of a wish list and you can just buy it for you and then you know but I don't know if that means lingerie or that means\nIt just sounds like it like anything anything that you would want if they choose if it's close to what it is a\nYou know a pan for cooking does that mean you have to take photos of using them being like\nOh ... absolutely

I think I did deserve it but I also think you shouldn't have done it does that make some do\nAnd I know I feel like those two things are mutually exclusive no they're not what are you what are you talking about who deserved it yeah but she certainly has done it though but if you deserved it that means that you don't you should have got would die like hunting gym that's teaching violence that violence is okay and they need to rethink your pap [laughter]\nWell it's better than a\nHitting his slapping and faith but hitting is wrong and make no ... no I understand\nIt's not really ... it's counter intuitive I understand but I also don't think it's a good thing but I don't I didn't get really like um I mean didn't happen very often I remembered my dad's making me one time my mom slapped me I think twice so you're saying\nThat you deserve that like you warranted that sort of punishment I make any money should have had enough self restraint not to do it you know he had the quote unquote green light right\nSo I'm trying to get that right what ever happened to the good old wash 'em up I was so oh my mom did that to me yes I\nKnow I'm a little when I met him to my son a couple of times that I put like a drop of soap on my finger and I I put it like ... killer oh ice ... doing the math [laughter] are you in the mankind with a man will cooperate on yourself or not we're not there I've ever done\nThat my my parents I knew I knew some people who like their parents would play like psychological mind games with them like they'd say you know go pick a switch and then go to the bathroom and then they would have the weight there for like forty minutes and then they would take them out so they'd have the anticipation\nThat's cruel yeah my parents I mean my dad and my mom I think my mom\nMy mom told me she ... she spank me one time and then she cried but I was ... to\n... my dad in my to my father's memory spank me one time and I was like twelve or Thirteen and him and I were really having a one of a rare fights ... um\nHe's spank me on the uh smacked me cross space so and then immediately grabbed me and hugged me and said I'm so sorry don't ever make me do that again and he never that's the\nOnly time I've what did you do I don't even remember ... I Know I remember we were fighting about something if I were in his garage and I'd pop in the mouth and I don't even remember crying I remember how shocked I was 'cause my dad is ... my dad never hit my sister my dad has not\nA violent guy I Know and not he's not even impulsive like that but that day\nWas a bad day and he immediately hugged me and was what did you do and what did you do are justified it I don't remember what I said I was twelve or through college or know how did that no 'cause he's not so but as far as me like my mom what do you not\nKnow what you really you know I only by definition [laughter] no I um my mom was the one that caught a road\nWith a heavy fist but she never she didn't like beat us she was we knew that if we did something so bad when we were real young kids it was bent over your knee and smacked with about a couple of times but it was ever getting erections when your mom's by okay but I Want to know\n[laughter] I always will ask that question when he was like all comfortable with [laughter] ...\nI'm ...

cheerleaders\nApparently this country and this is what the articles that this country and its treatment of women are starting to change for the better yet they're still such a long way to go and sports can be a part of that change how you actually get rid of cheerleaders I mainly talking about the NFL although NBA dance teams and the wrinkles in boxing at the same category\nThere are thirty NFL teams and twenty six of them have cheerleaders and today it's our including the Tampa Bay bucks and let's be on it\nThey're not there to cheer on the team the NFL games have fifty thousand fans who don't need encouragement in that area sharing the Syria and the massive loud stadium you can't even hear the cheerleaders you can see them\nNecessarily notice them when I watch a football game I haven't been to a football game I Can't even remember the last ... but like on TV there they show them a lot of times they show when they come back from commercial yeah it's very you know if\nI don't think I Would miss them per se but from the aspect of this is something that they\nThey're passionate about and they love doing because they don't get compensated fairly for it but they have to love doing it\nAnd they get on TV they get to go to all the game for free and stuff like that huge that's so cool as part of the reason why I wanted to do like you know since our professional dancing sort of thing but I didn't make\nIt and I promise you that if if you're a ... part of the cheerleading squad that gets to go to the super bowl the the ... you probably get more for that too mhm like officials in the NFL they're graded on how the officiate cheerleaders I guarantee you are the same way\nI Do agree 'cause not all all NFL teams have cheerleaders are some that you have not had right when he sticks out of what forty thirty to thirty two so most of them do but I agree you know maybe they should be compensated\nYou know better more generously by the team it is only a ... what eight games that they are actually you know working at it they don't travel with the team or anything right\nI I think some of them do actually really I Know yeah but I mean it you know again and then you can look at it from the fact that\nThey're getting free air fare free and getting their food and water parents may are perks but again you're here you're you're\nTraining for you're putting your body through the rigorous training of I don't know how long they\nTrain for a you know I mean [laughter]\nI mean they do their routines and stuff and I agree maybe we could take the teams can break 'em off a little bit more than what they're doing now I mean you know especially if they're you know it is only for sixteen weeks that they're really working but just paying a little bit and I think that would shut these other\nOh goes up because at least they're making money and you know it's a the guys are out there you know playing it's worth putting their bodies on the line they're using their bodies and they're being compensated as well so shot up and let the girl dance or they want to dance\nThat are not listen I I did dance team in college and all through high school and stuff I had a

I remember I was watching or listening to a rogue and podcasts and they said that like a good night's sleep is like twelve times can improve your your mood twelve times as much as\nA um an anti depressant bill and so like\nAnti depressive uh antidepressants\nOnly like take the edge off they don't make you really happier they just take the edge off which is what some people need sometimes sometimes the edges between you killing yourself and not killing yourself writer but if you really want to improve your mood had a good night's rest go out in the sunny eat better and move your body and you feel so much better\nI feel amazing when I get done with that run I don't know if there's they say there's a runner's high and I I think that that's just being able to stop running now like you're just finished running a highly thank God\nYeah but I Do I feel better the rest of the day I can tell my mood is different mhm are you more energy I have more energy and the more I don't really need coffee in the morning oh wow that yeah I can say oh run and white and blue and go so it's important men courage everybody to get do something or\nAn absolutely and also just besides obviously the physics\nThere's a ... this post modern or something I tried to get into it or try to at least learn a little bit about it it's well I don't have a high enough like you to to deal with that\nUm but there's basically is that there is no truth so you're arguing with people who really don't believe that truth exist there's only your own personal truth that exist so that's when that's hard to even have a conversation with those\nWill then you can't even really argue about actually it was because each truth is subjective to or personal to rewrite vigils yeah I'm All right this is a next phone call you're on say well\nWho says oh gee I win hello Jay hey for hours and um oh God I Love it I Know sorry if you like any oh I Know you ... snake so\nNo they should take it or a radio station I already have so so the only way to go ahead [laughter] awesome\nI'm now getting back to be somebody is a little bit older than you ... you know I mean I grew up in the eighties ...\nAnd he said was there ever a time that it's worse than it is now and I would say probably not and that being because social media right so you used to be that you had to be news anchor somebody famous to have that platform to blast out your\nIdeals or your opinion and and that was pretty much it\nAnd and if you wanted to argue with somebody you out to be safe to say right now you don't so everybody can I'd be on your keyboard and have their opinions here and and you you know so\nEverybody now rod cash or right exactly that everybody has an opinion\nAnd now everybody has that platform mhm\nAnd and it makes\nI think it makes you know issues a lot harder to deal with because\nYour knowledge set of having a few focal points\nThat are saying okay this is a left in\nThis is the author writes opinion and ears kind of where everybody else falls in the ... now you've got millions of people that have different opinions you're never going to agree because they're really like your last ours are written extreme when I was a guy there really is no definitive troop date\nMhm and and and going back to\nA new whole cabinet fingers there's three ... you know there's there's your side my side and then there's the truth of what actually I ... and nobody will ever know dying route\nBut people claim to even though it's impossible to know and and like you know with this face to face conversation I mean when you're speaking with someone face to face even if you don't agree with them or you you don't believe what they believe\nLike there's a humanistic aspect where you know like they're a nice person or their you know maybe you know them personally and you want to be respectful you know and and then you go okay well that's a good point you're able to have\nA back and forth where you can have a civil discourse with someone and really open up your mind because you're not on the so much on the defensive 'cause you're face to face United behind a keyboard like you said\nBlasting your opinion and then someone else's blasting their opinion and you don't really have that face to face human interaction that allows you to kind of put down your guard and respect the other person because instead of just a anonymous voice there actually another human with ideas and believe just like you\nKnow it takes you know the Internet and so she is taking the civility out as\nAbsolute ... you know out of out of conversation and\nSame thing work exactly\nWhite kids like I Can't even imagine now\nWhat the kids are going to do you know forty years from now 'cause they know there there is no social skills with you know if you look at millennials are or you know even the group coming behind them which aren't all that\nLike disease they had there there there's they have no social skills that you don't know how to interact right which people they don't know how to have a conversation right and you know I I I I don't know I mean I think it's only going to get word yeah it's only going to get\nBetter abs absolutely and it's only going in one direction you know technology is only getting better um the technology that we have now cannot be on invented and no one is going to give it up like I Know for a fact that I'm a I Would say I'm probably addicted to my phone\nI think everybody is like I have to stay in contact with people you know and every time you see a Facebook notification or an instrument motivational I Wonder what that is all got to check it oh\nWho to who just rang who just called me who just to you know we're constantly attached you are a little pocket computers and\nThat's not going anywhere but it's so funny that everybody harp on the time where\nOh man it was so nice and we you know wherever there's talk face to face in in person and you know we weren't texting all the time but I'm telling you it's not just teenagers in kids I see people at the gym that are in their forties fifties sixties\nThat are stuck on a machine sitting there because they're playing on the phone texting somebody or watching a video so it's not just a millennial issue with not just a\nGeneration Z or a youth issue it's a people issue because we all have the same sort of internal psychological mechanisms that are being hijacked were constantly getting hit the doping mean every single second of the day with messages and post in life and everything like that so the huge problem\nYeah yeah I'm not blaming like you know the technology on on on not saying that it is directly just the younger generation\nOn everything you're saying that but when I was hanging\nYou you're being in your thirties oh or thirty one thirty one you um but at least you have\nMemories his yeah you have the history\nOf not having technologies that not being there and having to go out\nAnd talk to people interact absolutely nuts\nAnd then that's a general I mean not gonna that's a generational gap that that is getting wider and wider and wider\nAbsolutely and even if I decided to make the personal decision to like give up my phone or go off the grid or something like that\nThe sad thing is is no one would join me you know it's like in order to thrive I have to be on my phone because that's how everybody is operating you know I Can't be like oh I Want to go to a bar and meet people and not bring my phone and go there alone and just meet strangers well everybody else was on their phone so I won't have anybody to talk to if I go alone without a phone does that make sense\nSo sad 'cause that's the only way that you can thrive because\nThat's what everybody else is doing so absolutely yeah I got a lot of phone calls mammoth thank you so much for calling in\nFor hours and every day\nYeah but I Love you have a good night All right ah guys continue to call in um we will

I have something\nThat I Would like to bring back that I haven't discussed with the okay that I Want to discuss it off the air All right it's a little bit it's a little bit\n... it's not hard to figure out if you think about that we did at one time\nAnd it was really fun and I think we could do it in in front of people it will be even funnier okay I'll I'll tell you after the show um I also want to let everybody know as a public service announcement\nThat up on the recommendation of a lot of people that I trust as human beings not necessarily a movie critics or give Galvin or Spanish tell me it's pretty good movie now water better\nWhy this is your own person I Know we're probably funny I just haven't had time to watch it you did have time though yeah well there are clearly I did yeah sometimes they don't wanna laugh on a plane no I Know when you're staring I mean there's all this makes me feel good that you are okay well you're a you know I ah these guys were trying to\nGet rid of ... Gruber for the longest highrise so much of the rings shame me both one Jericho and ... well for for a we're on the show like uh\nIf they've seen me in front of them I Will watch it I'm not against it in fact I Believe I own it I think I did buy it before one of our trips I just never gotten around\nBut uh the hot thing that everybody is watching and raving about was the Mr Rogers documentary and I also know there's a movie being filmed with Tom Hanks where he plays Mr Rogers and they released pictures of him did you see that yes\nWe lost a lot of like a yeah which is funny because a colon hangs play both Rogers on a Drunk History oh really yeah\n'cause I as I was watching a documentary either I go I think on things would make a good young Fred Rogers yeah so I watch the uh the show\nAnd I have to tell you it was the most boring God damn thing I've ever seen now now I Want to go back to everybody told me it was good and punched him in the face now there are a few different uh documentaries out there about Mr Rogers this is the will to remind everyone that everybody's talking about the new one okay\nBecause the viral video of him appealing to Congress to get twenty million dollars for a public television was pretty impressive it was it was it was almost like that was a movie because you have this real Italian you know\nTough guy congressman who's cheap on the budget didn't want to give them the money and everybody was coming into play in our case and he was getting away with them there Mr Rogers came in and he's like well I guess you just got your twenty million ... like you want them over\nAnd in the documentary alerted Mr Rogers is definitely a sweet guy and that he was genuine and he wasn't creepy and he wasn't gay and uh I never thought he was gay but he uh he did get questioned on that a lot and one of the guys on the show was gay\nAnd he said that the amount of time that I spent over Fred Rogers I never once or one sign that he might be homosexual uh but you know that he was just a legit guy who had a genuine care for children in the upbringing of children and it was a nice story but it was one of the most\nBoring guy to undocumented I've ever watched in my life quite possibly one of the greatest middle names of all time by the way I don't know his real name is Fred Mick feely Roger cement around illegal Israeli that yeah isn't that interesting\nYeah yeah and and are you on TALK a little budget I mean have to have the staff of him and his wife and he did all the public voice is a writer and wrote a ton of songs and oh yeah yeah I was a trains a pianist I\nLook at it was it was really I watched it and it was sweet for a couple of minutes and I thought Jesus Christ or better be some sort of conflict here in this thing I mean even in death was wasn't even that big of a deal ... you know um there wasn't any choke up moments that was just all\nIn one of the huge advocate for like public television and stuff like that like he did a lot of charity work\nHe started he basically gave them they were there was public television was established\nAnd they had a lab channels for learning and stuff and he started there he was going into the ministry and then he saw that the TV and he was like I think I'm going to do that instead so he went and he worked on one of those uh those shows\nHe said but those solo budget and it was so bad that he knew that come up with something else or go back to the ministry and then he invented by accident Mr Roger's neighborhood\nAnd you know and they showed they show things though that Facebook is already ruined like he ... he during a time where everybody was you know racism was really bad\nAnd they were ah they were kicking a black kids at a public pools and uh uh he would incorporate black folks into his show in\nIn good positions or you know with good jobs and stuff\nAnd then he would subliminally show you him like he shared a a he was sitting in a little kid he pulled right and he invited a black gentleman to step in the ... and put his feet in there with him and and it was just him showing you that it was okay to be in the pool of black people out I I but you already saw that stuff on Facebook now when\nI watched a documentary and I know all these ... get with me tell me about the one guy that ah who's getting a little to make really\nWell I mean but how about that either of the documentary you didn't even know my feeling was his middle name I did I Know I got I told you about after a while but I was a story of how he came up with the show at least interesting now that was ...\nNow they have actually a book so he worked at this uh this station\nWhere they had a free movie used to show like they were a liar but they weren't real the real and he said the problem with free movies is they're old and sometimes a tape breaks so they're running a movie in the tape break so there's a they need a second to reset it\nAnd one in seven seven and you can now to double your chances of success no judgments just\nWanting to buy the bone and I'm Carmen you can hear me on my couch Michelle every weekday morning six to ten am actually fill out an because I'm also on the highway to count the after show as well I Want to think about\nRadio the white Celtic show is back on one of those two five the blown what\nAre we are having news in a in case you haven't heard the senators waiting one week to vote on Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court appointment so the FBI can do another investigation or FBI investigations like this one order last week by president Donald Trump\nInto his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh are routinely limited in scope\nSays a former agent who worked with in the Tampa FBI field office this ... this isn't the ministry of investigation not a criminal investigation that's according to Fred Humphries who retired earlier this year after Twenty one years or that included several such investigations because no one\nHas filed criminal charges against Kavanaugh\nThere will be no subpoenas for documents or other information and all witnesses must agreed to speak voluntarily\nThat's according to Humphries who has no direct knowledge about the case\nHe said it would be different if someone had brought charges now on this week long investigation the seven into Kavanaugh was ordered by Trump after an emotional and heated Senate hearing and allegations by research psychologist Christine Blasey Ford\nThe cabin I attempted rape her at a house party when they were teenagers and the Nineteen eighties I Am so you I don't even want to talk about this any more because\nYou can't give your opinion to people without them immediately dismissing you as a terrible human being yeah and uh I you know there there are plenty of people that I Believe her\nOh okay so but if you say I believe him all of a sudden you become a devil and and just because you believe in due process that doesn't necessarily mean you believe in him\nAnd it it doesn't mean you're supportive if you found out that he was in fact a violating her and if you did a ... you know if he did violate her physically but not sexually is that enough to make him not be a Supreme Court justice now is because there's thirty three years of good stuff in between\nLike I I don't even know what to do and the the problem is the more you talk about the more you say more people start vilify you like you've done something you're not allowed to have an opinion this gas or oil we talked about a little bit\nFriday obviously it's a job interview it's not an actual trials sorry that's the big thing even though it feels like a trial but here's the question uh when they do vote is he going to be in or out in use hand in yeah okay I put you in the category of in your along with myself geo ...\nAnd pap Spanish Carmen say he will not make is everybody and and he was going to be in and uh then people are just going to start going there is are losing their guide their mind ... nobody wanted them in there they the same people who are trying to keep him out of the ones that didn't want him in there because he was conservative it has made it had nothing to do with the fact that he may have done something\nWrong thirty three years ago and what is the the level of that situation before you before you go uh okay uh well it was you know he didn't really have\nSo I had a question now who vote him and who voted him in right 'cause I have been appointed right by the president but now\nCongress will have to uh decide after that should they approve\nOf this I don't know because of the activists confirmation right so the house it'll go it'll go to the Congress the people who are doing the Senate ... eleven Republicans intend Democrat right so what will happen is they'll vote 'em in or a tried to vote him out\nAnd they'll he'll get voted on it and they had I had a party had but although I think that there's going to be a cross party voters and the situation on both I got ya\nAh of course the talking about cabinet on Saturday Night live Matt Damon shut up in the cold up another season premiere of Saturday Night live to
