I don't I don't want to maybe like a I don't know he he's also producers well ray you so much more than like logic more than like a ... or Kendrick Lamar likely no but like as a whole you take the college dropout rate album that was great I don't know\nLike one of the best albums ever made on on any a platform John or whatever but great but the things he's been doing over the last decade speaking out in public and say he he has never come across as somebody that can put together a logical\nFault you know a rational thaw yeah\nIt just seems like it's a uh just covered narcissism and look at me and look out he asked off in the limelight\nNow young he's definitely a clinical nurse incest and I think that when you already have some sort of I don't want to say as a mental disorder

got in a middle garbage can and went to the moon\nBut uh the one thing I Will say about this is there some quiet moments too I mean it it is a movie about Neil Armstrong you know there's all this controversy about this movie that they they don't show the flag on the moon I'll tell you a little spoiled the flag is shown on the mood in this movie I mean\nIt's there but I Try to tell people this is not a movie about NASA it's not a movie about you know the space race it's about a guy who was involved in the space race and going to the moon it's really a focus on him and you learn a lot about\nArmstrong and I mean I tell you Ryan Gosling he all of a sudden like over the past five years you know the goofy kid from remember the titans\nYeah I I Believe he was even though the Mickey Mouse club I mean ... you know one of our top actors out there\nYeah he's awesome I I agree totally um but yeah I think I should go ahead a personal question Jim who do you think he was the atmosphere and the whole moon landing meaning it never happened\nOkay this is what I'll say after watching this movie like after they kind of show what they were doing and everything I Believe that they went there I Want to believe that there\nBut when you watch this movie and you see just how hard it was in what they were doing it it's an insane what they did\nI can totally believe why people think they didn't do it is it's so in ... ... what they did it and we never went back because I just don't think anything that that's my personal opinion that's why I don't think we don't we didn't go back there's just nothing there for\nHave you have you have you been have you seen the documentary dark side of the moon yes yeah\nThat thing oh yeah when you watch that it's all about how uh you know the

an or on Apollo sweater and there's all kinds of little things that they little uh Easter eggs within the movie the shining that would a kind of a suggest that maybe Hoover did do it so it's kinda it's kinda interesting yeah yeah I'm Sorry go ahead\nYeah I mean I totally understand why people think it's fake because it's just so incredible that they did it like I said basically strapped rockets to a garbage can and flew up you know into space and and you know they were just orbiting at the time you know everybody was just trying to orbit and getting up to the lack of space they were going all the way to the moon I mean\nAnd it's just crazy that they basically thought it could have been a one way mission I mean yeah that's the part of this maybe I find fascinating is just what they went through and basically just saying hey we're going and we may not come back and you know what they had to worry about you know a lot of people don't realize you know in the Apollo in the Gemini mission you know\nThere were major accidents major flaws I mean astronauts burned up on the landing a you know there was I mean when they were trying to take off it's it's insane so but that's why I Do understand after watching this moving sand and I'm like I totally understand why people think it didn't happen because there's just so incredible\nYeah in ... when does that do well when does that movie actually come out\nFirst man will start a tonight probably there's probably showing all night and ... you know it will do well and I will suggest is if you can see it in a Dolby Digital theater or a big screen definitely say that because the way it makes you feel I mean it's kind of like riding mission space that Disney and yeah I'm with the way it just\nMakes you feel claustrophobic and I mean they were looking at this little bitty windows to I mean it's not what they did but definitely kind of spend the extra money to see it in a big theater if you're going to go do it and just be worn this isn't it action packed movie the whole way through their tense moments but it is about Neil Armstrong\nAnd what do you went through there was a lot of things I didn't know about him that I'm not going to spoil because\nI think that's part of it is showing what he went through but the cash has great call Chandler's in a cleric or it it's a really good movie I think it's worth a watch but I still think you could probably see you know then ... and the stars Warren that's going to have legs over the next couple of weeks probably still went out of the box office but I think there'll be an audience for first man\nTell us about I hate us\nThat's not a statement notes that hey you do you get\nI mean I wrote down I hate you I'm hey you give okay my dad did [laughter] I Will say this\nI don't have a ... when I wrote this ... page [laughter] want to be a great time earlier where you where do you say Tania maybe [laughter] like you did [laughter] [laughter]\nSo this is a movie that's based on Hawaii novel and I know a lot of people like a young adult\nBut this one's a little difference more of a serious tone it's about a little girl named star washed it a little girl she was like sixteen years old\nAnd ... something really bad happens to her and her friends and she lives in just a terrible neighborhood it has a lot to do with the cops and you know police brutality and what you see in the neighborhood\nI think the acting is awesome and it's a man's law I Know that sounds weird but it but the LA at the end than birds she plays starving if the breakout role for her comments and if there's a lot of people end up the acting is good and it definitely comes from the gender you want it comes with an agenda yeah but the message it wants to deliver\nBut I thought it was well actually the only thing I Would say\nTwo hours and twelve minutes long\nI think they could have probably shaved about twenty minutes off that movie it's still got their point across would still be able to shot but as far as performances go an acting goes it's it's a good movie and I do think there's people that were really you know find something important and what the meaning of this movie it may not be someone like me but I definitely think there's\nA lot I Gotcha I Want to ask you about a movie and I only I only really thought of me 'cause I was listening to the Mike how the show this morning and uh I don't know if you are listening Robert Kelly was on there um\nBy the way he's inside supporters all weekend long ago check them out um anyway uh he was in the movie on sane and I didn't realize this movie was a hundred percent shot with the iPhone seven\nShot yep bye Steven ... and the clear clear for isn't that terrible I Believe that she was in that in a ... that's where we're headed I mean a lot of news casters they're\nDoing shots all on their iPhone I'm In Memphis as to what we know she told me a couple of times she got the whole story is with her iPhone completely and the way they shoot video I mean it's a it's so stupid to think Johnny\nHow much we paid for digital cameras now thinking about how much money we wasted\nCome on I one of those cameras now there is a good is our fault you\nKnow when I first started doing stand up my uh my mother in law when I first marriage Danes mom or his grandmother\nFor Christmas bought me a camcorder\nTo record my comedy set this thing would you put it on your shoulder you know it's like a camcorder and I remember yeah now that saying the the the the quality of that video compared to my iPhone\nIs like somebody who really likes my sketching it with the crayons and it was it's unbelievable where where do you still have it they'll know you could sell them for a lot of mine who's like vintage now Missouri's porn on their hand homemade really solo I Know the\nLittle though [laughter]\n[laughter]\nThat's all I'm Sorry no ... no it was before webcam does if Kamkar dropped my uh my my video can step off in random places down there you go just getting\nVideo 'cause that she didn't have the many does good lord\nI Know they went straight to it um the other exciting exciting news the a train of her pet cemetery the new one came out\nThe new one came out and you know\nI pet cemetery I don't I don't really get scared and movies like ... there's only like a kind of a select group that really like you know create me out\nAnd I will totally admit that when I saw a pet cemetery back when I was a kid oh man it just freaks me out just\nSomewhat creepy and weird stuff and I I Will say this is nowhere close to being a perfect movie and there's a lot of flaws when you do look back on it as a movie right but it's just like just creeping in on comfortable that's the thing that pet cemetery at more than anything is make you uncomfortable it does have a good story\nWatches the trailer yeah the one thing I Will say about when we saw pet cemetery originally\n... if you didn't read the book you didn't know anything that was called right we know what's coming this tunnel so\nYou know that was the one thing that it I think did a good job of as they did stick to the story but they changed things up it didn't take place in the fifties that took place in the eighties with the movie ranged up enough of the look of penny wise and different features to do that and I said when there was getting in his remake craze of ... to ... opened up\nI said the Stephen King all his work from the eighties all those old movies that were made in the late seventies early eighties their prime for remake Johnny fire starter\nAnd it really easily ... I think I think Clint ... married yeah yeah absolutely I mean\nIt doesn't it doesn't surprise me they're going back to pet cemetery I like John Lithgow in there and I you know I think that it could be cool but I Wonder about that April released to I'm like man in April I ...\nI guess they look at it like a movie can do that wouldn't you release that like right in the heart of October that seems more like it\nYeah I think all the horror movie should be fall movies I get 'em in there before Thanksgiving because of course Thanksgiving when all the Christmas stuff happens and I'll feel good movies and all that and and the the Christmas I'm action flicks um but yeah this would have been perfect they looked like the movies already done given to us we want it\nYeah that could have had an hour or just hold back it wouldn't be surprised if maybe it does get held back that happens you know stars form is supposed to open up this past may\nThey just looked at the schedule and it's like there's death toll there isn't sanity or there are so low what are we doing in the middle of may we got to move out and it was a smart decision what they did they end up having to go against another comic book you know movie but they still did All right I mean I just think October is going to do well I have not seen Halloween yet I'll be back to review that next\nBut he didn't hear helped I can see the money on ... so he switched and said\nYou just kind of a touchdown but at least he was still good at that\nTime I tried to run around\nAfter hours ... open to seven eight\n... dot com oh\nHey this is at the time you know me from the radio station one or two five the bone ten years I've been giving out free legal advice to our\nCitizens in community that you've been injured in an auto accident contacted attorney that you know you've heard from\nYears if you have questions regarding the legal issues surrounding the action and the ... office numbers they won three to five one five five five Europe where you can do to have 'em dot coms\nOfficers right here in Tampa star distribution the brightest naming distribution is hosting a hiring within this Saturday October Thirteen star distribution will be doing all levels of experience and all ships for where health position forklift operator ... position some work for Ford has remarried third party logistics\nProvider email jobs at dar distribution dot US today the reserve Europe ointment jobs and door distribution got us do our distribution hiring is in this Saturday at twenty three oh two hinders away in Plant City on line at dar distribution ... us\nOur gators don't compromise on the field and gators fans don't it\nIt comes to diamonds engagement rings in by June you always get more international diamond said at night easiest blurted leading jeweler recognize statewide for excellence in every category selection value\nAnd trust and that's why we've been named official Jupiter, Florida gators again this year so come visit one of our show rooms across the state or twenty four seven ... dot com forward slash go gaining international\nDiamond since we're gators fan shopper jewelry when\nComes to the bank tiny banks prices in Florida\nStand with international diamond Schachter he's why I Need the is the kind of official or other Florida Gators year after year many to count the gates every day with a massive mailing\nTorry Hansen making diamond jewelry designer ring on ... and you'll read the guaranteed even Merrick strongest working in the jewelry industry learned more in the ... the ... chapter jewelry bonus\nIn areas can can you\nCan I hear we're complimentary lifetime I let him every day they got caught the eye from four to six and a two for one drink extended happy hours until nine why you're relief I entirely one hundred hotter entertainers VIP ... hoping to it and I have three and\nThey think they know covered for free and\nReally that you can outlining northwest trouble learning from I think I'm looking at the same kind of like if I may slack\n[noise] three to four five to bone when your smart speaker by simply telling them to play one or two point five the bone one of those two point five the bone get the point where they were one or two point\nFive before we radio ...

I was hunter Spanish\nOr I guess they they were they were both fighting it says um they they suspending USC lightweight champion ...\nAnd Conor McGregor starting Monday a hearing is set to determine if they will be banned for good which we already know the answer that thing that I Know there's a lot of money for a rematch they're not going to be banned for good that's insane they didn't rape anybody or kill anybody they fought like idiots after the fight but what a cardio\nA I guess he instigated now you're in the ... words somebody one jumped into the ... function in the back of the wag before that he punch somebody before that\nYeah I mean the whole bus incident but that was oh no no I'm Talking about it during a brawl afterwards Connor hit somebody the brother of the guy to hit him in the back of the head while the whole Malian what's going on we just didn't see it with all the chaos\nA yeah said both fighters temporarily suspended or starting October fifteenth painting the hearing um see here the severity of the length of the punishment other two are expected to get will depend on the outcome of the hearing\nThe worst case scenario man all these hearings if Kavanaugh two weeks ago now I got this one game though oh tune in\nMan so many things I every way that our new thing now ... I Hope this isn't on CSPAN\nThe right guy I I I think the fact that we're still talking about the fight almost a week later because of all the ... the after fight uh-huh yeah I think that a rematch is necessary and is a great idea for them 'cause people want to see it again or I think there's going to be a ... point\nTo be raining down on him when he was doing a ...\nA little painful that look that look deadly and you don't think that people don't want I Want to see that again I think people would love to\nSee that again I don't know any way in hell outta linked by project you know what I'd like to see ... Derek Lewis by them you know why because of the usa openness how this is my hope so yeah\nWhat did you just you know\nAnd then she yeah you can't you can't\n... birch oh ... ... talking about his wife by the way when all that oh yeah Josh what's up\nHas one good by all also\nThinking even if they do punish him for ... ... just take this fight over to New York and they let us in Square Garden\nWell here's the problem New York is very very stiff with their rules it took a lot just for them to have the U. S. C. in New York I got a ton of money a ton of regulation\nSo this this would probably scare in New York out of having a fighter\nHell they may never had the U. S. C. in New York after this one because the last thing New York once it's a brawl in the middle of Madison Square garden so\nI think that's what happened may have hurt or any fights come in New York if I had to guess from what I've been reading and and from what I understood when they did bring the U. S. C. to a New York when did they did that uh it's been a two to three years ago I think when they when they when they had to USC they're really really cool yeah but\nA New York's there there there really was that what was the ... I remember I just remember them having a hard time getting approved for New York city I remember that so I\nI don't know about it I I say bring it right here to Cox media group Tampa wire right here in Studio ... Jews they should have a feeling that it off by\nTexas yeah really that's wild well you you have it in a in a cowboy stadium and holding a hundred thousand people whom I think biggest doesn't want to lose these fights yeah Vegas is the perfect spot for a ... you know traditionally that's true and everything and brings money to the casino and all that stuff\nDude I tell you what's up\n[laughter] how're you doing sir\n[laughter] so like the alternate McGregor thing is you know you go back to you know back in the day you add chocolate now Randy torpedo could you know ... there was a bunch of big big name ran through a lot of attention yeah\nWell now you've got a whole group of mediocre guys and they're all talented don't get me wrong rabbit Carter McGregor is the only star that the U. S. C. as right now under our sees out\nYou know hold their own didn't you know she doesn't have a big following so he's the one big name that they have to attract a preview heads and that and the ticket sales and and you know and it and it's like you know you watch the oath site it's part of the game is trash talking of course and the guy's head it's\nYou know I mean it's just it's all part of the game and you know what people don't mention is that you know we should be show came out and the rest stop him he can can you\nOh yeah I Hope you know I mentioned that I absolutely madly in there [noise]\nUm I I'm In and out of the chart workers I catch you know pieces but yeah but you know I mean that's you know the draw for for for a number two would be cute 'cause they added that fan base is so divided\nYeah I I I say give them another shot I say you get a copy of another shot to uh but if he messes up again you've got to kick them out you can't let them back in but I say you're right the da da da da da da da da da\nAnd this thing's going to be huge the rematch hundred percent I'm definitely gonna watch it ah everybody's going to watch it so uh you're right I think there's another there's another one I think it probably happens in January and February I think that they they hype it up and get all the sales and to get everybody ready for it\nUh so yeah I agree they\nMost most importantly it probably will not be in the state because they still haven't decided whether or not\nThere in ... New York city and I say you they are under manila deer lender England thriller manila that's where you go for it later about oh yeah they love fighting over there and they love that though looking at and say hey what's up\n[noise] hey guys love the show X on a level I Want to I Want to speak to my\nGuy Yes sir yes I Am listening mhm it'll tell\nYou I saw you in and do yesterday did you or just an old and oh man not only did you look delicious but Jesus\nI like I have a secret crush on Kendall but it was great you on TV I Know you have to be a a lot more reserved than normally are yeah yeah to follow you guys who used to love you're my favorite you root\nFor the New York ...\nIt was nice and by the way are you saying that can do is attractive to everybody who has eyes so yeah yeah she said she is a nice ah thanks and regain\nAppreciated buddy thank you very that\nHe didn't call him when I was on TV a few times you know what I mean thanks pro I guess I'm not I live in ...\nI don't know about that I think you're right I think you can type though all you know a little more with your hair a little bit more with your you know it's humid yeah said all the rain and everything I hear\nThe here's the thing now like frizzy are you kidding me\nIt was a flat am it's not going to get any flatter than that and my straight with like a clothing iron and you're not going anywhere handled much higher maybe a salon salon owner elevation was fine it was fine with I don't know if it's OK everything's fine it's fine\nI recognize views and there was a lot of hair talk no there was a little bit yeah what were the is they they have Google reviews these rights you know I'm looking at him right now a boom and then I heard that it was as broad waving at the camera in a while that some big as the uh that was one of them or does that was my review actually it was really good\nNow you're awesome things or Jordan what's up\nI'm going to be doing buddy good man how are you got that this\nWas in Congress first mistake as far as that some of them not only the ... when you buy a corporate jet human following loaded monster can cross stadium yeah and civility in the room and then\nThe uh I mean he's great for publicity but I think these bad word as far as you do say there was a pow fighters should act\nYeah he's a little bit uh I guess uh I don't know over the top in and he's a danger yeah or you can throw full cans of monster energy drinks across the room he did which was that he could kill somebody like that on the Senate and somebody in the temple but\nBut yeah I mean he I think that's one of the things sadly that people like about him is that he is unpredictable and he is dangerous and you know people like danger they liked unpredictable lately they they want to see what they're going to ...\nYou know what's going to happen that nobody wants to say a ... Conor McGregor press conference and we know he just going to go sit down and talk a little snack they weren't alone is this guy loses mine and catch the the desk on fire we have no idea let's see what happens\nNow and it's it's so sad to see that it's such a a giant act for him because you see private interviews with him is actually pretty relaxed guy and I don't think that is true for\nThe link to sign all in all of that goes on there\nAnd lately like that but if you think these WWE like wrestlers like all that you really know what the ... the owner but I knew what they love it and you're measurement Applebee's\nIs like oh shit Wall Street or something else food can sure my heart I didn't want\nTo start and like ah like ... and ... well they're coming back\nNot as good a job at a little bit of the John jokes the test is unpredictable so we all know headed by our job but you know you're right yeah I Know but he's probably gonna mess up again 'cause he's a repeat\nOffender also ...

gun control yeah but they took it I guess and said you know oh look at her she's a shooting guns often or new movie a and she's against guns which\nImmediately you look at that and you go ... that's how to reach\nIt some day when she was playing a rapist or a murderer was used plan I I don't know some fictional\nCharacter that happens to be right I I Do understand the point like if you are you know you're trying not to promote a gun violence and then there you are like your like play in a bad act as a movie you're kind of glorifying that role I can see why people might say hey you're you're kind of a hypocrite here I Know but\nBut you know you're you're also an actress you know so you're going to take roles and you're going to play other people besides yourself\nI listen I completely understand where you're coming from I'm just saying if you don't want to glorify guns and\nHow cool they are that being a bad after school or something like that and you're really you know you're a staunch anti gun person then and then suddenly you're you're blowing off guns in a movie I can all cool people they get you know she's not sitting there\nFor me it would be different if like the
