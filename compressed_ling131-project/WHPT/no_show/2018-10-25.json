trying to stop texting and driving just don't do that\nWhile you're in front of them and you're in your ... problems are so Jackie what other issues do you have as far as your campaign as you've gone around and talk to other citizens and district sixty that you want to work on and focus on when you when your ah your seat there\nI Believe education's on the other people's mind and really our education is the foundation of the strong economy will invest our children and that's not a teacher\nLike on the devil is in the air and it was one of my teachers through earlier would talk about education will help mold me to lie and now that we have to make sure that it will take care of that than than when it was with our um\nOur teachers and art and science and try to get foreign nature that\nJob than what we have a strong economy lowest unemployment rates are like any on that has\nTo make sure we attract businesses so our children stay in Florida I Know you had a couple of kids I've got a lot of kids and\nWe want them to come back to Florida and had the opportunity is and the only way to do that is the fact that there's an eighth of a family business environment which I think we're doing a great job and so those are things I'm focused on and our last year I was able to um wages\nSales tax on commercial leases and I want to hopefully eliminate that in my um charming and he's in the house so I'll I'll be working on that as bones\nAre saying it it seems like two years is wise by ah I Know that the central school is here and she's running for a district sixty three and

that's a non election year and then the next year you're right back into the election\nIs it is it it's almost like the two jobs at the same time every other year or how you how do you manage that you know as well as you have and I guess a friend who was that something that you're probably going to have to experience once you with your seat right you're going to be like in every other how frustrating and Jackie is that uh and\nWhat is it that you do to manage that and it's still represent the district so well\nIt's absolutely frustrating because instead of trying to work on my ... and driving though what I'm having to do is make sure we elect\nBecause then I could be calling my other colleague say well you sponsored the bill next year which is coming up like we start session in December so I Need to get as many as sponsors on the house and then on the on the Senate in order to pass that bill\nBut I Can't start doing that until I'm ... and they only get reelected so really it
