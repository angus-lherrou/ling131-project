that was like the best intro where your throat so far ahead it's like they're like I Can't even think that can play well I'm really uh\nI'm very flattered thank you all downhill from here Steven I like to uh shoot my proverbial wad early and then while lowering mediocrity for the rest of the interview so thank you for that but ah I men's every word you are you are a tremendous front man you define front man in my opinion are the way you carry yourself the hits that you have produced\nAnd what you did in Cleveland forever in geared\nYou to me and the world of provocative tours of of the world did you have a set plan before you went on stage that night to go hey look we're going to poke and prod a couple of these uh a couple of these blind cheapen the audience who don't believe in science and we're going to withhold semi charmed life where was it something that you kind of said\nI'm going to fly by the seat of my pants Steven chickens\nWell I mean isn't that kind of what rocket will both before it's like are we supposed to be like provoking something it's like you know kind of ... is this supposed to be some mischievous I mean I'm not a song\nAnd dance man so I'm definitely are for the course but for me\nNo I didn't have a plan we went there and supportive or musicians on call that's the thing we're supposed to do and\nAnd ah and then I just kind of went with the evening as it occurred to me [laughter] and uh we were making the short list up on the fly it we've got to get that I've said great [laughter] yeah and\nYou know uh when you mentioned mischief in rock and roll\nYeah it's a it's a time honored tradition when you mentioned mischief in rock and roll whether it's Led Zeppelin throwing furniture out of a window and doing things with vision groupies or the Rolling Stones refusing to change the lyrics of their songs mischief is something that is sadly missing\nFrom the current state of rock and roll so I salute you for bringing it back and did you know

what\nAnd it just kind of West there [laughter] yeah but you know what\nNobody got hurt\nLike it's like come on people\nRight like the biggest thing you're guilty of is asking who believes in science and having the a ... to not things semi charmed life which I imagine for you guys to take the stage and not do that song probably a little bit refreshing for you right\n[noise] you know like sometimes we play um shows like like we\nDo a an after party show and it was small it was like ... it was like nine hundred thousand people a\nA Chicago and it it's sold out in like twenty minutes so those people were experts and they really want to hear all the ... the ... they want to hear\nWent to his songs I haven't heard for a while they want to hear them out so we played a completely different set and then the next day a lot with a loser I'm you know we played\nIts way to replace anytime like there was great like I look at it is just like all these people just like just feel the sense of joy so sure of different\nThings different pot you know\nAbsolutely we're speaking with Stephen Jenkins front man for third I blind speaking of not playing your heads I have a I've kind of an unpopular take I'm a I'm somewhat of a Radiohead fan I'm not a gigantic radio fan but I'm I'm a big enough ... to go see them in concert and they haven't played creep for years\nAnd when people who aren't maybe even casual Radiohead fans go to see them in concert of course that's the one song they want to see and to me there's a joy and seeing a bunch of sick ... bros\nPissed off when they're leaving a Radiohead show because they didn't do that one song that they know do you as an artist you feel an obligation when you're playing to a group of maybe casual fans to play their heads or do you kind of see Tom you work in radio heads point and withholding the song that they're somewhat embarrassed stuff\n[noise] [noise]\nI'm not embarrassed our music at all and I I I liked playing hits that I like it when\nPeople like all you know stand up for their dad but I think it's great I don't I don't have any issue with that at all\nIt's just it just depends on what we're playing on my thing is I Try to be as a bent Dick and president and ... years and alive as possible in those few hours or or you know Ninety minutes or\nSixty minutes whatever that time is that we have I Try to just show up and wrote down in the field with people that that's what that moment it was all just take off\nUh so you know we play the music that fits with those ...\nTouch you were speaking with Stephen Jenkins third ... and\nThey're not blind foreign in Nineteen Ninety three played small gigs around the bay area for years and then sign in Ninety six to electro records in those three years before you got signed were there any moments Steven where are you struggled with continuing as a band or did you know that if you just kept true to what you guys were doing that you were break would calm\nNo I've struggled every moment we lived on the floor I Lived on a I live in a cleaning closet\nFor a while and and uh it was a constant struggle\nOr we would get you know we get gigs and then like I have the band fall apart um\nLike say the gay with my grandmother or something like that lives like like lose a bass player and then you start all over again so no I'm I Am like\nYou know I Will forever be down with bad who are who are just you know grinding it out their hopes if I'm a I'm reaching people's music I get that world\nWhere or when we announce that you're going to be on the show I had someone tweet me a and asked me to ask you about the story of a slow motion and uh and changing the lyrics along a legendary tail of the label asking you hey look can we maybe not this make so much about drugs is that a true story did they ask you\nSeems lyrics\nOh they didn't want a lot but didn't want that on the record at all that they were they were like\nYou know they they just banned that saw a from going on or else he and\nI'm so glad you asked about that because you know when we play most of my fans are about seven teams that I don't know thirty and they\nUm they want to get around for a lot of them I mean a lot of the younger\nBears wandering around for MTV stuff they find their music in different ways in slow motion is actually one of the biggest songs we play and and I\nPlayed what we played bottle

kind of like discuss why it took her out of the shows I ... songs to play\nAnd um even though I only have eighty three thousands close friends [laughter] um and I haven't moved into the kind of stratospheric famous land I'm a you know I I kind of appreciate the comments and and\nUh in a way uh I I get perspective from that and um and and I learned from that ... songs people want to hear and I are nothing more than ... contests where say these three songs on my plate give us one and then I just get you know bombarded\nBy you'd definitely run your Twitter because drew was saying before the interview that he doesn't think that you run your own Twitter accounts such a liar oh you didn't you said there's no way that Gavin runs his own Twitter I said\nI D does because that will be standing up in the morning at like three thirty AM our time and I remember your over and I think Indonesia or someplace like that and you're like hey what's a good Indian restaurants and check out and I'm like oh my God it's like night time of the funniest to them\nThink of that is if someone wrote going um because you know all of a see some people are going to be cynical but I I ... when I get on a roll you'll you if you ever catch it it clearly me and my favorite ... someone goes there's no way it's us us it's as assistant or a reply will arrive at the same assistance for\nYou know ten twelve years we grew up together and I love him but there's no way he replies to end the things you know any\nTime any fashion I Twitter he doesn't even have a tweet count and an email takes a week to get a reply so it was definitely know him\nYeah and I don't think you're a system be tweeting about a three day old peanut butter brownie and whether or not you should or shouldn't be eating it doesn't\nWe the genome the hassle I Try to get him to get 'em to give either [laughter] I was like dude is free get vibe or and it took like two months for him to get vibe or\nAnd then we find that he was really annoyed me because he said he's getting all these people coming out of the woodwork who now want it to be friends with him I was like your anti social issues nothing to do with the brightest use vibe or\nWhat is it like to uh be so immersed in social media now versus when Bush first came to popularity there was no Twitter there was no Facebook ... do you feel a stronger connection with the fans and does it have any negatives\nWell you know obviously I was I was way more successful than silicon has helped me personally [laughter]\nI'm working my way into the mud and we'll look at it\nGavin what's the last concert that you pay to see\nUm well I I you know I often I'm a bit lucky because I I just ... one of the things if I if I Want to go see magic show and I love magic I have to pay comedy out to pay the music has been better so James Blake was the last show us or if you know him he's kind of a so dumped step with songs or\nDid you try to get free tickets for that show\nI also Brian [laughter]\nHopefully you know from my manager he's right here so I'm sure we I I was prepared to pay like a a city um who is it I got tickets for someone somewhere um oh yeah I'm a kings ... oh you asked me for king William tickets\nAnd that I don't do guy don't ask for tickets for free for somebody else sure so then I go you get a VIP price um whatever it was and and um so I bought tickets to see\nA Kingsley on because they can't imagine I wouldn't get free tickets but I Would never expected like it'd be odd I you know what I mean I don't expect to off of other bands sure and is it\nHot and you know when you play our studio and every sales person comes out of the woodwork every listener wants to spend the you know ten minutes with you is it like that for you everywhere you go are you able to kind of go someplace and just be by yourself without a bunch of people coming up and wanting their moment with Gavin ...\nNo yeah but I Love that it's a privilege right of course to have is plenty I you know music century can you know old tentative based a rock based so I don't have the same kinds of issues um as as if you if you kind of um you know those kind of huge pop acts you know\nI'm so I've always been part of the counter culture but you know Sonny people come and say Hi what was being really cool I'll tell you I'm\nNo one's ever I've never had any trouble people to come up to me they just they say positive things how my music could affect the lives how the bans affect their lives they want to picture\nAnd it's real easy um dumped on people down it actually takes longer I've seen people I've known her famous and they they spent tendons explaining why they ... the ... way thinking their jokes and they don't get a picture of what's the point\nI think it takes a lot of courage to come up to people so I I'm super easy about that stuff is just a complement\nExxon we've got Gavin Ross duff and Bush in the studio Gavin\nWhat's the worst remedy for and about yourself what their death rumor floating around\nThere's loads of death row dying all the time [laughter] to me that's just a Korea [laughter]\nI'm not the way this one is the thing that I find is is is I mean I don't get it that much as some of the the kind of the the kind of crazy um you know the movie stars is that more and more I'm you know working hand in hand for a tour meant to dinner with Gwen and we will pass newsstand ... says we are getting divorced you know\nThat's the one that kind of post a damper on this stuff up by the by the first margarita with fine [laughter]\nYou know it was like it it just it makes me realize is that the you know unless you see it you you really don't know is I mean it really is just insane they just\nThey always say you have to keep up with those tabloids with each other and they just have to print whatever they print and they noticed it just it's just a it's a boomerang game of of uh\nOf of of I don't know Mr truths and\nNow I gather and I know that one of your early influence is one of my favorite bands of the University of ... and do something that toward that band apart I think was the egos in the in fighting a how have you managed to avoid kind of the St pitfalls that they've fallen into and really keep a really obviously a really solid had about you and not get you caught up in and stuff like\nThat um I I don't know uh I mean I find it hard to you know in the context of the ... ever criticize them love them so much but if you ever watch that allowed quietly out really you just can't believe you just wanted to make another record that just talk to each other it's just like insane but um\nI think for from our point of view it really comes from and I'm not talking ... against the ... because I don't know the circumstances\nBut we just enjoying what we're doing and we're so into music and and we realized that getting a second shot around um is an incredible it's it's an honor to a place for people and and and we don't want to screw that up basically and you know you see those pitfalls and and I tell you I'm\nI once met Tom Waits he's one of my heroes and uh when most impressive things I've noticed about the people who like Supreme me supremely talented and really have it all going on a um\nHim and he's the example for in this story I may and backstage in San Francisco I'm a few years ago 'cause his son wants to is a wants to be a drummer thing says she came in and when I spoke to him is about forty minutes with him and he was the most unassuming interesting cool cultured brittian\nPerson I'd ever met and and it really struck a cool to me that um\nIt it seems to be the people the most uptight and the most kind of full of themselves and self important and all those things that we just want to punch them in the face for um you know figuratively 'cause I'm not a fighter um\nYou know it's usually the people that that I have a defense because they do something to do something about them this you know I think that is something to be said for just going with the phone like Paul McCartney you know you heard what he got paid for the Olympics right like a\nBuck eighty five or something like what the way it was at one point seven million was that it was more than that it was one pound he had I had to really confirm actually have to pay him something positive deals so he took a pound okay I guess is a floating thing yeah in\nCanada is worth more and here's what last right now but uh so that's the class that ... that that would the we aspire to and that that's what keeps us grounded when we're home soup to suck up\nHeadaches that hangovers guys you either do it unless I'm drinking uh Mm I don't have a problem again is and I don't know if it's because they use a special type system again is what it is um but I don't have a problem goes but if I drink a beer ... guarantee the hangover and if I if I drink tap here in the states\nI'm dead Mm that\nThat's where do you think that that would be that'd be good because the beer flows so quickly there you'd think the lines of say clean I'm James constantly I don't think\nHonestly when Yankee Stadium was built I went through that I like the second game when the new stadium was built I went to a game two or three or whatever it was and I got like brutal from the happier\nLike I'll make my head everything I'm like I think they brought the taps over from the old place [laughter] well I didn't even read the novel and maybe there was this ... or drop all their for Babe Ruth back wash old wise\nOld traps right yeah well I don't know I I I don't seem to ... I just it's just really obviously anybody if you drink a lot of really cheap beer summit before the next day may not\nBe so good ... may not be thinking about going out tonight for the giant game but I just read an article that's right they don't match kill them and for me as being yeah hope it gets herpes why because you wrote an article the giants should side Colin Kaepernick right now\nOh no they shouldn't\nLike he's blaming you're he's blaming all these ... on you I Know many saying well cap and it's more mobile\nAnd I'm saying to myself yeah but he's pretty but he's not good he's a good let me say we want to be like I'll be the first one to tell you I don't think he was going to be a whole theme quarterback or anything like that no but when you protect him\nHe was ... when you don't protect him no quarterback is a good quarterback\nAnd then all of a sudden and then I'm reading all this stuff and it's er yeah of course he's not a starter right now well what what do you want to for weight lifting ... stupid\nStop it just about solving before he came on the I don't need that in my life of the most popular game day food in every state and uh you know you'd think it'd be the obvious things or whatever and Monica you're going to have to ... to vouch for this or not what the list\nFlorida's most favorite game day fetus sausage cheese balls that makes sense a sausage cheese balls like meat balls made a sauce cheese in the ... to ... coming out of um like how was that Florida's ... favorite oh sure there are good I've never even\nHeard that like a Thanksgiving that's like a holiday thing isn't it like\nI've never heard of it sausage trees ...

place was was sick and it's just you're tired of it that it's like what is our time when it's our time\nFor us to cheer ... you know we had it for two weeks and now it's gone\nOh they're the first two week it was amazing the feeling that as a fan devout healing is a former player gone we and the word I don't like to use a lot but I'll use it here we were elated yeah because we never thought we would come out and game on\nAnd play that way against Drew Brees and the saints and we didn't think we'd do game to against Philadelphia and we knew Chicago is gonna be tough\nWe knew the Pittsburgh game was going to be talking about what fits the on the field we all we had a chance\nI don't think we think we have a chance with with Jay was on the field different\nMy my my I say it because I Am a fan and I want to stand behind the team my confidence is really going downhill not only with my quarterback but with my old defensive line\nWhat do I mean just it's supposed to be you're not really supposed to have confidence in something that's that inconsistent and I can tell you I can break I couldn't bring up any football team the whole NFL\nWell not in any any good football team in a fellow I'll say this is what they do well let me ask you a question what do the bucks do not even not even great well what do they do well give me one thing\nAnd looking at yesterday's game I Would I no no no for the whole you know if I get what do they can you have to hang your hat on something what do they do 'cause I don't have an answer what do they do consistently well\nI'll Wait a you want to take a commercial ready to go\nSo they make all these years I was going to give kudos to Peyton Barber yesterday for his per was I thought he looked a little better than he did the game is before\nOkay um you know make some good running dry enough though that's not enough to win the football and I mean not consistent you know no absolute were laughing but I don't know we might be last to leave Russia we might be it's or close to it\nSo that's definitely not in our defenses definitely was in the late\nLast last yeah so you know we brought all these guys and we got all the beds allied\nGarbage solve garb and when you look at Atlanta's defensive line and how many of their key players were out for yesterday's game injuries yeah yeah I was gonna say jeeze if these guys had actually been playing it would have been a slaughter\nCould've been could've been passed protecting is that that's one thing we don't do poorly we actually protect past protect pretty good but that's not what you had your hat on them because you know because then that means you're quarterbacks throwing the ball too much a quarterback those about too much we we need we need James ... thirty times again\nTops we run the football for heaven's throwing the ball that many times it's just it's an equation for failure that's that's for sure oh let's take a quick break we'll come back we'll talk a little bit more about that the\n... main we've got a problem on the interstate let's go ahead and get to travel\n[noise] I Know they're\nLooking at a car fire on two Seventy five north bound if you had enough to patch go

your symptoms and the good news is\nSo that was the one bright port the rest of it was just stupid like don't take that hit Davis and you\nMe how much does the price of he didn't get the call and he should have got the call yeah because you remember last year it cost us my Kevin sir absolutely when Winston went out and was poking dudes element and it would push Winston down out of nowhere comes Mike Evans in just yes side walls the guy that was immature\nIn Davis when ... when he was Tokyo yeah see that's what they wrote comparing him to about is maturity so we're gonna we're supposed to applaud him because he's more mature than that that's the child is crap that's a five year old crap okay and you asked me ... matured just about the same player\nI'm Talking about football wise how he plays on the field plays about the same\n... if I don't think that's going to change I think what we saw yesterday\nIs what he is because that's what he's been he's going to so touchdowns is going to get yards he's going to make mistakes well he's consistent at least consistently mediocre well [laughter] to be honest I mean if you look at a view of you look at what he's done to his career right now\nHe's got to a point though I I had a look it up but you want a lot of games now is winning thirty five percent of his games now his his\nDeal with the bucks Winston a this was the year then after this years where he's signs on to make more money what what are the buccaneers options\nThat unites they signed last year an extension okay they grab an extension one year okay he if they want to retain him big cat I Believe they can get out of it because of his suspension that could be told that that really quick like that they can they could cut him off at the end of the\nIf they want to that's not going to happen I mean they would trade him as anything but at the end of this year boy at the bucks we'll foreign twelve which looks like we're going to do by the way like how how marketable is he going to be is anybody going to want to pay somebody twenty million dollars for that was a\nVery well next Sunday we've got the Bengals here at home to bagels actually Sopranos or I'm Sorry a lot now we've got a the brown will go OK yeah we've got the browns coming up\nAnd the browns are up and down but you know go ahead and say we should win this game I dare you there ya 'cause the browser coming here thinking we should win this game anybody plays a buck so now I was going to think we should\nWin the ... and the browse actually looked pretty good yesterday against Pittsburgh final score twenty eight Twenty one I mean they fought hard the ... ... rounds are actually looking better this year than they have in the last five seasons and I thought this would be a gimme game while I thought the same thing about yesterday's game I thought oh this is Lana team\nYou know their defensive lines decimated with injury if our defense shows up [laughter] ah yeah you know we can get out there and possibly win of James says his head screwed on and uh so now I'm not too sure about this game coming up on Sunday I'm less both somebody's bowed out now I'm\nThe opposite mystic has gone we've lost three games in a row optimism gone nobody should be optimistic that when you will lose three game good teams don't lose three games in a row\nAnd good teams don't lose too bad football teams which is the bucks just did on Sunday so we're not a good team they should they got to go back to the drawing board they got all look at themselves in the mirror and figure ... and bitch and moan in like go ahead that doesn't help anything\nIt really doesn't Davis is our guy and you got to ride or die with him and but I'm telling you the hoax going to start getting quick I 'cause I 'cause I can see the I think people's eyes because like the coach of thinking okay that started God but that's also going to lead toward demise\nAnd if there's a situation next week where he's not playing up to par and they're still in the game I Would not be shocked that they put the magic in there and the crowd really nope it's about that time\nIt's about that time it does do you just you're just losing that's all we're just losing and it just seems like we're OK with losing world Kay was having a suck you defense we're okay we're turning the ball over boy it was it\nWas the first two games for fun but there are long gone my friend long\nLowering oil let's say they put fit CNN we beat Cincinnati and then the next week we have Carolina and we beat them which is going to be a nut tiger let's let's be honest and then the chiefs right after that and the chiefs are playing ...\nYou played shown we play the Redskins about to say no no no we play ... doing the schedule I had\nYou don't want to play we we and I thought wait a minute chiefs are so damn good you don't want to play Washington but she's the score Seventy nine points on his yeah he's really easily we could not stop the cheese you don't want that right I so they both Winston out and they bring fit CNN pulls out a miracle we beat Cincinnati and then you know we look at Carolina last week that\nThat's what happened yeah you just keep once once you pull Jay miss out once you pull him out and he's healthy\nVenice eras done then whatever happens after that just happened but once you pull him out that's it 'cause you just don't you don't pull out starting quarterback so you don't write\nYou you just don't you don't pull out your starting quarterback if he's healthy nobody does so if you pull them out he's stuck once you pull them out get rid of them\nOkay moving on to another game I Want to ask you about 'cause I didn't get to watch a lot of it but I I did try to catch the ended then got cut off with two minutes left in overtime or the dolphins yesterday against the bears\nI was like because they switched over into bears we both know yeah and absolutely monster deep and you know a great team I mean we've we've seen him play the buccaneers they get down to overtime two minutes Cody Parker goes for fifty three yard field goal ... we had nowhere near oh yeah he sure did\nTwo minutes left on the clock dolphins habitable network stops coverage [noise]\nAnd even the village CBS or going hoops do not tweet us please they even made it very clear this is an NFL rule we have to go to the wrap up show\nSo with two minutes left on the clock Feldman will come back Jason Sanders kicks up forty seven ... yard field goal to give the window to fish\nAnd I would love to have seen that her because actually that over time was probably the best part of the whole game again I didn't watch the whole dolphins bears game but that over time when they switched is over and I go oh man I said two minutes left on the clock and dolphins have possession they play it right they they could pull out of wind here and all of a sudden boom the feed went off it\nWhile the bears fans got to be stick to the stomach they lost abrupt us while they're\nYeah a backup brought Hannah hill was out with the shoulder injury rock ... that's the way law [laughter] they're barefoot as if it was so good about himself made him look like Johnny United Way in which you know it's when you want to get right do you know what you do if you're a quarterback and what you do if you want to get right planet bucks\n'cause how good the ... how good the the ... bucks oh the best but we made him look good best yeah like we literally gave up to ... to five quarterbacks is here and a five five out of five that's where\nWe are and real quickly jaguars get blown out by Dallas the jaguars all year I think of headache rate defense and I think it was the chiefs that they played and the chiefs figure it out if you if you get that side by side coverage of\nThis is going to be able to win you a ball game and I think Dallas used that to their advantage they almost played the same side by side coverage yesterday against the jaguars in water blowout forty\nSeven nobody saw that ... no I did Alice doesn't have any off and no I'm Prescott had\nBut they will hear it out how to really again I think by watching the chiefs film they said wait a minute these guys are playing side by side and this defense that's the way you've got to play them and to see the highlights of that that I watch this morning I was like are you kidding\nWell they got exposed that's for sure and uh we've stayed expose we just been wide open so we're all we're not getting ... we've been exposed to take a quick break and come back with some news this late\nAlready buddy let's get back to that car fire on the interstate with another look at traffic\n[noise] another okay\nThis car fires going to be two Seventy five ... down if you're heading up to
