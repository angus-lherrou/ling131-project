silent Bob in those movies\nIn now and then you compound Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan\nYeah he did I think that's probably a I mean if I ask him and I will which movie he regret the most I'm going to say probably cop out he's got some bigger movies did you see the documentary make a porno\nRogan yeah yes I did that movie that's what you did that movie and he was in the movie right oh I don't think you know the\nDaniel ... for the man to come here [laughter]\nMan alive anyway we got Kevin Smith on the line with us we'll start with a question from Seth\nKevin I follow you on Twitter I'm a big Walking Dead and I thought that you you're involved with this show called common man that's premiering after walking down on February ... well how are you involved with that show\nUh it's it's our show it's about ah our boys who work at a giant found by secrets dashed back east in New Jersey or comic bookstore\nThey record a pod cast on a small gifts dot com that network I got online we're all we do is punk us kind of like what you guys do but just a short once a week as opposed to like you guys get up to a deli\nThey want to do what you guys are doing I Want to stop what I'm doing do you do anyway [laughter]\nThey've been doing these pockets we don't always pockets in that show telling Steve they've\nKind of translated well to to a TV AMC was looking for something to follow the walking dead with because they liked the fact that [noise] Walking Dead brought in kind of like the guardian for sure and you know this long time between seasons as they were in production and they were like man we'd like to keep them around what would keep them around\nAnd the dude from original media named Charlie corps when he called me up and he was just like there's a\nAMC's looking for a show and then you have any ideas for TV show might be cool for the crowd you know I don't do TV I don't really have anything I said but if you were going to do anything somebody should should do reality shows that in the comic bookstore like upon stores or something like that right we shot into the working title of secret fast is the name of the store\nBut I Am the want to call it something that was a little more uh you know generic term like it'll feel to everybody not just to pick her stash I guess that's the connotation to some of like it's all about weight\nSo they went with comic book man and I've seen two episodes already is go to if you're into geek culture it's phenomenal like we sit there and you know what it's like that it's like a combination of clerks and mall rats as a ...\nI like what I'm hearing\nIt suits behind the counter so they're interacting with the public um and then like we sit around ... instead of doing like one on one interviews on camera\nLike most reality shows we do it a ... of the podcast so you see a sitting around recording the podcast and that's where we talked about kind of what happened at the store that week and then cut into the reality footage and stuff it's really really cool so check that out on a static because it's on AMC man which is like\nIn terms of networks that that's the network of the moment man networks got everything I'll watch got Mad Men Walking Dead Breaking Bad so suddenly to be a part of that it it's phenomenal but at the same time you know you feel like oh man such quality programming I Hope we're not the one that stuff I Hope we're not we're AMC jump the shark\nKevin outrage three shows you last mentioned from from the brain to least favorite Mad Men Breaking Bad Walking Dead\nI go I go Mad Men or walk at that and then Breaking Bad wow my least favorite though that's\nLike it's not like oh man that one thinks it's just like those are three heavy choices so if you have to put them in an order that's murder\nThat's a good order we are talking to Kevin Smith whose lives from behind between Jay and silent Bob get old will be selected theaters that ... not thirty several of them here in the Tampa Bay area you guys are doing some interactive stuff using the hash tag live from behind tell us what it's all about Kevin and how people can get involved\nWell we do another one of the ... that we do it's my guess is called Jamestown about good old it's kind of about Jason muses life really it's about his battles with drug and he tells amazing stories that you could go listen to it they're all free over its markets dot com chainsaw and Bob Dole you hear it every week\nSave his own life essentially it's like an intervention podcasts where every week we check on go how long you been clean and he tells the amount of days\nAnd we kind of tell stories about you know the drug abuse in the past and making movies everything it's kinda like this is your life and it's shocking and wonderful and fun and it's sad like you'll you'll sit there and hear stories about\nYou know it'd be unlocked with a closet in a stranger's house was mom could go off and do heroin and then he quit tell the story about watching Ben Affleck masturbate\nSo you know it's got everything emotional gamut [laughter]\nDoing that a live\nIn the theater in Toronto or goes back theater and it's being streamed broadcast into theaters all around the United states and Canada all around North America so even if you're not there you could be there with us and since ah we're we're doing it interactive so after the podcasts\nWe're doing like an hour and a half two and I so we're taking questions from like all the theaters not just the people that were on them with you treated a question we're going to be like oh man there's a student Tampa wants to know this and boom we're talking to you even though we're not in the room as it should be kind of fun\nI Love it sounds like a lot of fun and I got a

folks know if there is an ongoing litigation I've talked to I cannot prominent on it but I couldn't understand what the hell he was\nSaying it [laughter] I I don't even know what the hell was that question number three of us are [laughter] so what what county are they from close to right to allow she's she's getting it down [laughter] Jonah screams ya I got a second look will love you may as

which is which is you\nOkay great thank you appreciate you guys taking my call absolute um so I was um [noise] uh ... uh well uh let me see her a friend of mine was\nA luxury [laughter] really around ... he's got his ah clay or my ... and our other [laughter] yeah and somebody\nHe was recording you guys are there was acting out in the mall and I'm In may or may not have grabbed his cell phone and thrown out on the ground so my question is sort of my friend is a legal\nOkay well I Want to I mean as my friend going to get up to me no I mean not me not to my aren't going to get in trouble for that I\nWill you'll to buy a guest in Studio before I answer I don't even understand the question well what happened or someone grabs someone cell phone allegedly and threw it on the ground because they probably got past that they were being videotaped it in a mall yep\nA hit an audio videotaping them doing something about ... whatever they were doing so the question is is that in essence a crime and then I'll you'll to you Mike and then I Will follow up absolutely okay so\nAbsolute looking at probably a misdemeanor if if the value though at last\nIf the ... well that would ... it depends what the ... that water jak tearing ask you if you're on a second man whoa oh was it a police officer [laughter] if they took the phone the value of the phone is greater than three hundred dollars\nAnd they damaged it um it could actually take possession is aspartame ... snapped 'em if they damaged the phone now you're looking at uh the uh whether or not it's a misdemeanor value to to fix that Boehner felony value\nUm for for um a criminal mischief so there there there's a number of crimes there that that are potential\nThere was a a U.S senator who grabbed the phone or South Carolina center I think a Purdue who grabbed the phone to the student to read on the grounds mass wasn't that recent there's yeah two days ago\nBut yeah so but yeah I remember a ... it has to be damaged you know sometimes things can be shoved in someone's face and you ... your violation of one's privacy ones you know you know immediate area and if you you know move that out of the way you know there's also has to be a criminal intent men's radio\nThere has to be involved there with the senator in this example I of course I don't know really the facts and that particular case but you've got to look at all of the the surrounding circumstances to determine whether or not a crime actually committed or not\nAnd would that being said now moved Tom who's our DUI color of the evening Tom ... asked what county are you in Tom so Hank you don't know\nI Know I Know I Know is county fire by now I Want that either I I been in ... county for the past two days dealing with a DUI matter so what what's your question that you have for me go ahead sir\nI have a friend who has gotten a DUI about it's about Nineteen life with an ongoing a DUI battle and it was because that's you know marijuana was involved as well\nOkay so my question is he's been apparently he's had ten different prosecutors has been traded off\nAnd there has been at least a few different times in the court room where there was someone that that perception he said he recognized from high school or something otherwise and you know it wasn't necessarily the best person during that time period so it's kind of is is is this kind of crazy\nFor no prior charges in the state of Florida or anything like that like is this pretty like crazy for them to be ongoing like this\nUh I Would say no but I'll you'll to my first before I answer\nI agree with that it's not unusual first of all changing prosecutors is changing under where they they move from one division to the next there's a book that how it is crazy it's not unusual it it well but I don't know ... they move around from division ... division and and nobody's stays in any particular division for more than just just a\nCouple of months anyways um okay it's not unusual for a case to be a especially the wide and that was to be aggressively prosecuted because that office takes those charges\nVery very very serious well I think a lot of them very very seriously but they don't know and I think every off take some very how also but they don't know how to apportion announced county I think is one of the more aggressive counties for prosecution a DUI yeah but they you know I that's what I've heard\n... I I think Paul county is one of the worst now I ... when you yeah well I mean it just doesn't have anything to do with the sheriff there's great but the problem is the state attorney's office over there you go in their first time misdemeanor or marijuana possession never had before they say are your clients going to get ten days as to what\nYou're talking about I mean ... yeah that's that's crazy uh but no exactly\nI mean like just your throat I mean even if it's someone in jail for something like mine are like that I I mean in my opinion is out to make the laws are now I mean yeah that's crazy\nWell you have to schedule Whitey it's that is what it is\nBut I'm just using the example of the the sentence doesn't fit that particular crime in that example in my humble opinion the ... century at\nBut I Will tell you started south county ... you started north county betting house you're there for six months to do motions neither one of those to trial divisions you got to consolidate everything to forty ninth street and then you've got to figure out what you're going to do there when you talk about the ... question you can do trials where you just can't do jury trial you cannot do jury trial that you know I\nI like cases in in in both the sign I think the judges are great that's a little bit states attorneys can sit there and say well we'll know we're ... we're not going to do bench trial and they can they can sit there you got to do with a jury trial\nOh so they can make that decision because I heard that you can take it to jury there like if\nI mean they're not going to seek jail time\nThen you can have the bench trial\nNo that's not okay well I just said no no that's why it's happened so ... it's it's certainly true but it doesn't happen all the time\nIf you want I mean I Want to be the case in North or south county the prosecutor is not going to stand up for a jury trial they will keep it in North or south county Iowa they will transfer it I I Know that but the the way it has to be predicated on which the defense wants to do and what the prosecution wants to do know the prosecution doesn't\nI'm saying the decision whether or not to keep it at south county north county or to send it to the complex is strictly offended to the defending it now and what I'm saying\nYou're trying to confuse me oh I Know you're not you're saying it's up to the prosecutors ... sports so my question is\nIs so so if it's my friend had\nGotten this DUI back in ... months ago and possession of under I Believe it was under Seventy rams\nMarijuana and try to case [laughter] pick the show [laughter] I mean\nThing is he he hired a lawyer the lawyer charge them a flat rate of about five thousand dollars right in the beginning is what he told me and I'm assuming the lawyer charged in the fly right because he thought that this will be a quick case opens shutting done and whatever\nATC after my daughter was born after ... graduated high school and I said well you know I got to do something to support my family so ABC had a bunch of two year program say had nursing they had nuclear met technology there was a host of allied health programs and some other programs and\nSo I went and talked to account for looked on the right hand column and said which of these programs pays the most when you get out of school\nAnd for a two year program it was optician re dispensing technology so I'm like signed me up for that [laughter] that program and became a licensed optician\nExcept for a state board and it really started to move me out of what I called generational poverty I was making a a wage of an opposition which was more money than I've ever made I was able to\nYou know get an apartment at my own get a car that actually worked because when I went to school I drove this Ford fairly and that had like a table cloth over the front seat\nAnd I called my um my two gallon challenge because I Would put two gallons of water in the back seat of the car\nUm and I would drive the ACC and ... campus and I would by the time I got there the radiator was overheated\nSo I Would go to class I Would wait for the radiator to cool down lift up the hood put the gallon of water in and then go home and I did that for six months because I just didn't have the damn money to fix my car I mean that's just to kind of life I Lived and so [noise]\nWhen I passed and I went for the state board and started making real money or not real money but certainly a living wage and um I was able to buy a car and start making car payments and live in a\nA place that was better and you know lifted our family and then I'm working for this provision center in east like mall if anybody remembers east like most been gone a long time now but I'm fifty in Hillsborough\nAnd they decided they were going to franchise their store so I went home I told him I'm I'm like oh I think I'm gonna lose this job I Love this job I loved the store but\nThey are going to sell it out from underneath me so my mom that same woman that worked in that ... that factory for Thirty years she'd put away\nA stock from her company for like twenty five years so she had this stack of stocks that we went to the bank\nAnd she put that up for collateral and they gave me alone and you know overnight I went from\nSigning the back of a pay check to signing the front of the other day the feeling to sign a damn good Johnny and I also learned about inventory profits and losses I learned about paying others before I paid myself and I learned about struggling but I loved it\nI Love being in control of my own destiny I knew that the harder I work the better the results and um that's where I got my START I just worked and then went to work in health care and always worked on campaigns\nHelping people get elected I did a lot of judges races I did Baba corns race I did all above horse races and I was his campaign manager and never thought that I Would be on this side of\nOf campaigning but a seat came available I'm Mike ... was a soldier and he had this seat in the house and he was picked to go in and he was appointed to the Pentagon for big position so it left a seat open with a two month election cycle and I thought well heck\nI can do this for two months I've been campaigning for others for many months so Iran and I won and it's been the most rewarding job that I have ever had in my life but I just wonder do great when I go on to that house floor and I\nSee all the majesty of the house floor I think of like my grandparents and my great grandparents who sat in rural tobacco for ten hours at a table the sacrifices they made they left their homes and came to this America became citizens were very proud never asked a dime of anyone\nSo when I think about them and I think about working families across this city I'm In this county I always vote with them in mind because I Know where I came from and I will never forget where it came from\nAnd now you're taking a bad experience growing up here you're taking your time in the Florida House you now are running a campaign for as a group Eighteen in the Florida Senate\nYes okay it's district Eighteen in the Florida Senate I well I'm not finished you know I Am just not finished I rose to the ranks of minority house leader um and I'm very proud of that it's you know remember that as a minority house leader I Am the leader of\nAll the minorities in order to chat room when [laughter]\nYou're like I started\nReally going to be there really means the house that has the least amount of member\nBut you know when you're the leader of alpha dogs because none of those members got to Tallahassee because their followers they're all alpha dogs so if you can figure out how to herd alpha dogs and convince them to follow you that you are freaking amazing and that's what I\nWhat I was ... I I'll tell you what before I get to the calls because I Know I've got gene uh Dave in air and they're holding\nIf and I know there are a lot of issues and I know we have some more time for you is there a big issue that is on the forefront of your mind as you are are waging this Senate campaign that you you know and all your issues are important so I don't want to diminish no your care but\nI Will tell you what it's at the forefront in my opinion and that is public school funding infrastructure funding I had a teacher a Tampa Bay elementary that sent me a picture of her thermostat today\nUm you know she has third grader sitting in a classroom to eighty eight degree oh my God and none of us would want to work in a building and then I hear people tell me they say oh well I went to school there was no air conditioning well so did I but the school that I went to\nUm had windows that were open and a big fan in the back these guys are sitting in hot boxes the windows for security are closed shut\nSo there are no options when the air is not working and we just have diverted to many dollars away from our public schools we have to get our priorities straight we got to fund these schools we got to fix this\nUh we got to fix the infrastructure a an air conditioner replaced in a high school is ten million dollars we just don't have that money because we haven't made um education of priority we have reserves\nWe should be taking care of our structures taken care of our students we allocated a out of an eighty billion dollar budget we allocated forty seven cents per student increase last year Omar ...\nWell ... that's a very a very good a primary concern for your campaign or I certainly hope that resonates with voters a cat where where are we the order of folks\nAh we we would go top to bottom but I'd prefer if we could just go to break real quick it's a short break job right yeah well\n... got to keep me straight on the time they just said was brought to you by ... specializes in treating patients that have been injured divide high yield imaging open MRI X rays cat scans aired ultrasound\nTheir social located here in the bay area serve you you can reach them and he won three eighty six nine nine nine nine or ...

here in the urban areas so it's some of that it's a lot of 'em for defying schools and it's\nIt's a sad state of affairs that that's what we're looking at um especially since we are forty seven in the

was handed\nA pot of money from the legislature and ... and says do with it what you will this money for salaries is is not instructional and this is for um repairing schools now we pay a millage\nI'm a which is a tax of our ... having a problem that he was married and in two thousand ten we were we were giving the public schools to mills\nI'm On a county bases and the state said look we're in a recession that we're going to take a half a mile away from 'em structural you\nKnow dollars and we're going to take a half a middle of that and put it towards salaries so that we can make this budget\nAnd when you say half a meal you're talking about a percentage point not half a million dollars on folks folks listening you thought five hundred thousand it's the ...\nNFL we're going to take a half of a point of millage and we're going to move you move it to salaries and instructional salaries but we're going to give it back to you when the economy recovers so the economy recovers and we never get that half a mail back to the schools\nTens of millions of dollars that could be used for air conditioning repairs structure repairs taking let out of our schools and it was never returned\nSo once you you you lost it because of the circumstances they get better and you can't gained it\nBack yeah and then they they hand our superintendent up this budget say make it work\nAnd then some people want to come back and say well you know they're not managing it well well they're doing the best that they can they're they're working at funding levels that are\nTwo thousand three two thousand four it's just we really have to refocus we need to refocus legislature on 'em enough money to educate our kids well\nAnd that's why I'm Glad that you folks took the time to come on tonight real quick I Do Barbara's been holding out of Sarasota Barbara thank you so much for holding your on without Saddam what your legal question\n[noise] bar or are you there [noise] Ah yes if\nThey asked the dom face so much for holding how're you doing sweetheart\n[noise] good uh we got a question\nI'm Adam ... got a letter from the state I didn't take Les ... how long have we seen the kind of a patio\nAnd you can take a clash\nOkay so you have a business purpose only license and your your question is All right well do you have well a little more information you charge which something what was the reason you're white\n... oh okay what does tend to like I ...\nI had a I have a lawyer and like a totally over for eating and like they at least daylight but I didn't do anything [noise]\nOkay I argue pending is are pending any blood results breath results lab results\nUm any any of this stuff so I don't know I think they're they're just waiting like they keep pushing\nIt off well let me ask you this do gotten my great sounds to me like she refused everything did you refused breakfast [noise] yep\nSo she got suspended for the refusal to and so she's driving on a beep you or the question is did she waived her right to the hearing did they request to hearing it the DMV and she's on the forty two day permit there's some other questions we need to\nI have whatever it's like ... ... I had to go down to like the board or whatever and\nSay you have a hard ice and she said to me it sounds to me like she way right it doesn't have the ... when I was like what are you waive the end of the\nCondition of the Web or you have to enroll in to the Y. school but you've got to\n... go to they had in ... and how long\nYou got to get well you have to enroll in that and then you've got to take the first class available is what I tell my client what well in order to get the the permit non she uh she already had to have in ... in rural show show should prove enroll night she was supposed to have a pre determined de da de ... beyond the day\nI like what the Bible as I Am a lot of issues going on and I couldn't get that because they have like you have to have a role and you have to like go down there and like extra AOL okay however it worked\nWell you got like you got a complete now it's not as if you're not an admission you got to complete the level one do you watch\n... if she doesn't ... that she does complete the school when she's posted they'll notify Tallahassee that you didn't attend incomplete\nBut how long do you have any ...\nShe's in her car questionnaires cases laughing so long\nYou know there's nothing to do this her but but the suspension the beep you or nothing to do with the criminal case this is simply a condition of of the waiver she had to sign up for DUI school and she has to attended and she had\nBut it will answer six month visit nine months of the twelve months the question is how long do I take for that and here's an I don't know if we know the answer because it depends on the wet it's reported from the local DMV to Tallahassee the department of I was your B a B and then back down before the waiver before the Web or used to be\nA couple of months hold on hold on one second\nOkay oh we used to be that they had to ... in rolling completed within Ninety Days\nBut now with the waiver typically I'm In I don't know if this is in Sarasota so that's why I'm I'm the policies from went off to the next or actually a little bit different in Hillsborough County they make you come in with the date that you've requested\nSarasota is controlled by the ... county office and apparently they don't have the same requirements are issuing the or\nThe temporary permits or the BP oh on just proven Roman without coming in with his best by date\nUm I Would say that if you don't get it done ASAP I wouldn't even wait to Ninety Days I say if you don't get it done um tomorrow sign up and get it done in\nOur area you're going to be and here's another short answer Barbara call the folks down to the DMV being served so to say hey guys when he goes to some of my life yeah\nWe're going to say oh well you haven't completed it that you're going to do they're going to send it up there and then you know the clocks gonna ride sometimes you don't know the answer\nYou just run right to the source that might actually mine was good in in in the post office or their their uh the there'll be a nice spoke to live there was a very nice spoke to actually I like dealing with an old county IBM deal they listen to the folks are are you ready to sing my\nKelly and are going to do ... things fail you're ready to show the wings are going to sing yeah this is brought to you by random Belmont family owned company been sort of the bay area for twenty five years\nSerious agents are here to educate to guide you through the mail process is apt to be able to ... more seven you've got to be because bond never sleep they're gonna help you in the process go smoothly if you or someone you know he's been arrested or if you listen to the show right now and you got a warrant this number is for you ate one three to five for two to four or five he won three to five for\nA district fifty eight you were talking a little bit about some things that were concerning about schools and obviously you're history as an educator or any other issues on the forefront at least for your district as you campaign to those folks listening here tonight\nWell I think another big thing in our district is since we uh our district encompasses temple terrace in Plant City so we are the tale of two cities in our district and another issue that seems to be going around that I hear a lot about out on the campaign trail is the top down\nAnd the big footing of those a smaller government and you hear of him how Tallahassee will try to dictate to them or what they need to do or if they want to do something like ... terrorists want him to outlaw plastic bags and Tallahassee told them they could not do that\nUm so the fact the Tallahassee is always trying to step down and tell the smaller government is always what's going on and what to do [noise]\nUm I I think that that needs to go way with me they need to have they're making their own decisions for their own towns around cities so they should be able to do\nThat well that's an interesting point and I really appreciate your bringing that up I haven't heard that one very often or talked about that issue on the show which is one of the reasons why I was excited to have you guys come on tonight then you had a question I think for our um our representative here about an issue that was on your mind\nYeah and I think it's just sort of a a smaller example of a bigger problem of when you know Seventy percent of or Seventy plus percent of the people in Florida vote to ah legalized medical marijuana and expand the licenses but\nUm since the past they have an extended one new license uh to uh organizations to open a stores um I I think the only ones that had it were the ones who originally had it for a kid seizures and in CBD but what what's the holdup and what\nWe know they created a monopoly and they did that intentionally um they're only X number of licenses and X number growers and that in my opinion it's wrong and I mean it's\nYou know we are moving this is the first step toward legalization and perhaps recreational use it may take time in Florida for that to happen but\nI think that we're moving in that direction and I think that problem here is let's take an ABC liquor store for example you know we put ABC liquor stores and they follow regulations and they do what they have to do to be regulated that you know I hear\nPeople talk in Tallahassee all the time about free market\nI hear them talk constantly about free market free market free market and the truth of the matter is is rather than all this regulation um\nLet the market ... bread itself I mean you won't see you know we we see a CBS and Walgreens across the street from each other but somewhere along the line at a quill a brace I don't know who we we are to think that we should regulate to\nA specific number of dispensaries and they could be many miles away from someone who has a license and you know now the excuses well we can deliver it's ridiculous I mean it is a monopoly created to make more tight millions of dollars for just aren't as\nSo so is it a matter of crony so it was it a matter of holding up the lessons ... who ah give new licenses so those who had license to spend millions in getting those license near the head start in the marketplace\nBasically exactly\nEverything they're always talking about capitalism and how ... will make ... make a product cheaper how will make it more available and here they are capitalism is all about but yet it with this issue or not about being\nTrained just like me to Seventy percent of the people voted ... of the voter sure what about the concern that there might be some sort of abuses we are talking about um illegal drugs and they often about a like a very large potential\nUm um financial a arena\nHere I mean there's obviously if it becomes legalize there'll be a lot of money involved I mean it's not only legalize recreational you're talking about uh but but just it seems to me that a lot of the regulations are in place because of the perceived abused that that that's going to go on if if they let the free market take over I mean I I don't know\n[noise] well you know there we have a lot of work to do on this before we look at marijuana on a recreational basis you know we have to address\nIn the same way we have to take a look at someone for a DUI [noise] um we are going to have to figure out effective um affordable testing if we told someone over there so many pieces of this puzzle that we need to put together but the will of the vote yeah that's right in the state of Florida we voted\nOverwhelmingly they'd been ignored for medical marijuana and and and it's been intentional I mean you know we we have had\nA a a governor in office that has that has continued to under fund that department intentionally they are so overwhelmed and under staffed and that is intentional\nI had a client that came to me not a client or a constituent that came to me in the office sent in his went to see the doctor sent in all of his paperwork sent in\nA money order um cold and called and called for months and they were like well we don't know where your money order as we can't help you know\nI'm again did it again again couldn't you know it wasn't until I called it intervened um that that that that individual's medical marijuana card\nFinally was moving forward and if anyone needs help they're welcome to call my office because I Am happy to call and apply the pressure we actually um\n... [laughter] I Can't do that it's okay it's all it's ... it's All right Bye bye so it's passion and they did in and let your okay Jack ... is that a reason not to what you said with the\nI Do want to make one point in in e Michael is here and he is a candidate but he's a judicial candidates and and there's a reason why I haven't asked him the same questions are they ask you about um representative and and I and of course you feel\nYou know his is a a nonpartisan is non political\nAnd he cannot take a stand on my ...

reason you have\nNo idea I mean we don't have a free day\nFrom a Thursday the Sunday after this weekend until February it's unbelievable how many things come up my complaining about it I'd much rather

were all\nPunch out I hurt Debbie Victor Cheryl I assume that's is that supposed to be Cheryl Carmen in line for yeah\nDo shower out uh Jason all please hold on a Dominic very yellowish here in fact let's take one called on before we go to break that ... let's let's talk to a Jason animal free up some phone lines what's what he got Jason you're on with that Saddam\n... guys but somebody a dumb question a lot wife uh she works shovel and uh last week on supposedly otherwise day or a boss that George Tex ... it wasn't that responded tax message\nA bigger ever got it and then now yesterday I was I got fired it never been disciplined facts just had her ... the weight rate\nIt gave me a raise and then now because she supposedly did respond that tax bases that box called it a band the ... and ... she but terminated\nCheese it's not work phone it's a personal phone you're never contacted any other way where like temporarily conduct any other way uh\nThey were tied to call her astronaut respond to it that that is that your email or anything well how\nHow do they usually communicate which works at home it's usually tax to her personal phone or is there some other means of communication that as a normal course of her business\nUh was using email or sometimes you does texture jak to give me a call or whatever you know it but it's like I said it's not a work ball and they don't pay the rest of the fall they don't care for the service of the fall in\nThere and how long did it go unanswered how long did the ...\nSupposedly ... whites day and then in a way and then yesterday at ten o'clock in the morning boss called her I said you'd never spent about ... ... ...\nWell I don't think that is is correct in the sense that it's a band in ... in the sense that she's a band that her job however yeah however you know I I don't see any legalities and her being fired I mean she's calling in something I don't think it is\nHowever she still has the ability to terminate her uh if if they chose a you know and I mean there is no discrimination there there there's nothing that is deemed inappropriate other than she is just labeling it something that I don't think it's classified ads\nAh but I don't think that there is a legal recourse under labor employment law to go after the boss because you were terminated now might be a dumb reason\nYeah I mean I I've been fired before you know\nFor dumb reasons you know and and your things that are outside of my control unfortunately if you didn't get the tax\nYes outside of her control yeah that's a conversation she's having her former employers maybe they re hire her back saying hey look I didn't get the message of support signal I'm sure if I got it I Would have responded or maybe she should be a little more diligent return if she didn't get the signal man I don't believe that you know I mean what is it\nToo is in her mother was having surgery at that time okay that that was supposedly say she was at the hospital so it's a hospital singles or not\nThat reliable well there you go there there's a great reason bought me but that's all or a bus or didn't respond then why did you call or email or or whatever\nWell you got to stand on her boss her boss doesn't have to give you an answer for right\nAnd also if if you're an I look I'm not talking about specifically about your wife mostly talking about Spanish here if you haven't heard from me you should go outside of every once in a while when I was a signal hey let me just make sure that fuzzy important calls as wide overtime I call a bunch of\nAh so sorry sorry about your wife serves ... especially in this day you got no record\nI mean there's I mean there is no legal I mean she can call and explain what happened maybe get back and do graces maybe look boss is getting bad moods maybe they do things that the next day they regret I had a conversation and I've seen where people come back yeah you know and that's what I Would recommend if not you're going to\nYou know she can get you know unemployment for a short period of time or single out back in the workforce\nSo good luck to you sir I look I got one phone line open it's an
