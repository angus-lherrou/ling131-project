whatever go on the I'm totally wrong it by ear and I paid a lot of it I\nReally you'll Johnny's a vision in this thing 'cause most people I think uh I have a lot of wealthy friends uh-huh they want their time but they don't want to have to project work at Wal Mart so if if it were\nWell it's three hundred and fifty million total ... most people are gonna go pursue dreams unhappiness things they wanted to you\nThey're not going to have an eight to five job because all the people watching tells you don't speak English speaking towering so they want to buy their time that they don't necessarily want to write the book but they're going to pay people to do that job\nAnd I totally feel the Johnny saying because I Would just be the same thing I Would pursue happiness and dreams and I I don't think they opened up a tech company I'm not going to be on the assembly line of work but I Will it be behind was treated people having on uh doing different things\nYeah I mean that's why that's why you are that's why you played the mega millions and so you can make all that\nStuff how are you saying that you're wealthy friends have resented or regretted the time they sang grinding to get to that position of well\nNot at all but I think most people have been graced they were at or where they come from to know where they're at and I think\nDon't you think there's a sense of pride that comes along with the fact that you know the you bust your ass or Fifteen Years and gardening and millionaire or early\nBut listen nobody wants to lose their money and all those people that are that are winded in a hostile all their life\nThat that are in your ... your spirit to win it alive doesn't just because you have money the money is just gives all these opportunities these great things that will journeys but I'm saying the last couple of months I think\nYou can't really do normal people like all of us that you know struggle the lake or just grind it every day to make it happen if you had those gifts\nYou had that money you could pursue all sorts of avenue and it wouldn't matter that\nThe state means that it doesn't matter if you fail so we open up fifty jobs in sales and we have all this money when we were not able to pay our mortgage or to not losing our own well now that's the state so you have to make it a try something but if you have the money it gives you the option to\nIf it works it works if it doesn't it doesn't but no matter how much you have\nYou're never going to want to stop making it and winning\nAnd actually my ... that that's solid solid point thanks for the call buddy appreciate you will yeah\nAnd that's what I'm trying to stay to I'm not going to like I I've I've been grinding so now if I get that money\nI'm not going to forget again the did you just my opinion of what I think what happened like I'm not there who's right or wrong I'm not either forget behind grind it and and made money that Johnny millionaires billionaires whatever they have a reputation to uphold screw that more than just the money it's their identity it's who they are they I\n... isn't he doesn't just work for Facebook he is Facebook he identifies himself\nAs a Facebook I get it I mean I did that that kind of reputation uphold but I'm not getting the right people are depending on hand so there's a lot of pressure it's not just that he's rich and whatever\nI Know know what forget that can burn right I'm Talking about getting six hundred million dollars and going but but you didn't grind to get it yeah I did I did because I'm forty six and all I've done has worked since I was Seventeen\nAt all I've done all I've done so I get that six hundred million I'm not going to forget all the work that I'd done up until this point I get back to look back now and go you know what\nI I Know the struggle I wasn't some kid born with this money 'cause that's how a lot of people get their money\nYou know you call it old money I Know people will do money sure I Would I'm Glad I didn't get it that way but if I hit the the mega millions and I plan on doing that tomorrow I Will never forget how hard I've worked all I knew was wake up every morning and do focus and see how bad my neck in my back and all my body aches because of how hard I work uh so yeah\nNow the dream start now at forty six years old now I get to retire something that without the mega millions is probably never going to happen for me\nWhich is which is you know listen I I I completely under yeah I just I'm just saying for me personally I feel like it would ruin it might kill the dried if I

on the phone right now the one the only the empowered somebody\nWas going on by the way yeah just too hot to decorate that she had to write your right it's gross outside it's horrible oh wait really quite the attempts on for one thing I'm Johnny yeah ... ... oh\nMan I don't yeah that was probably the ends next question right probably right I Am a yeah your back on the line now what's up buddy\n[noise] well hopefully that's a problem with me is that I care for people in my group so I'm probably\nA little ones allow GM you got to know how to do it alone plus three and you got you got to know how to do it by now you're like oh guys daddy's you run a Walmart for a little while and then you just you you know you just come back later at gas break did almost your dinner tonight sweetheart although I'm not feeling so good ...\nTurkey or something like that\nUnfortunately I'll be going to Walmart and target for real\nIt yeah and absolutely or yeah you'd better do it way before a Thanksgiving Day people to go shopping for Thanksgiving on the the evil Thanksgiving idiots and they deserve all the pain that they suffered a grocery store yeah\nYeah yeah I don't understand that the grocer you got to get the grocery store down out a way to turkey and everything else like that either frozen turkey I avoid the Wednesday before Thanksgiving at the grocery store but I Am one of those idiots set of going out on Thanksgiving\nYou know shopping yeah what we're doing this year is we're doing the fringe Thanksgiving on Sunday before and I think Thanksgiving Day we're just going to crash other people's Thanksgiving flu so if you want me to eat your Thanksgiving you know I'm getting just sent me an invite you know we're almost neighbors I'll stop bio eat I'll eat some of your food\nOr you can do your kids in the pool you know whenever you need\nAll that shit all the leftover turkey because like I said we set your like four of us so there's always leftovers but\nI Love having turkey leftovers like two or three days because I'm the only one of the cold turkey sandwiches I was doing those Dahmer sandwiches way before public swallow we're doing them\nI that's a sad thing I can I say I bought one on a Facebook last year when I was we did Thanksgiving in Georgia and I made a big old fat Thanksgiving sandwich with the the the the turkey and the cranberry sauce and the stuffing and everything on she had been through like a dad would style ah so fast so good [laughter] this is\nWhy are we getting ruined took her to talk about\nIt and I'm so fat I'm Sorry uh so you saw the new Halloween now is this say is in the sequel or is it a a like a remake what exactly is it\nOkay this is the deal just like they said all along after I saw the movie they were totally right it's the original Nineteen Seventy version\nThere's some really big nor\nEverything else that happened in between okay he does not matter it is that first movie in this move and here's the crazy thing about that person that that is a fantastic movie right Johnny liked that movie correct yes [noise]\nYes the originals great and the original is so good that it's made us believe that Halloween is a good franchise it's actually a terrible French\nI remember the first one right it's the only good one\nWhat was the one where they played a dumb commercial with snakes can out our eyeballs\nI think that was season which\nPart yeah it was so bad one of them and it was like I wasn't there like an Alice Cooper song with interest it was so bad\nIt was so bad had nothing to do with Michael Meyers ... it wasn't on how the movie yeah and the second one you know they kind of have the whole thing with the hospital but like I said that's ignored I mean we've had Paul wrote in Halloween movies Michelle Williams L. O. Cool J resurrect referred to as the Busta Rhymes one ha ha so crazy that\nThat that original Halloween is just so great that it's made us for gifted all these sequels and remake some group of people have been very good at all\nBut that changes with this one oh boy changes in a big way because they get back to basics a lot with this it's a lot more simpler it sticks with that story of\nJust the killer that just keeps on comedy you know let her face creams in the house with the skin ... has been wearing the trust McCain so let's terrified and obviously Jason comes out of nowhere friday's in your dreams\nBut there's something just just so eerie about Michael Meyers because he doesn't run at ya he doesn't do anything you know to to briskly just walk towards yeah\nBut it's just so terrifying he just kind of disappears and go over there but it's also a lot simpler Johnny it kinda just get back to basics it almost feels like an old Seventy targeted\nI Love it and is it is it is an action packed throughout is it a long movie like this is a build a how how's how's the flow of it\nUnder normal hours which is good for her movies that's a good\nThing under two hours now just like the first of all the way it does build potentially I mean it takes a Halloween to get going that original this one gets going a lot quicker and like I said they don't shy away from the Gore no one is safe in this movie and it's pretty brutal at times but also hides things in the background\nWhere maybe you only get sound ... a glimpse of something or they use the darkness to kind of do the scares it's simple in a way but yes it builds the tension you kind of see everything come to a climax and the third act oh man it's\nWild I mean it's really good Jimmy Curtis is great in it she just owns this character it's a different type of role for her in this branch eyes and just to think that that's forty years difference between these two it took forty years to finally have a great fall off the Halloween it's amazing I took that long\nIt's crazy to think it's been forty years um yeah in Jamie Lee Curtis she's pretty high when she's got to be one of the really sixty five years old now like a hundred and four\nWell they've player is like a broken character I mean this is a lot about you know survivors and PBS the with her with what she went\nFor the night for me to Michael he's even six now that's that's kind of character three years later but he's still just you know there's strong refuse treatment\nFor whatever reason he's just this mammoth of a man that can just take people out he doesn't say a word that mass is there the look is there the music said that's a big part of this whole process as when\nDavid Gordon Green and ... and Jason Blum house they went to John Carpenter first and told them their plans of what they thought they were going to do he kind of gave me his blessing and he stepped away 'cause he thought they had a great idea then they went to Jamie Lee Curtis\nShowed her and gave her the idea of what they were going to do so I think they did it the right way\nWhere they got the blessing of the original director John carpeted who brought this character to life and you don't have to break out movie with it and Jamie Lee Curtis which was her breakout role to bring 'em all back in the picture to tell the story where it definitely have like a glossy two thousand Eighteenth feel to it in some ways\nBut like I said and a lot of ways it still feels like kind of like the ... seventies movie it was\nJust creepy horror movies where there don't worry about being PC if Gore I mean there has some core moments but it's not over the top Gore but there's definitely some moments that'll make it look away and it's a chance but I guess that the last you know probably twenty five minutes of it I mean you're on the edge you swap\nExciting in the end is that starting tonight\nShow and he started tonight and I'm expecting a big big money for this movie yeah\nI mean I had originally said you know sixty million I mean I think they could be anywhere from Seventy five to eighty million timing is everything with this movie there's no scary movies out right now just like you said maybe this'll\nMoved go before church go see Halloween alright buddy than pay them we'll talk to you and I thought the letter\nLiterally a heart that seeing pal AT T and Powell media I'm ...

banning a group of people from trick or treating and doesn't sound too good I'm One hundred percent on board I I Love this idea I think that these people have been getting away with trick or treating a my lawn at my doorstep for too long you're right and I\nSay this you know my goodness well certain ones do when it comes to this man I'm telling you that right now\nNo we're not building a wall

could be Chinese people could be Puerto Rican people could be Caucasian to be black people it's all about age because this town is planning on banning teenagers from trick or treating oh okay yeah and I'm a hundred percent on board because I personally\nStand it I Can't stand when Fifteen and sixteen year old little ... candy mongering little jerks come up to your door and trick or treat them don't even have real costumes on or they just called the damn street\nClothes to get some candy goddamn\nJob you're old enough to be in the workforce by your old Snickers don't these are for little kids that are dressing up there and joins Halloween and then the style that that they're that they're carrying on not for some Fifteen sixteen year old would jerks\nI Love this idea I Love it a lot and I think everybody should uh implement\nThis and uh that's made the news and it says are you\nThere are talking about putting them in jail and it's a little children over twelve may face jail time for trick or treating in some towns uh yeah\nAnd let's start with the big question what what is your idea of too old to trick or treat like morally not legally like did you took a dream as a kid yeah so when did you stop I think I trick or treat until I was sixteen you're part of the problem\nIs a good care of your good kid I don't buy candy\nAnd I had no okay see I have a few greed jerk I always had to pull that I've done it with the pillow case when I was a kid it was so hot roast yeah ah right angle you\nI Know there's no I'm pleased man has to take pills or lots of water or some of it is not only suggests an age but they will also send kids over the legal limit to jail for dressing up and going door to door looking for candy jails a little stream it is yeah\nBut I wouldn't mind if there was officers patrolling neighborhoods and they could see a\nA older teenager and go hey\nTyler take that crap to the house or just stop it\nJust do it all what what I did when I was a a Seventeen Eighteen I send my younger siblings out to do my betting I Would I Would wonder if you don't have any then ran the kid whenever you got to do homework go CBS and buy your own\nDamn candy not and fine we don't get your ... be fun if you don't you may die from you know being poisoned you don't like that you like the the ... yeah my dad always check my can about this you buy your own poison and you poison ten percent of your own candy with a razor blades in it yourself yeah\nApple much water apples are sowing needles that that was the thing when I was a kid apparently\nI don't know I remember I I'm old enough to remember when they would give you a real food oh yeah I still have that happen before you know\nIn today's today's society\nThere is no way I feel a little ... two years ago but now

says you can't have an STD if you never get tested a sort of thing but I Want to hear from other people you purposely avoid anything that might lead to bad\nNews I Know a lotta people even Johnny said

I remember one time I was really really scared to give blood I still am I almost cry every single time um but I hadn't given or hadn't had my blood drawn in probably like five or six years and I went to the doctor when I was in Michigan\nAnd ah she did a full checkups usually everything looks great you know I did a urine test and everything and uh she was like OK I should I get a blood test and she's like well I don't see why you would I'm like well what if you know like cancer or aids or\nDo you like or do you feel sick and I'm like no you're fine and I'm like you just think like you don't really know she's like well we can get you a blood test and like\nI don't want to let that she's like I should get a blood test and I'm like I feel like I don't wanna like do I look normal right and she it was just as back and forth because I was so scared that I might have something but I'm also terrified of giving blood is kinda like the back and forth I ended up getting the test and everything was fine\nBut it was because of just the fear of the needle I mean I'm not a needle anyways for the for the give the blood you're still going to have to have the needle though right\nNow I was not going to get a blood tested all she told me it was not necessary for me to get a blood test but I was worried that I had a there is something that can be detected only in blood\nRight right so we're going to test the I mean they're going to have to test the blood regardless\nIf I were not going to get a blood test at all but then because I was worried I might have something she said why don't we also do a blood test so I was going back and forth because I'm I'm really scared of the blood test but I decided I needed know like if if something is better I Know now than later always it's always better to have the information as soon as possible\nI Can't imagine the guilt of giving something to somebody else if you did have it in the weird circumstance a dessert I mean not that I'm you know a party animal or anything yeah doing intervene us drugs and you know having gay sex but just in case something happens where you know I Do\nHave something I Would feel so bad if I gave it to somebody else I actually went to the doctor not too long ago as a last year no I just went for a routine physical okay\nThey're going to see a way I see it a hundred percent they're going to see it yeah it was starting to see it when I'm ready yeah the thing is just like yeah that's the beginning when you're trying to impress but after a while I talking to fade away you're not going to give it s anymore\nI feel honest takes all the luster off the team you know doesn't have much less started to begin with but now he it and if natural habitat where just cowering and fear\nYou know pretty funny I actually yeah exactly funny I don't want to I don't want it to be funny I mean it's an sexy doesn't mean it's bad\nIt's just you know it's it's interesting to look at it the body part that I don't have I'm often very you know like you poke it and no I don't know about you don't ...
