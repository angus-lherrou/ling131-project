shopping\nNow if I say it on the air ... week a time stamp they're sending somebody steals my idea I consume right nine fifty pm Monday our fifteenth visits shark tank worthy sharing for everyone was so excited about it All right go ahead\n[noise] here's my idea it's called smart cards [noise] okay now you know you have a self checkout\nSkip that with smart cards and you have a scanner on the handle of your car as you grab your grocery your skin and on the card you put it inside the card [noise]\nIt's scan it gives you a total\nOf a running Toto of your grocery bill now if you're somebody on a budget you only got like a hundred bucks you can look\nRight on the smart car and it's like you're up to eighty eight dollars sun right you grab you next item you scan it right on the cart toward inside basket right then\nBefore you leave you just swipe your your ah your debit card on the cart\nI Love and eight and a little green light will pop up on your cart meaning you're okay to walk up to your car with your card of groceries in Iraq to interact with the person standing in line that\nYou know that's going to charge and you can put a little video monitor on there and there's ads popping up on smart car the whole time so now you're selling ads bill sponsors and you get out the little a rack of plastic\nI was just going to know me and that yeah it's very young right hurry on their effect will last flight and put it in the bag smart cart to change the world are you got a shark take will not\nDo you remember the cards they used to have the calculators on the handle or yeah yeah yeah no this is they made it for the time his name right here is\nWhy by compatible this was smart car this is the the the new shopping during the checkout line there's look you've got to a grocery store that says on the outside we don't take cash smart car store only you you don't have debt it what yours is smart car boom hit it just like that damn\nSo nobody wants to invest in smart car please talk to me will go to church together I'm telling you do a great idea let's say I love it how to interact with anybody waiting any line you know and\nYou don't need to think about it my girlfriend goes shopping every Saturday sometimes on Sunday and she gets she goes to Costco Walmart and sometimes you'll have public but usually just Costco Wal Mart\nShe doesn't care costs go up every damn weekend she sends me as a of a picture of the line at Wal Mart\nAnd it is backed up like there's a lot of people and I'm like why can't we figure this out twice you have to go to vote because of certain items at Walmart they don't have a Costco and vice versa you know so\nUh yeah because like we we drink almond milk and if you're going to get on another Costco you're getting seven gallons yeah I think when they ... gallon that's um you know little things like that\nBut but I thought about just got to be away in two thousand each team that you can sort of ... and you don't like you don't have to wait with all these idiots think about how you pay for gas now I don't I don't remember the last time I went to a gas station has been given forty dollars instead putting pumps you swipe my debit card and I get I don't talk to anybody I just go the technology\nIs there is just\n... yeah I've literally had people tell me they don't have data cars because they they hate banks banks of the beauty of smart\nCard if you try to leave with it you know the homeless people I'd walk out with ... goes on this thing is already wired into\nThe system you can't steal smart smart but then it kind of create some other issues like what they mean a lot of loss of jobs\nCard matters you know what you want a job you want you want to make good money learn how to work at smart car factory and make smart carts I'm just telling you maybe it will motivate people I mean you still have to have employees there to stock shelves and and to make sure to smart\nCards are operating ... a lot of people like the checkout and stuff those people will be obsolete won't eat them any more smokers could be an option that I don't know it's not like they'd be the only thing you know man\nLike self check outs an option but they're still true or six or seven other lame though they're going to be probably five years in transition of her die gets not going to happen overnight it's something that

ten K. finally I Am I mean I've\nBeen running on a treadmill kind of the last few weeks but ... yesterday I did six point five miles down bay shore pretty awesome feeling really good about it but this is what I realized this is what I realized at the end 'cause I'd ran from like ... all the way to Kurdish thanks in part just so I could see\nOctober fest and you know not get in essentially I just wanted to look in from the outside and then on the way back it's always the worst cause you run so much you're so proud of yourself you made it and then you're like oh ask them only half way 'cause I got to go back\nAnd I really consider getting a new verb but I'm like if you put the out and get a God damn mover on your run your pathetic and so I made myself or on and it was one of those\nThings where it was such a ... it was such an unpleasant experience because upstairs in my head I'm going I sucked on it\nSo I told myself have plus he bitch shot up and run and I started you know I started thinking about David God yeah\nI'm like oh David ... this guy got a check out this guy he's and he's a bit much but he does have a tendency here like a hundred miles with like broken ... yeah and he he was like yeah man I just told myself to do it and I did it and I'm like you can't even run like a half\nA mile like it and in perfect condition you're fine you're just being lazy and you know one when you flip that switch in your mind and you're like ooh I like this pain is feels good gas\nYou did it I did it and like literally twenty minutes later it was done\nOh I just always told myself like look you're gonna do it so you can you can be good if you hate it but you're still going to do it right you might as well enjoy it as much as you can\nAnd it was so funny how it is such a mind game because even if you think about if you're totally on motivated and then suddenly you're listening to your you know music on your phone and suddenly a good song comes on and then you get all this\nAll this crazy energy yeah oh yeah it's all in your mind 'cause change you ate something magical or you know you went to the bathroom and let everything out it was just he was a state of mind that music when it's pumping and the pumps you up and asked you up gets you in a good state of mind and then you're motivated and you're ready to go\nI have to find some sort of mix that I can listen to because\nI when I listen to music and I have like a good study when Pandora fines or write songs for me that morning where I have to keep skipping or image\nKeep running I Am much faster because I think I've slowed down and look at my phone to skip spell hundreds in a while I'm looking at park has park has aren't really hyping me up I'm just learning while I'm running absolutely want you to lower I mean I can take ten minutes\nOff my time just from listening to music\nI definitely do not listen I listen to pod cast a lot I was in a lot of like TED Talks in motivational speeches I'm all about the self development I'm all about learning new stuff but\nWhen it comes to exercising I Would highly recommend not listening to just spoken word it just doesn't ... the same way and it distracting from what you're doing you're supposed to be concentrating on your breathing or going faster and when you're listening to somebody else talk you're just not\nAs as emotionally engaged as you would be if you are listening to something like I don't know Metallica or something that's pumping you up\nYeah because I feel like you have to devote energy they're paying attention as if it's something I Want to listen to I have to really focus and then that takes away some of your momentum from just you know moving your feet mhm you know so yeah I think it's going to find some sort of mix so that can use that are just maybe ...\nYeah um when I was running yesterday I saw this guy I don't know why it pissed me off itching to piss me off 'cause like who cares\nBut this guy's wearing like a from twenty twenty sure oh yeah just running down the shore and it's one of those things now listen I don't care like I'm not going to stop him but it's like he was so obviously trying to ... talk that it was a noxious he's like I'm voting for Trump because I'm like I feel like if you're\nIf you were conservative and a place that's\nI Would say mostly liberal or people who think a certain way and you're trying to go against the grain it's your purposely trying to be like punk rock that's the only sort of analogy I have for it and you want everybody to know\nAnd you want to rile people up you know what I mean people just enjoying their they're beautiful\nSunday listen you allow yourself to get affected by it absolutely but I just feel like to me it's not noxious move because he wants people to do the double take he wants people to maybe say something to him I Know those types of people didn't wanna reaction out of people are sure so I find it annoying\nI I feel you and I hear you and I agree with you yes however I understand the reactionary move that a lot of these people take\nBecause of all the other crazy stuff that goes on I saw this video that kind of went viral round
