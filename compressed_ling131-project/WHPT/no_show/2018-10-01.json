ridiculous\nThan the money line was even crazier points verbs like sixteen and change but the money line was minus two thousand [noise] so if you wanted the Vikings you at a later two thousand dollars\nTo win a hundred so I Would go there and I don't know if the hand and you know two thousand dollars to win a hundred bucks\nGetting a snowy or why would any nobody's going to do that though\nRight well this schmuck did anything to do two thousand one hundred he bet nine thousand dollars and often he wager\nNine thousand dollars would you do that to win four hundred and fifty

so wrong that game like they're really good at picking the spreads being like it's just once in a while they're getting a free game that can help right what really what it is if\nYou looked at everything on paper Minnesota should've pummeled them right\nThey should've humble buffalo certain extenuating circumstance even Monica will tell you know buffalo should've got\n... well I didn't expect to win that game at all yeah no and then even then actually attack innocent fan so I mean before the game and\nI Know you're not laugh at me but the way the bills are they win games like that that doesn't get 'em all your ... come out and play a crappy team and lose ... ... so ... you know like you said on paper\nYou're right by it I think you know I never ever\nEver ever bet on\nOr against the jets neither apple or against it I'm reading or I don't touch the ... and I'm not a ... a\n... a rod you're like well that sounds like to join a just war after me every single time I tried it and I finally said you know what I Will never and I don't know if the judge anymore for that reason right for that reason they are good and they're supposed to windows of the games they look they feel that\nThey should be ... you don't care about or you are that's just that's usually what I Do know that is what I you know I'm\nNot so much a little bit I haven't been any games yet because of advantage he stopped going to have\nTo worry about about a lot more used to be a lot more\n... yup every weekend [noise] ... yeah\nWhat's that if he takes place so that as far as like a action on the game yeah\nYou know it gives me something ... you mean in my age are you like hijacked the gambling yeah no\nNo no pharmacy ... replaces yeah like they have that and the thing to look out for\nI have that vested interest the or I'm not just watching the plain old game ...\nI had a bunch of friends like mad at me because they started minutes at a defense because why wouldn't ya and that right you can you know and uh yeah Starbucks\nAnd they're mad at you like your coach the team or running back and I was like oh like why am I was playing against Kirk Cousins\nAnd you know\nIn the second quarter quarter he was minus four points because he had done nothing he ended up getting sixteen points but that's not what you expect that have occurred cousins against buffalo ... ... ... and you want to go back to got everything you deserve\nSo that's straight but I'm a team right know spread ... straight up but the money or the money like minus two thousand 'cause when you bet to spread it straight or just daring you know you just like he just graduated ...\nScares me and it's like this guy doing with this nine times like what he just like you said if he drunk and he's like well I got ... ... should disparaging you watch any of our dollars back I mean what are you doing raw certainly right now if\nHe would have bet the point spread he would have had a I Believe it's ... plus a ten percent so he could have played the spread\nAnd bet nine thousand dollars but he would have won that money would one nine thousand ... against the spread so he could have gone that said All right give me um his giving nine thousand on\nI Wonder if if that stuff that is now considered classic rock a class of kids would have been top forty with out like what drove it did radio Dr MTV or that MTV Dr radio ...\nMTV drought radio probably right yeah\nYeah so how did I get that all about it though how did they get that much power that fast so radio I've been around for decades right\nWe're going to be sold so money right rock or what I'm saying is so radios around for decades\nYeah right and it is what it is that all of a sudden MTV's launches in Nineteen eighty one\nI guess it was as immediately\nThey're calling the shots on I watch the new what's it but not radio anymore if MTV and then MTV drives\nEverything else\nThat's right I don't think and then they signed bands that sucked but look good but look there's obviously there's somebody signed that look through it and we're great right by the boards that no talent like I don't think\nAnd I wish I happened to be a fan of gun multiple times his name in concert um oh John Mellencamp\nI don't think he is I'm not sure he's as big an artist or is it important an an artist as he's become\nWithout MTV\nMedina she's not she wasn't initially known her for a great scene voiced by any means you know she didn't you know right they're hearing showed her main interest and let's go\nRight but he got to realize and I'm\nLike a virgin but that was never a cat was making records before MTV or Madonna was thing she thought it was it\nNo many but with that but you're saying how did they get to Dr haven't had so much power it there was a new videos were new and they were like OK videos I Am I'll hear like who else did that who else took charge and who had Ryan Center spot\nTo watch where I Am a national level where they go to ... than\nA short article in and\nMake no mistake about it that's why\nEvery radio station now has some sort of video component to it\nYeah now whether it whether it's something like um bone TV which is not common um most of the time the radio stations will be cheaper about it and just go Facebook Live but they'll want you to shoot video for every little thing you're doing because that's what people want to consume they want to consume you know they they love that whole that's\nThe different parts of me like I understand the videos and wanting to see your band play or whatever but an adolescent I'm not to pulling it though whatever but I can use me why radio and I know like you said this is ... is rare\nUm but to me radio is listening if not miserable if it's maybe visual on social media but it's not ... you know what I mean it but I don't that's where did that happen how did\nThe world is visual so radio has to conform I think I think that's what it is you did you provide a sound file on a on a tweet it's never getting clicked as much as if you provide a video with the same audio on it and you can watch and listen right yes everyone wants to see something still photos already been as big as video right\nVideos I Am yeah it's All right so radio has to come along or\nYour dog you know play along I ... on TV\nI play music videos will do it for me as\nMuch as an artist like as an artist like Mellencamp came around now mhm writing similar songs the same or whatever you know\nNo way top forty would open now had a good sound different unique sound loan that was about\nBut I'm saying I shouldn't hold in this country Rob a bank singer songwriter\nIs very rare you know and Sharon is you know his songs a pop ... you know um I I don't think of John Mellencamp been running pop songs at the time you know and then they give us the pop artist like he was a rock guy\n... well that's the way I always looked at it may be a moment\nLike country more country and that you think about like\nWhen he was the first one to him and uh\nAnd I'm ... him and really know for ...\nAnd he told me over the last week of August\nOr by two thousand anything really who played\nExactly as well I saw Willie Nelson and the problem I'll put it that way [laughter]\nIt's probably the same problem was that was a problem over and over again actually maybe ... you know it

Kellerman did such a good job with that\nWhenever the merchant usually on there are a lot of the other guys around there through the years Roy Jones junior yet George Foreman who was on there with them a manual Stewart all those guys did such a great job of it really interesting I I'm a big boxing fan I Love boxing\nAnd it's so funny 'cause it it seems like there's such a divide you can't like\nUFC and boxer that is really weird it had such a weird thing I'm not saying one is better than the other thing I enjoy boxing because I'll tweet out about boxing you know whatever you know you love in fighting or whoever some of these different people out to eat something a little bit the\nBugs us and I'm like I'm not taking shots you up here and just said I enjoy boxing I Love you actually I've been to a more UFC events that I have boxing about yeah\nYou know but it seems it's just such a weird thing the two totally different to you know sporting events in a HBO in a statement confirmed the initial report there was a report about New York times which brought a sad end to an era which the network brought a class\nIn high production value to the sports which included many of the biggest pay per view events in history\nAnd a breakthrough programming like the often does do put jaded twenty four seven ... documentary I Love those I Love to watch any sports documentary stuff hard knocks twenty four seven thirty ... thirty ... fantastic all those they're done so well they do such a great job\nThe HBO Sports stuff is always a lead Schreiber yeah and he doesn't sound anything like he sounds normally ... but he has such a great narrators boys and stuff on the same and said going forward in two thousand Nineteen will be a pivoting away from programming live boxing on HBO\nAs always we will remain open to looking at a band of events that are fix our uh that fit our programming mix that could be boxing so they could have some boxing in there but it won't be such a staple as it was\nI hear it's really expensive to produce and nobody's watching or winter yeah which say it's just kind of sucks but there's no there's no big characters in boxing any more I think that people can kinda gravitate towards\nYou know what the problem is you know what the problem is is that the heavyweight champion not a lot of people now because there's four different belts yup yeah not a unified belt\nOr you know if that's the big problem you have to be able to point and go that guy is the heavyweight champion and I know his name I Know it's Mike Tyson and it's exciting to watch them fight and he might knock somebody out in three seconds you know what I mean you need that\nType of person where your if you don't know who the heavyweight champion of the world is\nThan boxing is an interesting ... is pretty pretty simple and there's too many different WBFO the uh uh uh what's the other WBFO WBAI er I'd be out all the different one they have it's too many you need to go one guy he's got about he's the big guy but yeah so\nEven like when you have seeds may you know there's there are more there's more than just the U. S. C. when it comes to mixed martial arts right but still owe anybody talks about UFC if you have ... champion you the best in the world\nYeah because ballots or in my opinion ... is you ever made it to the U. S. E. yet or you were in the U. S. C. and he got shot it's the minor ... yeah I mean it really is if you're looking for the best fighters you're looking at the U. S. C. and they kind of have a stronghold on it was just a little bit of a little bit of a monopoly there even though you like you said there's other stuff out there so\nIt'll be interesting looking forward to the er McGregor ah can be by what are we gonna do well we got to figure that out because we're going to be on the crew yeah uh now Diane did email and say that the all the TVs do have the USB port right in there so if we can\nYou can purchase the fight to stream online and H. D. I. I looked into that okay well we're we're leaving the very worst case scenario you can go I think um who provides it I think YouTube revise and I think you can go right to us the end they provided an HD stream as well I'm not saying anything but a rather that might promote\nYou know I remember him [laughter] yeah I Need more money for beer [laughter] head on\nYou never know how good the why fight in the boat out sometimes\nCan be ... well I got super package I got a the highest one yeah yeah last year it was pretty good lay out here I didn't have any problems with it um so we'll see we'll see what happens by the way speaking of the crews did you find out who your Kevin made us yeah yeah I think it's just me a\nNumber yeah look I was your name on the ruble yeah\nBecause it's down to three man said if you put in your booking number you can see who your cabin made is ah his his Adam who was also the purple toddler a rowdy tech guy bus driver everything else yeah a man around town so they're going to be in the room together a gym maybe by himself ... years yet\nGod I don't know if you're in a way for us it was at all because\nWe didn't do anything about it didn't do anything about it you know obviously white the ceiling and white the ceiling fan and clean up on the floor and stuff but never did anything in the Senate was totally fine now holding offered at any of the stuff I don't know I I guess is caught it so fast but it was hilarious you over filters water bed\nStarted coming through the due to leave and you would have by all through the ... the bad totally\nDon't get why the water bed when away 'cause when I was a kid ... my parents ... everybody had to I had a water bed myself all through high school and so I'm going to my parents' house is it hard to have sex in the water bed I wanted I never was able to\nIt is the big Hoosier around one was although sometimes it would help me a little bit because you'd be like ... [laughter]\nTo come back and I was just set a metronome what do the work for me when I remember you jump in\nThe whole bad we're like Joe\n... but the one that I had that had the pattern it was pretty nice because it gave you a little bit of a you know I like that ... motion of the ocean yeah [laughter] that are not too much so yeah it was good or how do\nYou because I imagine if you if you had different schedules with your partner and you're living in the water bed you always wake them up when you\nGet out faster ... out of bed when the ...\nEither keep cranking up on the side that I I Would imagine one of the things that probably made it go by the wayside was by the insurance like if you oh yeah and international friends are doing something like that they were like hey if you're an idiot like this guy's Fred [laughter] filled up the water and it overflowed and came down the anybody has\nWater bed and would likely to come over to have sex on and just like\nOh please let me know
