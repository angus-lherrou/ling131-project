months\nOkay thank God so I just I wasted three I started to say three years I Would start screaming or do what now I now where you actually married or are you guys are just to get not married are not married so the question now is going to be we're really talking about child support now have you been deemed the father\nI have started the birth certificate but nowhere or they go about Bertie says when it comes down to it a credible rights right when you're not married\nYou're correct now a gym you have you ever done any family lost stuff uh fortunately just a couple of cases you know as far as like a marked man mecca to me for I hear a you know what happens\nIs if you're not married are deemed the father had a paternity test then the biological mother at this\nWhite has inherently all the power temporarily until you were you kind of get through that process okay here's a buttery tests\nAre if you're on the birth certificate you kind of check off the box with certain things and then you can you can start to establish yourself as All right you are the uh the maternal parents the the father of the child or children are now what I Would recommend that you do is stop what you're doing\nAll right don't engage with her anymore with any of this jazz and going on line with legal computers and you have to stop it what you want is the sponsor to this segment leading in was Jason ...\nAnd you need to get to a lawyer who does family law and you just sit down and say listen this is what I've been doing for three months and it sounds like to me you might be getting host and why and if you're listening to the show I don't want any my listeners getting host so what you need to do is you get a call Jason here's the number of giving number website again\nA F eight one three five one for\nOne zero five eight again he won three five for one zero five eight you can always go to ask Saddam dot com I can always give you any information you need with any of the sponsors any referrals of course Jason ad Balkan Berg log group dot com\nYou sit down with him and read him in on what's going on to protect your interests to make sure you have equal time with your kids to make sure you have the right amount you're going to pay because she right now holds all the cards oh yeah you're doing deals on napkins no no no I don't know where she\nWas giving me the amount of time that I was with the kids that's been good at least I've been getting every weekend and I also er once I get my place but I'm\nIn a in a mate mood than than the wind goes with her and that's ... but I think it's fair to stop\nPaying 'cause I'm afraid that it will build up the big guy a retro payments that I'll\nDo that or if you get to a lawyer and you get to Jason and he can help you you don't have to be scared or Frank okay okay yard who are legal rights and interests will be protected and that's designed to the show that drive people to the right groups are attorneys to help them\nThat's exactly what and and now ... what do we have to do cat go to break no we don't have to\nGo to if we have to go out and have to sign up with another one the duty to\nGo to break we go we can do that we never felt trying to be denied that's how I thank you very much or is that my my\nUh nope this is a Jeff now which is where it was a I Believe you were talking about you\nKnow there was somebody [laughter] why was this this this is Jeff does your neighbors are okay All right Jeff I think I might have been talking about ... you know maybe you're out without Saddam go ahead buddy when she got\nAll right I never thought I'd be calling you but here I Am a like your show though I'm living in Chicago\nI live in a condo community in St Pete and it's a no pet community However I've had a a dog I'm about thirty am dog many golden doodle that I had registered oh about a year ago as a service dog a\n... in a in the military I did not did I did know he's\nBasically an emotional support dog for me okay uh but the problem is I've got to community now I've lived there for about nine months telling me that I have to get rid of my dog they what documentation why I have a service dog and my doctor is just simply ... form stating\nPlease allow Jeff to have a service animal and didn't go into specifics as far as medication or reasoning why and I'm told that hip a that's a hip a violation number one\nTo require request a reason why I have a service dog\nAnd so I met a predicament right now where they're\nTo evict me or find me and I own this place because I have a service dog and uh I'm just kind of torn on what to do\nAll right well let me do this I've got a comment before I tell you what I think you should do I would I'm going to go around the room to my gas and\nSee what their opinions are if they have one I'll start with Mr singing this this thing or do you have any suggestions for Jeff\nI'd have to I don't have any suggestions on what to do yet but I think they can't have victim if it is a service dog I think\nOkay it's not a rental property I oh it was like yeah\nI don't I mean I don't I don't I think it's you know under the ... like that I I mean I have to look it up but that can be a condo association can't find you for having a service dog assuming that its use of service properly registered and you need it and that\nKind of ... well I registered name on line two just so you know I live as long as he's registered I mean you could be or day it was on yeah I can start Marion people\nSo I mean I don't know the right proper got Caesar's you know or do you are a concur with your husband or disagree\nWell if you're going to keep the dog you're going to go into a bunch of litigation way Talia cessation path again yeah ah my advice I think it might be faster and probably better for you to sound a place to buy someplace else than each way\n[laughter] somebody somewhere else to live\nAt your property you can sell it and buy something new\nI thought he was kind of his dream that one opinion [laughter] SADs ... show or not necessarily\nUse of that that is somewhat extreme shift but yeah but not in the last ... that are paying their hang out and that's why we're going around the room to relax you got all round up now there are but it was called now they're all around the Jamie would say you\nFor our caller here Jeff I Would just say that I I don't think it's a hip a violation for them to ask for a reason a medical reason to to ah show why you have the dog that's not a hip a violation it'd be a hip a violation if your doctor gave them your medical records or without your permission\nOr but if they can voluntarily give them the information they're requiring that's not a hip a violation my my first suggestion would they two ways especially now whether it be a lawyer condo association is have you read the condo ducks a joy documents\nYes\nOkay 'cause most people don't and most people on a ... never do and you'd be surprised the violations that that they'll issue that is not based on anything in their own documents and when does it say anything about service dogs\nIt it says no pet community it says service dogs allowed and they knew when I moved in that I had it had a dog that was registered as a service dog\nWell some of our own solid footing my run up in a big deal\nHere is what my my advice basically has a question to Jeff\nAnd Jeff I tell this to a lot of callers and a lot of listeners did a show you need to ask yourself internally what do you want in your heart do you want to fight the H away\nBecause they are attacking you over a service dog sounds like is properly registered in might be properly allowed if an ingenious question was great that is outlining the H away a contract you feel I fight nice people because you can't\nWell deaf to the other thing I Would say it probably a lot of times if if you just hire somebody to write a letter or real estate attorney citing their own condo docs there's a lot of times that's the first time they've ever seen it\nA writing them a letter um inciting their own condo docks and also a failure to do so that they may be responsible to you for ... a lot of times that first in the end of it and I ... to hundred and fifty bucks\nThe ... the other thing is I mean it sounds like if they're ... they're requesting documentation from you that is required in there they may be trying to comply with the ADA or whatever it is it covers that\nUm so I mean I'm a positive in in the ... probably says no pets\nAnd you know homeowners' association condos associations are almost I think it's a great call I think that's an a great position but it sounds like if they're asking for documentation that is in fact needed service dogs need they're trying to just make sure that I Can't stand nature ways I\nI I I live there was a real thing going on um rented law here I got to let\nYou go but I tell you what if you have nothing to do on a Tuesday night go down to an HMO a meeting and [laughter]\nOr in the process I've always liked 'em or the way the way judges good\nGood uh serve the community or by doing their job well or they can be an asset by following the law um by being prepared or when we we lawyers always like it when when when judges ... cases at a time ready for the hearing make quick rulings move their docket\nOr so we can avoid overcrowded court rooms that sort of thing um and it's always intrigued me whether it be from a family history or just from what I learned or doing the job myself in litigation just want to make sure I had enough experience before I took the plot\nWas there you go All right well again well thank you for coming on the show and you're still hanging out with us for another hour right are you gonna run out of here no I I'm a I'm going to be here until I get the hook for my wife by the world will like this is the how to go it's time\nTo go to a guy he mama happy aren't real quick or let me just run through these uh 'cause I Know I got the top of the hour coming up here can oh yeah I it's kind of speed limit ... do the\nJumps around real quick 'cause he said I went to camp with him ... what'd you do about Iraq\nIs that you listed a yeah maybe you're right\nYeah no I'm All right I just had a simple question\nHold on wait a minute I've [laughter] I Would would ride saw Robert I doubt or a cat that's five guys don't do it or whatever I think Roberts got a question ... real quick Robert what's your question I bake ... go ahead\nI'm Sorry I was corrected a but it had to be done by All right my ex wife she had a big or active by\nMy sister because she couldn't do it herself and then I had another girlfriend she's like oh I'll\nBe corrected you again I said well you can't do that to be\nIs it through blood don't you have to do it through family\nNo I mean ... if I let me tell you some\nI almost ... cat [laughter] out a Facebook post or enough time my wife called me what's wrong with that and I I don't know I mean I don't really know how many of their accent is that he has this emotional post Mike how's it talked about it yesterday\nAnd there's different types of march mean actors ... there there are things if they feel that if one's family friends\nA field that you are a danger to yourself or the community whether it's a mental illness whether it's alcohol whether it's drugs or there's different types of acts and again I mentioned the to the bakery march macher pronounce the ... the two in March men and Baker [noise] um you know and it's a serious thing and and folks frail looking out to protect you 'cause they don't want you to hurt yourself with the community\nUh and that's really why they do it and they probably did it out of love our who's next to Rob\nThat will go to Rob Hi right here I Would ask go ahead buddy\nHey ma or general and chief ... um I actually got with you I'm always go about my ASA animal I wanted to reach out to\nLike Jeff said maybe he's listening one it's not a service animal is they support animal you can go to jail if you stay service animal in certain states the second thing is\nThat he said Mr support I don't remember the court did the cat is that both did he say both out here they are okay\nI'm a social animal would be like a like a\nA a blind seeing eye dog you know the medium talk about but\nI'll continue okay um our oldest down hard it\nIs the governing body of federal rolling and you can all be charged a street and\nIf you go to a doctor which I did\nAnd you get your primary care and they say hey they write you a letter they write a script shit there is nothing anybody can say and they can get in major major trouble with\nUm the other way is to go to a psychiatric professional um and get a letter in a prescription from them\nIs how you do not as my advice to Jack I did it and I have a very very hard time with my property management and guess what an award can be shed they cannot do anything to me\nThat's why I Love the callers I I you know I Know why\nThat's why your caller's willing to callers and lending support because we're all a family here and went out to find the bum rap I appreciate you man Chamberlain chiefs rule\nThank you very much for that call and follow up with Jeff that's awesome do we have time for one more to what one more who's ... I don't know what order is who's been holding longest 'cause I Know Brittany is there a like on fire we did okay that's okay so then the market is a Brittany and mark if they can hold through the break or Kelly if you can tell Brittany mark\nAnd mark is that we're going to get to them and the other side Mike or have a problem with the contractors that corrected I get I get the right one\nDeath yeah All right it might go ahead you're on with that said I'm going to buy\nA quick rundown ... uh uh renovations done on the house found out after the fact after you\nFinish the work and I pay them that that ... that the workers not up to code and several serious respects and probably will have to be all completely already done so my question is since it's not up to code Hillsborough County I Wonder whether it's a good idea to go to the county with this or just go straight to small claims\nIt's about six thousand dollar job\nI'll rotate across the room I was just thinking what say you on that or was it was an apartment a job or do you\nDo not a permanent job now\nI'm\nA first of all it's not small claims 'cause six thousand dollars so it'd be kind of corn that's right county I wouldn't have paid them until I got a you know a certificate of ... or I bought one of the problem is eating permitted and so he could get in trouble for not permitting so\nThere's probably not I did I did it to go to the air and they are the call 'cause I could potentially have liability well\nI I wouldn't say not to go to the court necessarily 'cause you know of course not necessarily going to\nTalk to the county but who knows it's not in code other than yeah that's the only thing how how do you know\nI I Know a neighbor of mine that used to do the same word pointed it out to me and then he looks through Florida building code and we discovered that yes indeed we did not comply with the ... what kind of work was it a it's a it's some uh renovations to the exterior of the house don't really want to get specific\n... he was a license contractor\nOr he says he was a that there'd be is too I I just try to figure out what the best pack year I mean if I can I'm facing liability and not being up to code then lady considering it with the county is not a good idea maybe better to go straight\nAway or it I I don't know if he would approach the permits that it I assume that that this wasn't any permits that were pulled out and\nSo I said that he was on permission\nFor I mean that's that's that's the risk you took maybe I mean you're you're hired this guy who may or may not be a contractor you didn't\nPull the permits that'd be a call shades of the shades and I know I Know the guy didn't you know do it to code which he didn't pull the permits and the guy might not even be license that's what you call a trifecta of trouble\nYeah and I and I you know if you're just worried about and I you know I don't know is your concern that there's going to be wind damage or something to the exterior is just that you're going to be\nMy concern is what I'm planning on doing is is I'm going to be just completely redoing the job but I Want to get something back from this guy is there any possibility you don't have any recourse any any hope of getting something back from this guy\nI think he's chasing good money after bad yeah I mean that's your contract since he was going to do it all by code and everything else is there a contractors\nThis is a wink and a whistle\nNo there's a contract that states what he's going to do and and you get it lays down specifically what he\nDid he do that but he just didn't do it to ... he did it and then they stole it but you know but my question is to code to go that the contract said a code no you know what I mean let me ask you this question did you know that he wasn't pulling permits you knew that he wasn't\nNecessarily ... told me that the dollar amount that was being done it was a certain dollar amount that it wasn't that\nYeah that that's a risk but you have you tried going back to him to ask them to correct what you think is not to go to be tried that well\nBut he doesn't like all the\nOil that yet to fix this problem is going to need to pay the money I have a contractor getting their ... that's license all the permits make it the coat and do you have to spend a little more money\nTo get it done right but I Would not I don't I don't think he wants to go to your friend it said that\nThe court house say hey guess what I did die\nBefore you do that you may want to retain about allegedly alright Seventy
