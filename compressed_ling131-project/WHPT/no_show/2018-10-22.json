still your child\n... plenty of it they wouldn't give a ... [noise] so how did you eventually given back to just find another ah they\nHave to know that they had to think of all because he was the old ... Powell also falling asleep on the U.S [noise]\nWhy some story later what does he do now he's twenty four years old that he makes\nI'm On the shooter right now Brian fill up the great show shooter yeah probably swagger is the main way\nAnd say hold on please why or that you might as well hold on one sec hey so I guess that's why I played in the movie if I talking to you too\nEasy executive producer who may Marco yeah you ... you hear the executive producer markets yeah he did a great job about a third the third episode and I haven't been sucked into a TV show in quite some time here so lost them yeah yeah I Love the show right Philip he's the closest thing got Paul Walker at this point\nIs that is that the show and USA Network it is yeah so I'm like I had it on one night after wrestling I who\nWatches literally just been just because the shows they were in purgatory the whole time like you to you that that is turning off I just\nCan't get into things that are not based in reality and once you\nGet a fictional shows John there is no Bobby lead swagger\nYeah but but that is a very realistic scenario that could be played out you could crush on a plane and then you could you don't know what happens after we die would sell really play out John cut it absolutely because you really pick up a table and hit somebody in the back with it and expect them to not be crippled the but but the thing is about that everything\nIs rooted in the idea that it is an actual sporting event like that's the set up that's the story line so I mean you're buying into that but you got to be able to buy into a basic plot that is based in reality it it it would be really tough for me to go back and really get into last because\nA ton of people that love the show so much of a sudden the ending was horrible so if you're going to spend what seven eight nine seasons with a show and all those episodes it's gotta be worth the ride ...\nOkay um I don't have to agree with this subject this is my this is the way I embrace television programs the endings are never horrible the endings disappoint us because we have different expectations than the creator of the show\nIt is up to us as the consumer of the product to appreciate what the creator put out there as the ending it was their baby all along so they wrote an ending that fits along with their vision of the show now we get put off because we think oh it should have been as I didn't get this question to answer blah blah blah\nBut in actuality the problem is with us and our unreasonable expectations I'll hang up the listeners one\nDo you think that when he when they wrote the show he knew what the ending was going to be the whole time or that's something you kind of figure out as you get into it\nMay be honest yes I don't think that they had planned out the ... I think they just started writing the show and I don't think they thought from the very beginning it's going to the final ... and I want to give the ending away just in case but final shots gonna be a close up on a dog and you're going to realize that they all died I Know it's it's ... it's\nSo so what was it like if like it's one of those things where it's open to everybody's perception like was it had been what the hell was in a dream we don't know yeah yeah see like I don't want to show that didn't\nExist but it might actually happen what did we did the Sopranos really exist what happened at the end to Tony die to Tony not did they say the black to the guy coming into the bathroom kept Tony did meadow ever get her ... parallel bars and watch what do the black\nPeople on his show [laughter] that voice\nHeard racist I really do I'm very sorry to all my uh my southern rather than that I've been utilizing your voice racist yes it's time you you even things up a little because look what they were you know there weren't racists up in the northeastern United States of America well before there were racist down here in the south probably as soon as people went into that will sign on their ... like I look at all these people darker or lighter than I Am\nDon't they say one of the are you most racist states has where ah where you're\nYou're ... yeah they they I I just learned that recently I did not know there was such a a racist connotation with people from Boston I've never been I just it's just stuff I've read I think\nThey're just kinda hateful and generally\nYou call and hateful you call and aggressive\nOr they are aggressive and hateful and it's a different kind of racism up there and let me explain the difference differences down here in the south at least the way it used to be black I Would walk into a convenience store to get a team soda T E M is that there's much you make it a team so to please the guys like here you go in word and then he just like you know what I'm saying very much up north they'd be like\nHere's a I'd like to start to leave they go oh they do so they have a nice day yeah take it easy you see that at work right there when he walked away aggressive a much more subtle behind your back\nUm vicious racism and down here it was just like oh there's one of them are one of the ... you know so different kind of racism so I tried to portray that in the in the racist a voice that I use from this point forward I correct\nWhat do you tell me that I got a name for a walk or now alright ... a but I'm going to go with a last with what real\nOr washed oh us hey how do we not think about who's got the hobby a cat a kid is no no no\nIt's not it's perfect you know it's perfect nuts and the ... absolutely perfect John yeah yeah I like\nAll right hold on sir I'm going to give you something from our a process that has yet been dipped into this week okay wait\nThank you how do you ... the movie specialist checking employees higher him he's on Twitter at ... media\nIt's Gump and I love pulp fiction big is a very close second oh wow so I'm Glad we're aligned on big and if I were able to drop my anti Gump rhetoric for a moment I Would probably have to admit that that is a phenomenal role for him and a great movie that he carried\nSo you saw Gump seemed ... three times huh\nThat's one of those movies and like I Know it's great and probably watched it a couple of times I thought it was great but never have any interest in watching ever again like when I see it on um like I said I Can't even get into requiem for a dream for me yeah well that's that's understandable I've seen it wants [laughter] you can't see that again what movie the pulp fiction movie you watched the most in your life\nNo um I mean I see pulp fiction a lot but I've seen ... more than I seen pulp fiction I've seen the first vacation more than I've seen pulp fiction Caddyshack probably Goodfellas and sixteen candles\nWhat's my number one movie most watch movie of all time most watch movie of all the time at this point ... on a ...\nI've seen at once but I haven't even seen it at all I there is some hidden gems every time I watch it I cried that than to the movie really brings me down or something it's fight club they'll fight club oh really oh yeah it's\nA fun movie in a letter last would be good at\nIt doesn't give you enough though like you want that title that when you see you kinda know what's going on less could be any run of the mill porno any day like we need something that you\nYou're right it in the thought that that that was written I lost ... lost with like the last DVD box that well the OC was the last DVD box but that was only three seasons I I had all the entire series on DVD box set\nBy the way if everybody's got to hook up on a Roseanne box that I'm looking\nFor a sand box\nWell I'm just saying I Can't find it anywhere you know they pulled it off on my streaming devices and I was halfway through the second season is a reason for it I Need hard copies\nI have seen is pointing out and and I don't like to to feed into this rhetoric however however\nDoes it not make a sad statement on our country and the era in which we live currently that you have no option to watch Roseanne any longer yet on many different channels you can tune in and watched The Cosby show wow that I mean\nIs what Bill Cosby did better than what Rosanne did\nI Would say I would\nSay what Bill Cosby did is much much much worse ... if I look\nBut if I had to vote on [noise]\nIs it better to drug women [noise]\nSexually assault their feet and other parts of their body [noise]\nBasically treat them like trash\nOr send a bad week comparing someone to planet of the age they're\nHave to say what Rosanne did\nIs not worse\nThan what Bill costs on I mean there was no there was no physical harm done to anybody that whole thing I mean these women were\nDeemed unconscious and raped is hurting feeling among\nJust find that on I'm not trying to feed into anything I'm just\nIf you're if you're going to go overboard and overreact to an end whole all Roseanne everywhere\nYet you leave Bill Cosby on the air you you you love people to watch The Cosby show\nSeems odd to me now you can't find The Cosby mysteries anywhere do you know why that is is a terrible show\nI I'd like to be able to still watch them old rose and I'd like to\nBe able to watch the ... you're not I mean\nAm I'm a DVR come over any thought I'd like to I'd I'd like to see what it's all about or what it was all about you're not missing anything okay oh you are a\nBit sad Jay you never went back and you you had nothing but good things to say about that it was great it was not really going to ever catch up on oh I Know that but you can't you can't have you certainly oh [noise]\nWe know what Bill Cosby did those women [noise]\nYou can tune in and see I'm going\nLet clean what we'll talk gross blew\nRoom [noise]

I'd listen to the skimmer um I I didn't hear much of it lived myself because I I have a day job and I I don't really catch the first couple of hours the show\nBut um I got bombarded with DMZ in and text and I even a couple of phone calls telling me you should probably turn industry right now you probably didn't Andrew and I'm waiting tables and I can't really do it\nBut uh I as far as ... goes I mean I didn't lose sleep over anything that's good but ah it it became concerning I guess concern would be a better word where are you concerned about Ryan\nUnderstand I guess what I'm and I understand this is radio I I've been at the station over three years now so I understand how a lot of the content can go sometimes\nBut ah I didn't understand I thought for the longest time that I that you had nothing wrong with me that there was no I don't yeah yeah so so I guess I thought that when when I said that email which I sent you an apology which you said you accept the problems you said there was no issues with it anymore and\nUm I guess I thought it was squash at that point sure and uh I I Do admit that I could have ... much differently than I did or not that I I just want to you again my whole point of the whole thing was um Johnny wanted to be on that are sure to be a part of the problem he sent to set a text message um when\nWord got out of everybody that was going to be a part of it I was not on the list so I just wanted to be a part of it somehow cool and I could have gone about it differently I completely admit that but that was the whole premise behind the email\nGrants from the from the Senate console is Mac ...

radio station and I went outside and it took a look and there's enough time in between shows here\nAnd it looked like a plane crash or something like oh my gosh giant black cloud of smoke I mean what is that\nAnd um did you drive and tried to get close cells inside of the time my right to go check it out it turned out it was\nA sign of layers of recycling facility that was on fire but ah so I

the first one to legalize marijuana um throughout the entire country and\nKnow it's I guess what happened was Trudeau was doing a ... it was before he was the prime minister but I guess\nSome of the post and he was at a rally and someone had a sign that said decriminalize marijuana he goes I'll do one better I'll legalize it and tax it while regulate it and he lived up to his\nYou know he was just ... up your promises I've been doing and I don't know I Know there are a little bit like in that renegotiation of the um\n[noise] well enough of the ... you know and you know I Know they took a little bit of a beating you want to ask them because you went back to the table and renegotiating so maybe now is the best time for them to go out and say okay we're going to go to the well regulated well tax it and we'll make that money um but\nYou deal with people at the place went on like there was one part was that part of Canada that's all the weight up east ... Nova Scotia was like there was one store that that was legalizing it first at midnight or Newfoundland which one ... one of the two ... and are they will\nLegalizing at first and they had like lines around all the [laughter] and I'm like all those people I don't have any idea what was the thing that's what they said in the news report should go to the reporter saying I don't think I saw when he first timers [laughter] people who wanted to know\nWhat the um what the store would look like what a selection would be\nI'm a history no yeah and you know and Trudeau I'd said he's like new within a year we'd like to see the black market dawn ... you know and then saying well right now they're saying is a little bit of a drought and a little bit of a shortage so am I take a little bit longer but they think within the year to Eighteen months that the entire black my marijuana black marketing Canada\nWill be gone by because why wouldn't you want to go to the store\nBuy legally in the daylight yeah and not have to worry about underhanded stuff and I ... I can see why if these stores are allowed to deliver\n... [laughter]\nBecause you ... the first thing I was\nThinking I was like OK well who wouldn't want to just go to the store and buy it without having to worry about it right right as long as the prices are similar in that kind of thing and then and I'm like okay 'cause you're still and then you don't want to have to go yet I wanted to show up but if you can just dial phone number and have a delivery service will\nOverheat will deliver your fast food with you we ... we think [laughter] you know yeah ...\nThat's it for them to go yeah in Hong\nKong and you know what I say good for them I think it's a really cool move\nYeah why not let's see let's see what happens we'll see how it goes I mean but because in general it seems like it's going pretty well in the states though I did just the headline about my driver crashes are upper stoned drivers and the states that are legal they have like an increase of whatever the percentages\nSo they're watching that right but if you want and Will Stone right but\nIs there a decrease in drunk driving accidents you don't have a question or is it all just really so even doubt\nYeah yeah well I mean if you get some more ... I mean it's something like that I mean it could happen or somebody looking for his dad and putting in a you know you don't know over time we'll find out if that's true and you'll find out if we I mean but they're starting to his articles coming out now about how it deals with health and people don't know\nI've been taking the CBD Oil\nMhm like for two weeks now and you're so far\nMore than a normal size that more and\nThat and it's funny because there's a difference because I got one I'm from a listener here man then I ran out and it was a little bit pricey and Iran I was like All right and my doctor said she's I I can get it for you know so I got it from there and that one sucked\nDid nothing uh nothing for me to go back and bought the original and again I'm sleeping through the night aches and pains minimized wow yeah and that's from but that's just from the kind of is I mean that's all there are ... in that one never trace amounts of teach see like if I took the drug test now even though I haven't smoked pot and God Knows how young I\nWould I'd be positive oh so the week when you got didn't have THC\nDid you see that happen to be loyal to see and I just had did nothing for me the only one I happen to have you know minute\nIt'll help me sleep ... when I was doing the other one I had I slept through the night I didn't feel anxious I didn't like field and to even remember to put the Xanax in my pocket and ... you know that kinda thing I'm really it was so I just went back and bought five bottles with the original one\nDid you do it why not work works gives her from pick up and yeah I think it wherever you can sleep right\n... ... and has been asleep is an issue you know math online through what are you going to [noise]\nUh yeah you guys are talking about getting we delivered I just wanted to say you go to Washington DC and that's exactly how you get your weight\nDelivered delivered I I actually went to Washington DC\nAnd uh so they legalize it in DC and the funny that has all the politicians didn't want stores all over the capital of the United states so we'd so\n[noise] people get insurance for alien abductions\nAnd coconut and pirate takeovers crazy right what's not crazy as dominoes carry out insurance will replace your pizza for free if something happened\nTo you would actually distort whether it's dropping it or to pirate alien throwing coconut data karaoke dominoes large do we topping pizza for seven Ninety nine each carry it only has been limited time opera prices but they should try it and they very insurance coverage for this promotion of find explicitly you download download the at the beginning of intervention butter Richard apply to the dominant that come from what he tells\nMe that they have said when you do get back say\nIt's hard to recover from open heart surgery with how he\nIt's hard to get well when you sleep on the street\nIt's hard to take care of a baby with untreated depression\nHealth goes beyond the hospital\nAt Providence St Joseph how we believe health is a human rights to see what we're doing to advocate for the vulnerable and invest in health for all future dot P.

as good because it works [laughter] and um\nThat's just the one I use I think it's different because when I was taking the other one um I was it was telling me to take point six\nOr know how many think six millimeters almost like I was you know when you give you ... the children's motion you put it in the ... the little those little cut was using that to take the other CBD Oil and that stuff's

getting ... and some of the dark Web\nMore [laughter] [laughter] yeah\nI I work in criminal investigations and the ... while narcotics is not my wheelhouse I Do have a little insight as to how bad of an idea that it's\nAll right ah just because they yeah just because it's packaged well does not mean she is not going to get busted\nOne once\nOnce federal authorities flag a shipping address or shipper which it's very easy to get flagged all it takes his little old lady to get busted with a joint and she's going to give up how she's buying it and they're going to back backtrack how she got a package\nAnd they're going to flag that ship or and then every shipment that comes out of that that particular\nPerson they're going to start Dan when those people that are receiving so just because you buy it off the dark Web\nAnyway so okay so ... well I\nThink about it and let's just say let's just say it's a half hours a week oh even announced elite Ramona and you're knocking on my door and I get in trouble what's going to get a ticket that right\nWell you know true we're well you were trafficking interstate traffic and you know it's been rough conduct\nOkay so it is different it's not just like I have a quarter ounce of lead on me or not to wait on me it's the they get me for trafficking\nRight and they're gonna probably do multiple deliveries to your home [noise]\nMm well that is what they do is check I teach that he delivered right\nIn the lead to packages just keep coming in what the couches pile up and they look I'm going to you [laughter] okay everybody has all learning that is not something we all get along you know it sounds like you're right yeah in fact that you could\nPeople from getting in trouble yeah exactly you're right there are people not trying to do any harm but they are the interstate trafficking is no joke so\nGood point yeah yeah thank you officer guys yeah for shipping a\nWet blanket over ... [laughter]\nI mean I mean it's good that he called because you know you need some common sense in the discussion but because when it goes the interstate it's a whole different thing you I mean you nailed it we're a little bit on you know I hate to bring the crosses the line Joe\nWe've made an entire career out of having no common ... discussion and weigh less than the amount of normal amount of information right load and on line three what's going on I was a boy this is you know ... you know I'm good I'm good\nAh I'm all good vanilla girl she guys at the punch out\nPeriod I now I Know I [laughter]\n... period because I remember a larger city I I ramble but all we have today would receptors in our mind like we're married to do it and to me it's ridiculous that it's still a schedule it's still on schedule and\nLike it's up there with heroin but yet and we all know the medical benefits it's it's it's a play what they're trying to do right now in my opinion is that they're trying to figure out how the government just get the money how do we do this or they will get the money [noise] kinda like prohibition\nMight take her to be honest with you know the government is crazy knocked him they crazy not\nTell yeah it's it's just a because you know if it's federal like federal it's legal but statewide like California Colorado certain states was legal but there that's the state's seeing if we did it we should really chaos our deficit is we just knew that legal general\nOr a citizen a few trillion dollars out a lot of where you know\nI I'm not understand that but literally talked about ... look at what Colorado did then as soon as one time the amount of trouble and Adolfo legalization of Kevin this was ridiculous they're given schools money like that right money left over\nThere actually letting someone because I think the tax dollars ended up being over well over a billion dollars really good for them yeah oh yeah so\nImagine that if the state wide uh we could really\nMhm which actually when I go to them as they can figure it out you know depending what there are people out there I\nWrite period period and sorry but I'm ... another thing is there a reason I Know I I got my own issue I got\nKnow I got punched for a living and all that much to me it's the one real medicine like all the pharmaceuticals stuff I've tried everything [noise] uh not not too good in that messes with your liver and all that this is one thing you can never overdose on there's no one in the history of the world that's over ...

want to buy\nRoger you're on Twitter and eight hundred and Seventy Seventy one one through five on the phone number seven seven five seven nine to five\nIf you are I mean everybody watching the red Sox ...\nIf you're a baseball fan and I mean that's the best series going in the playoffs and came up to ... off\nThat anybody kicking each other because they're not taking about not taking each other well in the uh\nDodged brewer series of course many Machado kicking butt or in this series came up just pissed off course she has a\nVested interest in the Astros a she's just in Berlin his wife and three beautiful model of course\nAnd last night there was a ball was hit right Josh to the top of the wall just in the stands where ... bucks for the red Sox jumped up to try to catch it and the the fans are reaching out to catch with themselves and their hands in his glove closed as ...\nThey made the wrong call Albany might have been able to catch you wasn't able to catch what they made the wrong ... the the well call us up to a degree she said hashtags bulls call yes you are not happy\nOf course is the deal the ball so by calling in and out what happened to the um the guy from the um ... yeah he was he had his glove data over the wall put his glove out trying to catch him and his glove went up against fans and the glove closed right\nAnd the glove close so the umpires by calling in and out or soon and that he was going to catch that ball now what they don't have to assume what is definite is that the ball was over the fence ... there's no assuming that the ball is over the fence there is an assumption that he's going to catch that ball\nYeah nobody touches that it's going to be a home run by a little bit but it's I definitely route\nIt's hitting the fan in the belly All right so you have to make an assumption to call in and out no ... for it to be a home run ball should have been home run\nYeah so and I can understand that that's an interesting argument because there's no assumption made on that one side or however\nThe rule talks about um if a fan interferes with a player\nIn a situation where um they have a possibility of making a play like he's in the midst of making a place so even though fans are there and even though fans are reaching over and that's all okay uh you cannot interfere with a player and so he was interfered with\nAnd so that makes it um it out\nRight but how is he interfere with if nobody leaned over the fence you know is that you well it's a pliable ball so what is so now all of a sudden the fans it's supposed to back away while it's just part of that I mean that's part of the fence income I didn't mean onto the part of the play it was over the wall right\nBut that's supposed to be his running\nBut they're touching a ball that's actually in play and so that interferes with the players ability to make the play and so that's why they call it ... his gloves over the correct he's allowed to run the fans are allowed to go right up there right but they're not allowed to interfere with ...\nBut they didn't the rules and whatever anyway rule three dot once his\nGlove hit the fans the fans didn't hit the go up\nA large arguable one of the world I'd argue one of the rules I saw no interference shall be allowed when a player reaches over a fence right that's what he did no interference shall be allowed land that are making Ronald arguing that you're ... you may go not interfere with a player reaches they have\nTo give the play room to make the play because\nOtherwise years would you get there are going to start putting up the wall and then there's going to be eight feet and then you're going to start setting and if they had to so that no fan can ever interfere with something that's possible for the person for a player to catch\nAnd they'll just see I Do and those in rows of seats that can make money right but I don't have the right\nRight so there's a there's a difference you know the easy one is the ball in his rolling down the right field line at a fat reaches over from their seats and almost tumbles out of the seats and picks the ball up before it bounces off while it gets to the field that's the easy one\nClearly the player it didn't get to play it and so they're they're gonna you know they have rules for that whether it's a double or whatever the deal is but in this case out of color so ... oh Houston is pissed because now the red Sox are up three one and they happened to win by two runs which is what the\nHome run would have been for all to see if it had been a lot so it's very controversial and ah jade opted not happy but\nAt the time I mean I saw it live and you know Joe ... is a veteran empire who's ... years of being a veteran and they all went but I don't even tell because Joe us has been around forever and he's awesome you never hear him\nHe's he's not like who's the guy but I couldn't name of ... spoiled boy that guy is sucked since I was with the Mets and you don't want that was the early to thousands\nThat was a long time ago and I don't know how he still has a job but the show us guys like he's these the crew chief 'cause he's he's the man okay and so him into the guys get a headset that they talked to a guy in New York at ... headquarters and they all look at it he was like listen you made the call the field that it uh it was a not a homerun\nGot nothing to overturn that and so they it's an out and that's all there you have senator nervous to overturn it nobody ever got you know evidence or\nMy my idea and my thought process is correct you know you have to make an assumption to call it or not you have to assume that that ball would have ended up in his glove right where he couldn't even see the ball he gets through his glove up\nThere oh no he thought he was do I want to want to have is oh but it's going to catch a glove is over the fence\nWants to go up as over the fence he can't see the gloves I Can't see\nAnd right now my bottom up against the wall right when it's not what the case is that you don't have to ... defense is looking at them and tell you you got to make the assumption that we can make the catch you don't have to ... over to\nProbably do not correct who doesn't love you it's right here and he's about to make that catch now let me say let's say you're correct and like your role goes into play now anytime somebody goes back to the wall and you were to visiting park the fans can freaking dive on your glove no and you will never get\nTo the fans didn't you could well with by the way the fans were going for the ball they didn't reach over the fence so on and trying to listen and prevent really want to do they could ... off the wrong and that's interference with stolen out that would have been awesome [laughter] it would be an out\nAnd that happened were or whatever [laughter] I haven't caught up to go gotta catch a ball and it was going over to present advances took his level [laughter] look ill [laughter] thank you [laughter] that would be working during the game for\n... David is on the line to what's up David\nHey guys are just a quick point first thing I Want to say is I Know they want and I love you guys you guys have been right down here\nThen go see the show is
