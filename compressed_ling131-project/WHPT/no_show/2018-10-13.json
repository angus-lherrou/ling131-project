a there's held a grand as you look I yeah oh I didn't expect that to be held the grant her okay I'm a sentence to be exact uh now we're going to\nTake it ah to Lakeland a little local story Mm\nI don't know if you heard about this one\nUh a woman was arrested on suspicion of killing her husband but what you told deputies was\nThat she slips and tripped while holding the kitchen I've been accidentally stabbed him to death well now that can happen yeah I mean Rachel huh [laughter]\nYeah a racial I don't even want to see her name or just going to call a racial ah she was arrested per second degree murder was a button to poke county jail earlier this week uh she actually stabbed her husband was forty year old Brian with the same last name I've taken to a ticket to the hospital a little bit later ... died um after the stabbing\nLet me just give you a visual oh go ahead if she fell on him with a knife listening is holding\nThe night [laughter]\nYou couldn't tonight\nWhat does this one's a story she sold the investigators a slice of pizza with her a ... when her dog started with ...\nWith a knife a slice of pizza with a knife how she is okay but she said she saw\nThe dog was covering the PCs ran outside to pick it up she said the dog was urinating deaf getting all over the ... all over the for her uh her husband walked into the air to help her out as you walk towards them as well and and then tripped on a rug and then I ended up stamina\nNah brass now historian and you don't have there been any other incident is is that the police showed up on that point do you put the night down before you start to getting poop it's\nNot a you know and it's gotten a pizza\nAll arrived at blood on the dance floor I didn't get that yeah but you know what I wasn't that no that wasn't post death the blood on the yeah the blood on the dance floor but that was a remake salad and it was the album know about it that was a new song on it though it was apple nobody wanted right right because what what was the new jam off that\nWasn't that wasn't that there was one song about blood on the dance floor was the gym or may maybe it's only it's only song I Know of of it right maybe you're right I thought there might have been another one but you could be ... I don't know man I I'm Still trying to figure it out I was in the records I worked in a blockbuster music when that album was released some\n... I remember you know putting it over the system quite a few times and gone man\nBut again I think it was largely because it was really mixes of a bigger hits other song yeah I didn't understand why they why they chose to go that route\nOr money he ... he may have had nothing to do with that I mean remember at you know so many if I'm not mistaken was the one that own him and the rights to his muse I think that when he was trying to fulfill its obligation to get out there right right right\nAnd that's when he passed away around that time well he passed away he he was about to\nHe was about to get the rights back to his music if something was getting ready to happen for Mike really big right after he passed away you don't remember that what was going to be\nSomething about the rights to some of his older music he was getting ready to get some of those rights back I after I have to figure this out because I think you'll find it prince was in the same similar situation before he passed away two okay that's the conspiracy\nOkay All right All right what you got to I was looking at or above blood on the dance floor the the trek listing and it's got a I Need to revisit that because it's got it's got to we've got two of my my two favorite songs by him ... yes stranger a mosque out when they saw\nIt hurts a hit song just bear that that's a or solve these desperate and when we put that on that has\nHas brought him you know we're in the clue that we put that I had put her down and I don't want anything from Michael in Colombia I only went well I don't\nWhat you're talking to her son

comes the queen or something like that or not they'll get to spend it on um I\nAm excited about our next guest a wheel or on the phone right now I I look over a week it's been almost two weeks since we had a buccaneer football game and we needed a break after the last one\nLike it was it was a perfect time to have a a really horrible blow up my back because it was like I now want to buy week we could just be just like there's this was the defining the last game or no no no the Steelers game now but the bears beat us or are they like spanked deaths right really bad really really really bad let's go to the phones right now from their blood ...\nA guy who's been writing um sports in the in the area and covering the bucks for a long long time a Greg ... is on the phone what's up Greg\nHow much are you guys doing good buddy how are you a good target target\nAwesome uh well the last time I talk to you Greg we were to know and\nIt looks like we're going to go on to feed and when the super bowl or at least to some people and then things fell apart really really fast\nUm do do you know what happened ah I Know the defense obviously is a big deal but um you're you're round one button place they can you did you get a sense that that was the collapse who's going to happen to games and row or no\nYeah I mean they they probably aren't as good as they were in the last time we talk and probably aren't as bad as what you thought last night out there so there's somewhere in between and obviously there's a lot of room between where they are and where they were um so I think they're often can still be as good as it was in the first two games\nAnd it just it it has to be good enough to make up for the defense they're playing right now the problem then that either when they were to know they'd give it up forty voice at the same mhm um I mean like pretty well but eventually against the eagles to get that when but\nThey haven't really looked like a great effect that much this year so that that's where things have stepped up um and the falcons for not a team that makes it easy for you to look good defense like the last time they went up there all your Joe's went for two hundred fifty three yards it sure does show so\nI'm just has to be one way or you know the office has to step up and get back to where it was and the divas probably has to at least creative turnovers like if they're going to get up yards they have to be a defense but at least can get a kick or to or do something to take seems out of the rhythm a little bit\nYeah there's a couple of storylines here that I'm interested in obviously for Sunday or where the bugs are really going to turn a corner for the good or for the worse I think the biggest story line that I Want to know and a lot of people are really questioning his\nIs James going to be ready this was really his first started and you know since December so it's like\nA you know he came out and he had some reps against Chicago and again that was already gone or how do you feel I mean 'cause you're around there and I am from what I've been reading I guess he looks great in practice I Know the preseason ended all good you think you'll be a hundred percent ready on Sunday\nI think so I mean if there was any benefit to the bears get going badly it did is that they basically got the second half as just free shake off the rough times per Davis which I'm an idiot it looks spectacular by any means but I think he kinda got to work through\nThe normal issues you have when you haven't played football or whatever it was five week\nOr so no I mean I think the nice thing is that it has a bad ... yeah the Lakers given up at least thirty seven points in each there last three gate\nSo that should give them confidence I mean that if three starters that are on I are they're gonna play without their best to tackle without their leading Russia for last year so there are still you know James has played well in Atlanta\nUm hasn't played that much in this new Mercedes that state of they have but I mean the only one place that he's won more than one road gave in the same place and its allies so they should have a fair amount of confidence if they if the rest of the options can play around with it the same way they did to the most part around the country I think they'll be able to ...\nYeah and it landed too that the one of the worst teams against the run also mean their defense may be worse than\n... I mean statistically that probably very close but I watched that game last week\nAnd they it was it was almost a mirror image of what I saw or what the bucks against the parents just people confused outta position are lacking energy or speed it was a it was it was pretty gross to see an NFL team a go from or what used to be a really strong defense of town to just\nA absolutely nothing but you're like you said they're missing for really good pro bowl caliber starters um I my question is is this the week\nThat the bugs running game finally emerges because it's hard to from what I what what I'm paying attention to also I mean I probably know a little more about football than than I than I than other people on a on TALK radio has not sports my\nWe've faced a really good rushing defense is the first four weeks of the season so it's kinda hard to gauge if are running game just socks are we just played really good defenses I think again to Lana will will will have a pretty good idea how good painting barbarism in in in ... Jones I mean you agree\nYeah I mean the one thing we we know for sure is that we don't have enough talent in the back or in the deep in the backfield to sit back and let a guy like that pick your parts so that was my whole attitude was you know and\nAnd and this was you know I coached youth football for a long time which obviously isn't even close to the same thing but I remember losing by three touchdowns I'm going on and we're blitz in every play why not at this point we have to cause a turn and we have to do something to switch this up because if not met Ryan's who's going to you're going to have a field day with us and we can't have that\nYeah they'll do and and I think they'll find ways to mix it with every down yeah if you will it's twenty twenty five percent in the NFL as I Am out on that and you can't do in the same situation as you got to keep guys from getting comfortable back their range ... so\nYou can do that and it's all you do is make him sometimes if the blitz doesn't get the quarterback but makes and lose his point of worries releasing from ... get out of the pocket met Ryan is not necessarily a mobile guy mhm so at least you're getting him out of his comfort zone and I think they know that I mean they they've you know there could have got his first win\nOr the head coach in Atlanta regime was when I got to win as a rookie in Atlanta they're gone and done this before when it limits been a good team is the Atlanta when they were a Super Bowl the right so you can certainly do it now when they're wanted for and they're given up thirty ...\nOr one more question Greg and and to me this is the key to every victory it's how the team practice if the if they have a great week to practice they seem to win and that's every team if they have a a a lethargic week they seem to lose you've been around one bug place give us the vibe\nYeah you know we don't get the feel of practice as we see the beginning half an hour read today we see him walk off at breakfast field they were pretty light coming up the practice bill today that the bees or\nStaying late and and like working on their ... at the back of the end zone with rows and stuff like that so I I kinda liked it they were kind of low key it it looked like a team that was\nToo high stronger you putting pressure on themselves some yeah there are a lot of this will be on the on the defense is I mean I think we know this off as you go to the score getting the twenties enough that thirty the question is can this decently stop right and I think that that's where the game will be won or lost on Sunday\nOr ... to ... if you're just tuning in ... on Twitter of course he writes for the athletic you could find him or the ... dot com forward slash bugs launch if you want to subscribe and it's a ... bucks for your articles right\nYeah ... or ... really really appreciate your time buddy and uh hopefully the bugs will make everybody happy and a next time we talk to you it'll be a it'll be a jolly good time\nOr they have a good weekend\n... many tired Hank ... from the athletic guy the guy's a legend in the area so you had some good questions on them and then yeah I'm really uh I was shocked by how good you were I was just I\nWould I wanted him to elaborate more on the whole on how you see that yeah no no no there's a a beat the home there's ways to beat the whole there's really good ways to do it\nHey and we come back guys we're going to follow up on a Kanye West\nRemember all the news yesterday he was in the oval office yeah uh you know nothing came out when he moved his lives just a bunch of ... and everybody thought they forgot about Kanye\nA well who who is a lot of stuff to say some famous people have chimed in on Kanye West now and it says on the ... when we come back we're you know with the black snake [noise]\nReduce blown all week for updates on hurricane Michael\nSeventy percent off that's right\nI court furniture than than Seventy percent off new retail prices and she was from a wide variety of previously leads furniture and they are for your home or off cell phone from one Ninety nine Ninety nine\nVeterans that from three Ninety nine Ninety nine dining from two Ninety nine Ninety nine and more items are certified guaranteed inside favor delivery orange and take home today made the smart choice in this one of our five locations in the ...

would button up those two buttons and be\nPossibly after maybe they've popped up I don't know the story man I don't know but if you've tried recently to not look at something that was obscene Lee disgusting call in Seventy seven five seven nine to five people who who pulled the will and ask Kais why you got hair on your face yeah\nThere's a there's a girl that I think that you know as well that ah I got ... I don't want to see up close and personal with well I was having a conversation with and I was messed up\nOK mhm I had a lot of drinks that day and it was really really hard to keep contact because this woman had a pool and I know we're yeah I'm I'll just leave it there okay and you told me and make it very cryptic\nSo I don't want to get anybody in trouble I don't want to give him on Twitter no one that works here when we're definitely in the sphere of roommate Rachel no definitely not re Phil do will be happy [laughter] All right um I Do\nWant to talk about something here that I found on New York post says that millennials are consciously choosing\nTo remain single and I've seen is actually the divorce rates have actually dropped and that's because people are getting married later or they're just not getting married at all since you're millennials are ditching relationships embracing\nSingled him according to his sister so wild according to a new survey a tender and consulting firm or who cares a survey to thousands singles between Eighteen and twenty five\nAnd found that Seventy two percent quote have made a conscious decision to say single solo status gives young adults and sense of adventure independence and empowerment an an overwhelming majority of young adults agree that being single benefits them beyond their romantic\nLives now the group that they surveyed they are pretty young Eighteen to twenty five I feel like Eighteen to twenty five I'm super I find being single I Would have been finding a relationship is well\nI had my first relationship when I was twenty seven so I was quite old ah for first relationship but right now dating seems tedious to me it seems like a lot of work and I would be happy to be in a relationship so I feel like if they surveyed say thirty to thirty five year olds I feel like the the tone would change\nOh no doubt about it one hundred percent listen when you're Eighteen\nIt feels like you're going to live forever mhm and then when you hit that three zero rolls around\nI Know we're young I I get it and older folks out there listening to God geez you uncover world when I was I Know I Know but you got to understand that we're at about age now and I'm sure you felt the same sure thirty to us on the world but I definitely feel the pressure\nI feel like I looked at a a Doug stand hope uh-huh um special right I got released I was about two thousand fixing it was nice housing twelve\nWhich is a long time ago six years ago I'm like where did all the time go yeah time is speeding up now and I feel like I'm going to die alone is what I feel like at this point I Know\nMe all my qualifications all my requirements but I feel like I could optimize I could do better I could meet someone at one swipe away who knows\nYeah well I mean there's always the risk of that with all the apps that are out there that on the Web sites all that crap yeah for sure\nYou don't stay well who is this\nA ah yeah I mean those are some of the jobs are going ah was on the United states don't marry young I was married at twenty or Twenty one and she actually left me with my ... month old daughter and the Irish and your\nWife how jeez so you got married and pregnant pretty much right away and she has the bay area and then just decides you know this isn't for me\nYeah so how did you guys get married so young if I can ask very were you did you come from a religious background that's always what I assume\nA nose or military family no she actually was the first and oh okay the right thing or the right thing off the air\nAnd why is that the right thing to do I hear people say that a lot like OK guy you're pregnant now have to get married\nI feel like you can co parent and sometimes it's a better situation when you're when you're not married\nDon't try to force a relationship but I but I understand the thinking\nRight yeah and I think it was a little pressure\nOn the family colors yellow just so there was that I was double major in college at the time I was a Marshall University in West Virginia and in the street in biology major and\nI actually dropped out of college I went to work uh for her adoptive father on oil wrote us one so the and the day or day after he was married to a town and that was a show to cheat on me and\nShe was lying and cheating on you\nYeah yeah it looks as though I'm always looking\nAs West Virginia true for you yeah [noise] so what\nDo you know that this uh now she was pregnant do you know for a fact that it was yours\nYeah actually I moved here to Florida a lot of ideas or my daughter in English\nAnd bond or actually ah get us in all ... an adult or another but over here and\nA daughter as long haired blue out so to say so I went and got above the other\n... okay good nice like how you checked up on that um and so you have no idea where the whereabouts of your ex wife are\nAll the way that you conduct um [laughter]\nDid you get a divorce I mean are there resigned\nOr when everyone's on maybe like once or twice a year in the state minimum fifty dollars wow so every once in a low so they're actually get a job and they take it out of her taxes\nThat's insane well thank you for sharing your tail with us my friend\nYou very much or haven't been to one\nAll right Seventy seven five seven nine went on to five or eight hundred seven seven one one oh two five I Want to hear if you've ever been pressured into getting married I feel like a lot of people have either from family you get the girl pregnant or something like that or maybe like you kind of will say you know you've been together for a while and the family is like what's going on man\nI Want to ring on that finger um I also want to hear from people who were given an ultimatum\nOh yeah\n'cause I feel like ultimatums I I hate them but I Know that they are necessary\nReally yes I I feel like nothing good can happen from an ultimatum when you're forcing somebody to choose that's just not yeah back in the end it\nRight and I was initially thinking that way but think about it if he if you're a woman who wants to be married and have a baby and you say we've been together for five years you either marry me or this is over and the guy either does she wants or he leaves and she can go find somebody else to do that with yeah\nBut then they're either there's to either they would have done it already more they'll do it and then resent you pour it later ... that that's\nWhat's so you're saying you shouldn't ask you should just leave but that's not what you want\nIf it's if it's been four years sorry lady that called earlier and you're not married yet and you're twenty seven ... what are you doing you're wasting your time\nWell the thing is is again you're you're coming from a place where you're saying she that's what she wants but if she doesn't necessarily want that she\nSaid if he proposed that she would say yes as what you saw it on the phone call\nOkay but I feel like she could have gone either way she's happy to kind of stay where things are she's happy to\nDo it for it I don't know or maybe she's in the ... I'm not quite sure I'm not quite sure\nUm I feel like I'm very I don't want to say very anti marriage the more and more I think about it the more I think it's it's less romantic if that makes sense like I think the proposal is very romantic in my ideal world I Would have a wedding\nAnd no marriage that we're a wedding and so you just want the party you want the reception yeah just whenever the reception winning an so right now I don't understand the getting the government involved that's always bothered me is getting the government involved in your love life Doug Stanhope had a a great bit about that saying\nYeah we got a good thing going here let's get the government involved with signed that piece of paper and make sure we're blinded legally at this point I mean that that doesn't make sense to me but\nIt makes you not be able to just take off and leave you know if you have kids or something where you can just like pick up and take off your your legally buying did so I have mixed emotions about marriage\nI the more I think about it the more I don't like it and the more I think that when you think that you're going to know who you are going to be in ten Fifteen Twenty years and you you know how your partner's going to grow in that same direction I think is\nIs arrogant and also kind of ignorant I think it's to assume that sort of thing that you will just love each other forever you don't know what kind of obstacles you're going to face and oftentimes obstacles can bring people together but it it can also tear them apart sure if something happens you have a a troubled kid or something like that\nAnd one parent takes the a tough love approach and the other one isn't an enabler you're going to have you not going to have a United front I've seen it happen ... plenty of times\nAnd people end up splitting up because they can't deal with the same sort of obstacles that life throws at them so I think it's I just I never think it's a good idea to get married now unless\nI I suppose one of the exceptions would be if it's like a citizenship thing you know that happened with my friend the the girl that I went to South Africa to see her wedding in order for her to be a German citizen she kind of how to get married and for them to live in the same country yadda yadda yadda I get it there but otherwise if you're just you and your two independent people\nYou have your own jobs in your own lives I don't see why you have to get the government involved or why your family would want to pressure you to get to the government involved and in my perfect world I Would want to have a partner that I live\nLike I'm married but we're not married so that there's you don't feel like you can just All right you're stuck to me now you know or I'm stuck to you now it's like I still want to always feel like I Want to impress you I Want to show you why you want to be with me and I want you to\nShow me why should still be with you and you try because you you're not bound to each other each person can bail anytime that they want you know\nYes like me now when I think about that in my more mature mind I find that to be more romantic where you keep trying for each other and just keep trying to impress each other than just saying okay we're married now I'm just gonna get fat and watch TV\nI I get you on that totally makes sense to me but I also dig\nIndia of not being able to just pick up and leave especially if there are kids involved\nI mean you still you would have to pay child support at yeah but you know what I mean ... you're still bound to the kid I Know\nI I get yeah I mean I I'm a product of divorce All right and how it works and it was weird getting dropped off by my dad on Sunday afternoon when he had me for a few days and they gave me my fifty nine dollar check and they give this to your mom and then I wouldn't see him for for a week yeah it's not the same of of having two parents and\nOf course not but then you also don't want to live in a house where there's constant fighting or people hate each other and stuff like that so yeah uh\nI guess it's a delicate balance okay you guys are really really really have to take a break and on the other end of this break the u._k. is cracking down on drugs and by drugs I mean pizza and burgers find out more after the break you were listening to it\n[laughter]\n[noise]\nWhat do\nWe\nWant to do voice\nHuge savings on new and previously least furnishing that writes huge savings court furniture clearance either choose from a wide variety of new and previously leads furniture and the corps for your home and all that you'll find so friends from one Ninety nine Ninety nine and more everything in our nine thousand square foot she'll run its course certify guaranteed and in stocks\nReady for delivery or to take home today that are handling court furniture center at one three nine for six ...

Bush okay W Bush and when you know training and uh they were they were both uh George W. Bush was a member of scarring bones like his father\nAnd then uh in the Matt Damon movie they were getting the he was given this going on to a different era and they do a lot of weird\nShirtless ... ... ... I I can honestly say\nNone of that happened in my fraternity there was no male sexual McMillan male sexual stuff\nThat happened I don't just mean like gay stuff I mean like there was like nobody wanted us to be short list for anything more than embarrassing us in front of girls\nBut like when we're alone and we're just a fraternity never nobody's ever touching my nuts when nobody wanted to spank me or anything I just I I hear about that ... the ... the wrong fraternity yeah yeah like you you you're joining us attorney for different reasons\nYeah when I was there in the nineties we didn't have anything like that it was it was a I mean it it was more\n[noise] it was different type of funding the sense that nobody was um y'all doing anything sexually inappropriate because all my brothers were men enough to stand up and say I'm Jackie in effect yeah yeah yeah uh you know but and there was nobody urinate on ... yeah well a punch in effect guy no battery\nJack in the face of the guys who well you said in right well you got understand the nineties like no I'm just saying I I'm not saying that you did not the jak word is ... ... yeah now you're you are talking to an attorney that has a Jack o lantern painted on his black but I Know that All right so are you you understand the ... I was just\nCurious about that because I don't know how other fraternities and then when I hear these stories about hazing incident we drank and all that but we looked out for each other and then when you hear the ... the assault of them is but with the Wiffle ball but I'm like what are they doing them it's fraternity and right\nAnd who wants to be in a group so bad that do go along with that who doesn't go I'm Out yeah that's now that's not the generations\nYou got older they started doing crazier and crazier things that they can gain creative um you know that I mean you know the there was a a chapter on our our campus not my chapter different fraternity that got in trouble because there there was I Believe that urinate on pledges\nShut down yeah that was that was one of the thing it's like I Would never the thing in in a in that\nMovie with Matt Damon there were a urinating on him from a second live on these ... I'm Out of this thing no he was like our will handle you know but who gets who takes pride them anyway let's move on let's take your phone calls so I Will tell you the eight hundred numbers are wide open eight hundred seven seven one one or two five let's go to Jason ... Jason\nHey what's happening\nGuys good to talk to John I had a quick question for you whether it was last Monday\nWhen and when my brother all night ... a lot of fun drinking all night long whatever bottom line question is I I Want you know finding a lawyer up or not the next day after I dropped my brother up at home was coming back I live over in Sarasota um I was under the er you know whatever\nI ended up passing out in the car in the middle of the road and I was stopped at a stop light and then I was awake and by five cops in\nAge you know am keys check me out blah blah blah and ended up I gotta do you what do you tell me that lawyer up but I don't know if it's war\nThey were like oh I did because I knew when I went to the station\nWell regardless of what the evidence is Iowa\nRecommend in this type of scenario that you definitely have a lawyer to navigate you through the process regardless of whether or not you did the roadside exercises whether you made admissions whether you are asleep behind the wheel or exercising or demeaning and control the vehicle whether or not you blew\nThe level of the breath is going to come into play and then I can negotiate sometimes based on other facts even with high or low blows with the state attorney to negotiate maybe reduced charge or maybe reduced sanctions because there are certain sanctions\nThat are under the statute guidelines for three sixteen point one nine three which is the a DUI statute in the state of Florida if it is going to be ... to go to the statue just below which is three sixteen point one night too which is your reckless driving charge but again if you've got a high blow you know it'd be very difficult quite\nWas a it was a very high below just ... it was way too high and then I my first time first offense very stupid dumb um but you know I I don't know if it's worth it to me a bunch of money to a lawyer [noise] um\nYou know what I mean I I I'm scared I\nI think you're focusing on the wrong thing you know it may not be a bunch of money depending on the lawyer hired that's number one and number two it might be worth it in the long run if this has handled properly because this is something that may affect your life and your record\nFor the rest of your life and so I I wouldn't minimize it in the sense that if you got to pay some money to lawyer\nAlso you don't ... among the lawyers still end up paying a ton of money in ...\nI Am yeah I Know I Know I'm scared for a little wiser\nAbout what I Would recommend is if you want to talk to me off a are what little more specifics that you may not want to say on live radio or you know go out and you know reach out to the office and they'll be more than happy to chat with the endless afternoon I've got three DUI hearing this afternoon a but I'll be in the office this morning and then after I get back from court so I'm available today to chat with you if you like\nOkay thank you I appreciate it\nYour ... and a lot of people are like that they say well you know I don't know if I Want to spend the money if I'm going to go down with the ship I said well you might not necessarily go down with the ship as hard as you would if you didn't have a lawyer\nOh yeah yeah like you are like ... and this is what's gonna happen you don't know that that's going to happen but somebody\nThat has been through it knows the whole situation to deal with it and you might be might be a better way better than any things have forgot the fines on them or their the scriptures err on the ticket or something like well there's a variety of things that can happen to ride my ah let's go to Steve Steve good morning your own ask them what are you guys to have\n[noise] hey thank you for your call I'm going to my daughter is going to school up in Boston strictly a living with\nFive other roommates is you know up there it's very expensive and one of her roommate actually a suicidal very disruptive and the house I'm just wondering if they're going to be legal ways for us to deal with that situation where you're able to get a release or\nHow do you really don't fear the pursuit\nOf your speakers have a better environment\nLeave weapons out well the are the issues though you she's in Massachusetts so I don't know Massachusetts law is four well we have in Florida such as Baker and march max\nSo she'd have to look into that with a lawyer up there if you believe that somebody is is suicidal or if they're a harm to themselves or to others there are different things that\nAre can be done there's also a restraining orders are injunction is again I don't know what they refer to him that jurisdiction if she feels\nOr that or she has been threatened or if there's any any imminent harm\nThe question of whether or not you can get out of release is something that's up to the folks that she signed a lease with so she's got to talk to\nOr the management there at the complex I explained the situation and then perhaps you know given that circumstance you know maybe they can come to an agreement first last month or maybe some type of buyout are only that information being relayed by uh the management of the company is she has a lease with or\nHer contract itself to lease agreement you got to return that\nAre both hard earned for sure\nThat you're you're very welcome your three options there for him for his daughter sure man uh you know not being offensive but he has to look out for a dollar a safety first [noise] well that's right I mean if\nIf she was threatened then she can get an injunction innovators injunction then that person can't be around them and they might be displaced from that residents for a short period of time until there's a hearing to determine whether or not they're going to be a formal enjoy and then if you have an injunction against somebody I I think that's obviously something you can break at least with you know a lot of sorts of Ralph Ralph how are you sir\nSo use the gentleman that you don't get\nThe ... if the if the dealership is pushing back and saying go pounds than say our hang on I'll come back to you guys in a minute go make a claim against the other insurance for the call the personal insurance of the vehicle\nAnd if they pay everything there's not going to be the doctor will for you and then the cars repaired and you go on your merry way if there was a problem and you call my office and you say it's time to lawyer up we're going to go after every body and it's go time\nI guess if\nYou go appreciate guys All right ... thank you yeah you shouldn't be paying for some of the fact in your car unless they didn't have insurance right Ryan corner and then you can\nGo after them for the doctor bull but then that's a whole separate process you know and then a lot of the people get upset because well you know that's the type of insurance they purchased or New York is a little lower per month because you pay a duck but what I have full coverage yeah yes galvanized or are you doing [laughter]\nAll right ... thanks very yellow as Saddam if he didn't get through today tomorrow night he'll be here on the station and you can always get
