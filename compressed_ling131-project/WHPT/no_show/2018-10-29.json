one of my favorite people in the building the very beautiful and talented Carmen from Mike out this show hello Carmen\nHow you doing good a\nNose you who are listening last week may remember the Carmen joined us from me and asked them more MSA PA\nI literally just did recaps of these and\nR. A. easy for you to say yeah\nShe was out in Bradenton and she said I said why did you come back here and make out with me she said absolutely a but it took her a little bit of time to get here uh so our effort was warranted\nWell Denis was driving extremely slow had no interest in getting\nA little bit of a drive and plus it's really going to be down there this Friday as well be calling and talking\nTo you can't wait to in one week well that is a that was exciting double Carmen up but a dentist and bill on TV a lot of people know uh we don't want to say\nThat he is crushing uncommon but I think it's safe to say that he's romantically interested in you\nKnow I I wouldn't say romantically I Would say heart throbbing [laughter]\nThat's a word that was a word or you just put up carbon future ditch up on me runs on TV I'm not sure I'm\nSo Dennis was the opposite goal or to call them in an odd swapping spit last week because he still has it for you [noise] um we told Dennis that we would plug his podcast\nIf he would give the green light to comment I blocking lips multiple plugs I mean countless blood ... at least want an hour why does he have to approve this is a great question still rather Kevin\nOkay so this is my thing because me and Dennis our friends ... and he has um openly admitted his feelings for me at one point in time yeah I was so but we do we still hang out and we leave it as friendship but that you have them but they don't drag 'em alone but there will always be that underlying measure\nYou know emotional ties between that so I just feel like I ... back in ... for our friendships\nEmerge each other you want to keep the false hope going I just want him to know that I respect in that much that I won't make out with people in front of him and I see All right you know they're going to make him watch on the bottom TV and now that I wouldn't like I Need his approval unless he tells me like ... a pet at this point\nI got you and and I I did this and I did admit last week that uh my my fondness an infatuation for you goes in waves based on the cruise behave like was leading up to the cruise I'm very into you and I think man I I'm Carmen so hot\nAnd then we'd go on the cruise and I see cruise carbon immediately that and you go into this category and it's like but then as it further removed from the cruise I forget about what you were like on the cruise mine right by five bucks now you're getting back to appealing to me now here is a very angry Dennis in the studio with us ... did you have\nDentist we uh we offered to plug your as of yet unnamed broadcast on our show here\nOr if you would greenlight a comment and I ... I mean just think of the numbers for bones you below what's the nature of the plug 'em I Would say we give them a we give their website here's what we'll\nDo on the go with him back and say okay we'll give you I'll give you an honor plug\nEvery hour for the rest of the show today so you've got three o'clock plug four o'clock five o'clock and only when they just want to point out okay and we will do social media we will promote your individual social media accounts and we'll promote your ... your ... everything just happened\nAnd how many hours do you have stuff I have all like Seventeen thousand Jews guy to like sixty\nDollars ... nine thousand\nI don't know I think I'm like maybe like a hundred away from like forty and you know if you ever just tweet at ...\nAm cause you bay area's great wow it's kind of deceiving the yeah not leaving on at all um so yeah social media plugs radio plugs and think of the number of people watching on TV does making you look good for producing such a spectacle ongoing TV our numbers today are ... they're just there a data we get a crush\nRemember exactly but it was it was a very dark time for both of us [laughter] I I mean that's the one that I don't know if they'd even opening you had yours is\nOh good at keeping that stuff off the air\nNo it was we hammering out quickly was it I thought you didn't you didn't say thank\nYou yeah okay I didn't I didn't want to accuse you of something that wasn't true yes I did not think him properly for something and he um\nI was I think it would be for many when John first started on the show and I think I was able to finagle him in a crowded table filling in for\nA while I remember that yeah well that's a long time ago yeah\nThat was cut off the table John and I just remember he like came at me a little bit and I came back at him and he just goes you're such a deck and I'd like him and just like scorned off and it hurt it does I Know yeah we ever did out there oh yeah that's how we do yeah I mean it all those things along the way of made us all very much\nGoes yeah you can do one of two things you can suppress that an act like it didn't happen or you get it out there and yell at each other and then everything's fine go north or nosy and I've done that\nThroughout your life what am I things if anybody ever said hey what where I Am not afraid to have a hard conversation I I'm not afraid of somebody telling me how off buying if as long as I can say the same thing that you and I love when you can just figure it out at the end you feel so much better so I always loved getting that stuff off my chest\nYou know what's interesting is I just realized this now I have ... thanks for changing the way I can communicate with people because before I Would have just like if I got mad at says about something I just do on it and they would do it would stay in my brain but not like in the front of my brain so the whole time you know something about this and\nThen the first time that he made me cry a I was I was driving back to Orlando and he called me I didn't even want to talk I was just like\nScrew this going to work and\nHe kept calling and he's like well do we have to talk about this we're going to work together and they got in the fight at the airport yeah oh that was the airport the second time they were quite a while yeah and so we talked about it and work through it and that's the only way you really start having those real conversation that's the thing is great is to pay the pain is so\nHard you know but the but the feeling that you have one you can work\nThrough oh it's it's almost worth it at that point is worth it yeah the first times that made me cry [laughter] I mean the conversation in a big mess getting\nYour wrapping up kind of cooking is a lot of Seventy five days a lot of studio right now they all want there a moment of that era there was a good cry they're they're also cathartic\nWell I mean it's still let me talk when we got in the fight when we got in the fight on the air about the hula hoop and the hundred dollar yeah it was big and then you're you're harboring resentment because you are paying for the pot cats and I didn't know oh yeah I'm sure knows right and you never told me so there were mad at me that I wanted a hundred dollars but in your head you go well I'm already paying for this yeah told me along the way\nHey I've got this pet pocketing let's figure out how to do this it would have never been a massive fight on the air\nProbably still would have been mass decided on the air but I Would have been holding up with all the stuff that you're you're absolutely a hundred percent right and it isn't it interesting that we work in one of the only jobs where you have to do this we we literally don't have the option of not talking about it because every day we have to talk for four hours other people in their jobs like\nI'm not getting along with Bob and counting up him going to do my job but we're like well mad at that guy and I got to act like I like him for four hours now\nAre you kind of alluded to this but through thick and thin through ups and downs and there's been bad days not that long ago a that we've all gotten through I don't think I think we overcome that and when this red light is on were all best friends whether or not it's whether or not it's true or not\nMaybe not best friends who really really good friend John I saw the ... were very good acquaintances [laughter] he'll rub it really really good workarounds so uh yeah I don't come on\nSeventy seven five seven nine to five and eight hundred seven seven one one or two five again that's how you get in touch with us we have a big show plan today were you able to find my uh my oh yeah I said to you oh you did okay yeah I Would have even though there's some reason the easiest thing ever found have you ever seen\nAn athletic performance like you saw from LeBron James last night in game one of the NBA Finals I'm not looking to do twenty minutes all abroad again which was actually forty minutes on the Bronx I Am looking to just simply marvel\nAt what an amazing athletic performance we saw from him fifty one point eight rebounds eight assessed and should have stolen game one at oracle from the Golden State warriors instead we bore witness\nTo the most singular most bone headed athletic play I've ever seen in my forties some odd years of watching sports I've I've seen some bone headed place I've seen some people do some dumb things\nI've never seen the level of thick headed stupidity the lack of self awareness as we saw from that no good scum bucket sub\nJR Smith last night he's he's disgusting he's do worse because he has the opportunity to be one of the elite an NBA athletes and instead he's a bone headed more on an absolute moron\nWhat happened because I fell asleep at half time I I don't even know how you made it through the whole game\nI made it through the whole game because of the adrenalin that was coursing through my veins from LeBron pulling up from thirty feet Sacramento pretty much and training uh Freeport\nThe cabs well not the cast LeBron and describes played and amazing game that he has no teammates he's got nobody he's got garbage around him absolute garbage so at the end of the game right first arrests cruel\nAbroad out of a charging call that was a charging call I don't know if you saw\nThat I saw I saw I settled pretty much the last quarter\nThey overturned it on a replay and it was a horrible call you hate to blame the rap but whatever so a\nCab to go to the free throw line down one right towards ... former San Antonio spurs swish is the first one tie game hundred and seven two hundred and seven if my memory serves grass wants to have a photographic memory sometimes one of seven ... seven George ... takes a second free throw cranked up the back of the ... but at\nThis point there is what roughly fourteen seconds\nSay like ten sec yeah ... ... s off for Illinois when he saw okay the incline run all around for a little bit so the the ball ...\nAll sense of rebound JR Smith for the cats gets the ball chance to win the game at the bus or if he shoots himself that if he shoots although if he should do something with the word okay so if he takes a shot himself passes it all up Ron calls a time out the cats have the opportunity with the ball in their hands to win the game would they have probably but\nOh I appreciate that yeah I just I realize that there's a obviously what kind of a cynical person negative more times I'd like to be and I realized that if I get some of the negative stuff out and I said all the ... I had it all allow me to to think in a way that I I've never thought before and so I'm looking forward\nTo whatever pops in my head and neck none of different kinds of other person as long as I never got to medicate and then I never want to see people so is that affecting your sex life\nI mean the these very sick right now so that that is in fact she says she goes another week where she can't take care of me being on a pinch hitter\nLook so positive did you're focusing on the things that are good yeah I Want not having sex with my wife is not good at all it she's going to get better in a week that has that are going to help the ... right now not\nThen I get a pinch hitter at the problem so hey ladies shit or what kind of sick is she okay wait\nHold on just how worried about that pension or what kind of pinch hitter while you were you looking to fill the restaurant\nNot looking at you and you know it's got to be up to her what she said hey if we go into the week and she can't help me out that we can start looking at other options as she got arthritis or something that you can't help you out even a little bit she's just she's not feeling very sexy right now at the a virus that she\nHas her hand ever have to feel sexy no no no it's not like your hand is this your hand it has no feeling so you know you just hold it\nThey're just massive listen I Know stomach problems you meet your cheating on me I mean for I Know I Know you're not in the ... because you don't feel that you know you know what it is not a\nBig D I I don't know what's happening\nOh yeah I can see that he comes over and they are out in the garage they probably play ping pong for hours on end and get all sweaty and they're right over the ping pong table probably\nAnd here's the one job where we are always accountable like for our yeah like I always I always thought about that I'm like man any any girl or any wife that I've ever does whatever they know that for four hours I could do whatever the hell they want to do because here I Am that is\nTrue like not like other jobs like they might come up for lunch they might and they go out I um oh it's actually set he is not leaving at all like for anything I'm going to surprise at right now I\n\nJumped out of these interlocking ...\n... s gone too far not trying to test the new me should in fact I Am wondering if you turn your back to the ...

like oh I Know how to get what little brother all pushes buttons what's for dinner here's the deal about what\nShe owes me\nA few thousand dollars to go from [laughter]\nFrom the stuff on my mother oh from burying my mother\nAnd you think that's why right there you have that in the back of your head in anything she's going to do right now it's going to be\nNo I don't even I wouldn't even thought about it and she keeps saying I get it to you all get a deal as it can when you have it you get it to me it's not a big deal\nBut like instead of saying I'll pick up dinner and I take it off the top or what I Wonder are like that on that would be the case for ... I just leave money on the gun all day Joe some for me\nThat just she's just too much ... ... ... ... is she going to wait till she got a three thousand dollars for your back or she can pay back like five hundred at a time or something\nBut I don't know I haven't even I really had to rush around it I really haven't been Russia Iran you know 'cause\n'cause he doesn't have a long time or to go three thousand don't write a lot of money you know there's some stuff coming up she says so whatever heartless and I don't\nJust coming into some do I mean oh yeah so she's real sleep over tonight that's a big give ... a ...\nYeah but it also the gas cuts her commute to work and a half a you know it takes an hour to get to work now it'll take twenty five minutes party gets work ah\nActually now that she ...\nThe right thing you do in any given time no sorry to interrupt\nYou while you're going to you and you do and you had to think of Russia given you know we\nWe didn't have we have the same ... well yeah um my sister and I are very very opposite people I Know you might not believe this but I tend to put everybody else before myself\nIn ... in my life friends family whatever it is I tend to put everybody before myself Russian bell and you need them right\nNow we're not even about my children that I give you a little church you know not even anything like that with just wired very this is my sister is very different she's very selfish\nYep I'm well established by the way over the years even from my point of view just watching it happen I'm not quite as well as to you know I'm not selfish about\nWhere and doesn't care if she doesn't share of your skin or does she just not even real life and she just being so she and\nIt's not about whether she'll never cared about getting under my skin and I wouldn't care about getting on the hers either to brother and sister relationship you know\nBut uh she just is who she is I mean\nIf she knew that she was pushing buttons are are kind of getting on your skin and ... and she didn't even want to ... you know she can pull back like there are things I don't say to my brother 'cause I Know irritate him you know what I mean it I don't care if it's by the sister I I don't live irritate them\nThis is not her well his but this is not hurt pushing buttons this is just hurting her [laughter]\nSo horrible that cat for who she is and yeah you can't be surprised by her selfishness or her\nNo but it bothers me laugh oh I'm not a problem and I watch a lot of lives and make me laugh every time I just trucks on my wife she just doesn't stop there is no which is very ... very very different people\nYou know and it's just you know you don't ... there's there's no matter\nNo idea ... my mother we have a mother in common we have different fathers I Do my mother was married had my sister got divorced my father and then they had me there's twelve years difference between me and my sister\n... trust young father was an older is already chose her father was an amateur basketball referee so [laughter]\nNo I didn't I was just ... who were in a weird coincidence with Monica in editing as possible\n[laughter] [noise] [laughter]\nI think that anything is possible but no so well how long it's all\nIt's all good we get along with what I Believe it or not I thought when my mother passed I was very nervous but because\nShe looked up you're never sure what some of it's not that she stepped up she just let me handle those things because I was going to have to lay out a lot of money and stuff she just let me handle things the way I thought they needed to get a handle on\n'em and then you know she's we fought we're one big fight the entire time while she was still alive we're one big fight was about moving her health if you're not here and you're not seeing what I'm saying I'm taking care of it is I don't really give a rat's as what you say right that was when I talked to put his hand on me\nRemember those are the ... that went down to the nursing home\nPut his hand on music let me explain something to do I totally forgot about and I almost wrecked him right there in the\n[laughter] I was robbed him right right then and there ... as I Walk in a very very patronizing as I Walk and I see my mother is struggling to breathe in the hallway and in in in a nursing home issues along in in the first place and then he's going to put his hands on me and told me let me explain how this works good of you of your mind\n[laughter] I mean one phone call Derrick might that might offend them like you got to get my mother out here and we're all done\nDone mhm yeah brothers and sisters ah\nI Would think probably Monica and brought will agree with me as well they couldn't be you could grow up in the same house same parents\nAnd be just ... miles apart me and my oldest is six gives me and my oldest sister are similar after that every one of us are so different you know we're the same exact parents same exact upbringing seems schooling say remember they\nTotally different people I Know you and your sister being that different even ... even though I have one parent difference Roger and I got to give them it's going to be that\nRoger and I went to Los Angeles to cover the Grammys before I was before it was even Roger in J. P. he was the afternoon dude I was the you know the promotion guy and I started doing some on our stuff with the morning show a little bit just like man in the streets of crap\nAnd ah they sent the sauce Angeles and for whatever reason Rogers hippie brother\nUm who's now like picking coffee beans or whatever was national but ... was in ... ... is that what it was already I go to a man and he's right Dr Roger like Peter we had to warming is like I'm telling you know he's going to smell [laughter]\nCompounded out gonna stink and he's going to be dirty hands but he's my brother is the author\nWhich our ah yeah ... I don't want to buy it at all it was\nLike he ... he didn't just told me what we're so different like any time the subject 'cause like All right what do we mean your brother is your brother come into the whatever was like any time became obvious let's just remember [laughter] him and I thought the same person [laughter] I I Can't even really\nWill be some stuff in common like the metal thing we have in common that kind of how to deal but\nHe is a totally different and that would be one or two is your brother mark is in the middle and he's ... he was the one that more ... like the party a little bit and you like yeah this is just a little bit but a little busy like um\nWho is he like is he like either one of your parents would have just rebelled he's looking back I read both of my parents were he's got a very mellow side of your moms are probably about ... your mom is Milo who's ... on my dad's very mellow my mom's a little more high strung so who are your license or\nOh I

all and he just he just that he's he is smoking cigarettes which I thought why do you have two little girls right but something stupid he was always outside is always not near that when he spoke as to whether it's from it\nSo uh yeah he's a he's a mix\nBut I mean it's weird the way we're all just completely different from the same of farm so so much for like\n... and stuff my younger brother my younger brother is like drugs and cam oh my God he's he's a gamble Halleck or whatever\nAnd all of the some of the stories you've told the testing\nI mean he likes [laughter] more opposite you know

my question about all the stuff that went down yesterday and it gives you this morning with these packages in these bombs or whatever that ... if somebody really wanted to do damage how come no but nothing blew up mhm\nQuestion I'm surprised nothing blew up accidentally weather is whether it\nBlew up where it was supposed to or not right I don't think matters I'm saying OK so all these packages where they all bombs supposedly\nI haven't seen someone saying all but I've seen the FBI said there were bombs right and which ones they were talking about\nAnd nothing nothing nothing that right it\nI Know it's hard to believe they sent to and you see the packages regular mail with like six stamp someday I'll buy now at a regular padded envelope it's not really super padded all go through the mail without unless there is no you know maybe all the elements are there for Obama pipe in two things coming up aside wires and the middle of my like looks good\nOr maybe there was just no way to a trigger al ...\nThe generator in it I don't know what'd you do it for just to scare people maybe doing a good job or they are going to the headlines are making a point about who is linked maybe that was their whole point link all these people together watching me and make you linked them in your head by doing this okay so now you don't know what the endgame as you're obviously I have no idea\nI'm just saying I don't know you know that some of the one of them one of them they blew up in the woods that's the first one to Soros but some of them have like a powder rented some had a shards of glass in it\nYou know [noise] who can get in the mind of a crazy person I have no idea it oh did you see what ... what they said was on the one of the pipe bombs that had like a\nA photo ISIS font I think they called it and in the fall ISIS fought so the script whatever you call it it said get her done like [laughter]\nHow does that happen to know uh so\nYeah so is it like a a an eye on this guy and they believe\nHe's a he's on there in uh backwoods guy or is it is actually an actual uh American guy make believe these ISIS get though\nIs I mean none of it's funny but it's I don't believe anything I'm hearing I Believe none of it\nAnd had to get her done it had a fellow at a two girls oh right the ... ... yeah yeah yeah\nYou see in the ... of the girls usually it's a yeah yeah\nAnd I saw that as well so who's you know I don't know what that it does have been probably know deep meaning to it and just goofing around whoever that is whatever goofing means I don't know but\nI feel like so strange and this is just my feelings it's not an opinion it's not a it's not factor truth anything mhm but I feel like if it was really some pissed off Republican something would blow up\nWas pissed off anybody who's a ... well yeah I mean if you automatically ... actually about it that way if it was a pissed off anybody ... something would have happened and so far nothing now the one that\nThey took out in the you know and my ... D grabbed it and the one from sorrows and exploded it ... that one was live actually so we could have done damage I mean it didn't somebody open\nThat package yeah and nothing happened so I just feel like something shady like this is a crazy person would have made a blow up\nI think so you know it's crazy person would have made a blow up somebody who is mentally deranged that kind of thing would have made it it exploded again just my thoughts what you know but I I Know I don't know anybody in NYPD bomb Eunice [laughter] you know right I Wonder\nIf there's a profile for this you know is this just attention getting which is totally worked and does that lead to something else oh ... you know and this person if they're sending them regular mail like that so now\nI I saw um an interview with an axe NYPD Grisham but our character who was on the talk shows like maven scene of\nThe time is that the one that the time you know I don't know yes he ... he went away for something well he's back he was going to run for he [laughter] he was getting ready to run for mayor and\nWe was a hidden no that wasn't Bernie character was going to ... what is it you might have is a part of a corruption K yeah he was a big time after nine eleven I Russian and American lives and if the nine eleven he popped including tax fraud right are you today headlined to White House officials\nAre so envied e yeah why not if I should believe it when he says this looks like an amateurish job maybe like what he said it's just it's so amateur the way it's done you know uh there's a there's a lot of just\nWeird things may do the way the packages mailed a so amateur like if you wanted to be effective back not the way you mail a bomb for example I write it doesn't make a lot of sense the way the sweat so\nI I agree with that right does it make it if you are going to send a people a bomb and you wanted it to go off would you just send it regular mail and we were talking about using audio plan what they use it gets there yeah how many people are involved in this\nCurrent thing on on you know we're learning that you can count and the reason\nPeople that do that want to use right now 'cause they don't want to come face to face with anybody and they want it\nAnd they put like to look for access that's how they they don't want to do anything how much the way how much of this call right now they will just kind of not touched on it and they can just drop it first happened it up in UPS or an actor and writer in Asia mailbox on the corner yeah they can just play that crap to China and had it in there without anybody thing there a\nWhile he makes a good point he did say uh the the extra pressure who used to being Joe said that he said there's no way this person isn't on video it's a matter of finding it\nBecause it but it's like you're talking about ... some random mailbox they have to go through all sorts of ATM machine videos and other videos just to have a random chance of coming across the person putting that yellow powder level up into that mailbox and figuring out if that person but this is why they have\nThe FBI and that's why they have investigators so maybe maybe the fault I Would think it would be where\n\nI Would think where it was processed would come into play because they all had Wasserman ... as they're trying to save the return address right on but when you like if I send something\nFrom the post office by my house it'll have Oakdale I live on ...

defensive line is missing the leadership of Gerald McCoy it's like\nWow I don't think so\n[laughter] you know what a funny about that people keep on saying that because Joe ... cause a really nice guy and he is that the press okay but everybody keeps on saying that that's important for them to say that just means to me I'm really going to be nice to him because he's nice to me so I don't want to speak poorly on the guy\n... his leadership he's not they took the kept it off his chest yep I've talked to\nNumerous numerous people that played with him he's not a leader and not only that he's not like I'm telling you what I'm Talking about I could tell you who told me this in the break I wouldn't say that on their\nLegitimate people with legitimate pedigree leadership is something that the press makes up you know what the press thinks leadership is anybody that talks to them\nSometimes that's the biggest kiss ass in the locker room\nSometimes the voice in the face of the team is the biggest kiss ass in the locker room and that doesn't make them a leader it makes on the other end of the spectrum and it's all about to all the time you hear the commercials and plays on this on this on the station they questioned me blah blah blah blah you ain't got nothing they say I'm soft yup\nWell yeah it's not hard you're done hard yet so we just got a lotta we've gotta protect we got a lot of ... pretender is on our defense and we can't stop anybody\nWhat do you think's going to happen today during ah the Monday morning talk from Kurt cutter road yeah\nThey're going to say that I'm In a life as Patrick's and the continuing downturn quarterback that's what's he has to\nYou can't you can't your cat now you cannot you cannot put them back in the only way it in my mind if they put James when some back in for me it came from a top of your own\nOh I Can't talk in the light ... not Jason lifestyle really up top I'm Talking about the blazers\nLightened Dirk ... know listening Glazer say we have to figure out this before the end of the season and that's what's your what's your boss ... know Jason light tries to demand that they're going to butt heads up the glaciers they've something that's what I saw that\nAnd if he doesn't like it than to cut her be gone the way it goes if you if your oldest tell you something I you don't like it you're going to be the next one out the door\nBecause nobody wants to watch that crap no more\nOh terrible though I don't know that the lasers want to sell tickets understandable their businessmen know what you're saying you know if you think that way at the beginning of the season if I told you that are more people would want to go watch\nThe football team was wife has packed to the gym is one thing you would say I'm Crazy right I don't know what it is that right [laughter] that is one first Patrick is selling jerseys now James jerseys or on the discount rack\nThat is the fact that fact\nOr I look at the schedule coming up we have the Panthers next Panthers Edwin yesterday or not enough\nTo say we're going to be anybody on the roster yeah 'cause we can't stop anybody and then the Redskins\nKids are unbeatable once again no and not good enough or not good enough defensively we give up we will give me a thirty three points to a game before yesterday okay we give up thirty something points every game were not going to score thirty some points every day we're just we're not we're not that good\nSo it just there's there's not enough anything that our team for for us to consistently wind up with this team which were not good enough was enough good football players on the ... we have a lot of good offers players absolutely but we have too often too Lyman better knock\nAnd a daughter who's myth who just suck\nEvery week\nEvery week they just kept block anybody and they get penalties every time it's a good run as a flag on the field it's one of those two holding every one of our defense alive and jumped outside yesterday university the patrons dump all sides and that's that's about it as that that's\nSomething else I wanted to talk to you about was the penalties themselves but that's I mean look penalties even at the very end got 'em down from what forty seven yards to forty forty hours forty two yard undisciplined play yeah you win a lot of it was all sides false starts ...\nI mean that's just on discipline and okay dope move until the ball ball goes up but that seems easy and we don't ever see James pulling anybody outside we we I think we had five\n... off sides against her defense of what life\nYou know first in five is so much easier than first and then you're just making their lives easier so\nWithout a discipline team without a consistent team I don't find those to be a well coached team\nSometimes on on the first touchdown the days I think was was the first or second tests do they ran in it looked like we can feed it like the running background and he was almost looking like where is everybody up what plague normal defense you walk in the day the bug she's always be about being in the right lanes being or you know in our one fifth they don't know what they're doing\nDon't you think do the defense again not the best but has picked up a little bit about the best the worst OK has picked up a little known since they got ... Smith\nI gave up twenty seven points to the first time you know\nWhen you're up a bunch of points in the second half to get conservative when it was time for them to shut the game they let us went down to feeling ... no that's not good that's good that's not greatness who gives them twenty seven boys in the first half of something every week we give up twenty seven points in the first that\nNot when you do the thirty some points every single game though it's it's not good we're getting a couple of more socks not really had one guy get a couple of facts other than that at\nThe quarterback so comfortable mhm that's not that's not winning are often says good enough to where if we had a good defense and defense absolutely poor but then again give me a ... and sort of all over four times it's not good for all we do is get a lot of yards that's all we do when it's all said\nOh you look at it we had more yards than they did yeah because you look at it on paper will leading the NFL and yours yeah office of yards it's it's very misleading very very misleading All right let's take a quick break we'll come back and talk a little bit more about the game and some other things going All right

everybody as that's why you see players like Sam Bradford get paid every year\nWhich one is bad for me to do nothing it's because he's already been through the rigors he's already made all the mistakes as you can depend on him to make good decisions because young quarterbacks suck\nYoung football players suck in general because you have to sit and watch them poop on himself and we have to watch an upstate young I shouldn't be bringing Jamison a in a conversation but he was just having a bowel movement on himself yesterday in front of everybody oh\nHe had diarrhea wasn't just one ... that was that was one of the worst\nOutings I've seen from a quarterback at a ... a long time I'm a longtime throwing the ball way way over way did it twice to Mike Evans what twice there was something when he added another half a dozen times at one and deceptive\nAll the ground the ball to nobody about and it was an interception it'll but there was nobody there that's what I'm saying no body you know where you throw in that like\nHe was seen ghost like he was he was he was looked at the end and he was seeing goals and he was ... it was he was squarely\nAs he was squarely yesterday and he was getting hit that much it wasn't get hit that bad but he was so off yesterday at the I guarantee he's he's he doesn't even know what's going on and that's the worst thing for an athlete is to not know what's going on\nIt may be off the field to as far as possible he's gone through a lot back\nHe's gone through a lot it's all here and he did it but he's gone through a ... it's hard enough to do that it's hard enough to be an NFL quarterback is really really are just so much going on there's probably a hundred times more to people really know at the have other things happening in your lives and to be worried about is enough like I see something else going on in his helmet\nOr something else happening as hell but I don't know whether they were then he\nDid need to be on the field correct you know you can't figure it out on the field no no it's it's costing us as does go down and it's in the defense is gossip can zero cost us yesterday\nCanada's arrow remind me of famous even when he's hitting he's off\nYeah usually kicks a field goal is just going inside an extra points just yelling barely barely barely yeah but that's ... that's killing us every week well miss extra
