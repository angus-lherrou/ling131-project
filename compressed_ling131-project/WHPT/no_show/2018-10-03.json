{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WHPT", "content": "Okay so he passes it's let's say the FBI stuff comes back and there was like oh my friend a guy said this guy said that drinking beer beer bear\nHe's on the court and the first case comes up\nThat's a women's a women's issue a woman's issue something that's all about women he yeah how was he going to be able to like if he does anything cross the women it's going to just looked so we like you'll always be looking at this got sideways from now on regardless someone\nSaid it and I agree there will always be an asterisk yeah to his name and I don't think we need that on again whether he did it or not\nThere's a time where sometimes the process yes should eliminate you you would\nThink that sometimes people would see you know what man this has gotten into this has gotten into a place where I don't really think I could ever recover from\nThis and you do to you commit that selfless act where you go as I've worked my entire life for this but I I think the Supreme Court meet someone that won't divided the nation\nSpeaking a divided nation mine with thing I have against this guy I don't know about what he did\nIn college and this is a he said she said no it's basically who gives the best performance like his performance wasn't good temperament he yeah he lost virtue of temperature right I mean he's innocent let's say he did not do this yeah there's a part of me to say is if you didn't do this man keep fighting\nRight but now we're getting to the thing where\nWe don't know if he did it we don't know if he did it and don't remember like there's so many little nuances that is that it could be my issue now my issue is not whether he did it or not what's your issue my issue with how he handled it well he they\nHow he handled that doesn't hermit at once we got him and then he was he was bitten back at the ... yeah and a bra and\nWe know what's going on here he also sounded very partisan absolutely I founded loose he sounded out of control that everything that I don't want in a guy who's the judge I got\nI got a question for you guys I think his outburst was it kind of also a sense of entitlement that he feels like he deserved that spot like he's like he's entitled to that spot and that's why he's being negate it for the spot and that's how you feel like you know he feels like\nI don't know outburst I don't know enough about him to just say his outburst was because of of something I didn't feel like he was under attack yeah on national TV in the whole world is watching him talk about something that happened in college and I feel like\nI I think he thought well whatever that was within the past and that's not really relevant today but they made it super relevant and then when we find the lady came in and testified that with this my my thing\nWas there's other politicians I wanted to give an example like Hillary Clinton that was you know also was\nBeing you know in in in front of you know in front of the house and stuff like that being\nAttacked almost the same way that he wants but she kind of kept are cool but it was about something she did on her job and not necessarily like some drama like a a legit yeah but it was it was our love of the\nTestimony and like you know everybody going against er and attacking her in the same sense that the way they attacked cabinet and it's just like my thing was that she I think she kept a cool little bit better than the way you know more than the heat in\nMy opinion yeah well I don't know how it ends I um [noise]\n'cause I'm wrestling with the\nYou know they always say if you feel like you're innocent you should never compromise you should people say that all the time and I do believe that in my heart but you can also do some serious times with those believe I'll absolutely it's not about I I didn't do this man can you prove you didn't do it because of the evidence says you your your looks like it made it more so than not a jury is going to believe that\nAnd I'm not saying he should compromise I'm not saying that you should give up you should do whatever he wants to do but you have to understand the dynamics of temperament yes and how they can reflect on you and the job you're applying\nI I agree that we kinda get we have we kind of have an idea right of his politics but that temperament though like I was really I don't know if I could ever meet John Brennan was talking about this man you ever see anybody roll up in a job interview mad as hell [laughter]\nI I Am right and if when you strip away the job and ... and that was the only reason by the way Lindsey Graham who everybody was praising the publicity that he is he's like oh man someone else got angry let me get in on a piece of this [laughter]\nA lot of ... uh I don't know I think he was a woman you think he was a woman on his I haven't either confirm nor deny that and that's not in this past life and this and this one [laughter]\nI I Know because I'm a young boy Lindsey Graham JR yeah [laughter]\nA woman does play 'em on Saturday Night live longer than any writing him John you're on the phone with hating oh\nYeah my my whole thing about this as a when he was I watched the Fox\nNews interview with him and he acted like he was just like the preacher boy and a bird into a into college and never did anything and then you see in this era book that says like treasurer for the ... group and like kill is is old ... says all party here party there but it's like oh but I didn't go that party\nLike [laughter] it's like yeah I mean if\nYou didn't act so uh yeah like oil now like and then come out later that you know basically a party a lot of college and each has signs or stuff say oh it's you know I just demands affectionate someone that's gonna be a Supreme Court justice for that or\nNot not so John So he was fit to serve in every other position he failed before no it\nWas it oh I think probably the main problem with everything is it a lot of things are okay and like well you know\nPeople always say well what what about you and your young I'm not running for president I'm not running for Britain clerk or you know it's it's a yeah I I ... the problem with the politics is a loss of moral fiber in my opinion anymore it's just it's\nAnd it's just getting and that's why we're getting this soap operas she'll Jerry Springer you know political base is going on now because you know\nI mean everyone's like oh they just you know the Democrats just want to do this because you know ... you know to Trump's domination he's already had a trip nomination goes through we didn't see all that with the you know ... ... ... it's like why do we stay with it maybe because you know ... probably ... to serve and this\nGuy is it's so it's yeah and how does this end is does he get confirmed and put on the court\nI don't know today as well you never know I don't think he should but you know it's I don't think a lot of things they still [laughter]\nI mean I I mean it's just\nYeah I I don't believe he should be um I'd be surprised if he if he was and\nThat's the only thing they're going to get it it's not like oh you only get one chance to have it and then you're never they can immediately and nominate somebody else right I'll probably be a lot better for the job they'll probably make sure this time but you know do a stricter background check and people are like\nA wise just come out now it's investigating ... their trotting him you know\nThan they've ever proud of them before all the erotic stuff comes out in ... it's a it's an investigation it's like why oh why did it come on now as it goes or investigated it All right\nThanks Jon we're going to um we're going to get the justice that we deserve\n[laughter] we're going to get that we deserve up as a country where the yeah all of us are bad right now I'm like the way you said you know we're\nGoing to get exactly what we deserve [laughter] well here's the thing if the guy that I disagree with politically then he needs to be squeaky clean you know you can't be like all mad about beer and they didn't want to do some stuff I don't like\n[laughter] I Know you go do stuff out of like whoever the guy they put on the benches but I'm afraid I got to be a little cleaner yes I mean I like beer I never pushed a woman in a room\nI had a question for beer segment we're going to be added on to the you know as many times as he said beers that going to be added on to like that uh\nNo we can't do that that would be that would just we wouldn't have time to play it

work their whole lives to to make money and and these people don't just make you know hundreds of thousands of dollars we're talking like millions and billions of dollars here\nAnd they make the money and they're just as unhappy as they were before probably even more unhappy because like you said now they have all these extra stresses\nAnd that's usually at the point in time when they kind of shift

I asked the lady lady again if somebody does this do you\nGo to the cops and kit to press charges please no absolutely weight and take money for it mhm\nNow again I understand two thousand nine was completely different political and social climate obviously maybe she didn't she didn't feel comfortable obviously that's why a lot of women are coming out now as opposed to even like two years ago this wasn't even a thing\nSo um I understand that but if you take money and you say you're going to be quiet about it and then not only do you disclose\nYou expose the person they can possibly go to jail obviously and you're still him you're sitting in for money more money\nI don't know this this is just it rubs me the wrong way\nYeah that when when people talk about some of the bad aspects of the me too movement this is one of them mhm where people are getting started for things for behavior now yes they did wrong initially\nBut go again you got to the cops don't stop taking money yeah who were raped right go to the cops absolutely crushed charges criminal charges\nI feel like the best thing that she could have done at this point and say listen nine years ago I did something wrong I took money I don't want that money anymore give it back\nIt or donated obviously Charlotte doesn't audit lobby obviously but I mean best case scenario if she had that money or whatever give it back donated and say this happen to me I should have said something about it I don't want any more money but I Do want to press criminal charges\nAnd and okay I respect that you want to investigate see what happened that's fine then that guy to jail don't rape him don't rape his wallet like don't\nDon't raise them for money I think that's ridiculous um and just one last thing before we do go to break about the me too movement and this is something that has actually crossed my mind a few times it says here um there's an article that uh will send me and says how the me too movement is impacting survivors mental health\nAnd it says here uh the global reckoning on sexual harassment and assault\nHave prompted many people to reevaluate past sexual interactions in a new light\nThirty seven percent of women and seven percent of men um survey by who cares a said that they now consider a pass sexual encounter to be inappropriate in the wake of me too and for eighty three percent of women thinking about a previous encounter that quote crossed the line\nBrought on feelings of anxiety depression regret\nNow I've had the same thoughts\nAnd I'm I'm not saying that I've ever been assaulted or harassed or anything like that I'm not claiming to be a victim I Need to profit by saying that but of course there have been a few times which I Would say most people have were maybe people pushed a little too far\nAnd you stop them or maybe you went along with it because you felt pressured or what not\nAnd you just kind of thought well I mean guys I don't wanna say all guys but a lot of guys will push until they're told no and most of them obviously but they're going to cross a line of yours and some them assaulting there just attempting and if you say hey not cool\nI Would say most guys what nine out of ... I don't know that but I Would say most guys hopefully without my bad my bad even before the me too movement right\nWell there's a difference between no no and no I don't know for sure oh jeez\nEarlier and I don't know it's like I've said nope not happening tonight and and it's always stopped never been but of course they cross the line um and what were they given consent to cross that line it makes you think oh crazy things\nOf course not but you liked whatever they were doing before so they try a little more and more and they kind of pushed the boundaries which is totally normal but as soon as you let them know where your boundaries are\nThey should stop obviously ... but um it's made me think of a few things where I'm like that didn't really bother me but should it have bothered me was I I don't want to use the word assault or harassed but something lesser than that\nWhatever that may be you know whether it was like a a a groping I didn't really like was I ever pressured into I wouldn't say I've never I've I've been pressured into sex or anything\nLike that but you know maybe something else or maybe I did something a little too soon or I didn't feel real great about it afterwards which is like it was either regret or the guy was kind of gross and I was like why did I make out with this guy there was a lot of guys in college and a lot of them were gross and I would kind of\nI Would see a picture of them on Facebook the next day and I'm like this guy and they're like yeah and I'm like jeeze what the hell not love\nWhat's going on here yeah so there are a few moments like that where I was like should I have been upset by that\nBut then I said no because I wasn't upset about it at the time it didn't destroy me I I never really even had thoughts about it later where I felt you know was I harassed or assaulted no never so but it's definitely made me question like should I say\nYou know yeah I mean I've had a few instances sewer I've run into some scenarios of ladies at least two times where I was uncomfortable no one was out everybody was drinking while she was drinking anyway I don't but I think I had just gotten out but you're wondering why one beer\nBut she just grab me and I just wasn't really into it\nThe downstairs or you know grab my face and like mold you kiss me kissed me like a tongue down the road and it was like on the street you know with people watching and I was just so like I mean it was\nI wasn't traumatized by it but I was like oh gee ... I didn't want that you know I wasn't interested in that and then I had one time where uh I had a girlfriend and we're at a party as as I was my that was probably Twenty years old\nAnd a a girl just kind of shut the door behind her and\nKind of I could've easily just push right right and again I wasn't it's different for a guy that threaten I Would have been threatened to hell yeah what are you doing stop because you don't want to push a girl out of the way it are already then she'll go and that guy just ready to push me an idea what the consequences that\nMakes you a little uneasy but you know I didn't hear from you know by going to be raped or something so that's a difference there of course but it put me in an uncomfortable position I didn't like\nSo I mean this does happen you know quite often the people\nOh yeah but it's definitely made me think about my past sexual experiences whether it be you know the whole nine or or just even just making out with the oh my God you know and\nAnd I've had to make out sessions in college and I think like what what what did someone pushed themselves should I have said no whatever pressure to anything that I really wasn't on board and it still makes you question everything but um\nIf I I read I mean you're talking about regret being one of those things happen to sex is regretful of just is I'm not proud of it it's not something that I Would want to do again but you know what happens yeah growing up so one year olds [laughter]\nThat's what you want to call it um I see your phone call we're going to get you have to break because we really really have to take a break like right freaking now and uh after the break we are going to we are going to discuss a peak David than he is in the news for a offending people go figure I'm after he was talking about what he wanted to do\nTo Ariana Grande day his fiance find out what he said after the break you were listening to listening to you\nCan I have a lot of power on me or am I feel like I treated unfairly the first time what did you explain to your lawyer what did he say was the main violation I Want to work on this do they\nKnow what I\nLike I tried to talk you earlier it was like I don't think it's plenty about weight\nMy own free will I don't know I you know you ...

once you well why don't you want to sell investigate\nWell the thing is he was on trial or not so much did he sexually abused anybody whether he was a drunkard that seemed like when he was on trial for yeah is is he a drink yes oh but he failed drastically\nIf you're if you're on trial for something and it was it was really on trial it was really just a job audition it was an audition for the

on a coke can it doesn't matter whether you get a good job afterwards whether you deserve to have you deserve the job\nFor somebody to go up there on the stand in line like he did he doesn't deserve the job because what he did was lie and it was gross the way he lied I like beer sure I like beer too I like beer\nBut I didn't I didn't say I was drinking me and my boys are drinking every weekend to the pole we couldn't see anymore and that seemed to be in a situation so once again\nThe fact that you did it is not a big deal the fact that you lied about it because you're on your up there and
