he was actor da da da da says come up right now you know he's probably been dating you know the waitresses from this joined and this is the first person probably he's David if any really signal\nYou know what you might notice this is him from he was on the streets of fire in Nineteen eighty\nFour I wanted to see a lot of younger he looks more familiar [noise]\nYeah see I'm looking for a million wow I'll show you the picture of him now and yeah you know this guy was money that's what\nWas not a no bad yeah high school I mean\nHe you know what the what you didn't break big but he was a

them I can see that in his face when he's next to her ... would you see what I can see that that too oh right right right and recognizing that good for him yeah\nHe was a bad actor though obviously 'cause he didn't he should act like that didn't bother him I tell you this if you're sick and she got caught off guard would I Would have took a hand up and they have like a perfect\nHuman if you've got to understand that you like you guys as she put together destiny child if the biggest film or your eye on the streets or\nFive years ago you along for the love of the U.S for the ride\nMy point is

it's not love and respect you looking for ... there are people that are in relationships like that right I absolutely get that I mean you know inside you know inside he's saying you can disrespect me\n'cause I don't want to ... well some people may want to do that though we will see some people you know\nI don't want ... he's a handful of he wants when you're there for him saying I think that no there's no amount of money\nThat I can be around where I don't want to wipe okay with being disrespected that's where I'm starting from and that's where I Am like I couldn't I don't see a scenario\n\nI gather figure well I mean I think that I think that I mean I'm not saying that is right but I think that a lot of times certain relationships are based on what can you do for me\nI understand that but I don't know anyone that's comfortable being like living your life your disrespected as a man from the woman that you are with\nBut the but I Would look at it this way Kevin sometimes you're with somebody that you don't respect if you don't respect someone why we're not paying what did they respect don't go out to be with somebody or a lot of other reasons I don't know what I'm saying I don't understand that but what I Can't even understand how you can take the disrespect what reason because I don't know about ...\nYou know what I care 'cause I Can't be with

nose and everybody knows or um but she actually asked if she could come with ana and walk me to the ring\nIt was say well yeah I understand that but like what about Johnny B how come Johnny B is not a guy that's just it's\nAbsolutely he's been on commentary every single year so he assumed that that was where he was going to be so I you know I I don't\nUh I don't know if a Johnny got the message is now but I don't know that's happened is you\nI heard I heard waking up in in my count as a way the way I think uh oh I think that as I said it depends sometimes the second\nWay so Lincoln white pushing pushing us all out on the that's a I think\nI think when you're a former boxing champion I think that takes president a precedent rather over you know former commentary\nRole Johnny B should be in his corner anyway you know it only it only takes it only takes submitted to walk in with the guy ... yeah ... but if he's not going to have to go back to a table John it'd be neat that's your that's yeah I Will be honored to have in my corner\nI remember Johnny B or you're doing commentary in the past but I Wonder why the emails that uh the the powers that be to make sure that we're going

Iran that made no sense at all like you could tell he was trying to go somewhere he's trying to make some points\nHe's a great rapper not a good speaker on things he knows nothing about [noise]\nI guess he called on the backlash from his peers and from pretty much everybody is Tanya announced today [noise] he's quitting politics guys crazy [noise]\n[laughter] or their religious views ... do not reflect\nThe atheist views of\nOn a home all the agnostic views of Johnny B and believe also the the views of\nWill influence if nothing just get on a religion Helen ...\nWe don't know if we're going to hell not how 'bout that were up in the air on it I'm not so hard to know where I'm at\nThat he was a use to spread messages [noise]\nI don't know you think he's a\nBad yeah Lynn ... all of the tide he's like a pit stop the people not that the people\nI kinda I kinda got the Bible was more that Kansas Owens check kinda 'cause she said that they had that boy exit thing right right right the uh uh a black people walk away from the Democratic party thing an ad that rally a a a Trump met with the people and all that stuff\nAnd uh I think she said that he designed this piece of clothing or something and that kind of pissed them off and I guess he felt like she was just kind of using him so he said I think he's distancing itself from her but as far as I Know he's still a supporter of the president\nEven now but he just said it's just not going to comment on stuff from Kanye West being used by hand is oh it yeah because I was a little bit of a level are no no no because she organized that are helped organize that ... thing and said like ... kind of backing this\nSo buddy I guess you didn't really have anything to do with it like I felt like she was being used by her I\nI don't know I don't feel like he could be used by someone who is barely even saying here's the problem\nI I think that he loves to troll he loves attention he loves uh\nDoing most controversial thing he possibly can whether it's a stepping in front of some teenage girl which is accepting her music award to be a deck had them for me to a or if he's going to the White House you know it's all a look at me look at me problem is now he's stepping in realms\nThat he's not smart enough for period I don't think you understand it I I think he's done\nOh I hear you I really do I do too and it has nothing\nTo do with it when I say that I don't want anybody going oh you're saying but no he just comes off as as an idiot there's a lot of very intelligent black people are a lot of very told you I mean\nAnd there's a lot of dumb of both also if you're dumb I'm going to call you up for being dumb if you look gum if you're smart then I'll go All right well maybe he knows something I don't know I Need to figure this out I feel\nLike he tries to play the whole he show off base and no one knows what he's\nTalking about that he must be a gene that is what people think he's a creative genius he said I actually don't know\nHere in creative genius why I'm not going to ... you can be dumb and you'll be a good musician goes to China and all you know\nI I I look what you just said yeah he had me completely do for a long time because I thought that I go you know what man he's on a different level I don't even think I can comprehend what a genius this guy is because the piece that great of a producer in a rapper\nThen he must be intelligent on other levels too so maybe I'll just step my ass back a little bit and absorb some of this and try to figure out what the hell's going on with counter but in reality is drug after he kept talking and kept talking oh he's got a moron\n[laughter] you're trying to get his name back in the news I Do that oh he take back everything you just said I don't think that's the he's the most famous person in the world I don't think he's right or do attention yeah but he's already getting it\nAlready has it why would it be trying to get more here you have your wage why do you want more money that uh people are wanting more and more and more he looked into an artist has said he's addicted to you still think that that whole thing with Trump was just just a ploy to get attention I really didn't really believe any of that is now ... percent it's insane to didn't hear about any of the politics\nThen found found a local a local story from Chicago that he can kind of you know leap frog off of and the the guy that was in prison you know it's a big story you kind of threw that into his rap in and really a bad way he didn't get his point across very well at all because he was all over the place like a maniac\nBut I Do I think he really cared about this but I don't\nI don't think he definitely cares about what he says and I think he believes in what he said I think because Kansas Owens woman used his name\nAnd I think he caught on to that and didn't like it and now he's the same which is right there's no reason for anybody that's not a politician to be in the politics doesn't affect your day to day like everybody is super involved in politics and doesn't it doesn't affect you day to day just do your thing he instead of being a musician a designer yeah do that\nLet's get a list of people a list of celebrities that are really good at something\nBut do other things that they're really bad at or they're too stupid to do who are
