[noise] I mean it's it's a beautiful country in some ways you know\nWe talk a lot of people go a lot of ...\nIs in Indonesia I Believe\nYes but a lot of like a lot of other countries [noise]\nUsing an Egypt and vacation spot you know they're so beautiful the beaches and everything but dangerous man very dangerous Seventy seven five seven nine one or two five\nEight hundred seven seven one [noise]\nOne of those two five or do we have updates\nOn the stats on enemies are right now because I Know the last twelve hundred and twelve hundred ... dead but they're expecting a lot more expecting\nIt to rise I mean there always is you know the aftermath people that they haven't found yet\nYeah al ... a lot of homes were swallowed up by mud and water so they expect that that ... rise significantly\nUm I don't like to watch people die and I don't like to know that people are dying over something like this\nBut I don't know if I'm the only person like this I'm I'm fascinated with natural disasters to the point that\nIf I started watching Youtube videos of any kind of a big destructive like whether it's at five tornado or her hands after I I'm so fixated like I I'll watch it for hours and hours or something about\nAh that much like\nDestruction foresight Mother Nature when that much force it it's it's intriguing as hell to me and I remember when the tsunami hit Indonesia I think it was two thousand ten right after Christmas and there was so much video of it and\nThe videos you nominees is still so new because I mean we haven't had like a real good surveillance video everywhere\nReally only for the last Twenty years or so so\nAh the ... that wiped out entire you know like I said in those eight or ... in yeah hundred years ago nobody got video that obviously just just drawings of it and stories of it but now when something happens\nWe it's immediately like ... you know it's a accessible to us like it's like oh man there was an earthquake in Mexico city New York oh my God you turn on the TV there was a hundred different camera angles out and you're like ooh damn say the same thing with hurricanes and\nAnd uh ... you know even like flash floods to me it's just fascinating to see that you know that much destruction going to happen and of course then you're rooting for people to live you know so it's like now to me it's like this\nUltimate like underdog story is like the small little human versus a giant for since like I come on guys you can get through this you know you're rooting for people in Houston and you're rooting for people like in North Carolina and it's a it's just to me it's it's it's it's ... it's it's amazing\nNot in a positive way but I cannot look away\nI mean it's it's amazing it's tremendous yeah very destructive but it is incredible on it it's weird to me because technology so advanced right\nBut you we can't stop these natural disaster no you can only this is how you can track them yeah they can tell you where to run from um where not to go oh that's amazing that we can do all that but if there's a hurricane of Berlin there's no technology to make it go the other way or or do you stop it while it was forming there's nothing that we can do\nYeah and you can't like a we're talking about this before like with floods and stuff\nYou can't stop water you can't stop that much water\nSo it's like they tell you yeah like all these people that died in North and South Carolina a couple of weeks ago from the just the rain and everything that that that took over the area from that hurricane like what in the forties right a lot of people died a lot of it I think it was a hundred and some people really yelling like that out it's up there yeah yeah\nAnd it's like they tell people look we are recommending you evacuate and people were like not that big a deal where you live through it but then when the water comes and you're there\nYou're ... you know there's nothing you can do you just gotta prayed at somebody comes in rescues you yeah forty eight forty eight okay three states that's too many that's too many uh for something that's avoidable you know you\nAnd I thought of them a lot of them were old people that were stubborn didn't leave I heard about that mother an infant that died my tree fell on them or something a ... year just run away and you had what ... over a week's notice\nAnd and your there's part of me to win a hurricane is coming here part of me wants to ride it out because I Want to see the force of it I Want to experience it but then at the same time\nI don't want to be a statistic either and I remember when Irma came and it was the track was coming right towards those last year and I was ready I mean with more and I were out there and Jane where other boarding up our windows were like we're gonna we're gonna you know face this thing had on and then\nMy girlfriend was like I'm scared I Want to go and I could see the fear in her eyes I was like well you know if if that's what you want to do it because she would have been a wreck\nI was like let's go you know I it was a hundred percent for her to get out of there and so and then I thought about it you know I was driving through all that traffic hadn't to Atlanta I thought you know what\nWe have a lot of big ass oak trees around our house\nAnd it's very easy for one of those to fall down and just collapsing and could kill kill all of us so\nBetter to err on the guy to you know on the side of a college and yeah there is no reason to sit there and try to be a bad ass you know all I think as we these giant like skylight windows I call I'm going to see the hurricane but yeah I'm also see like a ... like last\nWhen I'm gonna see a two hundred year old oak tree coming through it too and that's not a good idea or let's go to the phones real quick we got somebody that was a hamburger marriage last night on the phone Jerry what's up\n\nOh man thank you for coming out do those awesome and we did uh we did

these women or they're just a Cuban people underline the law\nThen when the real victims need help\nNothing happens I don't want the the boy the crowd cried wolf effect happened all over the place I I really want whoever's guilty to pay for what they've done and I want the people that\nAre that accuse people of being guilty to face some sort of penalty for too it just seems to me like\nThere's a

holders I'm One of them I was a season ticket holder into four years ago\nAnd when I I one day I I was on the way in the stadium\nAnd I and I had this feeling I said look if I go there today\nAnd it looks like they don't care about winning I'm not going to renew my my my season tickets and that was the last time I had season tickets and I and it's as soon as I feel like the organization\nPuts everything into putting a winter on the field then I'll go I'll go back and get season tickets but I just can't see spending so much of my money or that I really can't even afford because the entertainment dollar you only have so much this man every family has a budget\nOr in it and it it's a big danger in my budget to go there every week and spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars once you

very much a poll a gal you know that's that's my scene yeah but um but it was fun I had a good time and it's it's cool to be like that excited and I'm like how people live their lives 'cause it's amazing it's great but you know\nEverything fades though everything fade like even for rich people all the glitz and glamour gets sold it gets stale you know like I Do so yeah\nI don't know I I have a feeling if I could you know go out to a nice place to eat every night but when you get old enough to worry about cooking of a nice meal\nAnd in the sense that it it gets old where you don't like it it's more like you're less excited by it you know\nOh yeah well ... becomes routine like I remember the first time I saw were Thomas lived\nThere before he moved to where he is now he was like in the down in the heart of downtown St Petersburg okay in these brand new apartments I don't want to say which ones even though he doesn't live there and don't want to um and he took me to the rooftop and there was a pool and it was like it looks like a Miami sort of\nVibe with the palm trees on the roof top brand new like a fire pit the steam or ... everything and the gyms at the top but it's just glass windows everywhere so just looked amazing I started running around spreading around like a little kid I like what do you know and I'm\nNo but you know after we dated for a year and a half I'd gone like I got to go to the gym and I go to school or could sue city just wasn't I Wish I could ... live that first that first time you know it's kind of like I imagine I've never done crack but I imagine like you're always chasing that first high you know\nYeah I I've heard often a wealthy people were successful people in like say that they reminisce a lot about when they were struggling and when they thought about what but you know when they were just living day to day and trying to get by before they were a success and that was a fun time in their lives were they were pursuing the dream right I got it\nIt's one of those things where you're always I don't want to see the grass is always greener but you you you get successful and then you reminisce on the times when life with simpler and not that I'm successful on any stretch of the imagination but\nThere are times where I I I don't want to say the word a mess but reminiscent I guess kind of mess\nLike the Detroit days granted oftentimes they were dark and um my future was like you know I had I had no idea what I was doing at the time I was just\nPod casting to I don't want to say no one I mean I guess some people were listening but I didn't I wasn't getting paid for it I didn't know if it's going to pan out and anything and\nIt was really really scary but at the same\nTime it was like a it was a quaint or time if that makes sense for you know um I didn't have to worry about like now if I say something on the air and it doesn't go well and then it it the whole town years about her I get made fun of on the morning show like that can be stressful some time now if we were to put those two lives you know side by side is rather\nHave the one I have now but there are times where I almost missed that\nQuaint and that's where I'm just I was constantly just fantasizing about God I Can't I I Would love to move to Florida you know this is when John Brennan was an answering my emails and other does now but [laughter]\nYeah and and and nobody was really getting back to me and I was like man if I could just moved to Florida be just the best thing and when I moved here was amazing and I tell people all the time probably for the first three weeks I I I think I cried\nEvery day I drove in my car and I remember just with the windows down it was warm air in like march April I'm like this is the coolest thing it's freezing in Detroit right now and it was so warm and I would just cry every day 'cause I was so happy that I\nHad like a fresh start new beginning wasn't in Detroit anymore and they and every once in a while now I like look back to Detroit when I'm like man I was really like unhappy I didn't know or is going nobody knew my name and I almost like miss some of that which is so bizarre and then I get I feel guilty that I miss that because I'm like well\nYou have it every moment of that why are you looking back on that and being like oh man it was a good time\nWell you need those the bad times in order to appreciate the good time yeah you know I mean I think we both have our own challenges day to day here and hopefully we'll be able to reminisce about these times right in the late night radio of we will be in a better time slot attic and you know money and\nI mean that's that's the goal of course so I mean it's kinda the same thing you know I still have to pinch myself sometimes because much like you I have the same story of\nJust starting to pot and wanted to get on the radio to know how to do to start or are casting and like you said you're kind of just doing it just to do it but um you know now I did it to get on the radio and now I'm On the ... the station I wanted to be on was a fan over right half my life and you know and I'll get to see\nYou know my couch Andrew grab a walk around and hallways and stuff and like those guys are a big influence you know influence or yeah definitely on me and so it it's just it's just really neat sometimes you just gotta I gotta stop in pitch myself\nOh yeah and I love hearing everybody is uh how they gone to a radio story because unlike most professions every ... every one story is different here you know like Galvin was doing like I think he was like um he was managing\nClubs and stuff like he was in the night life seen bar tending and stuff like that I mean I dropped out of grad school Johnny's doing comedy you did a pod cast\nLike everybody has their own story it's not like oh how'd you become a doctor oh I Know the story on med school and even went to this and did rotations and everyone has the same for jak tree this one is very different and a lot of people find themselves just\nFalling into it or you know someone like any who had a really successful sports career and then after that ended they decided to pursue something like radio and then that blossomed into like an even bigger career so it's it's really cool to hear everybody's story\nYeah definitely something to look forward to to the future\nI like it All right let's move right along and talk about how social media\nPersonal defense personal attack yeah I really need to invest in the art of letting ash go it's not worth your time it's not worth your energy and apparently according to the study it's making you don't\nHurt because we all know when we're acting and clouded by our emotions you know we're not thinking rationally we're not thinking cognitively you know what I mean that's why we often have to ask for advice\nWhen it revolves when stuff it involves our personal lives we ask our friends even though we can give probably just as good advice about their lives but when it's cloudy and emotion you're not acting rationally\nYou're not you're not acting in a smart man or by any means you're just you're acting on on just kind of like fight or flight mode you know I was at the pair sympathetic nervous system thinking man you just reacting\nYeah and that's why I Love the specially the political stuff kind of go beyond I Know that's what it is on on both sides as we were just having this emotional response sure and if things that ... almost politics is kind of opinion based as it is yeah I don't think there's\nYou know right or wrong answers for most things in that field anyway so I mean it's I don't know it's just a waste of time even getting involved with with those conversation and what does it will and friendship but about about friendship but ended because I couldn't keep my mouth shut anymore and said something and then it turned into you know ... and a\nNobel diver so sad that it ends on those pregnancies yeah it does\nUm with me though I only get offended like I I don't even really know what that experience is like when it comes from a stranger like if you've ever made me upset or I had to have a serious talk with you consider it you know a compliment because I don't if I don't care about you and you say something I don't like I just dismiss you out of my life\nBut if I either have to work with you or I care about you or your opinion matters to me than those things well\nForced me to either have a confrontation with you or to have a serious talk with you and in those moments I feel very offended because I'm not\nI never get offended on behalf of women are on behalf of Jewish people or on behalf of immigrants I'm all of those things I'm I'm only offended when you try to offend me personally and ... and you know what my insecurities are and you use that against me or you just told me the truth and I didn't want to hear it also that it's all a year and say
