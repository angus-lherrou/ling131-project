becomes difficult for a quarterback sneak because those guys most likely are going to stand up\nThat center now it was different in the case of what we saw with the rams in Seattle they didn't do that they had a shade so they had a direct attack on one side and they try to walk up a linebacker not as big not not really in a dance to be as quickly as well off the ball since diming off as a blind so that's why I think it works but there's another reason why words\nYou don't know why were you tell me tell me right now 'cause Jon solve in with the center for the LA ribs and that's right my buddy mild center Notre Dame we executed a but Julian quarterback sneaks with old Solly he's one of the best in the business probably the most underrated center in the league\nOr he's got a ... he got very short legs\nI probably like a thirty engine seemed like a very short legs even though he's six foot three like from a distance\nHe he looks like a wee man he doesn't look very tall\nAnd then as you get closer you're like oh no that guy just has really short legs but his short legs allow him to get low pad level and drive like everyone's going to talk about Jared golf on that point out big years it's all about the center you know it takes two to tango and it takes to to make it successful quarterback sneak\nYou got to give John solve and a lot of credit and by the way\nYou know everyone wants to make this big deal about Sean McVeigh and that being the difference for Jared ...\nWhat about John solving an ... where it's like those guys to me have just as much to do with this\nDifferent but I don't want to get off on a tangent because that that the beside the point um I Do think more teams should utilize the quarterback snake I think the reason why they did it though\nWas that second that the sales to actually started to use their last time out with one thirty nine left which was a mistake in my opinion unless they had twelve men in the field or there was something that was going to cause a penalty and would have given LA a first down\nI have no idea why you would want to talk about that ... play as opposed to saving it for your two minute drive to deal with a football game like I thought that was probably the biggest mistake of the game\nSo are you saying that a center with a low center of gravity is got an advantage in a quarterback sneak\nYes okay there's no doubt no doubt about it so my favorite football player of all time I've told you this is my favorite player of all time have it in a no not even close by the way a if you talk to him to return my tax sometime within a hole that guys I get big lead by David Anderson\n... unbelievable and didn't even returned my tax or a PBS for David I understand if you tell them I said to go screw him self operative during my tax this weekend what a jerk but never mind that\nHole and crude is my favorite NFL player of all time loved him he's a Savage he was a low center of gravity center and I can remember a lot they would be going forward on quarterback Sikhs ... sneak Saddam that makes a lot of sense now John Sullivan being your buddies from college we can't get him to call into the show one time\nWe can't have him call in and describe what it feels like down rating Quinn behind you for four years\nYeah at some point maybe we can a couple of issues for starters for starters okay he uh he he just got done playing football game that doesn't make it easy or the the second issue is um he is a hard time returning calls a return in fact\nOne of those guys huh yeah okay I mean I mean we can rip him\nLet me know we can rip them no problem whatsoever that while they want to rip\nUnder saying like if he doesn't return of color attacks like I'm I'm with you bowling X. men you go we go\nJust remember that he's my buddy I I Love so yeah he's only you know he's he's the type of guy he's one of your friends you know especially when you you can live for their part and you start having kids and all that it gets a little bit more difficult but he's the type of friend that doesn't do a good job of keeping in touch and it's not that\nEveryone has friends like that like everyone has friends like that some are good at it some aren't so make an effort some don't that's just how it is everyone has people like that that is completely beside the point okay ah because I think it had everything to do at the time out that Pete Carroll so I think it was a huge mistake and I think had they kept the time out\nI think LA what part of the football because for two reasons one\nUm I think now they're thinking you know what we really can win this game okay on this one play and and I and I don't really want to turn the weather events played today I don't really want to give them another opportunity especially with Russell Wilson at home to go down and get a field goal but also give them an additional time to think about it you know what I'm saying\nYeah um I and I saw Tom Brady did the same here's okay another one for you this is another um a quarterback sneak question for you Brady Quinn the quarterback here the show\nThe patriots I'd seen him do this a lot why wouldn't you if there's a ... like say it's just a second or third in in ten\nAnd you pick up eight yards for whatever reason or second in ten and you pick up eight yarger nine yards for whatever reason I see the patriots do there's a lot especially towards the goal line well they'll run up to the goal line before the defense can get that and Tom Brady does a quarterback sneak ... how are they old dog dog or they don't or they are the only team that still does it\nUh no I I think everyone's got their playbook and in some fashion or form I just think they're the ones that truly believe in it I mean we there so the dog dog call we used to say\nThan MLD coverage is right here on Fox Sports radio\nMan\nTo wind up as one of yours\n[noise] [noise]\nWell I mean\nHe's ready when\nNothing I singing when the guy hosting the show it to me I'm Jonas Salk this is talk sports radio\nGoes back yeah we had Aaron for about a month or I or you don't you don't want to problems as well but no not at all especially right now he's ... I don't know but I'm surprised that I have a cigarette hanging out of his mouth [noise]\nThings like that kind of mood did he grow at MIT [laughter]\nThat it's really a song do [noise] I I listened\nTo uh what's what's that word I'm GOOD Music so I Would not clear to disarm here on Fox Sports radio by\nThe way of radio we're brought to you by discover card we treat you like you treat you I'm All right so Brady ... joined us Dr on outfits are we are moments away from kick off\nOn Sunday Night Football the Dallas Cowboys and the Houston Texans um this is and and this is five games we've got now five games of evidence\nThat if a team does the fall over time period\nThis season in the NFL the very next week they lose Steelers and brown Vikings in Packers the Colts have already lost on Thursday Night Football entered the Houston Texans to make it sticks for six are we going to have a six pack or the Texans going down at home and get the Dallas Cowboys\nI don't think so and if you look at the matchup it's\n... have really struggled to protect the Sean Watson okay he's on pace to be back like almost sixty times or something ridiculous yeah season\nBut owned by the way the Dallas Cowboys have a pretty salty defensive front but the past couple of weeks in last week's winner versus Hindi\nHe actually dealt with it pretty well and the interesting thing is they converted a high percentage of their third downs and oh I think it was sacked seven times last week sticks to those seven came on first or second now\nSo what it's telling you is even though he's he's getting ... they're having these big losses at some point in the drive there are still overcoming it and he's adjusting to that like I think the Sean why that is as looking more and more like the quarterback we saw last year\nAnd a six starts um then then maybe the the beginning of this year I think he's starting to settle in with some of the issues they have\nAt starting to get more of a report on what their guys and then you've got Jay Jay watt and should they be on cloudy they're starting to turn up a lot of the pressure so\nUh I think this is going to be a close game but I Would give the edge to the ... even with the staff and you just throughout\nUm also the Dallas Cowboy offensive line and look there do you mean you know one of their better players has a disease right now so it just freakish things have happened to the Dallas Cowboy happens on the line but they're nowhere close to where they were two years ago\nSo I think that changes the dynamic so when a lot of people will put all the pressure and the emphasis on jak Prescott not being as good as he was two years ago when neither is the office of blind\nAnd neither are the receivers that he's throwing to and as he kill Elliott is starting to find his way but he missed six games a year ago I just I think there's a lot too but I Do think it's an interesting match up um and I I ... what do you make of that trend though wouldn't teams go full over time period because you look at it and you go oh that's just an extra ten minutes of football\nBut what is an extra ten minutes of football equate to an NFL week when you've got to\nAttention to that comes up yeah I don't think it's a big enough sample size that draws too many conclusions I mean you'd have to look at this for example you know were that were those teams playing the following week at home or on the road who are they playing\nYou know what I'm saying I mean like like all those things factor in a little bit more um you know maybe if you gave me ten years of that research it'd be a little bit different story and assuming I like we don't know like like I think the most I'm\nTelling thing of any stat right now if I was like in the betting public arouse the gambler I Would be betting on the home team on Thursday football every single yeah hundred percent historically they've won I don't know about covered\nBut if you're just going to get the money line historically they've one sixty percent of the time if you remove that first there was a football game this season which doesn't count\nAnd then I Want to stay teams that have traveled through two time zones\nAnd are on the road they've never won on Thursday\nYeah I'm In that and that's that actually came out when the Vikings went to go play the LA ramps at the coliseum in that shootout game\nUh yeah Thursday Night Football there is something to it if you go on the road and the NFL can can can say that and I don't know if this is something they tried to be cognizant of this year but it was always while you know as long as we keep it in division so you're not having to travel so far\nOr what the hell was happening the Vikings then [laughter] I didn't want to you why don't you just not lie and come out and say look we're just looking for better match up I just came out and say that\nLike what Fox paid for right I mean yeah ... paid a lot of money to the NFL and they said you know we'll take theirs and they football ... we'd love to own that property\nBut you need to give us some good games and that's why there's a slogan where now the now to the game right like that's all commercial for Thursday Night Football because they are great matchups it is worth watching in primetime\nThey're not these divisional like color rush crappy game that um that the NFL kind of schedule now now they're legit matchup that everyone wants to see\nOutrage with a sense I mean look man uh we're I'm Guy aside for the call so I'm I'm offended by it not you should be offended I mean especially if you're a colorblind yeah or not yeah I mean and look uh I mean bubble can attest to it I Am definitely not I I Do a Brady Clinton Jonas knocks here on Fox\nSports radio um do I do want to get your thoughts on this because speaking of short weeks we saw the worst game of Patrick my homes [noise] season\nEarlier today a couple of interceptions no touchdowns in the air you did ever rushing touchdown but Kansas City still easily rolled over the Jacksonville Jaguars biggest takeaway from that game for you was what\nWell a couple of things that I think one of the match ups that everyone was excited to watch um was the matchup between ... to kill and German Ramsey and I got to be honest with ya I Know Terry kill had some good players and the game I saw the rams he was on um\nHe pretty much lock them up um especially when they played press men demand coverage which I think was furry kills request\nUm didn't work out too well for them a couple of times and he was targeted but look ultimately I mean you could fit the worst game of patch from homes career is going up against the best event yeah so so ah I I think you can give them a path especially considering the one\nI think the biggest take away from me or a couple of things Travis Kelsey and the offensive line should get way more credit like this is always oh about ... homes and about that but\nHe's got he's got all day back to the past versus one of the better defense of friends in the NFL that on top of that Kelsey is breaking people off left and right and getting wide open to make it ... makes it easy throws so\nThose two things I don't think enough appreciation or it's more about sorry killing the speed and big plays an impassioned homes\nOr then the defence the defence is slowly getting better and ...\nOn defense I think they're starting to improve so a ... for the Jackson was\nThat all come on the way they wanted to come on man you don't have to take shots of ... and James Man he doesn't deserve that I mean he's out there hostile and re did you see is four hundred plus passing yards by the way if there is a garbage time hall of fame and the NFL ... first ballot first ballot back Iraq's up\nNo look he's smart I Know you went to use yes but he is small shot UCF on this thing I didn't even graduate I don't even know how like God he understands that's how you get paid that's how you build up the stats\nThat's how you you all of a sudden your cube your your yards everything else you're rankings when they come back to renegotiate your deal they look a little bit better when you get some of those garbage types that\nWell a tell you what if he was if he was smart he would have kept when he brought with him to the draft know what I mean\nWho yeah those two are figures of ISIS is Louis\nYeah as a absolutely alright I we're on a lake Noxon quaint here talking buoys here on Fox Sports radio so by the way that by the way I'm On Patrick moms to your point when you talk about the often supply you know what I have noticed about him when Josh Allen runs\nAnd it's called like the uh injury\nTo significant players that\nThe falcons over the past three years ranked second ticks than the NFL and second again they've been primarily healthy throughout the course of ... time there\nAll of that guy flipped this year and you're in these close games stuff that never happens is happening and now you find yourself in dead last and and to your point key players aren't coming back I I feel bad for man yet I met Ryan's not getting any younger uh he seems like mobility wise ... slow down now the red\nAnd fit what are your what do you mean what what what what was really fast well I'm just I mean like you know what I Would probably should have thought that one out yet doesn't make any kind of thinking about it\nBetween games I have no idea when I was thinking there but um they just in the red zone has gotten better the often has gotten better but yeah it's not like they can just go out there and win games on their own ... being a defensive guy\nYou would think he'd have them prepare but when you lose that many players to injury and you've never dealt with that over the past three years since you've been there I feel bad for minutes over you're not getting back into that division\nAnd now what do you do you just go out there and try and win shootouts every game\nUh yeah and it's kinda tough to Julio Jones by the way it still doesn't have the customers that's weird thing is that is crazy weird [laughter] buried and Calvin readily scoring every week it seems like yeah yeah uh except for this week but\nUm it doesn't who cares right there is always there is one demographic out there that you have to appreciate okay if if you're up you can be upset about how the team's going to do the one for right now the veterans banged up especially down the middle that defense that's where they are impacted really right\nFantasy though people are still going to love that Ryan because they're going to be shootouts every week\nAnd he's going to have to come back a lot of times so we talked about black or bottles with some of those garbage time you know points in fantasy and that and all that for his his contract negotiations standing firm outright like he's always going to be one of the top statistical leaders because the ... out around them and actually cause the position that his defense puts them in\nNow ... deep down even though they're losing and they're probably all upset but deep down do you think a little part of Steve's Turkey's Eunice excited because he's going to air it out every game easier in and out\nThere why don't you got a lot harder for him to take the blame right now [laughter] like last year was\n\nWives of the disconnect they can't go on the red zone this year started off slow again and and people are thinking oh my gosh I still can't figure out how to get into their Jones and after the injury is now it's like oh the defense of terrible you know like like that's just what everyone kind of shocked it up\nYou are in season and a couple of things went wrong and he said yeah but it's just as an ... year\n[noise] oh that's a good question um I probably made his first year when I when I was in Cleveland my third year I mean we got rid of killing before the season started\nWe traded brave one after the first three weeks to New York there was an incident with with duct tape stole worth who was great the year before but then wasn't able to play that season for us\nSo it was like all these things could have happened right before the beginning of the year and then right when he started and you're just digging yourself yeah this isn't gonna work out well like like this is just not going to be that the type of is that we're all hoping for\nA break when John his doctor Fox Sports radios would come to your life and the guy go Fox Sports radio studios coming up next I'm following a game in the

you finally get ... you you finally start to see the Austin shine a little bit you get some creativity oh back I'm rose\nThe three yard field goal not in a dome not on on astro turf\nIn Carolina on

keeping up with the current ash in your watch total bellows total ... the food network the cooking channel diners drive ins in dives Monday Night raw big brother something on Netflix shameless\nDeadliest Catch whatever you can watch that isn't football related where you're not going to be reminded at what an awful last that was on Sunday that's what you do that was terrible for the giants\nYeah all the way around though a a better performance just not good enough and and that's the problem with this giant dam is I I don't know that they're good enough to win many games on the road let alone there they're tough matchups at home yeah looking at how this came went like I just\nThey're not they're not seeing that I thought they were going to be and I think there's a large part to do with Eli Manning like you know I hate putting on a one player I don't believe football is is always about one player the ultimate team sport\nUm so I hate doing this\nBut man he is just a shell of himself and that's saying something because he hasn't been that great in his career in the regular season now posted the Ohio you don't wanna mess with them okay postings ... when he gets there he could sort of on now but regular season Eli is average and he's playing below that so far this year\nBut even post season Eli outside of those two Super Bowls that he wanted which isn't which is great I mean that's awesome and it may one day get 'em in the hall of fame outside of those two years he's never won a playoff game he either wins at all or if you lose the first game it's a it's a weird but that's\nYork there is no worst place to be a guy like that because you're just going to get pounded on by the media all the time now old out back him did an interview with ESPN over the last couple of days and snippets of the interview of come out and\nThe first one that came out was friday evening to wear O'Donnell back them questioned the heart of the New York giants a question why can't we throw the ball twenty yards down the field so on and so forth another piece came out on Sunday when he was asked about whether or not\nHe blames Eli Manning or it's ... fault he said I don't know\nSo pat Schroeder responded to it on friday he said well I Believe it's more of an execution thing\nWhich is basically we're giving you the right place you're just not do it in the right way so you had this back and forth going into the game and it looked like through all of that you were going to win the game and instead you lose unease sixty three yard field goal so old out back I\nWas talking with the media afterwards the interview he did with ESPN and the criticism he gave his teammates and possibly as coaching staff was brought up\nAnd here was the post game without backing\nPro trimmer was living with you and I don't know ... ...\nI don't think they have this report you are on things that have\nBeen on my heart honestly since the other thing is they've been on my heart [noise] um and I think all the stuff that was both of us are just kind of came out on the wrong way I'm In touch with him and I are if I can have a minute to talk to the the um because\nFor like we don't ... if we're not all on the same page if it's not a senator and real and we can all understand each other then there's going to always be with you and fish so I'm able to do that was big for me I was nervous to get up and ...\nAnd these are your brothers and you see every day but once it up there in front of all of them so little nerve racking so I'm just excited about the way we pull together I'm like I say we\nUp short but we refer to the oh regret anything that is\nReady that was the recap there's this comments afterwards your take away is what\nMy my takeaway is he's frustrated and um I think we do this is only a matter of time right like getting his contract was one thing but still ... is a competitor\nAnd I think he's frustrated with the lack of their team's ability to get them of all even though today\nNow that wasn't the case I mean he was living wide receiver got targeted fourteen times you know twice as much as the next guy so he can't be that frustrated with that I mean in an held her if given the opportunity to throw a pass for a touchdown yeah which might I add\nYou think the media is anti Cam Newton the media voted him MBP the media voted him a Heisman Trophy winner there is no more welcome narrative because the media voted in for the two most prestigious awards run in college and one in the NFL so you're going to happen try another route that they're just against like no not ... not an accurate pads jog\nGodly weekdays ... eastern known to man he's much more well rounded song mocks our character called break we claimed trap and\nI'm not a hundred percent sold the patriots being back even with Edelman coming back even with that often starting to show a lot more ... I only get even very good for the patriots so big time swing games the next two weeks for the patriots we'll find out whether that ate and ate prediction that I talked out has any possibility of becoming the truth\nObject that coverage with the ... tribe and they say yeah I mean there are three I'm putting it back on Fox Sports radio [noise]\nThere are so many things that go on and you want to give you the best information who are you and what are you doing to check the number that\n\nBoy that make you smarter feels like college or if you've ever met when you're wrong\nDon't tell your

[noise] seems more loose did about like\nThe old he is he's got weight lifted off his shoulder yeah right yeah something something ... shoulders but yeah definitely for sure man\nOh yeah it looks a lot lighter on his feet um yeah no doubt it's a totally relax\nYeah very much for for it I didn't make a comment because I have a feeling that rush up my thoughts on that yet but we'll just cough into the Mike if we're right I have no idea what you're talking about [laughter] All right\nOh by the way we are uh brought you buy discover become a new card\nMember and discover card will match all the cash back you burn\nDollar for dollar at the end of your first year learned more discovered dot com slash match limitation applies Sunday Night Football the Houston Texans are they tend to fix lead over the Dallas Cowboys five and a half minutes to go in the first apple keep you posted on on that game as it develops throughout the course of the game I'm let's talk ...\nDid I Will I Will take full responsibility for that awful pick because as it stands right now they seem like they are all over the place you've got Mike mccarthy you've got Aaron Rodgers maybe taking shots at each other in the media\nVery very frustrated Aaron Rodgers seems like he's finally getting around to being a hunt or at least close to a hundred percent based on\nYou know being off the injury report for the first time this past week but still the Packers team lost out there on oftentimes\nIt's crazy to me too how like Jimmy Graham just hasn't been a more integral part of their oftentimes\nI'm ... and think about this like as much as we were talking about the the Green Bay side of this look that Patricia now after that week one blowout placid New York jets with a rookie quarterback say absorb all those first start on the road after that performance they've kinda figured it out they've got a subtle did\nThey beat the New England patriots\nTom Brady they've beaten Aaron Rodgers the Green Bay Packers now and I think\nYou have a radio nine or game they they probably should have won the nine or ... they were closed and I came on the road after that Monday Night game\nYeah and and I think this is a team that's by no means you know complete as far as what they're they need on the roster ultimately be competitive but I think as much as it telling about you know how the Packers looks so for early on 'em and just you know again like\nThey're making a more concentrated effort of giving me grab involved I just I don't see them having the same type of impact like isn't he wasn't he's supposed to be the Jodi Nelson cut a ten touchdowns you know per year type guy especially the red zone where they'd end up you know throwing high pointing them you're throwing us will jump balls letting him high point the football\nIt's it it feels it feels off at this point like there's something about it that's not working I just I I Wonder about Jimmy Graham um is she a little overrated do you think as far as what we ...\nAbout those years in New Orleans when he had Ninety nine catches and he had a eighty five or more catches ... consecutive years three straight years but since then he's never come close to that um he went to Seattle that was supposed to be like a big pickup for the sea hawks and I remember him getting injured one year\nAnd he just he's not he's not been close to that and I just wonder if maybe we over value what Jimmy Graham really is maybe a ... our expectations of them just on a reality at\nThis point I think it's two things I think it's hard to replicate what a lot of guys do and and playing with Drew Brees and Sean Payton in the system in New Orleans that's hard to replicate and then the other thing is is she never developed\nI mean you could say what you want about other tighten the fit into his category that are largely a ... a wide receiver first before they become like that guy who can really block\nBut I remember playing with killing wind blow out a lot of point in his career in Cleveland and then later on what the jets and one thing that I I think he came to the realization of is you know he needed to improve it is blocking\nAnd he might not be the guy that you're going to run to his side right if you go to Todd in that one on each side he is not the guy you gonna run to the side but he'd be much better on the backside cutting off\nAnd and he realized that there's other examples of that too I think as far as the guys like Sonia gates who was a former basketball player much like Jimmy Graham who is is a better what blocker past pro which they typically never use them in past protectionist\nRabbits Kelsey that you brought up earlier\nRight and it even him he's you know progressed I think as a run block or you know that's just something that we've never really seen from Jimmy Graham and Seattle was the best example of that because that was an off at the system that I think had he fit like more what they're doing now we'll display\nHe could have been really productive he probably would have had a good amount of touchdowns maybe not\nWith what they're trying to do and and that's where I'm curious to see if it's going to fit with Green Bay only because you know they're not run into football well\nAnd and I kind of look at what they do want to utilize the tight end it typically is in play action pass it typically is sometimes some of that those the boot action and all that\nAnd you know if ... can't be that type of guy that could do any of that stuff to me it's just it's not as valuable as just a guy who's got tremendous size right because they've got some other tall wide receivers now so that they can they can kind of put it to the ... who are much faster getting down fields\nHere was Aaron Rodgers following the Packers lost in Detroit on Sunday\nYeah it was a couple couple of real bad ones you know I gave him a ten\nYou know we must feel rules obviously and turn over on the one you're online you put on together a lot of points we gave him yeah you know we missed some opportunities are definitely just joining game not planning for no blood often than not to know and again and\nLet me ask you how many times when you were playing football or maybe even you do it now to where you look at as our team is currently constructed or you look at the off and they run and do you think damn I Wish I had that huh\n[laughter] probably probably August question because you're playing for the brown [laughter] you know and I think about it [laughter]\nAll right so every single day okay look through the [laughter]\nOh man uh I think yeah I Would have thought hardest thing or is is you see a lotta quarterbacks you look around the league in what we talked about a guy early like Matt Ryan that Ryan has had pretty much\nYou know everything for the most part since he's gotten to Atlanta um he he had Ronnie White he had Julio Joes now for quite some time Tony the adults and do what's that Tony Gonzales Michael J. ... turn or a ... always been pretty solid the divisions gotten\nA democracy framing the backfield seven Coleman you got all these options and now they got Calvin Ridley and it's like you know he's always kind of had\nThat that really perfect and everything else out around him and\nFor a couple of things one it helps the quarterback get into a rhythm better because you're pointing at a faster pace it's almost like playing basketball right and distributing the basketball round applying at a faster pace like that the other thing is he's got control he's the one out they're calling the plays that he wants to run based on what he's seeing\nSo that might be a reason as to why he's better off in those scenarios or when they play in the know how to him and pick up the temple um the other thing is of course there and Rogers is aware of of what are the teams are doing and what's going on in the NFL every single week as a quarterback\nYou go and you watch other teams and you kind of goes through their system who had a big performance you didn't like I can guarantee you this every single team every quarter back room on their off they on Monday or a doctor off there but the day after the game they're going to come and they're gonna wash Kansas City\nThey would've what India.Arie is doing they wouldn't wash this patch homeless guy I can guarantee you that and and the only but sometimes watch some some college taped to see what other plays and things they can steal you know you always to the NFL's copycat league for that reason\nSo he's well aware of what works in in other ... other teams that other systems is well aware of all of that and that's probably the frustrating part is saying why can't we do more of this and the one common denominator now now the jokes opens back because her office coordinator they got rid of it as a quarterback coach Bradley Van Pelt right\nThe one common denominator has been Mike mccarthy so because of that\nYou know I I think you're sitting there probably saying to yourself\nOr that's where the frustration comes from is they've made all these changes that he was not down with\nAnd he was upset by and they're still getting the same result and it's it's not really him it's the fact that they don't do enough creative things on off and they'll get other guys open or do was doing the NFL right now\nAnd it makes sense like people can look at Rogers and say he's being you know he's being ...\nThings and you can afford those same nice things and you you have the capability of doing that and you could probably get away with a lot more because of how good Rogers is but you're not and you look so stagnant like if you watch the Green Bay off as compared to Kansas City or compared to the rams or even you say a team was not as good as any of those teams offensively\nI'm telling it looks outdated it looks like we've been seeing the same thing over and over again and I just I don't know if if it's Mike mccarthy just so used to having Rogers that he didn't feel like he needed to add that many elements to it\nBut man the clock is ticking I mean getting out there right I mean how many more ... can McCarthy get before the ... the organization says\nHey we're wasting an all time talent here we've got one Super Bowl appearance to show for it and and the prime of his career is starting to slip by it and also he's getting injured every single season I just wonder when they're going to pull the trigger on it\nYeah this this may be a decision where like number one we saw the the Broncos move on from John Fox and they brought in Gary Cooper back and it's like well John Fox got to a civil right they didn't win it\nBut the ultimately knew they needed to make a change if they were going to get back to when when one\nAnd and that's what it says that they made and honestly like as successful as Mike mccarthy has been you got a wonderful organization like Green Bay or accustomed to that than they are measured by lumbar to use if that that goes through their mind like much like with the ... movie out for our Smith is there were like well we we've won that division\nWe've been to the playoffs at now about trying to get through a Super Bowl so yes we know we can be successful outstrip much like the Pakistan with by McCarthy\nWhat do we make a change to go to Patrick hose 'cause we're still like we have a higher ceiling do they make a change and go with another head coach 'cause it my thought to have higher stealing\n...

had the potential sudden like this are occurring this season but here's the tough part it's a bad trend that\nBasically Oklahoma has been in the start of the football season so if you go back if you go back through the beginning of the season and you look at for example the total yards given up in every single game it's it's kind of telling\nIt actually rather astonishing because what it ends up showing you as they've gotten worse every single week they open up with FAU they gave up there and twenty four yards right not too bad pretty good actually we do three hundred eighty three to UCLA\nThen they go to Ames, Iowa they give up four hundred and forty seven you could see the trend here now army they didn't give up more than foreign forty seven yards but they give to give up three hundred thirty nine yards on the ground to a triple options in which has to be the most they've given up and God Knows how long maybe forever in Oklahoma\nThen they get right back on track versus Baylor they almost gave up five yards for Ninety three and then this past week attacks us\nFive hundred yards\nAnd here's the deal it's not like Texas coming into that game was one of the most explosive officers\nSo when you when you chalk it up this thing's training in the wrong direction for Oklahoma and I don't think they can afford to do that and you could go back to last year and look at their stats\nAnd and kind of see the fact that look just the team that struggle to get off the field on third down I Want to say they're giving up like forty two percent or something around that which ranks like Ninety eight in the country okay for a top ten theme or what was the top Seventy him\nAnd how about this every single time it seems gone the red zone from this year they've scored points so in college they do a based off your goals and touched down\nBut um if you look at their touchdown percentage eighty six percent of the time they're given touchdowns\nThat's the part where you have to say it you know it it's taken too long a probably to make this decision and you wonder if if Oklahoma potentially it's cost themselves a big truck championship depending on how this plays out\nOr you don't I mean I don't think that a move like this will get made it Oklahoma unless Lincoln Riley would at least have the conversation with Bob Stoops his brother I I don't think that that would happen I because Lincoln Riley\nAnd Bob's do have a ... I'm assuming they have a pretty good relationship right he basically handed him a a a successful college football program yeah okay so I Would I Would think that that would have been a conversation they had like I think it's time we've got to do something we've got to move in this direction but what is [noise] I I heard Albert Greer\nUm say something ... dot com and he was on Fox Sports radio on friday and he said that Lincoln Riley is considered\nNot just in college football but in all of football NFL in college a top five officers of mind in the world of football\nWhen you see the current trend of young brilliant often said minded coordinators getting had coaching jobs in the NFL what's the future of Lincoln Riley is he will not for long at Oklahoma or what's happening there\nAnd do you know this could be a scenario it's kinda like David saw were like the grass and they look greener and I'm sure a lot of opportunities and just pads on what opportunity [noise]\nUm and he had other chances to become a head coach even before he went to Oklahoma you don't you go back to his time but he was the off as a coordinator in ... east Carolina\nHe had the chance to be a head coach at the smaller schools buddy wait at this time and then finally it was after I Wanna say twenty fourteen where you had the opportunity then to go to Oklahoma and once they burst honesty and like people kind of got the sense\nAnd and they're getting this was all speculation like complete speculation so ah you know this isn't from it\nI'm twenty Fifteen and twenty sixteen people got the sense that like hey if if we don't do something now like if I was going to go somewhere else would be ... it'd be a coach like that that was the concern\nAnd you know I don't know if that had anything to do with Bob stew stepping down or not um you know there's a there's a whole lot that probably went into that\nBut I kind of look at it and that's that's one of the things that run through my head as he was getting pressure from the University of saying like look\nWe want to give this guy and opportunity we want to lose them we feel like if we don't get this job you know it's not gonna work out well for us Neal maybe similar to a levee Smith cutter\nType scenario yeah yeah almost I mean I don't know if it centered around the quarter back quite as much 'cause you don't have an investment in in a college kid besides a scholarship pride and you've got these guys stacked up behind one another I mean ... is just that\nTalented or dynamic is Baker Mayfield is I mean you could probably be the case of the better athletes I\nMean how many guys get drafted top ten and baseball and then also can be in the conversation for Heisman Trophy as well and then statistically do exactly what [noise]\nYou know bigger did last year and it ties me campaign so\nUm you know you use your ... they've stack these guys in a row but what the question becomes you know would Lincoln probably want to make that job if I don't know a job like the Dallas Cowboys came open\nI mean think about Jerry Jones like you don't think you know the shots are getting a guy like Lincoln rally of that job came open if Jason gear and the cowboys don't get the flash and don't make some noise um what about the Cleveland Browns\nDay I'm Patrick [noise] we have not I am eastern six specific on Fox Sports radio\nFled the overreaction in January\n[noise] when you\nOverreact we've re I\nWent to school on time pressure west\nThe NFL is going down\nTheir boxer shorts radio he runs apps\n\nTo find out fast one on your TV show to Fox Sports dot com for detail\nAnd why [noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\nWe haven't Jonas ... Fox Sports radio [noise]\nComing up here and just a couple of moments we could be a major change a quarterback for one NFL franchise will tell you who it is and who they are contemplating that according to ... when I hear momentarily on fs are checking in on Sunday night\nFootball we have a hip to pass the interception\nBy the Houston Texans who were trailing the Dallas Cowboys Thirteen to ten the tax and now the football on the thirty yard line any first intent was seven minutes and change to go in the third quarter they used in trying to get on the board either tight or take the lead on a turn over\nYou know what the best part of that whole sequence was as we went back and looked at it and everything else and we and we looked at the the flow of the interception which uh I'll say this\nI'm not rooting one way or another All right in this game I don't think that should be considered interception I think the Reid used the ground to help him kind of a crowd of football and but I digress they're they're calling the interception\nDid you see the slow motion lips of Prescott where he's like they're kind of like ...\nPlay that it was like he was like you know ... like I don't know it's hard to describe but they played it in slow though it was like the weirdest thing of every scheme of things through the course of it at us all games don't make this awkward not if you were\nNot I'm not man I I like I I'm trying to think about they gear play by play to the radio it was really\nGood trying to blow bubbles with your mouth it's like doing that but they they played it in like slow motion it was just a really weird I don't [laughter]\nI'm not sure what to make of it\nThat well it'll it'll turn into a gift a in a hurry I'm assuming oh yeah just check it out social media in about twenty minutes but I Will say that um it's better than the the other a picture that made a made its way to the Internet Internet involving deck Prescott a little bit better than that I mean dream Andrea jak that jak\nOkay jak\nPrescott made that one that one made the rounds didn't get talked about a lot but ah but yeah why is that I'm ... I'm not sure to be honest with\nYou I don't know what can I give you some credit though what's that because if there is something that you love talking about it at any time of Snapchat or any sort of social media photo or or you know picture message that gets out there leaked on the on the Internet you my friend or the first to talk about it and you will not let that day it listen ... what do you\nHave some people go on here and they do surface research right they they they scanned the surface of discussion when it comes to sports and they're not willing to go all in and really do a deep dive on certain topics or certain athletes I Do a deep dive\nSo we're talking about a quarter back in the NFL and then ten minutes later a picture comes out and it looks like he's got a duffel bag between his legs what do you want me to do not bring it up on the air we talk about it\nIt's called the deep dive bra\n[laughter]\nWon't do part and that is yeah OK okay today and it's something between you and Volvo or I I'm just mad like this stuff\nLike if you want to just do box score radio then we can do that it'd be very very boring or we can talk about everything in the fire and\nI Wish around talked about the fight this past weekend uh do you want to talk about that I'm not sure what to make of it\nYeah it's I mean it's not that much of a surprise I mean when it was people who watch us the expected McGregor I mean it was a bad ... and plus you know McGregor looked like a guy who hadn't fought in the cage and two years that's what it looked like he was out of shape yeah I mean he hasn't fought in two years and then your first fight back you get that\nGorilla that you've got to deal with like ... is a dumpster\nI was talking to was shot Evans before the fight I talked to him last week and I just asked him I said ... and there's other you proud that as a hobby or do you have to actually it and I don't know anyway a bead we'll have even her monument off\nThat wow that was impressive [laughter] um but he said he'll be at ease rolled with them a little bit he did some ... do he said he feels like a two hundred and fifty pounds\nHe's he's like what did he goes I don't know how he does it he goes he feels like he's the heaviest person for his way clouds\nI've ever rode with or wherever you know a grapple with and all that he said he for was somehow just knows how to use his body 'cause you got that wrestling Brett background though the thing that killed me was the skirmish afterwards and that all about all because of the pre fight you know press conferences and all that yeah\nIt was very personal and then you had Conor McGregor is corner who is yelling stuff up the ... and he jumped off the cage and he attacked him and jumped out on the floor and and it turned into this big skirmish and then you add I'm a ... ...\nPeople jump over the cage and start a sucker punch in Conor McGregor and the only reason those guys didn't get a rest is just kind of refused to press charges but like people are talking about what a black guy it is for the sport man I I Can't believe that they would behave that way after a fight oh so you can't believe the guys who make their money injuring each other\nOne is to injure each other more after a fight you can't believe that\nIt's which after they've been going through months of trash talk and personal shots and it's this sort of heated confrontation and then we get shocked in disturbed when something breaks out and into a fight in the crowd there was a fight between the Irish and the Russians in the lobby if\nYou ever gone to a boxing match there's fights in the crowd all the time you know it's a different sport man it's it's not golf\nIt's one of the reasons why I actually I Do enjoy going to boxing matches but I I actually that's one of the reasons why don't because it seems like for whatever reason it is the most contagious it is dealing with you really want to be the guy next to just start punching [laughter] I don't have no idea why\nIt's just that that's how it works and I've I've been to a number of fights that every single one uh I felt the urge to the person next to me felt the urge it was just ... and then you witnessed them\nLike walking out of some of those arenas too especially on Vegas it's like everyone gets packed in there and people step on each other's you know white boomers next thing you know there's there's a fight breaking out and it's\nIt was all split on because you know fired up watch vitamins I felt\nWas shot at you yeah it's it's very ... who it is that a shot at me the white promos yeah boy you're wearing white who was not an All right now I Can't even let me see I Can't even see that far no not not right now something in the way I can see All right I'm breathing Clinton Jonah knock zero revolve around [laughter] [laughter] you know other room of art so [laughter]\nSo but that that it is possible with them I'm All right so I Do want to get your thoughts on that so we're discussing a you lie manning and his struggles as the Giants' quarterback so longest pass completion of the season for Ely manning was earlier on Sunday and it's forty yard\nUm I mean we've got backup quarterback every starting quarterback got a longer completion we've got wide receivers and safety is who have longer completion this year\nHe just it doesn't look like he can get the ball down field with any sort of consistency and older Beckham was critic\nManning is the problem he said I don't know I'm\nPat charmer was upset about it oh del back um apologize to his team afterwards it just sort of all over the place but\nYou can't deny that there is an issue with Eli Manning at this stage of his career to be able to\nProduce at a high level down the field now you cover college football you do it for Fox you're one of the best in the business you breakdown tape you know all of these guys at the college level this is this next year and a lot of people thought it would be this year I Would assume is\nThe year depending on where they pick that the giants consider taking a quarterback as the heir apparent you lie manning who's out there who makes the most sense for ...\nWell ... there's a number of guys okay I don't know that any ... feel good about are talking about um in that regard as what we saw from this year's class so I'll start by saying that\nUh drew lock the quarter back out of Missouri he's the one that is interesting he's put up a lot of stats but um I think when you watch um throws it just got a lot of ability um I'm just\nAgain I I'm trying to think of who I could have it compared to I haven't been able to take a deep dive um to to find like an NFL cop\nMonday she says Monday Night guys a Redskins at St so right so we're going to set the over under ... four hundred and Ninety nine and a half for career touchdowns by Drew Brees rights for Ninety six going into the game five hundreds of miles stone so basically we're sending a three and a half or his a touchdown something\nI don't you when you said four hundred and eighty nine and a half I thought we were going to talk about awkward a peek into the booth featuring Jason when I about that when you\nAdd on camera it's fired off we are sorry about that I'm\nSorry it seemed like he doesn't know what to do with his hands like I'm not trying to make an hunch going on we Bobby it's just it's weird yeah um but some people are better using their hand some people aren't I'm All right so foreigners over four hundred and Ninety nine and a half yards rather charger security guard foreigner Ninety nine and a half yards are between the ... between both teams\nOver three to try to understand you with it but yeah there and a half or CDs for Drew Brees midnight\n[noise] so he's approaching five hundred touchdowns and it'd be the under and I don't think he does diversity and the career passing your\nOh no no no you you heard I don't know where you

CDs in their game next week to cheat you mean ... yes a little touch that yes we have the power station last week downs guy down sorry\nYou know we've already sounds like something you know [laughter]

I like that where you go ahead or campus yeah but it's it's never going to happen you know crazy\nHere's a here's a note for the ... do you know how many football games are played in the cotton ball anymore\nI've got you got to tell me one day it's like one or two they had a whole gay and I was there it's a the a and that doesn't have the best amenities let's say that\nThey've upgraded quite a bit they've they've worked hard to upgrade so kudos to them and they put a brand new field down so uh if they've done a lot of things to keep all your taxes there but I normally that's\nNot in the middle of the heat though that's all\nI did I Know who I Know even when it was kind of nice at times yesterday was still right in the middle of the heat that places just to get on an absolute Santos so\nWe got a lot to get in I Know what you want to start with this Sunday Night Football game or do we move on past I Do we start with this and oh by the way we could add too much sports misery at the Dodgers were to lose tonight as well\nToo I Wonder what five nothing I'd I'd written them off but uh I'm like well maybe they can still come back in this thing that you know it's it's six five we'll see if they can I just think up\n... first what one out in the top of the eighth inning trailing six to five with key key\nKeeps me here in the end as at that point I was talking about the cowboys right now and let's talk about the Texans not a great Sunday Night Football game but we're tied it's competitive cowboys you've got a few breaks a bill O'Brian has not had the best protection for the Sean watching tonight or any what's called dry in the Sunday Night Football game so\nFar you know what I ... it's pretty much as we thought these teams were the cowboys really are not going to turn the corner and make a run I mean obviously the division a is pretty wide open but I have a lot of confidence in this team you can see that the fences stagnant\nWith way beyond bell he deserves to get the huge contract but he really should be angry with the NFL players association I think late ... needs to come back no running back in the position in this league that I hate to say it but jury expendable\nYou're listening to the odd jump off when Chris Broussard Enron Parker thinking about that that doesn't mean you're more be able to get back on TALK sports radio [laughter]\nThrowing up the ban\nAnd let George gold colored fly off\nMore bombings on a crack in three years [noise]\nThe blaze lamb right now I'm\nTelling you my bold predictions for college football this year I had all the action that may scream\nYour team they're covered right here on Fox Sports right now I Am\n\nTo find out fast one on your TV show to Fox Sports dot com or details tap tap water\n\nInto your girl a planned New York city manager I mean like I'm Out of ... out the little man Miami bill it's already a blanket on Fox Sports radio he's the secret junior store and expand your on Chris brought you buy discover card thing which do you how you like you'd at you\nOh I Know you have to leave I Will truly treat us as if we're kind of your a side show while the games are going on tonight and we'll keep you up to date we've got a Sunday Night Football game is coming down to the wire nodded between the Texans\nAnd the cowboys we've got a baseball where it looks like the Dodgers are going to pull this off they'll go to the nines or six five bottom the eighth right now to out to the Braves leave on a solo homerun by Freddie Freeman and\nI don't know Arnie looking like a potentially over time or do you think the Texans will have an opportunity at a game winning kick here\nI'm watching now so I ... they've got obviously get about about thirty forty more yards I'm not sure exactly what they are but it started down and they have no time outs there's only twenty seven seconds left it\nIt's going to be tough I'm surprised or if Diallo stops them hey I Want to see if they call a timeout 'cause they only have one left to see if they want to get into position I was twenty seven seconds will be interesting\nSo ah another thriller we had a a ... you know I saw and tourists who aren't he's with on Saturday nights tweak this earlier and I agree and we've talked about this a lot for all the conversations about our ratings were on a roller coaster and they are the NFL's in trouble\nAnd nobody cares anymore and everyone's mad about the\nUh the anthem protests are or whatever narrative you were trying to play out on the I think from a product perspective now we'll we'll have officials debates and we'll have wrapping the pastor calls but through we five I one of our conversations hasn't been boring games or\nYou know outside I mean I'm raiders fan so it's been awful but ... I feel like we've had a great game you're never going to have top to bottom you\nKnow sixteen great games every single week or if there's by you know fourteen Thirteen but man on the I think there has been some great football so far and twenty Eighteen\nOh look this has been fun and and now I'm just starting to stop you or because of the Texas were coming down and getting a position for a game winning field goal they only had\nSo the cowboys may have a chance to get in the field goal range with ten seconds left him there one time out Chris oh sorry about that I was just checking that out I I thought for sure that Texas rather way down there to kick the game when he feel gal\nHere's the problem a Arnie speed is well ahead of mine [laughter] and ... is it ahead of yours too or was it ride on whenever that went down because volvos are diehard category ... studio that well what I Will I Will say a geek [laughter]\nI'm a I'm going to say this I've actually been quiet I haven't spoken to anybody ... they are not even ... I and I haven't said anything already happened\nGame and I've been really frustrated me there's been a ton of bad calls in Iraq again and it's some that are just when the announcer say something about it there's a problem but what what makes it so bad is after the game when they come out of what we see that\nMaybe it was in and it wasn't an interception there's nothing you can do about it because the game is in a book like that stuff I Can't say what I Want to say yeah suck [laughter]\nLike you suck like we got ten seconds now to get close enough or feel go well one time out like a yeah\nYeah so it it's ... it's been frustrating from officials perspective a perspective a lot of uh I mean the the browns got an apology from the NFL them that their car fumble last week you know what what good is that do form\nNothing they still lost the game but they came back and won a thrilling finish all he was a lot of fun to be before we get that finished do do do you agree with me or any do you think we've had good games or am I just so hungry for football I'm starving guide you give us often cracker too\nUm I don't know if this is any better than it was like it's not sticking out like oh my goodness this year so much better than all over the years that we've done the show so\nI'm you maybe it's because it's the most recent um but you know we've had our share of overtime and maybe that's why you think it's been better we've had over time games every week since the since it started in ...\nA record setting off into numbers this year you are you ... I don't know if you saw the stat or not but yeah but that ...\nThat set the record setting numbers that's not because the fences or better that's because of the rule changes we've made it so the fences can score more\nWeight ... so do the numbers are better\nBut below the numbers are not better when you ... when now they give you automatic first downs for hitting the quarterback or you know defenseless receiver and it's Fifteen yards you're not getting those numbers on the outfits but you get the first down and you get to keep the series alive in and continue to go on\nArmy offensive numbers are better in the NFL I don't I don't know if if you're trying to say that it's all because of penalties or not but that's not that's just wrong I mean yeah they've changed the game to protect the quarterback and as far as\nHis what'd you haven't quarterback just got better all of a sudden from last year this year like Seventy five percent of the quarterbacks all got better well\nI'm not saying that they regret asked but I mean I\nMean my my point is I think all offensive the games open up a little bit the uh from what I understood is the NFL is usually a couple of years behind ... with college football does and you're starting to see a lot more college football tendencies in the NFL for the last few years and it's opened up scoring in a week now\nDoes the officiating and the games are called have much to do with it [laughter]\nI don't know if it has as much as you're trying to put on it I mean I I just don't think that the ... the pastor rules are the reason why we have such big scoring numbers this year I ... I got a bonus up\nBut it's not just so roughly I don't know maybe I'd have to go look and see if there's more pedaled leaves this year than they were last year it seems like they are\nOn or you know and everything they can to fish shady wise I don't mean to interrupt you but they're doing everything they can officiating why should try to open up the game now I Would argue with you on that\nYeah well I mean ... I think we have more complaints about the officiating miss year that we've had in years past I mean that's obvious and it's not so\nI think if um I I just\nI think the NFL has been a great product this year I really do I I think everything about it has been fascinating you're going to have your series of bad games\nI Would love to go into a deeper dive on exactly what we give credit to because I think we could have a hell of a debate or a conversation on it but at least as it stands outside of what we watched tonight on Sunday Night Football office has been king we're going\nTo over time yes we are I mean the Texans and the cowboys Dallas had a shot a on a Hail Mary late but was that the Andre Hopkins got up and bad about down I think it was they at Hopkins in defensively and he went up in ...\nDoubt you ought to explain to me why you're watching the football game instead of the Dodgers game got both thought gumbo I'm just like what's he doing what's he doing\nRight Jack Peterson a ... at the plate Dodgers trailing sixty five top of the ninth inning or they trails fives zip in his game in a coup a grand slam off Walker dealer who by the way oh my goodness credit to walk her ... her\nFor rallying himself because after that horrific start dude ended up giving giving him what seven innings and settled down for that from their six and a third so pretty good uh bounced back but more than ... theory on that when he was go head\nWhen he gave up the grand slam the grand slam kept him in the game he already given up one run if he walks the next guy edits to nothing Robert yanked some\nAnd he's out there right there is is out of the game when it's two to nothing grand slam five ... did they go out with it I'll just keep her bed merit and does it make it if it's we're not going to win that was the mindset\nGod that's brilliant Arnie you're absolutely right because it would either be death by a a million cut\nStart paying a lot more desire through it and then they obviously he worked his way through it quite well sorry I I have a topic that we need to get into tonight because of all the things that seemed to be a trend in the NFL today\nAnd that I did everything but laugh at point that the kicker before the ... ha ha isn't that what they did the top them see before you get to the game what do you feel go I Would have laughed and pointed whenever they try ... there was no doubt in my mind he wasn't going to make that case no doubt\nAnd what did he do absolute nails oh it was\nReal ... now you'd out I was ready to read I quit my job if he begs is\nI Want to add another team for the biggest implosion slash biggest to choke of the day we also have land oc up ... ah well that's the season I weigh a [laughter]\nI'm Still looking forward to my predicted it Patriot's falcon Superbowl if you get one of them right in the other team ends up with the number one pick in the draft is that is that I mean I got an app right but you couldn't be more wrong with the other one is the way\nIt's like any have credit teachers give have credit on something like that but I don't I don't have credit nice school what are you talking\nAbout I don't think that works in the batting and picking world but we'll diverted that when we come back so I'm adding a fit and maybe a six team to our biggest jokers today we're already at play here on Fox Sports radio\n\nThey leave in ...

I don't know but but again this is a good guy story so you you can imagine the Denver media is going to be all over this over the next twenty four to forty eight hours\nBut again it shows you how through a couple of weeks you can't get a good feel this is the second year in a row where you had a two and a team and people are feeling good about it right home they lose three straight and now\nThere's something deeper only look at Tampa I Know they're on a pie week this week Juno fits magic he's not even a starter anymore it is so hard in this week to week lead\nTo be as consistent as you need to be and here's a great example of what's going on in Denver I don't know if that's just absurd I Survived this he said today he's not making any coordinator changes but you got to put them on the hot seat right\nYeah well I mean if you think he's the uh number one to be fired I'm I'm not sure that's the direction I mean obviously\nHe is asking you said he's on a hot seat on oily young\nBut yeah of course yeah of course he's on the hot seat there's no doubt if I was going to do my top three or four hundred CD he's certainly would be audited there's I mean how can you not beyond ... last year after what happened last year he should have been on it after that start at that collapse of the same things up and go all over again\nSo is dirt cutter number one on the list than the bucks coach or know are we not in a position where we'll see a mid season firing this year we go to that that that's in trouble yeah ends up saving his job somehow\nI think they're a cutter saved his job and they got off to a to an old start with magic I found out it was why was I wrong about that that I saved his job a little bit

what they forget is the process\nAnd what they forget is how many people on Capitol Hill or at least bid on Capitol Hill respect the process at one time\nOkay just little nit picking mhm I Know it was it was a good battle to win it's not the war but it was a good battled wet right\nUh I just hope for the next Supreme Court justice and and I just hope they start laying the base now that the Republican Party stopped calling the judges conservative judges mhm\nYou and I've gone through this before we talk about how we even have got caught saying it just because you know it it's a ... but they're not conservative judges there is a complete and total difference between what conservatives wanting the Supreme Court justice and what liberals want\nMhm or we want a Supreme Court justice that has an originalist or a ... you know and or construction it somebody will look at the text of the of of the constitution whatever it is and say it says this and I'm not going to read into it\nIrrespective of whether it hurts my day to day politics\nA Supreme Court justice putting them into office was not about my day to day politics it's about upholding the constitution of the United states it is about the legislate short making laws and not an unelected the judge\nTo the left it is about an unelected judge making law\nThat the one conference and one college conference and talked about you know a a federal judge making policy and then got caught and said oh ah no we're not supposed to be ... said that and uh they really don't do that and we went out there you go you got caught\nYou know that's the whole thing they ... they they wish them they want the liberal justices in there who will make law who will ignore the constitution and when we\nAre as conservatives and when the Republican Party\nAs Mitch McConnell did a few times when he was talking he would respond to your ... where would you like to conservative judge sure I'd like more conservative judges and I'm just going to know because that's what keeps and I know it's going to be political to the left either way but remember\nReject a presumption of innocence\nAnd we'll lander and the fame somebody's\nCharacter without evidence to do so yeah\nAnd I think a lot of I'll tell you I had a conversation with independent Bob yesterday boy he was renting he was you burn in my ear\nAh because ah as you said you know and and I've talked about independent ... for years and used to vote for Democrats he's sort of tell me how I can never vote for democratic get ever ever when I'm being told what white males thanks as always wrong and white men are always evil and women are always to be bullied because everybody knows that's not true right\n\nThat's where they are so we'll get to that or by the way last year it was getting rid of the electoral college by the lab we told you the next thing would be getting rid of the Senate they got there because of all this now ... [laughter] ... ... a reporter who said you know basically it's time to get rid of the Senate\nSo have you ever to the electoral college go to the Senate the pits our entire narrative that they actually hate the constitution of the United states and where I actually don't like the United states because they want to change all the ...\nDo you want to pick us go to judge win the presidency hey let's get back to Russian collusion\nWell it's about time there's a couple of Russian collusion stories out there but but not the Republicans were Trump colluding with the Russians by the way no uh wow\nLeft is really going back let's bring back home and Paul for prospective see that [noise] yeah well why don't we first see how many of the protesters there that's goat is on the steps can\nIdentify Colin Powell through a picture or tells you buy given his name if they're given his name\nWho he is or what he's it was back at that guy that was mainly for the national anthem to write a plus a tropical storm Michael heading to the panhandle of Florida well the latest updates on that plus your calls and comments if you'd like to get in lines open now eight six six Ninety read I\nRead a book report read are ready to do with a record ...

is a pretty good breakfast you're not even\nThat didn't happen in fact Hillary\nHad a net loss of life doors and Trump had a net gain after the election after the election because these people don't live in reality they don't look at the facts and anything\nThey don't they don't care about the process they want you to believe that that the process is that they flap on their Superman Cape and they're going to be a hero in a moment\nAnd it doesn't happen that way you had a situation in the cabin are confirmation process that was while it was distorted if you look at it the President Trump was the one that really made that happen in terms of extending it out\nSo there was a supplemental background check\nThere was zero zero credit of course and he wasn't looking to get credit\nBut the people he wasn't looking to get credit from the the media or the left of course\nBut the people the everyday people look at it and they'll they'll look back on this process and go well one of the you know what is it that the the ones I I mean that don't follow it every day and we know people work and some people work around the clock and thank you for listening and you don't take it in\nOn this and they look at the facts of this by doing just simple research and they see that it was the president himself that allowed to process it was Chuck Grassley\nThat allowed her to testify it was the Republicans that gave her every single chance to prove her case\nAnd she could not\nThat's the reality of this whole\nNot that the you know the left wants you to believe in the protesters in the ... and the baby's\nWant you to believe that it was the Republicans who squashed it nope they opened it wide you could not have given them or her\nMore of an opportunity to come in and prove her allegations not not to the fact that she has to prove them like a court of law but just something just to set off the answer to a preponderance\nOf the of of running of the the evidence\nSomething to back it up and she couldn't do it now\nAnd neither could neither could re mirrors and and if you look at what was actually done the uh there what what didn't what did we find out the only thing that we didn't find out\nWas Ford who said that her\nThe the uh the note and whether she had video whatever the polygraph done and the therapist notes would cooperate what she said and she refused to turn them over right it's really the only thing that we don't know in that because she refused and her lawyers refused to to turn them over everything that we now\nI mean there there is and if you can point to get to the the as the FBI said we only we know that you know we know that are not ... but when the ... uh came out and said that ah you know that her lawyers\nYou're twenty people we wanted to interview well that's not the point the point is they asked her directly who are the people that you say are witnesses to this action\nThing happened in that case and none of them said anything she had plenty of time to talk she could have gone back to the Judiciary Committee or Dr Ford could and she never did\nAnd with those notes you could've answered them over a nearly well it was two weeks ago when the when the Judiciary Committee and the chairman as fast for them right because\nThe the story came out that she and her lawyer through her lawyers were offering those therapists notes to the FBI\nThat's interesting that we learned that after we learned that they weren't going to interview her in the supplemental background check that really is convenient\nOh no we're we're willing we call them we were going to give them you know I haven't you knew there and they weren't you have to come\nTo you know had plenty of opportunity or are they would have simply taking them and given to the Senate Judiciary committee how were they were not going to make a judgment on it they would give it to the Senate Judiciary committee ... and the Senate Judiciary committee would have gone over would have gone over then right\nThere isn't anything of substance that the left has on the ... the only thing that the left has is again and it was ever changing\nYou always believe women well unless it's a conservative woman\nOr a you know you'll ... you'll never believe the you never believed the uh the the man you had white males and the Senate Judiciary committee but when it came to the substance of the actual case\nYou know of of the political trial because that's what it was it was a political trial people say it was just a job interview uh yeah you uh don't involve the FBI in a normal job interview and uh you don't put people under oath\nUnder penalty of perjury for the average job interview so if you're saying it was just like an average job interview or you're a little bit of you are a little bit mistaken it got down to the point where all they had was an allegation and they believe than an allegation should be enough\nMhm really\nAnd then you've got to the point with Cory Booker well or does it matter the whether he's guilty or innocent doesn't matter it's just there's so many allegations right that he should step down because yeah that yeah so then you get what you want you to multiple unbearable hide right allegations and that's enough for somebody to step down nothing that\nThe left are brought up nothing that the mainstream Democrats brought up we need to make sure the right to clarify this because we always get those well that's not just the this was the mainstream of the Democratic party right and that's what they were trying to get you to buy\nThey were trying to get you to buy that the allegation is enough\nThat up a woman says that in this case it must be bully not in other cases but just this particular case it must be believe now I Know that they generally said oh woman must be believed but then the women that said well why don't you believe you not say just conveniently ignored right\nAnd and so that's what we're being told that the preponderance of the the the presumption of innocence uh uh you know doesn't exist uh for for a man or defending yourself in a passionate way shows guilt mhm\nUh everything that they sure while does not pass the rational thought or critical thinking test ...\nNone of it and it was from again I we need to repeat this this is not the fringe Democrats this is the main stream of the Democratic party it is the Senate it is the Senate Judiciary committee it is the leadership of the Democratic party\nAnd they're trying to get you just to throw away any mind set of due process right\nWell as we saw even independence\nThey couldn't cooperate it will then know\nConfirm yeah and and that's that's it I mean if you look at the end while it was a a fifty to forty eight vote if you look at the process from start to finish every opportunity was given to the accusers\nUh the the process was even distorted to that extent so in order to facilitate that and then ultimately it came down to what while I was voted along party lines\nWith with what two exceptions really and then other than that that's what it's always going to be and it doesn't matter that it's Trump as president it doesn't matter that it's kept when I was the nominee is where we are as a nation politically right\nNow if Trump wasn't president if it was somebody else yup and he was Kavanaugh was up there yet it would've been the

get rid of the electoral college in the next step also was to get rid of the Senate\nThere you go yeah yeah well you can ... a reporter at NBC News ...\nAh over the weekend on Saturday\nIt may not happen in our lifetimes but the idea that North Dakota and New York get the same representation in the Senate has to change senators representing less than half of the U.S we're about to confirming nominee opposed by most Americans\nOh I don't know if that's true because I saw the poll but was across America that showed a that uh if the FBI did the investigation that sixty percent of Americans are in favor so I'm right well\nI guess they're doing it on the population of the states are represented the yes\nCertainly represent the population of the United states\nRight necessarily oh that was that was his point yeah uh but you know when when we we've talked about this for the longest time that\nUh and we started with freedom of speech few years back when the lab came out and it was the big thing that you know corporations and any group people should not have free speech writings mhm that their free speech is only for the individual\nUh but gun rights or for the groups right [laughter] for the militia but not the individual right and we said no the the bill of rights ah is\nAh about the individual and groups of individuals because you have two people does not mean that you lose your freedom of speech we heard you know the the argument that on freedom of speech while a cause they decided to stick to corporations even though it would have evolved or a ... as we know I'm\nA McCain Feingold also but you know a encompassed other groups but they said a corporation is not a person mhm nobody ever said the corporations that person but the corporation is made up of\nPapal mhm a corporation isn't a person because that's like saying\nUh our work where we work today where we work right here is not a person you know it's a radio studio in a radio show but there is no persons mhm yeah but we're doing the show yeah yeah yeah I Know but but but but you're not studio\nYeah but we're the people are you and I really wish that they would go in that direction because then we want to be able to tell anybody that we don't have to pay our property taxes because property\nIsn't a person my house is very lazy ... won't pay its taxes right it won't clean itself up either it ... it was a dumb argument because as we know a a corporation is\nAnd doing away with yours and we've talked about that battle that's also doing away with the freedom of religion because your religion is bigoted\nIt it needs to go away completely because we disagree with the freedom of speech while we protect that when it's\nA it's our group talking we don't want you to be able to talk you don't have freedom of speech example California used the wrong pronouns\nThe penalty mechanism in the law includes\nUp to one year in jail yeah freedom of speech they believe in eight six six Ninety red

you can't get into our mainstream them that this is not this was not the radicals outside with a sign these people making the actual decisions and the president did not find that they might have been

George W. Bush or anybody else that came together in most dead on the right ah for judge Kavanaugh's confirmation\nAnd it really was about\nWhat the work and and and the results of the work of this president by nominating Kavanaugh but also the Senate or more importantly and more recently uh the work there\nAnd why it's important for Republicans in this case right now to be banded together a because it used to be where we could have the discussion will still have them I'm sure of the you know the far right conservatives on Capitol Hill versus the moderates\nUm but the end and one of those moderates along the way would include a Lindsey Graham\nI was just going to I was just going to um mentioned that that we knew that three weeks ago mhm that the left was motivated because I hate Trump right uh I don't know how much more motivated they could get I don't know right this royal debate the more or whether there'll be a\nA whether there'll be more of a sign of of despair and hopelessness we know the young people and I haven't seen a change and that's to young people that vote Democrat are are not enthusiastic about voting in this mid term ... and that could hurt the Democrats\nBut what I Know now know is that the Republican Party you mentioned Lindsey Graham you look at look at Lindsey Graham ... and the fight to defend Trump and his pick yeah because if you are defending his peck your defending Trump right there is a unity there if you see that George W. Bush or read that called Collins numerous times\nOr to tell her how to a vote when you see the colon speech\nYeah and and except for ... rarely ... there were some things I disagreed with her honors and beach or like when she gave a\nWe got to this point to begin with and to say that I Know that she would never leak anything like that is forgetting about everything else that she did wrong and\nUh but the fact is Collins speech was very very thorough walked through every single a point and came across as very very common sense and this is Susan Collins defending the great Trump pick\nOf Brett Kavanaugh\nUm you know you can only fight so much within your own party before you realize it's working against you and the things that you wish to uh uh get done as a Republican the Republican\nIs real party right now it's a pretty big party it's a pretty big party going from conservatives to moderate liberal really is when you come when it comes to spending culturally\nUh probably a more right than they've been in a while\nA more constitutional is when they brought in a while when it comes to social issues not spending issues are there as bad as Democrats have been in the past ah right now and you know and and that's a shame but overall when you look at it\nYou have unity in that party\nAs I said last week like I Can't remember when we had shut unity part of it is the fight or from the president but the president has always had that fight in rhetoric\nBut in substance you know when some of the people that he picked and how he would change his opinions or a ... on them and not stick with them and you know even you know going after sections as he still goes after them as he did others\nEarly on major thing okay doesn't really know who is picking doesn't really have confidence in the people out there and hymns sticking by Kavanaugh\nWasn't just rhetoric it was the substance of no he stays and we're going with him and I don't know whether that\nThat drove Lindsey Graham to still be on the Sunday Morning new shows saying he'll GO Campaign anywhere in any purple state yeah right ... you know and that's it ... because\nThat's where the effort has to be we can still have the discussions within a the right\nOn issues of where we need to go especially putting pressure on them to control spending\nTo change fiscal policy\nOr to the extent that it is going to be meaningful and mean great things long term for this country I I think we are light years right now or to say that this kind of momentum can get to that point where we can change the spending habits I mean for Republicans\nAnd their mentality on that is is not there yet we're we're probably a ways from that\nBecause that goes back to again what we said the based uh the the rank and file Republicans and and what they want out of their government but again that's a discussion we can have\nUltimately what has to happen though and this is this is you see this to some extent on the lap while in social media and in the protests calling out or or even officially the calling out of a Dianne Feinstein I mean before this process the uh Democrats of California you know not backing her officially\nA for her run and that kind of again that's there's that's an anomaly\nOften on the left they are better than the right at\nLetting the uh mansions of the world\nAnd even maybe a high camp uh uh do what they do in their state\nBecause it gives them the seat ultimately on other end the vote on other issues I'm On the right there has to be I I guess a greater unity politically on Capitol Hill\nOf beer\nAgainst the kind of behavior we saw over the last few weeks they're just not this kind of behavior is not over they believe they almost got there they believe they did change the process they do believe they can change the process and other items if they get a head start which is why they start with well we need to do away with the Senate\nAnd we predicted this at the moment they talked about getting away with a good well in a way where the electoral dollar the Democratic senators won't before they know that it's not going to have you know it's not right now but the point being is their behavior is not going to change and they'll work to that and and\nIt means if the because of they're willing to you know to talk about and and maybe even get some kind of movement growing movement and the calling for doing away with the Senate which again will never happen\nThey are willing to do and and work in any in every direction to do away with this and that and those little things and that guard has to be built that tower that castle if you will that wall that ... has to be built around this nation to protect this constitution\nCan get a few things done if you're

innocence right due process constitutional issues not defending somebody when you talk about those are all ... ... moral issues\nAnd that's what has United the Republican Party I Hope it continues to unite them through the election and if they are able to take the house it'll be interesting to see if they can take that unity into two thousand Nineteen in two thousand twenty\nAnd get legislation passed\nThat is extremely productive and conservative and hopefully give Trump a chance to win in twenty twenty against state yeah\nTax deal done that's when they got that legislation done they couldn't get it done before they lost that seat when they lost that seat that was motivating it shouldn't have been they should have been ... motivated before that eight six six Ninety red eye\nWas

I think it is about the fact that\nYou have the as I've said why'd I think Washington Examiner said or a quarter of Republicans or identify themselves as socialist a quarter and a half a Democrat but a quarter of Republicans and I thought to myself you know that shows you how wide the Republican Party is\nUh right now and this and the anger and the unity comes from the fact that\nThey listen to a Democratic Party and the mainstream of the Democratic party who when you listen to it you're not talking about the fringe anymore you're talking about the mainstream leadership those in the Senate

legitimize McCarthyism thing good and I think I can survive in South Carolina is\n\nWell you know the thing is is that uh I think Lindsey Graham needs to get off the [laughter] that was what he really thinks first of all I think it is going to be a positive if he's campaigning\nI'm a second of all I think the momentum from the from uh the uh the outrage that he delivered a there on Capitol Hill that day\nI think will I I think that is that needs to be carried through but not just through the election not just through the mid term election\nIt needs to be carried through in that attitude needs to be carried through a on important things that that ah that matter beyond that including a legislative items and other and and who knows what kind of her nomination process we may go through a while a Trump still president\nBut uh you know making some very solid point\nAh the lead was going to you know they used to it when it's convenient that's what they do they point to the right ah Lindsey Graham and the you know since Trump has been president anything that doesn't go along with you know any comment ah that that counters the president the left wanted to use that\nAnd and and\nReally kind of a position Lindsey Graham\nCan that John McCain was and in some ways he was but of course you're demonized now you're Hitler because you stand for something on its merits you stand for something based on the behavior of the left and your outraged and rightly so\nWell you know the thing is and reading Frank Bernice column in the New York times that none of it relates to the actual\nCase what he was talking about there is it's it's about the fact that Lindsey Graham has had differences with Donald Trump right and you know in Trump is you know been in a Trump has been mean woman called them names and things like that and there's been an animosity between the two and therefore\n[laughter] somehow Lindsey Graham shouldn't be taking Trump's side with Trump's candidate I mean it\nReally doesn't get what we said earlier this whole cabinet thing wasn't about Trump it really wasn't a Bernie doesn't get that and I don't know I have to go back on and and count the number of comments made for or against Trump\nOr from Lindsey Graham but Lindsey Graham's a when he issued his concern that day or a week ago last Thursday\nIt was based on the lack of merits of the case and the ... and on the larger are much to a larger extent are pretty much the treatment of Kavanaugh by\nThe Democrats and and not the not the liberals with the signs outside\nRight the Democrats on the committee\nFrank Bruni has nothing to the article he's got nothing well he's angry he's yeah they're they're they're wrong as I've said as we discuss this for the last two and a half weeks we didn't have any one\nThe mainstream media or the Democrats to say that the position that I hold and you hold which would be similar in this particular case to Lindsey Graham yeah where is flawed at all\nExcept for rhetoric and bringing up other things that have nothing to do\nWith this case with this\nNomination process with the witnesses and the allegations that came forward every single point that we had made\n\nWhich are the same what I can see is Lindsey Graham are all legit and the oldest is going to drop him nuts and moral and correct\nRice and you're wrong and reading Frank Bernie's column in the New York times you're a simple pin Mr Bruni\nTalk about the actual things that\nLindsey Graham brought up go point by point and say any of the things that he said we're wrong you can't do that because then you'd be lying to\n\nThem I mean it is again a the they just lack the will to have the debate they don't have the debate you can't have the debate so they end up ... and ... what Lindsey Graham said on that day so they do what\nWell they used to be for Trump now he's against Trump that's basically the gist of it right\n\nFrom their world absolute loyalty is expected as we've said in the real world it's I like this candidate for this don't like him for this older right over there that's a good nominate that's that's\nAnd people with rational thought Mr Bernie can do that\nI can say that there are plenty of times I disagreed\nWith Lindsey Graham and John might in the future you are you running for attorney general right [laughter] what ... what do you want to hear it in general what are you trying to get out of ... exactly ... well that's it\nHe's only doing this well again that's because you can debate the points that he made the only point you have as he was against Trump and now he's for Trump we've we've said with the simple ten you know are arguments that will never\nAnd I called them simple to an arguments because they never directly go after\nThe the particulars of an issue that we are discussing they always try to bring up side issues that aren't aren't even a pertinent to what you're discussing\nRight\nAnd you read Bernie's telling me like what about the allegations made that they're not wrong you're just saying he's kissing Trump's fought to become a Ernie general yeah you have no evidence of that you're not contradicting the points that he made your simply saying he's making it and he shouldn't be making it because\nHe was one of the most fierce anti Trump hers and now he's agreeing with him and if you disagree with Trump you must always disagree with Trump which of course is hogwash\nYes yeah it it it is and the insanity of the left and and again uh they ... well ... it's funny because they used to uh pretend to be the site that had\nThe greater intellect [laughter] still trying to tell you that they are no they don't but it is the ... they keep going for the low hanging fruit and and the and and really the brunt of the

Bye bye\nAre forgetting his name out there and that you could see I think ... part of that and you have in any case there that was that was him yes you have in any case eliminate because ... they're getting the the gang rape that yes you're right that's clear yet right\nRight right I the only possibility of parents last I don't think it is you wouldn't want to put it is a good buddy ...\nThey already see is yeah yeah you know got tempered problems I wouldn't want them to think that they're good at issue in this in spite of using invited to do this for a spy and\n[noise] yeah well they you know it would be ... it it would definitely play out in terms of the spin on it it would play out\nUh in every ... up predictable and even some are unpredictable ways we can we can try and come they use our imagination to come up with things and and thank you a market for the call we appreciate it and and I think a fair point or question\nUh he definitely would have standing as you point out Gary and pointed out during this process\nUh you you know you were into the political arena when you accept the nomination or as the capital capital did\nAnd and so you would have to go out of your way to prove that malice uh but in this case of 'em are judge or that wouldn't he wouldn't have that burden\nBut you you do wonder about you know I guess the future of claims of this these particular claims um and really the only one that ... that survived at all was Dr Ford's claim\nAnd and it it appears they do not want to pursue that any further so that's\nWhy I'm ... and I think you make a case that that his name was released because of the leak and so Jessie wasn't trying to link\nIt to the ... a a media but in the ... in any case yeah to me that would even be a ... and again\nDon't know who leaked and so I I don't know I'm just I'm On the doctor or right I'm just using right that that is a possible exception here right ah but with\nAnd those things are made of politicians all the time right and there are public figures for the law used them differently yeah but if you're a private citizen you're dragged into it\nAnd you're being accused of a gang rape mhm biking drinks you know things like things like that or you just you can't say you just can't go out and print that right ... and say that about people right especially private citizens mhm\nBecause then you've got to make your case it's the worst probable cause while I think it might have happened\nThat's not good enough no no absolutely not so and they could just do ... personally\nWell I mean well because [laughter] were the case the claims that were carried out and how he pursued this what role did he play in pursuing this in the media pursuing this and charging you a ... in in filing to the New Yorker sworn statement\nThe New Yorker\nAh for publicizing it and and and publishing at that and you would have a case at least to the extent that while the New York times went out of their way and interviewed dozens\nAnd couldn't find first hand knowledge and may be in this case it would be responsible decision not to pursue the story and compare that are forced to Abu ... he's a ... and of course the New Yorkers printing of [noise]\nYou can make a difference by serving people in need the society of St Vincent DePaul provides the chance to live your beliefs by helping those in mean\nOkay Dianne Feinstein live that way she has a spy or a at a chauffeur\nWell I Believe that there should be an investigation do I believe that yes of course right I I I Believe there should be investigation they are not so I Would agree with you on that\nAnd I believe they have done it in their promise their their ... I Believe they are promising that there will be an investigation they want to look into that\nBut they never make that charge of any kind of Hillary Clinton was\nAnd that was the only guy that was combing who clearly was politically driven and and that's something you couldn't control in that moment right\nWell do you expect the the Democrats to stop doing any of\nThese you know with I don't know why it didn't get them but\nWhat does this behavior get them ultimately in twenty sixteen mass of loss\nIt is but because of the reason Gary that they bring it up on Capitol Hill that somebody in elected office would bring these up these items up on Capitol Hill because\nWe used that about uh you know if you go back to uh the email thing with a with Hillary or even back to lying about been God's the which wasn't enough itself a crime although it should be but it isn't a you look and see what exactly what we've said\nIs that on the email specifically on the email or investigation and the whole no reasonable prosecutor would would uh prosecuted\nWe said well it what matters hears the court of public opinion what you did and ultimately she lost in November or twenty sixteen and and thank you for the call it is not\nAlways that that and not that she's above the law or we believe they should have pursued that but I if given a choice\nHaving her in jail\nOr is not as great as not having her in the White House\nKnow here's here's the uh the the the point about four to ... maybe he was responding ... sparks Nevada was responding to\nWhen we were talking to the last caller about a mark judge following a defamation of character lawsuit mhm well when you when you go after a private citizen you have to at least have some type of evidence that this happened\nA he said she said all of a of a private citizen can get you into trouble that still might not go to the level of perjury perjury as you would have to prove you\nYou know or it was you know I you know I I don't I'm I'm trying to think of when you know somebody has been hit with defamation of character right when it's something that is just so obvious can't be true mhm uh and and so my point was I I don't know\nThe doctor Ford situation is there in the realm of possibility she's committing perjury absolutely sure yeah uh any things in the wrong because we don't know we don't know anything about it because nobody can collaborated so we don't know what she what she wants to it's proving it\nAnd and our point was is Eric just said that well there are costs to the Democrats lost twenty sixteen uh there there may be repercussions here in this upcoming election where they don't ah when the seats that they should be winning\nA in a first term of a president in the first midterm afterwards that almost always the party in power loses seats ... that may not happen a Supreme Court justice was\nAh was confirmed mhm uh and United a pretty fractured Republican Party so it isn't always that your punishment is criminal\nSometimes the punishment is criminal as for Dianne Feinstein though a and Clinton as we explained Clinton wasn't the Republicans and\nHe'll do if you're angry that justice isn't always done all I can say is this from our point of view the most important things to get the truth out there yes that's what I Want I Want transparency I Want the truth I Can't do anything if the majority because one of the reasons that Hillary Clinton\nWas never charged is because there's a majority there's probably half of America even if they knew she was guilty would wander charged right sorry but that's just\nAnd it doesn't matter whether she committed a crime or not they don't want her prosecuted\nMhm and so the best we can do is get out the truth and we know the truth about Hillary a worry we know I'm\nA ... for example Susan Rice sure probably lap when it said she said you know the ... that she would like to ... she would consider running against Collins gives me you're the one the light and I'm ... now it wasn't a criminal offense but it was still line\nAbout a terrorist attack that killed Americans and every one\nIn the United states knows its ally right everyone in the United states you could take them and you could show them the law that Hillary Clinton broke right there you could read the law\nAnd and everybody would an agreement that is what she did and there would still be half of America that said so what you should be able to get away with it and can't do anything about it the best that we can hope for\nIn any thing is that the truth is told I don't know what's gonna happen and the FBI investigation right\nI don't know if it's going to show corruption it's now in the inspector general hands Michael Horowitz you and I talked about this it's the one story that's been buried completely over the last two weeks ...\nIs that when Trump said okay we're you know we we we've got a couple of allies that don't want us to to relieve some of this information and ah I was so we're going to give it to Michael I have an eddy we went that doesn't make ... we're going to give it to Michael Horowitz from my ...\n[laughter] don't give it to my colleagues Minnesota them and they don't have the [laughter]\nYou do give it to Michael Horowitz the inspector general you and I said to each other this was on the air when we went to ... because it doesn't make any sense why would they give it to the inspector general the department of justice if if they want to figure out how they can release it and and still\nOption ... improprieties right oh\nYes and and that that story has been buried and analysis of that story's been buried by the mainstream media why would the president not release it immediately and give it to the inspector general of the department of justice because he deals with corruption\nAnd\nSo we don't know what's going to happen there but get us the truth and if the American people if they get the truth and still decide to do the wrong thing that's on them yeah and that's\nThat that's really what it comes down to is that\nUh we've been calling for transparency on on all of it the whole Russians scandal thing\nWe said multiple times regardless of where it falls politically as long as that is fully transparent and the process the American people can decide\nUp because we can't change what people do it in the past nobody can not even the people that did it\nAnd my question would be that if the Democrats took the house do they really really really want\nAn investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is that what they really really want from three witnesses with no cooperation at all who stories were slowly and sometimes rapidly falling apart because this is this would play out in the public\nOver and over and over

caller said you know just play just placed on but you know their antics and their own words as we've been saying for years so that for a year yeah and and and and just demonstrate that\nOver and over and over again and how hurtful and destructive it has to this country or for about the last ... who I'm\nGoing to say six seven eight years you and I have been saying that it's never been easier to defend the\nConservative ideology in our in our lifetime because of where the left has gone I guess I can also said that it's never been it's never been easier\nTo run a\nNegative ad campaign

seen the last\nTwo weeks you don't have to be as a Republican you don't have to be caught in any\nVery important where the main stream of the Democratic party is now not the fringe\nBut the main stream and I think that one of the things that I have seen a and it's anecdotal evidence or to ... to to figure out what all the polls mean and how it's going to apply in four weeks I don't know\nBut the one thing that I've gotten from independence\nIs they look at the Democratic party right now and they say oh my God what in the world are these people about there is no sense of of fairness\nThere is no sense of stability right they don't ... they don't care about it you know taking taking somebody and destroying their life\nAnd and I mean I've heard this from from independence on both sides mhm that they destroyed for life by not keeping it secret then it went on to try to ... to destroy\nA habit all his life on both sides but it it seems like the only thing that matters we don't care who's lived we destroy we don't care what promises we break we don't care what we do we don't care whether we don't care about a presumption of innocence we don't care about giving you anonymity we just want to win\nAnd we will do anything to when we will demean we won't\nPlay fair and I do think\nThat there is something here that is even outside of the normal politics that we go through every day that this isn't going to be a discussion if this goes in favor of Republicans\nThat which means you're going to get a lot of independence that that ... mood in the Republican you know direction it's going to be not be because of ... okay will what will Gorsuch and cabinet do when it comes to regulations of the EPA now it may matter to you but I don't think that's what's going to drive\nWeeks where people look at the Democratic party and say these aren't fair people these aren't reasonable people\nRight and I think you look at it I got to be honest with you the protesters may be driving the left but they're driving away mainstream America\nThey'll let me think that they're winning because the protestors are out there getting the attention for them and that they're they're jumping on in in some cases they're bandwagon and their claims the fact of the matter is\nThat's not the case with middle America they see the behavior of the protest it's not to dismiss a claim\nIt is in fact to do exactly what was done in this case and to properly\nVet a claim to the extent that the president came out and ordered a seventh background check and that rationally gave Dr Ford her time on TV in front of the American people to make her case you know something\nYou just part of a great point there because I when when I was giving my explanation there I wasn't even talking about the protesters you brought up the protesters and I think the unique thing that we've gotten to the point now where there's no difference in ... in many of the public's mind between the protesters and the mainstream right politicians they're saying the exact same thing just\nThey're saying that it's it's not like you can sit there and say well those are just a crazy protesters no because the crazy protesters and the Democrat leadership of the Senate Judiciary committee are using the same argument\nThey are they're basically ... the the arguments and and claims made by these protesters and their tactics [noise] I mean look at even before we got to Dr Ford hearing the doctor forty hearing what was the tactic being considered\nThe first day the weekend before the first day of ...\nBy the way we're that go nowhere\nBecause they had nothing is Democrats always do these days it wasn't about challenging him on his position on on a roll the weight or anything else it wasn't I mean it was for Republicans with Sotomayor or Kagan\nYou know what do you think if the government you can the government force you to buy vegetables and you know that that was the question based on of course a parallel to Obamacare\nBut that the left doesn't care to do that anymore so they co opt the claims made by the far left and they have become the far left the mainstream members of the party\nThe ones who were elected to office have become that because they think it's working Kamala Harris can go back to California and certainly get praised there\nBut the damage done by the kind of behavior by Hirono or and and her words and the others on that committee and their behavior\nAll of that\nCarries over into the election elsewhere it's not about her owner can say that and get reelected in Hawaii

I was correct the moon do yes and adulation he was confirmed by the slimmest the margins actually it was fifty to forty eight because there was one democratic senator whose daughter was actually getting married\nWhat are you doing do are horrible false statements to just sit does it get any worse\nA beautiful thing is he is now when\nHe's going to be there for a long time and he's just an outstanding\nIntellect outstanding scholar\nJust I just spoke to him ... minutes ago\nI spoke to the justices\nHas a he's a solar side itself [noise]\nWe have doubt just his\nCabinet are and he's a a terrific terrific person\nMight just congratulated him I said congratulations there was\nA well thought I mean who would've thought set thing like that could have happened what he's been through\nEverything was hung corroborated I Want to thank the FBI I thought the FBI was incredible they worked hard and they work really fast\nAnd I hear the report was\nThat was really a detailed sorrow professional records so I Want to thank them I Want to thank the Justice Department because they also they were working along with the FBI really hard really fast\nI think is actually the extra weight delay\nWas a a was a terrific thing for the process\nSo we have a great new Supreme Court justice and he's got to be there for many years we're very very proud of him and what he\nHad his family had to endure\nAdded to which are great testament editor testament also to our country\nYou know a lot of people will question whether or not his tenure on the Supreme Court will be\nTaught let some diminished in some way because of what happened but once again I I even if you don't even if you don't think that he should have been confirmed\nTo take a person who's given loyal service to his country whose government to his job to his family and all those things for all those years\nBases with no corroboration with no witnesses with with no court cases or anything is really really unfair and when we wonder why we don't get the best people to run for political office\n... exactly the reason I Am one of the reasons why interestingly enough [noise]\nAh I Believe it was published last friday the former dean of Yale Law school wrote an op ed piece\nAnd I know we don't have time to go through it now but an interesting perspective he knew a Brett Kavanaugh when he was in college right uh and as an acquaintance over the years but I thought\nIt was a very interesting perspective on the situation but here the fact that you know you have daughters in school\nAnd a wife a law of oh a long time ... and they're getting death threats\nTwelve or I'm not a corroborated unknown substantiated people saying bad things about you and that is not ... and as as Dr Ford\nHas not moved back into her home either know that this all play and certainly the blame does not lie auditor or do to people it lies with the way our culture behaves ... uh that's what it says and by the way a month later on we will\nHear from a defense attorney who not against Dr ... Ford but against the stakeholder I Believe in\nThe last woman who made the gastronomic charges of literally gang rape of this man yeah um that she might be eligible to have a lawsuit against her\nSubstantiated know when it's really just yelled out there like once again\nWe have all of our freedoms and the world but we still don't have the freedom\nTo yell fire in a crowded movie theater we have not that far off the mark so once again I say in graduate him I say he's got to be a great justice I was surprised down some due to the president was in that soundbite\nBecause we did not hear he will be the greatest the most significant the most on Bahrain the smartest Supreme Court justice of all the time we didn't hear that but I did hear something I've never heard from Donald Trump before and they're\nYou know that really urging yeah it was his New York accent coming out he called them judge Kavanaugh or\nHear that yeah yeah because you know for a guy that lives in New York all this is like\nDonald Trump is really the voyage of the New York\nThe X in um in some things yeah this is the big words like that like it was right in the cabinet or yeah yeah yeah so you know but anyhow so that say we got another just just on a Supreme Court and now there's a line where rod re listen they bring us today\nThe nomination but you know what she did she listened to the evidence she read the FBI reports and she actually turned that new voter after listening to the facts and ...\n\nTo sided because I felt that we needed to interview some of the witnesses that per pets or fourth sad for press that night and ... and she believes the sexual assault took her and I was the star that they had not\nClare state mountain so there was no cooperation but\nI pushed along with senators Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski for the FBI to do an interview of those individual Christine for this very compelling and painful testimony I thought oh my goodness ah he\nNeeds to withdraw and but then when he came back\nWith ... a forceful denial and the anger and and anguish that he showed\nA ... and then the lack of cooperation let me back to the fundamental issues that are fundamental to our legal system a presumption of innocence and fair I\nWant to say and I want to say that I went out on a limb two weeks ago and said\nWhen they do the next hearings ... that I Want to see him get angry about this because I Believe that a man who was in justly charged in that situation would come back angry\nAnd he did and many people did not like that anger\nWell one of those people was the former dean of Yale Law school while judge Kavanaugh was Mr Kavanaugh and was at the university right\nHere is part and only part of his op ed piece I Believe it was in New York Times and I was either published on friday or Saturday I happened to see it on Saturday or this on the weekend edition anywhere he hasn't and these are his words\nBrett Kavanaugh and I differ on most fundamental questions of constitutional law never ...\nThe point I Am proud of the rich diversity of views that Yale Law school has produced over the past decade Kavanaugh has been a casual acquaintance he seemed to gentle kind of quiet reserved man always solicit is of the dignity of his position as a judge on the U.S court of appeals [noise]\nIt was therefore with something approaching on belief that I heard his speech after Dr Ford's testimony and he writes I was shell shocked\nThis was not the Brett Kavanaugh I thought I knew\nHaving come so close to confirmation Kevin ... apparently cared more about his promotion\nThen about preserving the dignity of the Supreme Court he is by her to join even if he sought to defend his honor as a husband and father is unbalanced ranting about political persecution were so utterly inconsistent with a dispassionate\nDispassionate temperament we expect from judges\nThat one had to conclude that he had chosen chosen ambition\nOver professionalism I was in the end prompted to write this essay because on Thursday Kavanaugh published a remarkable op ed piece in the wall Street Journal in which he apologized for his rash words and attempted to reclaim for himself\nThe independence and impartiality so necessary for judges\nJudge Kavanaugh cannot have it both ways\nHe can't gain confirmation by unleashing partisan fury while simultaneously claiming that he possesses a judicial an impartial temperament if Kavanaugh really cared about the integrity and independence of the Supreme Court he would even now withdraw from consideration just one more part\nGot thirty or so I always say above the point is I think plain and simple if a guy doesn't get angry about his family's\nThis kind of behavior well then he's much much too but nine to be a

clothing some American companies have already announced the tariffs could force them to raise prices they include Wal Mart gap Coca Cola General Motors and me\nOkay well first of all it depends on how we react to it now what if instead now you mentioned clothing and I will talk about issues\nJust specifically be oh okay it's something that I happen to know about from where it started in words Scott the shoe capital of the United states used to be Monticello New York ... okay [laughter] we're just an Amish community and there were five different shoot plants there\nIncluding the largest in the world American shoes they are all closed down\nThere is the only industry I Believe still in Monticello is the hardest racing industry and an IBM a plant\nWas that the sign of the ... as a result of the sign of the times is that why they closed down and it has was labor became cheat with a manufacturing down to\nChina and everything else right no no not even after international trade China oh ... okay where most of our shoes are made in Indonesia or China okay well what is\nOkay we're saying that with these tariffs the price of shoes may go up let's say let's just make up a number twenty five percent that's down if again so now a thirty dollar pair of shoes cost forty dollars well\n... and get thirty dollars for him again which would be twenty percent profit maybe he'll take one of those old factories along the river the ... river that runs through Monticello New York\nAnd real ... plant\nAnd all of a sudden you could buy a forty dollar pair of shoes from China or you could buy a thirty dollar pair of shoes made New York now as Americans which one would you be more likely to do\n'em by the shoes from America right first of all they are probably better quality second of all they're not made by slave labor ... and third of all you're supporting the economy and the working class men of America certainly\nWhat if that happens in every industry what is the auto industry begins to move back to the United states\nI I Love where you're going here I support you one hundred percent however\nYou are not going to be able to make that a reality people will not work for

you yes who wouldn't want to try to figure out and to look ahead to see what things are going to cost and and all of that\nOh ... ... I'm I'm just saying that as much of a ... for to be successful\nThere's a a chance for to not be six I mean and I don't know which way it's going to do I wish I did um Kellyanne Conway had to speak up about what happened over the weekend of course with the confirmation of justice Kavanaugh\nJustice Kevin I should not be seen as tainted he should be seen as somebody who went through seven FBI investigations including just this last week another one that was completed this past July\nHad to answer to twelve hundred written questions had produced about a million pages of documents committed themselves to about thirty three thirty five hours of sworn testimony to the Senate including denying the allegations that were put before him and they should look at his entire record the way Senator Susan Collins did\nHer speech in her vote or remarkable but don't forget what she said in that that that some wind or of the speech before\nShe cast her affirmative vote she said she had been praised by Nineteen attorneys that she had read his opinion she quarter for his opinion is she said she's very concerned that we're giving up on basic principles that make America\nSo wonderful including fairness and due process and the presumption of innocence the Supreme Court thank God has sacrosanct institution that can withstand much and it will withstand the fact that\nThere were a lot of

you're about a democratic senator of Hawaii on your show she chose to shut off several weeks ago so many people in his job at\nThe price you know like additional nomination\nOr something\nOr yeah for sure for all we know that that's for sure for Ron this brings us saying\nI read it was just somewhere that something like\nA every nine minutes a person dies on the roadways in in the state of Arizona\nNo that can't be correct I'll see if I Can't dig day it that just seen every nine minutes would be six people in our that would be a hundred and twenty people a day that would be or the over five thousand a year no\nI thought it was wrong I thought it was wrong I mean I've been doing quick to incredible yes but but that sounds like too much to me\nI'm sure mhm and once again it to me too but right first of all there was something nuts we had happened here\nWe had legalized\nSelf driving vehicles yeah in the state of Arizona okay and then we had a crash in the greater Phoenix area I Believe it happened in Glendale I'm not sure specifically but it was basically in the inhabited\nPart of the city where in the metro area right where a self driving vehicles got a car accident and somebody who was in the car died\nWell they banned economists vehicles said no more we repeal all not they did not repeal the law will will agree while you're shaking your head\nIs this a different over more recent accident the one we saw with the uh it was a an optimist vehicle but there wasn't factor driver\n... no similar but but my point is far from the my point is\nThere are thirty six thousand deaths a year in highway act that way okay and all those thirty six thousand debts fifty percent of them are alcohol related well guess what\nAutonomous vehicle is going to be driven by a drunk\nOkay so that's an Eighteen thousand lives that we've saved right there okay mhm and for them to stop inventing and for them stop proceeding\nWith this this thing and there's thirty six thousand deaths a year in automobiles and there was one\nIn mechanically driven car out of however many are on the road I think that that percentage is highly acceptable if I told you the number of people who are going to die from a heart attack this year\nWent from three hundred thousand to three thousand where'd you care and I I'm not being mean about this for you know what I'm saying would you care why the three thousand died or would you say two hundred and Ninety seven thousand lives were saved\nNow yes that okay wait in line to Congress saying basically that we could cut the number of deaths on the roadway from thirty eight thousand this year to maybe ten thousand this year if all cars or Thomas wouldn't that be worth it\nI Know we're a little bit horny eight thousand families yes and with all R\nAnd D and experimentation things happened earlier as it gets that are all yeah I mean we've\nYeah okay I mean they're both acts that we had\nThese things well you never going to have her ... or ... you said from time to time is the human element once you bring that in\nUm is that you one hundred percent safe and bringing human into it and and and you know human factor and as you mentioned in that one case even in that case there were extenuating circumstances\nWhere the person who got hit\nWas not in a crosswalk it was that night and they were texting or on their cell phone I Can't remember when we got one of what a driver but nonetheless it was a person on a bicycle or erode yes yeah yeah you're still\nGoing to get some people killed it's a it's a four thousand pound car it's a

Larry Kudlow on Fox\nYou know you were talking to one of the great free traders are and the fact that he's there at the president's side tells you the tariffs are a tool to get to free trade his very being in the administration says that we've got to be prepared\nTo make China do what they said they were going to do I was a A N China a few weeks ago for the both\nWorld Economic Forum there\nAnd ah she came up and and he talks like a Republican tax cuts and ending subsidies and so I needed forty five minutes of a speech that nobody believes but it sounded great\nYou got to hold China accountable to what they say they're going to do not what they've been doing which includes spying on us it includes stealing our technology it includes bullying their neighbors it includes their military activities in the south China Sea\nYou know the the one interesting thing there's an old expression that in America we only do two things wrong at the presidential level\nIs what we do and what we fail to do\nAnd the last couple of ministry rations failed to take China on and now we're everyone's upset because this president's taking China on real I'd rather make the mistake of taking China on didn't make the guaranteed mistake of not doing it and then allowing them to continue to grow with a false economy\nWell that's what's happened they have painted themselves in a corner because now they depend upon that economy\nYou see why wouldn't they built it up and right now now you've got to go back to living on a hamburger diet and set an estate died and they're not willing to do it and once again I we we know that the Chinese you know in a perfect world\nWell you would have fairness and people wouldn't overcharge each other and we'd all get along but\nLast twenty five years the uh the level of greed just transparently green once ... once again has China as a loaded China has diversity\nThey don't get our news and they they sell all kinds of products but for countries let's take for instance Venezuela whose main import is oil\nLaramie import oil next oh oh okay and so as the oil market goes sodas that our economy because they have no other way to get it\nNot diversify or not diversify and so you can see the green there because it's literally was there or not they're going to have substance now like you have a country that has this diversity you think they would attempt to be more fair with their trade\nI don't think ... and ... is not even though that on the table at a young singer made they can say that we can pretend that but I don't think there has anything to do with it I think it's survival of the fittest and I\nThink guys point was well taken that you can either do nothing and say all this while or even to do something and not be as well why\nBut maybe it really is all well we're not sure or ride right bottom of the hour means it's time for me\nWhen we return with more stuff right here on St break us or\nJust before the tsunami role than they were standing obviously waiting to see it come in trying to run from it\nYeah it doesn't work real well doesn't no no no a salami is\nProbably the most horrifying thing oh I could imagine watching videotaped and the time that I spend in Hawaii a I was there for one the sooner army at work where there was a bigger earthquake in Japan\nOf course why and as it turned out it did not really reach us they got high seas for one day you know who I literally water surging in\nAt about literally a twenty thirty or forty foot wave of water coming through town can you imagine you know it's it's it's unimaginable\nUm [noise] I don't know and once again now they had just had this earthquake which made the ground unstable to start with\nSo this has been a triple header for them and all the people that are there it's an incredibly incredibly um horrific horrific story and five thousand dead if that's a government estimate we wonder what the real numbers really are\nI mean you know I I hate I'm guessing still well no no government wants to overestimate how many of its citizens died or so the numbers are usually conservative in nature if nothing else\nSo now the east coast is worrying about hurricane Michael do you have any thoughts on this you are always\n... story things one's gonna hit it's coming right through the Gulf of Mexico will probably make land in that Mississippi area I'm just east of a New Orleans by about a hundred oh the the two hundred miles maybe a little bit more to the east than\nThat's the model I'm looking at has that are coming in ... it's kind of like at the three three quarter point to Alabama Georgia\nUh the panhandle\nTo kick a little more easterly than they originally thought they're talking about it being in the Gulf of Mexico as a category ... storm we're lucky we're getting into October where the water in the Gulf of Mexico\nHas gone down about five degrees and water temperature that five degrees difference in the water temperature ah turns itself into about twenty miles an hour\nOf hurricane force winds so loudly Wendy miles an hour less than it would be if it was in September and about thirty miles an hour or less than if it was in August\nBecause of the water temperature once again the ... the the temperature of the water breathing its own weather source so we're seeing this when it makes land that will not be a category ... storm yeah well that's probably be a tropical depression but a lot of those people\nHave suffered from enough rain already\nOh yes and it looks as though according to the model that's the latest one once it hits it will travel through Georgia and right through north and South Carolina where they're trying to dig out and everyone that has those rivers are still\nOver there are banks and over their norms so uh and will not get better before it gets worse that's the sad part of that\nThat's for sure we have Monday Night football tonight on a much lighter note the Washington Redskins are going to

Kavanaugh was just to have their collecting the vote says Kevin would ultimately be confirmed\nBut this happened multiple times and I was listening on a on the radio I wasn't seeing it but I saw it was even more horrified\nAnd then when the vice president walked out he was a\nCritic by a booze and his is a by a great number of people across the street with me right now is rich Jones or find the newsman here handled in the morning for years and W. okay V. in Jacksonville, Florida\nOr one of our great affiliates welcome to Jacksonville hey thanks rich first off I used to even though it's Washington do you feel the anger and passion down here\nYeah I think you can I mean we haven't seen that kind of um an electric atmosphere at say like a town hall or at a campaign event necessarily so it feels like we're at a distance there they can certainly feel it and it certainly comes through on the radio on your show and many of our other shows are alive and local show a little bit later in the morning and and through the afternoon you can certainly hear that as well\nBut it also I think that the take away that we have in northeast Florida is the Florida Senate race is really really tight when you look at what some of the recent polling it's been kind of back and forth where Rick Scott held at one point advantage in July from a Mason Dixon pulling their based here in Jacksonville\nIt there was a little bit more momentum around the incumbent the Democrat Bill Nelson and he was able to turn it a bit too about a one point advantage so I mean you are talking about one to two points swings that will happen every month or so as a new poll comes in and things and for weeks now are getting narrow razor thin we also have a big governor's race here as well\nIt hasn't bled too much into that it would appear maybe in the ads but not so much in the campaign trail\n... just to add to the whole country's watching a Gillum is somebody who's had some legal problems over in Tallahassee he seems to be able to shake that often does that just got off the stumbling start when some comments he made were misinterpreted\nBut he may get a Republican since he's ready to wrap it up now was there a bit of a learning curve for the congressman I think so I think you know he's he\nFor the White House remember this and this was a running to replace Rubio but he really had not penetrated the state wide audience to be able to kind of make the name for himself and of course when Rubio exited the presidential race to stand just went back to his house seat and likely it that made the decision to ultimately run for governor would be really interesting now is\nThe impact that was due to become a hurricane Michael may have because the Tallahassee mayor needs to be Tallahassee mayor as the panhandle in the Big Bend area prepares for a possible hit and just dance is seemingly is play in the right political card in saying he's going to spend a lot of the activities this week as everyone prepares for this possible impact from a store right\nYou got to be prepared we see what happens in other cities when you have no infrastructure and when you're not prepared for catastrophes Florida seems to have that down but I don't want to get ahead of myself you guys seem to be able to react to notice a lot of these lines are buried here so in New York when something hits the telephone poles go down you guys put the investment and have a new\nYeah but I I Would say that we also have three damage and we have flooding which are big issues and storm surge is always the dangerous part of a storm I mean we get\nEven on TV and you see it on Fox News channel as well Brian where you see the reporters who were out in the elements in the wind is a big thing but storm surge is always the most powerful and flooding is that the greatest killer in in these kinds of events and so\nIt may not look as impressive as category two and three wins but it's the water it's the rising water we saw with Florence in parts of north and South Carolina\nThat can really be the deadly I'm a parts of these systems for the most part though we've had our run through these and last year was a really rough year in Florida and north east war with Hurricane Irma\nWell I Know one thing the president wants to come down and help out around the saying this and he wants to help out a Rick Scott question for you from what you can tell the president won Florida and that was the beginning of the shock that oh my goodness he might be able to win this thing and twenty sixteen but\nYet some people and Rick Scott and he or friends however is there a downside to the president coming here full voice vote for my guy\nHere in Florida whether it be a home a mar a Lago or if he's done campaign events it hasn't been a full throated endorsement that that maybe you would come to expect from this kind of campaigner in chief for\nRick Scott for example he's in Orlando today it's not a rally it's a sheriff's association and so a number and law enforcement are going to be there he'll likely measures right police chiefs are so he's likely to talk about Rick Scott\nBut I Wonder if the way that the Trump campaign and the Scott campaign of worked kind of at arm's distance from each other if that ultimately comes back to hurt the Scott campaign it's all gonna we're gonna sorted out in the next four weeks and will ultimately no one was or wasn't the impact of President Trump for its got Senate\nBill is instinct is to put his arm around them because they are buddies forbidden former business people who decided to get into politics and not take any money to do it\nThe negativity I heard is and you tell me if I'm right here the rich guys for work very hard at winning over the Hispanic community and things he does need attention to these given especially the the Puerto Rican influx after the the slamming of their retain they relocated here some are still here and he's afraid of losing that on the perception that President Trump is not popular\nIt takes a moment to remember Marco Rubio when he was running in that race for US Senate on the Republican side with former governor Charlie Crist there was a moment in that race\nIt was when Charlie Crist gave a hug to President Obama when he came to Florida to help the stimulus the Rubio campaign used the hug and they were able to see a huge spike in the polls as a result because he was able to rally the conservative base of the Republican Party off that one thing so you talk about the embrace\nWhat ... Scott is too close and too cozy from the perception with President Trump how might that hurt and penetrate women for example and Puerto Ricans and others as you mentioned you never know what that one moment may ultimately be used by your opponent and how that ultimately will play out in the eighties\nRed tide where he was forced out of a restaurant we understand\nBecause of protesters I how why use me because it's an easy thing to be able to put blame on something that's a really complex story to tell it easy if you've not followed it and you don't know the background of how this red tide situation ultimately comes to be\nEasy to be able to paint your opponent as being tied to it or somehow being blamed for it because the average person\nI talked to one of those points a T. N. K. I find I'm going to teach me the station [noise]\nTo congressman Gerry ... of New York and as a New Yorker I'm embarrassed that he's one of my congressman or but he came out and said this if the Democrats win the house\nThis has got to be thoroughly investigated I Hope it will do so to use on the Supreme Court\nAh and and the Senate has investigated than anything else\nWill have to go on the Supreme Court so the house will do an investigation on a sitting Supreme Court justice\nA shirt you want to keep politicizing the process you know have at it that um look the Senate Judiciary committee has\nDone an amazing amount an investigative work and frankly they they still are looking into more of these ah these ... claims that they feel like OK even you know we're we're going to\nAt least I'm do our due diligence on all of these so ah hopefully if he if he wants to be that he'll just at the Senate Judiciary committee and they can they can share their nose at that because they've already really done the work see\nI used to I just do the benefits anyone for them to do that and the you know you don't do political stuff but I just don't know if that's going to do anything except for get Republicans to the polls uh we'll see how well that\nThat's something we've seen this whole time and people on the right getting so incensed at the way this has been on just politicized\nAnd it was good for judge Kavanaugh it wasn't something that was good for a doctor for that what she said she wanted it is not what it was it wasn't good for the court and it wasn't good for America so uh that's not the way to go about this process I Hope we learned that if not I hope that that there are some people I Know people kind of screaming in the last maybe that's what they wanted but I don't think that's what the broad swath\nOf America how they want our confirmations to go now to the activity just a circus of uncorroborated allegations one after the other uh for for purely products at parties and race and so I ... I learned a little less heat from this\nYou know I Hope so I always say that I've been saying this now I think we're all everybody's staring at the edge of the clip and see that with no one survived if we take one more step so my hope is going to be a sense of decorum on the next justice\nOr maybe on the next polarizing issue there's going to be a sense that vilify and I think one of the first test is not villa flying we used to Murkowski or Susan Collins from making different decisions\nAnd Joe Manchin if Democrats want to be arrogant into Joe Manchin let us down and shame and all these things good maybe he'll continue to do that now he has no reason even feel guilty or maybe it'll just flip parties you have to look at the picture\nA look at the big picture but I Want to just tell you those protests might not have been organic I got the sense when I saw Jeff Flake the fact that the cameras rolling the fact that all these are all these people knew exactly what the senators were coming out\nThere was a script and vice news was showing the raw Thomas said this about this ... twenty six\nWe also some people who are organized and that moment with Jeff Flake on the hell we talked to one woman who works for ultraviolet who was paid\nShe helped steer people in the right way is to be able to to confront were paid there were people who are paid by organizations like ultraviolet to to try to harness that energy in a way that would make the viral moments that we ended up staying\nAnd the initial confirmation hearing to remember this isn't something that suddenly they go oh no there's been this allegation we've got to stop they had been opposing him from the get go some\nSenators even from before he was nominated said that's it that we can't have any one of the seat on the appointed by President Trump so uh you know they they brought people said they were people who were who were I'm taking\nTaking video of people being paid at the protests during the initial hearing two hundred people were arrested that wasn't just a a you know a spontaneous event that people decided to\nTake go to a whole new level of of disruption and I'm really lack of civility we shouldn't be having a debate about something is fine that's democracy but shouting people down isn't and now we're heading that I'm engineered\nFor TV kind of a moment but I I'll tell you there were a lot of people there I Know\nOn the other side I Know there were groups of women for Kavanaugh walking Hall's not paid and it's and and people who are taking time away from their jobs their families to come in and walk peacefully in the hallways\nAnd and kind of talk reasonably with their senators not shouting not trying to get in their faces and and make a viral videos out of it but let's actually just show our support praying up and down the hall so I think\nThere's um there's a lot of people\nOn both sides and this and we need to ... we need to just kind of return to a moment where we can have civility and not be trying to make this about the next spectacle\nOr Terry last question do you think you were there when justice homes there you saw the dynamics between the judge Supreme Court justice who\nDo you think do treat him differently because of the controversy became through the Kagan's ... for example might be an briar might be like keeping them at arm's length like the Senate has become in the house has become parties don't interact\nTo so called Joes a justices of different political backgrounds will they not stop interacting\nI Hope not\nPolitically charged and divisive case and yet\nThey know the people you're working with for the rest of your life does it's there's no point in making 'em unnecessary enemies and people forget 'cause we focus on the high profile cases about forty percent of the case of nature\nAre unanimous so there's actually a lot that binds the justices we saw that several of them were there for his um swearing in on Saturday that the the quick one so he could start getting to work Justice Kagan with their Justice Ginsburg was there and I think that's great even on an even on a kind of spontaneous for the moment thing because as they were they were\nShowing that um I think the court is not the rest of the country at least knows how to work together they don't show to each other to make their points they make refund arguments and then they sometimes persuade\nEach other when one way or the other that's how our system should work and I hope that um the court can it'd be a lesson to us of how to move forward as a country\nAbsolutely love we do want to see him go bears we writers wrote and I'm being sarcastic I'm just glad we've ruined his wife ... to cut down so oh well you you would you say that um\nI mean that that that that is the tragedy of what it seems like they're going full but hey you know what we can't block you but at least we can ruin your life um that's horrible I don't think any I I just hope that that is a\nNarrow fringe Americans who actually want our politics\nTo go that way but I think the best thing he can do now is to move forward to hearing like Justice Thomas and say\nUh you can't ruined my life I I I'm going to go forward and limit I'm going to live out my oath to uphold the constitution and uh that that will be I think his best final argument and that is to have a you know continue to sit on the court and\nBringing those ... those really principled decisions and continue to be the kind of even handed fair justice that that he has been on the news ... up until now\nA ... loving your contributions on TV and\nTwo grand of maybe forty five percent of the country when we come back I'm going to take calls for the first time one eight six six for all eight seven

historically you know moderate Democrats that are not part of this this less crazy thing and and right now he's sort of making a Democrat versus Republican and\n... and his policies actually benefit a lot of these people to get your your traditional\nManufacturing and union workers wages have gone up early\nAnd and he's got he's got to separate them from the small minority of these crazies and say I know that's not you you know you can even say I used to be a Democrat I have friends that are Democrats this is not who you are in and we've we've got to isolate these these these crazy\nThat to him you know a key that is genius I have not heard anybody bring that up instead of Republicans versus Democrats Republicans versus Democrats or the Democrats have today versus\nWhat they used to bake and make them think about what they're doing as compared to what they used to do Marcos Im W. H. I. O.

to have a student at my lab and he joined us right now welcome Jonathan\nHi how's it going\nA good idea how do you feel about which democratic Senator Chris Coons just said\nWell you know what's interesting is I didn't find the allegation particularly critical but ah I did find it strange disconnect you know the Democrats came out and said that the accuser always uh\nWell the Republicans didn't believe her eyes so it's a strange politics of\nA sexual harassment and the me too movement for democratic ah Coons was clearly signaling that he didn't believe these allegations otherwise he would have been objecting to the treatment but he prefers to say the Republicans didn't believe her a so there there's this weird environment where we're living in instead of just saying look\nSexual harassment have a right to be heard not to be believed that everyone has due process rights and fairness right but for some reason a lot of the Democratic members can't get themselves to say that 'cause they don't want to appear\nThat they are or anything but totally in favor of the me too movement and I think that ultimately this hurt the me too movement a bit uh I think that it's clear that this final allegation did undermine the previous to allegation\nAnd in the big picture to win Susan Collins gave that comprehensive speech\nShe didn't say I'm voting because I'm a Democrat or I'm voting but now I'm a Republican gonna she used it let me just tell you what went into this let me tell you how I insisted on this let me tell you how I came to this decision\nAnd when you listen to the way she deliberate it it's hard to say while typical party politics I I just don't you you can be angry that it didn't go your way but as you see there when capitals accused of something that happened Thirty years ago something might have happened Thirty years ago I'm not saying it didn't but when there's nobody there can write the story how\nCan we possibly held this man he's not worthy of this seat or it's okay to destroy his wife\n[noise] well I I this is part I wrote a column recently in the hill that we have finally reached this level of primordial politics you know we've that where we\nEngage in totally on limited on the linking rage and ... you know politicians have\nSince to be rage full hateful and not consider any elements of fairness or empathy and there's lots of people that are waiting for that moment we saw that I didn't get to see that on both sides\nBut what's missing here is what you know used to be said about statesmen that the difference between a politician or statesman the politician things to the next election where statesmen thinks the next generation where we really found out in the Kavanaugh confirmations they are very few statesman left in the Senate to bother you\nBoth me a lot you know I came to Washington as a page a fourteen year old page and when I was here giants walked those halls you know people like moynahan end and Humphrey and the Javits and\nOthers you know they were Republican and Democrat they were institutional is they believe deeply in the Senate\nYou know when I when I handled the impeachment ... last impeachment trial or in the Senate there was last judicial peach mislead counsel I remember arguing I'm a part of the case and they took a break on the Senate floor and instead or in a way a came up to me and said\nHey how's it how do you feel that having these hundred senators as your jury unless you know I just can't get out of my mind when I was a page because in a way was there with us page\nAnd I said you know there used to be giants here you know and when I'm arguing these these people they all seemed so damn small and in a week I really sort of silent and he said I think about that a lot\nAnd the Senate is changed and it hasn't changed for the better um in at some point we're gonna have to decide if the majority of the American people have had enough of these people on both sides that seem to be trafficking in the politics of rage\nI'll give you an example I Susan Collins is as I have death threats and people raising me\nWe're going to run against you how dare you vote against them if you want to show that it's a new day\n... and understand it to Europe it's on your best interests to tell mansion Murkowski Collins I respect your decision now you're going to have to earn those Senate votes which don't alienate and vilify this'll be the first test not just from other senators\nBut from politicians and people do not hate Murkowski for not agreeing with your decision or going with her party you harder to make her own decisions well representing your people are and if not there's an election don't make her enemy number one\nAnd I think that is just incredibly well said you know the I I actually wrote a column and Murkowski first came to the Senate that actually criticized her uh being appointed to the Senate or ... or I Am because of the\nAh 'cause a concern and a half or ... you know that her father was a senator and I never liked the never like these family yeah or the family a lineage but I have to admit I and I do so gladly\nShe is one of the most thoughtful senators are in Washington I you can disagree with their decision on Kavanaugh\nBut she's one of those senators that quite frankly thanks very deeply most of these people I got to tell you are just grade the actors you know there I you know is the foreman is that it's yeah the worst performances when they tried to convince us they actually care of this stuff\nBut they're few and I think we're ... keep those care I really do\nAnything is you you you can't do it by the Democrats are crazy to alienate Joe Manchin chanting shame at him and ... and his party now he's representing West Virginia well being a Democrat and if you keep pushing him what is the endgame did he switched parties and what is the endgame with Susan Collins said she\nNext time\nI think that's right and we're going to see another face of this tomorrow perhaps we can see protesters tried to interrupt the Supreme Court proceedings that would be a new low uh you know the ... the ... the the Supreme Court chambers has always been\nA place of considerable reverence they're much more strict in terms of decorum in that chamber room [noise] all of the justices believe strongly in that and we're going to see if this is rage full environment that we live and will penetrate the chamber itself and he'll be a new low if protesters\nOr interrupt those proceedings\nAnd we heard them interrupted the vote over and over again and the vice president demanding order who's into if we if it does translate to radio I Hope it does these are the protesters swarming the door at the Supreme Court cut thirty\nJust an extraordinary moment of happening too we see action on roads approach [noise] crunching senator and as a\nWhole building our building or a restaurant or home all of that and I'm over here on the part of the [noise]\nSo I mean that was it was crazy scene where the vice president walk the walk back then he walked out again on the Supreme Court steps they which this crowd chanting angry things at him so you've never you've never seen this before right\nI haven't and we were we've lost any sense of\nControl or decorum I've seen it with friends of mine you know I come from Chicago from a very liberal family and uh the rage is overwhelming but what concerns me is I just got back from Chicago and I said this to some of my friends and family\nAre that they're enjoying it too much that they they're enjoying the rage too much there is this\nMitch McConnell died someone kills him or he dies of cancer and I said do you do it if I played that statement back to you\nDo you think that you will be ashamed and and she said no and I said that's the point there was a day when we still have the capacity for a shame that that's a shameful thing to say but we've lost that capacity\nWell I mean look at what just happened to me or as I'm walking through the training so I mean that and I actually\nI think that's a great example Brian what happened to you well it's an outrage the sense that there are people that would not only do that but then post it\nAnd people would congratulate them me his knees are really horrible people you know there are such things as they are yeah the the people that followed you like that are horrible people and they seem to have found their audience\nAnd they have a and I'll give you an exam so people say well Mitch McConnell used ... when you did not vote

routines that's\nOne life the comedian the TV father the educator the pitch man we don't want the new life as inmate in and seven six eight seven out of just open state prison in college bill Pennsylvania when he arrived after his sentencing Cosby had his mug shot taken he turned in the clothing ... and was issued a prison uniform\nAccording to the Washington Post Cosby is housed by

you're home for news talking points in the way down and I talked to one of six seven [noise]\nDo you think the president can be a more when you do for the war\nI don't know that they can do that because right now that is not the way he is acting giving example my favorite three words in our constitution is the first three words wins of people when the people but recently it's become\nMean the president as opposed to the people and you're saying things that should not be happening\nDo as secretary of state Republican by name only ah who worked for Reagan and Bush\nAnd Bush a totally appalled or just to upset the fact that Donald Trump for president and the new way as doing things I guess who else wants to call them to task Thomas glitzy K. S. A. L. in Kansas hey Thomas\nHello hey Brian kill maintenance shorter show very much better insurance are very much today\nOh I appreciate your support your station has been ...\nSo we the people are as it is constitutional they voted uh your dad and his late for Donald Trump so far we the people are satisfied I can say that because he's doing exactly what I voted for him for a he's been a force for the American people there for the way that people\nFor eight years under Obama is the the catering none of us had a voice so he's wrong as far as I'm concerned also too\nTrusting challenge I talk to one of those points of an ... I'm going to teach me the station [noise]\nSo he's he's not running you know he knows politically is to his advantage yours instincts tell him to bring up what will happen if we lose the house what happens if he loses Senate interesting tactic right\n[noise] yeah I mean listen he sees a an upside you know answering the question like like he did he sees that especially with Republicans who are going to turn out in the mid term election or the fact that he delivered\nOn Brett Kavanaugh and he got it across the finish line and and the senators did\nA is a is a big win for him and you know you wouldn't know that if you looked at the week of coverage\nOf it but once it happened a it was a promise delivered and it was one in which ah especially evangelicals and conservative a conservatives all over the country were really pushing for\nIt's just so interesting right because yesterday last week while you're away maybe it's a coincidence but I think there's a lot to do with you being away they cut a new NAFTA deal because you were standing on everybody knows that I got kind of knew that the deal they could they got together and opioids\nThe president has ramped up his rhetoric against China which even unites them with Democrats on that initiative and with a lot of the EU\nSo now we're getting closer to a bilateral with Japan and\nThere's a lot of dominoes falling in the president's direction right now what it on the economic numbers would even through a hurricane\nHad the unemployment dropped now the three point seven percent and they don't have access to that yet and the fed raises interest rates\nBecause he feels the economy is healthy for the long term kinda hurts the economy a little bit it hasn't stopped Colin Powell for a for ... for taking a look at what the president has created I Want you and you said they're free to carry a cut thirty nine\nAnd so America has to take a hard look at itself and especially the Congress take a hard look at yourself and see what we are doing to try to keep things things forces in check and put America back in the middle of all this as opposed to being sort of a reluctance player and trying to pull out of agreements rather than helping to make new agreements\nAnd you know he went on to say they do oh we're hurting alliances were insulting allies\nMaybe if you look at it on the surface but what he does he pushes back he says he wants to weaken figure be doesn't alienate\nBut I think his unorthodox approach is just never going to resonate political and success or failure with people like Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright and maybe the George ... of the world who used to doing things with certain way\n[noise] I think you're right and it's definitely not a traditional way for diplomacy or dealing with trade deals but over time\nUm some of these deals these big ones have come across and have you know I mean the the Mexico Canada thing was huge um the south Korea deal on the precipice of Japan\nOr who knows what the EU is going to deliver that promise but it's you know if there's a new new deal I'm not saying that they are all to the benefit of us if their reach structuring deals based on his ...\nAt it and saying it's unorthodox but might be working\nAnd yeah I mean this is what I what I find is so interesting is that because he's Donald Trump\nThey don't even give it they don't even attempt to give them the benefit of the doubt and I was one of the people read the Woodward book\nAnd I'm reading this and he's sitting down with generals and he's telling the generals including that is hey guys you would do this to Seventeen years why making me think more money into this tell me about a plan that works come on army tell me telling me you got a plan is going to work\nSo it's characterized as the president doesn't respect his generals\nWhat it is is the c._e._o. going up to his brother his division presidents and saying produce more it's time brand of looking at his hundred million dollar Yankees in saying winning by three games is not enough or trailing by three is not enough he\nWants to get more but not everyone says well how can you be so disrespectful of the military but they people aren't even open to we might some of this unorthodox way of doing things in politics\nMight be necessary does that surprise you\nKnow listen I'm ... people and we traveled last election twenty sixteen\nOunce around the country people that were most that we hurt the most from or people that were sick of both parties\nThey said Washington doesn't work it's trying to kick the table over and try something different well this is something different the operates in different realm she uses Twitter says things that don't you know it's not comfortable but\nThere is stuff that is happening we cover the iceberg that's on top of the water and the controversies that day but there is a huge iceberg up changes happening in Washington and different agencies including the Pentagon um that often don't get coverage\nYeah it is the you know now he seems to have more of his people around\nTo handle wise you want to do five things at once they go I Know that guy that's what he always wants to do this what you do is they handle it you don't run to the Washington Post and say invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment I even sense\nThat it's the ways we spend the whole thing with a Rosenstein is working he let 'em out let them calmed down and let the story die a little bit and then they're going to go talk Rosen someone to talk right away that's kind of the way it works in business in our business especially\nYou know you're not getting the stories you while you're not getting that your your case break 'cause you get all the stories you when you're not you're not be able to talk about this to this\nSo maybe a maybe a new direction a little upset you know knows you a little upset gives you a week or two to cool out then you bring them in office on your on his time or time and then you talk it through like we're used to this world but in politics they handle it just totally differently and\nAnd the president's not bending he doesn't care if it upsets people\nThat is clear a hundred percent clear he does not care if he upsets people and um and we'll see we'll see how the country reacts or the next you know barometer\nWe can really measure is November sex and it'll be fascinating to see if if what Democrats are predicting\nUm holds true or if these numbers really don't line up to the sentiment of how people are looking at their own personal economy and the state of the nation\nGoing to give you a good question for tonight or tomorrow that I think is really gonna work out for your panel I'm In Florida right now in Jacksonville

A. R. K. Paul welcome to the program\nMr ... hello Paul\n... you're you're just one of my American heroes I just want to thank you for all your work you do and I was sitting here having my wife and I got disgusted of what the slants went through\nAnd I'm getting up on my chair and I'm going to rise up and gather people to go to the polls and uh the self motivated because of your work you're doing it really helps\nFootball I I Will I appreciate those those kind words you you know what troubles me about all of this poll we\nWe've been talking for quite some time about how the attacks on religious liberty are are having such a in a negative impact on their country\nAnd one of the problems here is that due process is now under attack and again I Believe that stems from these constant attacks on the very foundations of what it means to be an American\nAnd we have to go out there and we have to punish the Democrats for what they have done we have to go to the polls and we have to take them out of power\nYes that could I say one more thing\nOur animals and the average worker that I work around does not act like these people and I think we need to realize that some day I Know the war on the Democrats that there's good democratic people work in that do not act like this [noise]\nWell I have looked at and I'm with you on that I'm not every Democrat is behaving this way but the ones they they elect and put up there on Capitol Hill certainly do Joe Manchin would be the exception to the rule there\nBut uh it's look you're there's something to that I mean what we saw over the weekend poll on the end you're very you're very wise to just to note that\nThese were paid demonstrators for the most part we're talking about people who were paid to get out there and do harassed and bully entering our elected leaders this is George Soros money this is Saul ... book right out of the I had to write out of the gate that's what it was\nAbout to tell you that George Washington and Abraham Lincoln's rowing in their graves away this budget was thrown it but I guarantee you with your power and your thoughts are and that Bible believing thought it just motivates me and I guarantee you will get through this\nGood hanging there Paul and and best of luck to you as you get your your neighbors out there because that's what it's going to take it is every I'm telling you folks it's time for every person the demand the battles stations by the way to Paul's point are guys let's play\nCut twenty six uh this is Shawna Thomas on vice news\nWe also some people who are organized and that moment with Jeff Flake on the hell we talked to one woman who works for ultraviolet who was paid\nShe helps steer people in the right way is to be able to to confront and there were paid there were people who are paid by organizations like ultraviolet to to try to harness that energy in a way that would make the viral moments that we ended up paying\nPeople who just were still motivated to get out there and to go march they were paid this was their job\nAnd they didn't do a very good job of that by the way when you just think about this for a moment just think about this for a moment\nCompared the size of of that crowd that you saw outside the Supreme Court building and all of those millions those and washed masters that descended upon Capitol Hill and compare that to just one Donald Trump make America great again rally\nIvory what may be what a couple of hundred people meanwhile you have thousands and thousands and thousands of people that are showing up to uh go to the Trump rallies that the mainstream media they don't want to temper that but there'll be all over these people who are paid to protest\nThis is what they do\nWhat's go real quick to miss the Harpers ferry West Virginia misty we've got about forty seconds\n[noise] I Am a very conservative Christian and I voted for Joe Manchin the last time he was up for re election and the only reason I did was because he does the right thing for where I live in West Virginia\nI'm not party blind yes again I'm a conservative Republican however I like the fact that he did what was right there is no evidence to say the cabin are what ... what she claimed that he did while I Believe that company did happen to her people need to wake up you are if you did not require\nA welcome to the show and uh wow what a weekend\nOh thanks for having me and I really have to go after messy that was a [laughter] I think she said it all you're going to ... she could have she can be a host of radio exactly\nMark I want you to talk about your your observations from from what happened over the weekend in Washington\nYou know I mean first off I think it's great for the American people that a judge Brett Kavanaugh is now justice Brett Kavanaugh I think it will be dead\nBased on what the constitution and the laws say not what others wish them to be so that first and foremost but secondly I'll I'll tell you I'm\nI'm disappointed in how this entire process played out and and I'm not going to get into the you know the leaking of memos and timing and all that I mean we've solved for that to to at nausea them but when you look at people who are beating down the doors of the Supreme Court\nAnd standing inches away from police officers whose job is to protect\nOur institutions of of power and the people who are elected to serve yelling screaming ... expletives inches away from their face and and they offer no reaction\nUm we saw on display really what this election and the next few elections are going to be about and I used to say it was results versus resistance and I still think that's true but it's also going to be Republicans versus the resistance because\nMiddle of the road Democrats we used to call them blue dog Democrats people who are who are moderate in their views maybe not [noise]\nWhen they look and see these protests when they look at the seeing people screaming at the top of their lungs in in the United States Senate or chambers and in the hallways and being led away by police officers after the storm the steps of the capital\nI'm I have to think that many of them are just sitting there just made going this is not\nThe Democrat Party that I used to belong to or I used to support it's it's just really so far to the left that I think many many people who don't follow politics everyday like I'm forced to in my job and many of us do here in Washington and New York\nIt's got it's it just has to be something that alienates them a little bit I mean you've got I mean you've got senators that are that are facing a serious\nCory Gardner and his wife received a graphic text message there was a video apparently depicting somebody getting their head chopped off\nAnd someone else publicly posted the names and addresses of his family members I mean we're looking at tactics out of you know the the ... the state police in East Germany I mean this was some pretty ugly stuff we're dealing with here mark\nAnd we don't have to let it when that the key in addition he didn't let it when in addition to the policies in addition to the continuation of the success under the president and the judicial nominations if for no other reason we need to stay a step up\nAnd say enough to this rat these radical resistance fighters and and and the tactics that they're using to try to gain power\nIt you know I I heard one of your earlier callers earlier segment as you were talking about you know making sure that you get out the vote that's not enough not only do you have to get out and vote I Need you to talk to ten people I Need you to go out and talk to your friends your family people at church at work\nAnd take them to the polls with you because\nIf we lose control of the house of representatives\nThat's what we're looking at a resistance war for the next two years\nYeah speaking of that um there's a report out from Reuters or the headline Republicans fear democratic blue wave\nSpreading to once safe districts now mark as far as I can tell it looks like the Republicans are going to be okay and this and it may even pick up a seat or two but things are not looking good right now for the house\nI I think they're looking better than that poll indicates but it's still going to be very very close I agree with you I think we're going to pick up about three seats in the Senate or in add to our majority by three seats but the houses is definitely in play and so if you're not in one of those targeted Senate states but you're in one of those tests\nNation fight didn't take place on the house side of Congress\nWe faced the same challenges and they are already talking about launching impeachment proceedings against justice Kavanaugh we know what they feel and what they want to do to President Trump but even take away impeachment they want to raise your taxes\nThey have been taken over by the socialist wing of their party and they're proposing forty trillion dollars in New government programs\nThese are things that actually matter to people at home and it will impact your wallet it will impact your pay and it's something that we just have to step up even though you may not always vote in a midterm this is a mid term you have to do it in\n... well it is and I'm I'm encouraged to see the president out there I mean he's giving those he's giving a two hundred percent I mean he's out there you know a couple of times a week doing these big\nA make America great again rallies and but the but the Republican Party they're going to have to do their part and it looks like they are I think Ron ... Daniel during a pretty pretty terrific job here but I'm a to be honest with you Mark I'm afraid we've been hurt by the the leadership style\nOf of Paul Ryan to be honest with you well I have a lot of respect and and the speaker very well I I I I can guarantee you that a lot of the things that we got that the president has gotten accomplished wouldn't have been able to happen with out the speakers leadership um he he's obviously decided that this is it for him and he's going to move on into a different area of his life\nBut we've got to get beyond all of those things and you know right now you've got the president and he's going out four times this week the vice president's out five I think five different rallies I think I'm traveling with him a couple of times in the next couple of days\nA week they are fully engage the RMC is fully engaged what we need to do though is to make sure that the ... message the best advertisement is not going to be paid for on TV it's not going to be brought to you\n... says this is how important this is we need I Need you to come out and make sure your vote and make sure you vote for continuing that conservative principal leadership that we've gotten because there aren't any amount of TV ads that are going to be able to to make as much of an impact as someone who cares enough to have a conversation with you and then make sure you get to the bowls\nYou know I have to tell you when you looked at the winners and losers here I think I think Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham ah are I I'm really looking at both of them in a very different way after after how they handled themselves\nA tremendous leadership I Would also uh through a chairman Grassley in there from an old ... Senate Judiciary committee\nOr this was definitely not easy and I think that's one of the things that should energize Republicans because many other presidents would have probably cut and run a on Brett Kavanaugh as soon as the the allegations started surfacing\nAnd this is a president and this is a leadership team in the United States Senate that said no obviously there were they they investigated they've found that there was no evidence and there still is no evidence that these actions\nTook place as Dr Ford and claimed they did and they press on as opposed to doing the politically expedient things and what we have found out and we're seeing it every day with President Trump when Republicans actually fight when we don't just do the\nPolitically expedient thing when we do the difficult things like\nDealing with China and Canada and Mexico in trade disputes\nFor too long we just kind of washed it away and said well we'll take care of it were were on it and never did anything about it when we actually stand up and fight we actually see that we get the results that the people want and I think that's one of the reasons why they elected President Trump we need to make sure we send a Congress that will help him out\nMark I one of my favorite quotes over the past couple of days from the president he did a phone interview with judge Janine\nUm why he decided to go after Dr Ford and he said quite I mean it was it was so honest what he said he said he had to level the playing field\nAnd what that told me was this president is going to have the back of the people that he puts out there and he nominates to these positions and this is a man who is going to be loyal to his people\nAnd I really appreciate that and respected that about President Trump because the easy thing would have been for the president to say you know what we're [noise] we're we're going to go with somebody else but he didn't do that\nNow you're right and I also think it's very important to you that the you know and and\nWhat the president did was questioned the story question the evidence and ask questions about the gaps in the information that she provided he had been and the Republicans across the board I think had been nothing but gracious respectful\nAnd cognizant of the very difficult stories she was a she was wanting to come forward or she was coming forward to tell but that doesn't alleviate the ability to question\nThe facts and I think there's a and while that while the Democrats and liberals would want to want to make sure that any anything that you a question from her is attacking her or is attacking women who have been through some I think is very difference between attacking someone personally and actually just raising questions about the information that's being provided\nHey\nScott Goldberg new information about a decade limousine grass or over the weekend ABC's mark ... in upstate New York New York's\nGovernor Andrew Cuomo says the driver of the limousine the green dot the road killing himself and Nineteen others did not have the appropriate driver's license to be operating the two thousand one Ford excursions stretch limo\nAdditionally that vehicle was inspected just last month by the state's department of motor vehicles and had failed its jak meaning it was not supposed to be on the road New York state is now moving to get a cease and desist order against prestige limo while the investigation continues\nMark ...

I think they've been hurt by people like\nTaylor swept to my surprise I have an eight year old girl and she has absolutely no interest and tell us what's whatsoever which is I find shocking\nAgain I the only thing worse than Taylor Swift music I think would be anything from nickel back but other ... I I but I I just don't get 'em ladies and gentlemen if you missed the last segment the Taylor Swift\nSays that she's going to be campaigning against Marsha Blackburn our good friend Marsha Blackburn a running for the U.S Senate in Tennessee [noise]\nBy the way Mike Huckabee governor how could be a good friend of this program decided to weigh in on this\nHe says Taylor Swift has every right to be political but it won't impact the election unless we allow Thirteen year old girls to vote [laughter] good for you you know what's happened you know what's happened to your producer John\nTaylor Swift has just ended up in the the big garbage sheep known as the Dixie Chicks yes that definitely in that category\nSo this was years ago I was hosting a radio program years ago and this was when the Dixie Chicks first came out against the President Bush\nAnd do you know we did live on the air we had one I Believe that our engineer at the time owned a Ford F. one fifty and he was a big fan of the Dixie Chicks and he was so upset we hadn't bring all of his Dixie Chicks CDs\nThe into the studio and we took them out into the into the parking lot of the radio station and live on the air we had him or roll over the Dixie Chicks CDs\nA good old fashioned and leaders smashing oh it sounded great because we had that we had we had our we had the intern\nOut there with the the microphones right next to the CDs as the as the truck was crushing them can't do that anymore with digital downloads that's very disappointing\nVery disappointing otherwise I suspect we went to the phones will be lighting up of people wanting to destroy their Taylor Swift music on the on the ... radio program let's say we have people saying there\nBut if you may have a tailor storage poster [noise] and if you do all that would be weird um well if you don't want to go into your child's room and take their Taylor Swift collection and burn it but [noise]\nYou know these people they just they they just don't give up do they they just don't give up ladies and gentlemen now coming up in the next segment or good friend Harry early is going to joined us I wanted to get him to weigh in on all of this chaos that Israeli descended on the nation that has been unleashed\nBy the Democrats and it's getting ugly out there um I mentioned to use tinder Cory Gardner a he and his wife received a death threats\nThere someone's also been sending threats to their family members do apparently someone has docked the senator and um is spreading his information out there\nAnd that's just not right by the way I Want them and we we don't have a lot of time with this segment but we're gonna we're willing to pay for this a little bit more so last week there was a liberal coverage story about a um they called him an intern for Sheila Jackson Lee this guy Jackson Cosco\nTwenty seven years old and I thought to myself wait a second uh twenty seven year old intern\nWell it turns out he was not an intern ladies and gentlemen this guy Jackson Cosco was a fellow he had a fellowship so the question is who paid for this guy's fellowship and who else who else did he do work for on the side\nThis is one bad guy he's facing upwards of fifty years in prison I think that's what they're saying about fifty years in prison there's twenty seven year old he was the guy responsible for posting the private addresses of three members of the Senate Judiciary committee on a wiccan\nThe private information about people that's what the young people call up these days ... [noise]\nI think the guy ought to be charged as a ... to ... to whatever extent we at the the the highest penalty that's what we ought to give the guy and by the way and maybe you guys could way on this I still think\nWe need to go after all those people who made accusations against Brett Kavanaugh we need to find out if in fact they lie and then they like do you think they ought to be charged with the crime the\nA there are all these questions that have to be answered there's all these inconsistencies and that is part of him getting his reputation completely back and made whole how's he going to be whole cloth again when all these things we just go away and leave incomplete I I Know they're not going to deal with Todd but they should do it\nHarry ... I I saw the picture of the of the swearing in of of a justice cabin on his wife and his two daughters were there and they did not I did not see a lot of joy in in that photo and that sickened me because that was the work of the Democratic\nI totally agree with you but at least I think there is a consolation prize there's two photos there's one with the chief justice Roberts and I totally agree with you it seemed solemn faces not happy not even relieved just just shot from what had happened but the one with Anthony Kennedy\nThey do look happy his wife looks happy she's adoring and proud of her husband the two girls at beaming looks on their face a so one out of two ain't bad\nHarry I I Want to get your reaction to these these ... this rent a mob that was unleashed on Washington over the weekend you had these these people that were just these were guttural greens from the gallery I was just really terrifying\nThen you've got these people out there you have the topless woman or outside the Supreme Court building people were literally trying to claw at the Supreme Court doors\nYou know it's one thing I part of me wants to sit back and laugh and ... and ... these people but this is a pretty dangerous stuff the Democrats have been leashed on America\nThere's understand they don't get in there by accident these ... these passes or competed and members of Congress are the only ones basically that have them the Democrats put these animals in place\nAnd it's all coordinated if you notice they were screaming that it stops then the vice president as the sergeant of arms get order back in and store and then they do it again and again and again and it's literally ran a mob and what I'm hoping comes out of this somebody has to have the backbone to say\nThis is not protesting this is criminal activity you're crossing the line when you when you go chase down by and kill made and put him on a ... and he and follow him onto a subway and then you announce them and you would do all these idiots things encouraging people to the Maxine Waters or these not funny comedians that did it Brian dirty\nThought we have to put a stop to this because somebody is really going to get hurt\nWe hear a lot and yes you I'm Glad you brought up a brand kill made um we were we were going to talk about that and the next hour but I'm Glad you brought it up because for one thing people need to understand those brand kill me one of the nicest guys get Fox News channel he would he would give you the shirt off of his back\nJumps to an honest ... decent man he is you know I Believe he coaches his kids are one of his kids' soccer teams a wreck he's he's er he's just a great all around person and for them to go in targeting him and do what they did I just wanted to say first of all\nBrand kill me can can handled himself he can take care of himself\nUm but I just thought it took such a great level of courage for him not to respond to these these bugs and that's all there were thoughts but what really bothered me though Harry is when you get on to New York city subway\nWe have some pretty violent and evil liberals living in in New York City and they will go after people like Brian ... of your they've come after me\nThe Brian yesterday I told him not proud of him I was because I don't know how you would have been able to pull it off because you have that professional a capacity but it's tough they're following him down the street and it started as a selfie and then it got really nasty then they followed him some more and some more they're throwing dirty questions Adam\nThan they follow him on who was subway then\nThey announce to the subway hey this is the guy that only got a president listens to what are your questions for him and he's the guy and he says race racy stuff they don't even have English language mastered are illiterate racist or accusations at a at Bryan absolutely terrible and he handled himself\nAmazing he didn't engage he didn't give a fire oxygen and he had himself in a way that I don't know how many people are there may be taught stars Brian kill me and a handful of people that could pull something like that off but you guys don't deserve that you work hard you're honest you're not doing anything behind anybody's back you're saying it right to the American people\nYou should you should we shouldn't have\nAnd atmosphere and our country where people like Maxine Waters not funny comedians like these two clowns where they they all announce that you get no piece you're not to sleep you can't eat you can't go to the movies you can't go to the bowling alley we thought we got to stop this and I've heard you say and I agree with that completely\nThis is our generations civil war\nAnd and and you're right Harry Reid John and do something about it you know I\nI I'm all about civil discourse I'm all about having debate um there's a right way and a wrong way um I called out last week there was some guy who are professors to be a conservative who threatened a doctor board\nThat guy should be punished and he used to whatever the severe penalty is under the law\nThat man should face that penalty on the other side of the equation Harry we got to demand the same kind of justice for those ... that are going out there\nWhen somebody shows up at a Republican softball game practice and that's what concerns me we've got to make sure that never happens again\nTodd you could not be more right and I don't want to run out of time without saying isn't it amazing ah Brett Brett Kavanaugh associate justice Brett Kavanaugh the hundred and fourteenth associate justice in the history of America has already hired the first all women law clerk team\nHow about that Todd how about that guy he lied about is the first guy to do what he just did\nHarry real quick um we've been talking politics we had Kris Kobach on a just a little while ago from Kansas\nUm we've got Mike Pence that's going to be he's going to be in Springfield, Missouri just a few miles for me and just a little while you guys in New Jersey could have one of those massive upset races in the United States Senate\nSteady and Todd it is literally get even right now with my good friend bought you can actually leading forty six forty one percent with independence if you win the independent vote in New Jersey\nYou when

independent leaning Democrats I think he's going to do it he will be the first\nIn fifty years the first Republican for some reason you can when governor every other term but for the ... for the United States Senate it's just all Democrat all day fifty years\nWell we're gonna we're gonna pay close attention to that raised here you keep us posted as well by the way one final question Taylor Swift or you Taylor Swift being\nAll the time we think so much alike I used to say on my show that here as a person that seems to do all the right things she's charitable she's great to her fans and

your\nI Am Dave Ramsey your host thank you for joining us America we're so glad you are here open phones this hour as we talk about your life and your money\nIt is a free call a triple eight eight to ... to to five this was a strange talk radio show to talk radio show where we actually talk about things that matter\nTo real people in real cities\nEverywhere now I Know you think a lot of that other stuff matters\nBut let me tell you what matters whether you change your family tree me tell you what matters whether you get your financial act together so that you can give and do your community what happens at your house as a whole lot more important than what happens when the White House\nWe're here for you\nIt's actually what drives this entire country you do not the characters on the television and oh my God are there are some characters on the TV [noise] wow man scary scary stuff but\nWe're glad you are here with us today open\nPhones at triple eight eight to five five two to five Arab guy is with us in Chicago Hi Erica how are you\nHow how better than I deserve what's up\nLarry I'm semi grandma and on I was just curious if you think that I should I put it\nI'm into some upgrades with my house or if I should just put it all down on my\nOn mortgage I kind of you some calculators on line and it's really about like six or seven months and I do want to make sure that on a spending a little bit of that money out of it\nAs well as the head as well you know I just kind of want to get to what your homework or is it worth about ... what do you do on it on and to fight to get into one of the homes on your street so far on average\nI'm probably pick up the five\nOkay All right I'm sure you're right it's a barely at the top of the market right yeah I read it last year for Thirty years is that yours is not like double the average house on the street but it's one of the nicest one's\nA it was it not\nToo long it's worth two Seventy the average house on your street is two fifty five is the information you gave me is that right yeah so that puts you in a little bit nicer than the average house is that right yeah okay that's all I'm Talking about ... if you're going to spend some more money on how much more money are you going to spend on the house\nA band I wasn't ... wanted to look at when we got plenty but were you going to spend the whole you weren't going to spend the whole twenty you said you know okay so what are you thinking about ten Fifteen\nI'm Around there and how long you plan on living there um for the for the future okay and what's your household income Seventy one county okay All right so if\nYou spend ten thousand dollars on this house you're likely not going to get it out when\nDon't you know what I Do I'll be happy about it either one not gonna be guilty either way it's your money it's your choice you're smart either way you're out of debt you have your emergency fund and you're saving up for expenditures\nOne of the expenditures as you want to build a house for cash that some awesome go second one is you want to spend one month of that money and go to Disney about three thousand bucks a either one is wonderful you should not feel guilty\nEither way but I'll tell you what I Would do I'd go to Disney yeah little kids you part is perfect age for that\nUm if it's something you obviously do want to do something they want to do I'm just not something I Want to do but you it's fine I mean Rachel cruise loves Disney she just took her little baby down there they had a wonderful time not sure how great it time her husband had but they had a great time and I'm\nNow a but but I mean if it's what you want to do you've saved up the money you're not going into that you're not getting out of debt and going on vacation you're out of that\nYou have your emergency fund this is the point in the baby steps where you enjoy some of the money and I don't suggest consuming all of it and hitting no long term goals but I think if you don't consume some of it and only hit long term goals then you're not enjoying your life\nYou live like no one else so that later you can live and give like no one else during the first three baby steps you're extremely intense you don't do anything except beans and rice rice and beans till you're ... out of debt and have your emergency fund in place then you let your foot off the accelerator some to where you can do baby steps for five and six\nAnd purchases are in there all at the same time baby step for Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement meanwhile you start putting some pretty good college and five and six years when you find extra money pay off the house early in that sense that's what you're working towards\nThe middle of all of that we don't go ten years and never go on vacation\nGrade the couch you just pay cash for this stuff and you realize that every time we consume something and slows down our long term wealth building but the purpose of long term wealth building has to be able to consume and to be able to give\nMoney piled up just for pollen Avon Paula money's sake is not worth anything is only worth something when it does something for your family or you're able to do something for others and it's all it's good for Jay is with us in Orlando, Florida Hi Jay welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHey Dave out ... thank you for taking my call first time caller sure I'm about two years ago I began a commercial helicopter training\nAnd I finally received my commercial helicopter ticket um however I unfortunately I Need a rabbi eighty hours or more training as I discovered this I mean there's trees highly regulated by insurance\nAnd in order to become a share of NATO out two hundred hours and I'm trying to figure out how to pay for eighty hours and be ready to work the upcoming season I'm as a commercial up about\n... is there any way you can do it as a co pilot ... hours\n[noise] no I unfortunately uh the uh the jobs are there any Abbott is the single pilot\nNow that that moment you just said the wrong thing you should do the job opportunity there's only one person in Florida and you know with ... what's wrong\nWell I I didn't tell you another thing or two days I I work at a firefighter so that's my primary um income choice there's this kind of like a secondary thing that that kind of went off in bed and that's a\nThat's kind of why I'm I'm kinda limited as far as the ... the jobs that I can I can take\nThe helicopter pilots not make more than ...\nKnow I Believe it or not firefighters are definitely make\nTo continue that and part time helicopter pilot\nYes yeah so that's what I Want to do [noise] okay um\nAnd you show U.S forces you to stay in that particular area and it forces you to work an irregular schedule that you can control and so it does limit the number of jobs available which means that having your helicopter pilots life things has a very limited value\nYeah it's not that I'm Glad you brought shrank is not that valuable to you because of the way you're going to utilize it so I mean you have to just cash flow this it's like it's like a hobby you're getting paid for your own make some money but if you're not going to make enough money to even justify the expense you've gone too\nYeah so I just I feel I'm too far into it to just\nWell I'm not suggesting you quit but there's just no way in the scenario you've laid out here that it makes sense to do anything except just slow down and go I'm just gonna take me a little time does I got a cash flow this and I got to find the time to do the hours\nRight they say don't rush to get the job done and they don't charge not worth that much yeah it doesn't pay that much either\nAnd that's what I mean they're not worth that last compared to what you're paying you're not even gonna make back you're eighty hours worth of training and the first year\nNo mayor right now\nSo not to mention all the money you've already put on it so um what I Want to do is look for a place I mean you've got connections in the fire department other lifelike guys or something that you can get some hours in the co pilot seat and get some takeoffs and landings and get some of the council actually\nA fork saying those are more complex aircraft and I'm I'm currently find a lot of them that we're at\n... ... aircraft gotcha not even a\nYet but um I mean I I've even reached out to people that own their own aircraft and and you know offered to pay for fuel and things like that to kinda do get those ... or ... and unfortunately a lot a lot of those guys are very busy though\nWhat does it the eighty hours cost\n[noise] well considering some of the hour and a place of a you know on the cheap you can get some at two fifty a three hundred five hundred at all and on the aircraft and what kind of a deal you can get you know so\nBecause you know my twenty thirty thousand bucks yeah pretty much already my chair and you don't have that laying around obviously negative negative on just take your time and cash flow it\nBecause you you now have as we continue the conversation you've even narrowed your opportunities down further because you're in an entry level um ... the simpler versions of helicopters not all of them which is limits the number of jobs you can take even more and so this is slightly above a hobby\nYeah yeah definitely ... Ashton\nYeah why not I there's nothing wrong with that as long as you pay cash for it yeah yeah I mean I I've got a I\nI collect handguns and shoot them a lot\nAnd uh and and also I burn through some MOH but it's a ... I don't make any money doing them I'm trying to make money doing it but I was just a hobby\nAnd so that costs money hobbies costs are on and this one was not going to cost you money is actually going to make you a little once you get past this but up until the point you actually get a check it's going to cost you money and you know you're just gonna put another twenty thousand bucks into this thirty thousand bucks into this before you get paid\nAnd um that may take you two years the cash flow that instead of one you're not going to make this year unless you can find some way that the guys that are hiring for the season I\nWant to pay for it in return you promise to work there are three years or something like that you know and they want to pay for your hours or something maybe there's somebody looking for a pilot that you know with that much intensity\nUh sometimes uh unemployed here or will pick up some education costs in order to get somebody on board if they're having trouble finding the help in that area that helps\n[noise]\n\nIt's time to take another look at your budget that means scouring every expense and making sure you're not leaving any money on the table one of

to five hours is in Dallas texas hey al how are you from yourself better than I deserve what's up\nHey thanks for taking my call\nThe biggest mhm so I'm to the point where I have two inch remote twenty eight hundred dollars a wind in fact she um repayment over over payment on the Social Security uh-huh security uh and the other one is basically a form I figure them mhm\nNow for the past month the for my kid only gets you got it from\nMy wages mhm though I'm a big considering that if there is part of the budget mhm sure sure go ahead and the other side just continue pain in the minimum on the phone one K. and just let the part of the budget or should I go ahead and just ... that show security\nNot because it's part of the budget and I'm not because of interest rate but because Social Security a repayment on that can have heavy seas and um you're dealing with the government which has no so and so I I Would get them paid as fast as possible because I wouldn't want them out of my life\n[laughter] and so for that reason I'm going to you know that's gonna be the tie breaker twenty eight hundred versus twenty eight hundred on the debt snowball from me and I knocked them out right quick now when you get to the four oh one K. you know you cannot pay extra on a four O. one K. loan monthly you will have to just save up and pay off the lump sum at one time\nI see what you're saying\nThat they will not let you pay an extra hundred dollars on it a month or five hundred dollars a month you just have to pay the whole thing off or pay the payments and so what you do is you just build up a big chunk of savings as your last bit and then when it when your savings gets up to equal to the four oh one K. above your thousand dollar baby step one then you knock that four one K.

don't know no one knows except for ... who runs for like a good they're the only ones that actually know their algorithm but it appears between six months in a year from the time that you have all zero balances and no open accounts\nIf you have a credit card and you're paying it off every month that's an open account\nRight okay that you can have no debt and still have a credit score all the time okay so if anybody is reporting on you and the only way that what happens if you have an ongoing relationship with them in and you're still owed them money or you're still using their products even though you're paying it off every month a ... card then\nI'm good how are you having me on well\nI'm honored the new book is called the next millionaire next door in during strategies for building wealth and it it's out this week right\nThat's right yeah and it was a labor of love and I have a father but it out and like I like about it\nYou know if you guys didn't know her her dad passed in a car wreck what four years ago is it now where the clean Power Plan that's right yeah I'm thinking I remembered that about there and um\nWe had had him on several times over the years as we discuss this whole subject to millionaires and\nAll of the some of the mythology that is around millionaires so uh you used some of the research from your dad's in Europe a professional researcher to like he was and uh and they put this together tell me about the background on that part of it what if this or did you do and what of it was combined with what he had done\nThat trade had we had worked together really on the NFL fair day for the buck on you know really started back\nAnd and work together on kind of what the book should include and got to the point when we were just about to send out a survey on our sample of of African Americans and he was killed by by a drunk driver\nUm and so really he wasn't able to see the data that came back and compare it to what was there and Nineteen Ninety six and Andy On 'em so that's kind of where I took up a sick on the project and and kept going with it\nSure is an industrial psychologist and president of data points without a research and\nTechnology company that studies wealth accumulation and build tools to help and you guys have to check this out its data points dot com has all the stuff on her research as well which you can get the new book the next millionaire next door\nIn during strategies for building wealth at any major bookstores show the new data that you guys got\nAs you put this back together on the anniversary and then you've added to it since with your continued research\nWhat were the ... was there anything that just shocked to win the findings were you should go out and see that one coming\n[noise] yeah you know we looked a lot at um some of the mistakes or that kind of behaviors that ... million airs make related to investing and I think what was causing was\nJust like any of us that are trying to do the right thing um millionaires make mistakes along the way to and that will lead to a lot of that sort of the behaviors and the the mistake if you will that they make related to them but I think that that was surprising\nAnd then I think what was surprising was that why hasn't things in terms of the kinds of ... of the amount that they're spending on things like a furniture and clothing and things like that\nThat some of those things are surprising that were sort of similar time\nYeah I was speaking in a church a couple of days ago and I told them one of the a key points that I've seen over twenty five years of doing this one to five\nOn the back of your book and understanding how those around you influence your financial but ... what did you find on that\nYeah absolutely I think that again you see it's very clear from the work that we've done both with populations and and every every day folks like I like\nThat they are um that that that social and different that not caring about what others are driving and buying and wearing is a really key factor in building well you know it's related to network regardless of how old you are how much you make\n'em and I think you know now with technology it's really hard to ignore what other people are doing research will medium set forth but\nIt continues to be a factor are just not hearing about what other people is and you know as as is one of the way it goes well\nYou know I think in my case I was I was a unique because one of the benefits going broke like I Do it in my twenties where his violently was ... at that point I just reached all I wanted to do survive\nAnd thrive and and I reached a point I just don't care what people think I still don't care what people think and I think that was a big contributor to me\nPersonally you'll be able to to build wealth again after going bankrupt but I see it with other people is when you don't care what other people think about what you drive where you live what closure where whether you've been on vacation you're not trying to keep up with other people's Facebook version of themselves then you've got the ability to win\nAbsolutely and I think like just like he said I think that that on Facebook there's and I live in a lot different right then what's really going on and I live here so that's something to keep in mind but we definitely see that and the research\nShe'll gaining knowledge and composer to invest and grow wealth that is a great word come closer to grow ... what do you mean by that\nBut you know one study that related to making them when it comes to our investments that it really you know you could apply any kind of major financial decision they are making a few have kind of\nAnd it rained that's not a great time to go out and look for in a car because you're not a skier and an emotional state where you are so excited about the new income level that you have all of a sudden your decision making is a little off so he can stay calm and composed\nI'm no matter what the financial decision bar then you'd have a better chance of making the right one\nAnd I also here we've got a ... personalities as a career show on you're choosing a career and there's all this stuff about following your passion out there but you guys have you found yet again in this new set of data the idea of a lifestyle related freedom\nDoes not equate to less income or less wells that actually ... to ... or will the new\n[noise] yeah you know I think that's right I think that you know understanding that looking at your passion or or your interests let's say for your career has to be grounded in some kind of reality um and and I think that that's something that\nYou know a lot of people don't want to hear but it is true and so um if

I was living in the open like the ... if if people like being unbiased stars I put in Fifteen sixteen hours a day for like eight nine months\nI paid it off our own kind of really proud of our but to me you should be awesome where to go yeah but I the next\nDo the stuff I used to take the bus they do to be a long day then to to be very tiring for one paid off my low and I went ahead and go to a lady extend the gutter and into this kind of how you live under the impression that you know it was okay to ... so that kind of thing\nUm [noise] so like I say when Comey five to eighty and the ... about thirty thousand others\nAnd one thing but the guy that I started listening to your show and ever since I've been doing that I didn't make feeling\nRelieved really bad about it because you know one of things you say that you should you should never get into that and that's exactly what they know how can I can I help you today sir\nYeah so my question and I have a couple of questions one new thing I said ...\nWhat's your household income Seventy five to ... if I Do it and you make thirty are you oh thirty I'm sure you oh thirty oh yeah oh yeah you how quick you're going to pay it off\nI mean if I put my mom like greeted with it and maybe a year maybe two and a half\nYeah my mum or like a year yeah you're single right yeah okay\nAnd you make Seventy five or eighty paying off a Thirty Years' doable you just got to not do anything else right if you're not willing to sacrifice enough of your lifestyle to pay it off in a year yes I Would salad that's up to you though how quickly you want to clean up do you like the car\nI Love it what is it um how old are you hungry ... which three hundred and he said\nThat's a great car yeah yeah yeah well I mean I there's nothing wrong with keeping their car ... you just have to have a plan to pay it off very very quickly\nTo justify its um less than half your annual income in value and you can pay it off in less than two years you're right I wouldn't have bought it but you're there now and so if you want to sacrifice a bunch of\nWhat do you think I should just I'm just trying harder and a good both\nWhat are you studying accounting\nOkay I've got a finance degree and I worked forty to sixty hours a week while I went through school and for years at at the university level so I'm a it's doable um you are you know you are doing a lot of studying and not a lot of partying for sure um the um how are you paying for school\nUm I go to I get grants and also um ... with the money for\nOkay so you're you're not going into debt now ... okay so if you quit work how would you pay for school\nI had a money saved up from a working for the past year I don't mind my bank ankle probably like twelve thousand mhm oh you left me a year year and a half no I think I keep working okay\nIf it ... last year if it costs you a half a point when your grade point average um\nYeah I heard I read about like cheap yeah yeah I graduated with up to nine seven I missed it as a magnet by I'm just making about three one ... still piss Thirty years later but [laughter]\nBut you know what I have never had a single caller asked my GPA before they asked my advice [laughter]\nAnd I actually I've never gone on a job interview where they asked my GPA in my entire life ever around in if you're wanting to go to work for one of the\nTop accounting firms in the entire world they might ask your GPA and you might actually be in competition or GPA might actually matter\nOn your very first job but after that it won't um and it has a whole lot more to do with did you learn how to do accounting than what your GPA is and will you work hard while you're at work and that kinda stuff and so\nOkay oh I poke around in the accounting field and see if you can get on with one of them making about the same kind of money one of them I'd actually aid for your degree yet if they get to know wouldn't hurt anything to ask around and see if we can make a job James and make about the same money and get free tuition or something that'd be very cool\nOn top of it but I'm I'm\nYou know you're not working a hundred hours a week you were going thirty hours a week twenty hours a week you can do this\nIt's very doable uh most people work when they're in school it's not an unusual\nReally by the way when I when I Do know vent or\nI was just in San Francisco this week and we're doing an event we should ... uh ... the audience were three thousand people there how many of your work when you were in college I mean it's like Ninety percent of the audience raise their hand you know maybe the people that didn't work when they're in college and listen to my show I don't know but\nIt appears that most people work when they're in college that's what it looks like and so um I I think if I'm you I'm going to continue that route good question thank you for joining us a ... is with us in Houston Hi Lucia how are you\nI Am doing well thank you for asking um I had the pleasure talking to you and my husband and I were I mean babysat ... getting out of debt and now we are and what you call they said three in the arm them for their down payment on or how much be finished driving the weird looking right now at about a\nFifteen Percent about them I call frequent down um\nOur household income before\nI'm On the fact is about one twenty five I'm after bonuses cycle it's about one thirty two and so I'm trying to make sure that everything about like how much house by um that we are understanding the um\n[noise] I I I think he recommended and afford to have your take home pay exactly a okay perfect and so I wanted to make sure that like right now\nAnd I'm like oh we hit the ball comfortable amount\nAnd honestly I think number I Can't say feeling you know it is a big no it's a lot better than you're paying now but if that's that's a fourth of your take home pay or less and your debt\nFree with your emergency phone and blows you have the mouth spread to prosper if you continue to budget and stay on track but again that's not what you should do that's the most you should do\nSo you can do less if you want to 'em or you could put it on a shorter term if you want to\nYeah and you know I'm about less house at Twenty one hundred and paid off in ten years there's nothing wrong on five years I don't care I mean you can do a lot of stuff but the most I Would ever tell you to do and I I don't even do that 'cause I don't borrow money at all for anything ever\nIs a Fifteen year fixed rate\nWhere the payment is no more than a fourth of your take home pay Luke is with us in Dallas Hi Luke welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up [noise] so\nUm my wife and I have a listening to you for many years actually I my dad got me listen to you and I was a young kid and um stupidly I did not take your bike and I have student loans and um we are considering taking a cash out refinance our house\nTo knock out the high interest you know ... and then start paying the debt off on the house because it that much lower interest rate [noise]\nAnd how much they want to do ... do you have 'em read at forty eight thousand drank and what's your household into it\nBetween takeover forty to sixty so I own my own business so last year we did sixty five this year we're looking at probably doing I'm probably going to bring home culture\nSix years I've never told someone to refinance ... take ... to pay off their debt ever except to avoid bankruptcy or a foreclosure and you're facing neither\nAnd so on now I I've never told anybody to do that\nOkay and the reason is very simple you make enough money to pay this debt off in a couple of years calm you got to work like a maniac and you're gonna have to have no life but then you're going to be dead free except your house\nAnd then you can work on paying off your house I'm from there and of course start working on your retirement and the other baby steps that we walk people through but you can't borrow your way out of debt\nAnd on and if you pay this off within two years the interest rate on this becomes mathematically irrelevant\nBecause you're gonna end up so fast it's like you're keeping it for Thirty years it's a two year thing and and really it's not forty eight thousand for two years more like twenty thousand for two years because halfway through you're going to be halfway through\nAnd and so yeah you guys need to get on a budget really really tight budget very careful very ...\nCut your lifestyle to nothing do everything you can with your business to increase your income because you need to clean up the student loan debt I agree with you on that part but no I don't I don't tell people to borrow to get out of debt you can't borrow your way out of debt and work to get your way out of a whole\nDigging out of a whole is a an oxymoron ec statement that we all make which I'm digging out of a whole you're not digging out a whole if you dig out the bottom of a hole gets deeper\nShe can't dig out of all you have to fill in the hall I get out and climb out of a whole maybe but you don't dig out of a home\nUnless you dig into China doesn't work so no you can't you can't you can't borrow your way out of that and that's the same exact situation so you got to stop that you have to break that cycle\nBut on the sand and say well now borrowing money\nEver ever ever\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare\nI don't care of the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just get rid of it there or a ball they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely legally in forever is with timeshare exit team\nThey have offices all around the country where you can sit down face to face and review your contract to find a solution they've accepted thousands of timeshare owners this year alone they're\nThe best in the business because they simply a more options for exit than anyone else it could be a long process\nBut there with you every step of the way and timeshare exit team is so confident in their exit service that if they don't get you out you get a full refund called eight for for nine nine nine exit and schedule a free consultation eight for for nine nine nine ... or timeshare exit team dot com\nIt wasn't something\nThat I didn't like it I just I felt like\nI Need and like I say ... to help me 'cause I I didn't want to be in that either I just felt like there is just a huge cloud ever asked all the time and what was your\nBiggest takeaway then where you went oh I see that now\nAbout the U.S and honestly and\nAnd then me and just coming to my senses and saying you know is this is this material things something that I really need to have them and using the ... the ... system really helped me\nAnd I'm not felt our budget and you know this is the amount of money we need to pay for our groceries this is you know this is how much we we can get to the church and this is how much we can give people for gifts and what not and so I just needed to lay out and once we implemented those steps I you know we were just\nLets you sound a little bit like ritual Richard ... little budget as permission to spend I Love your daughter yeah I've ... yeah\nYeah and that's exactly what it is and I there is sometimes when I just felt like we didn't have any money that's the mindset I had to give myself was okay we don't have money for this but you know it's there and we wanted it but in you know when\nI'm going down for a budget but once I said about what a control me I don't I don't really regret okay we know uncle was a cheerleader window your brother was a true leader when you have the community that you're plugged into richer leaders who else would your biggest earlier\nA I mean we're really close to our family and my family through\nAll of them are very supportive of us we we can both come from five brothers\nNot five riders\nFive kids from each family so two brothers and two sisters so we have we come from a big family but um they were all supportive of us really in our friends and as well so\nEr grew so what do you tell people to key to getting out of that is now that you've done it\nI think the key thing David is being on the same page ... you know communication is key and you know we went to the money in marriage last week and we were listen to a lot of the other couples mhm and none of them have gone through the financial piece for gone through a lot of seminars mhm and I've seen\nExplode once they get through that anymore and follow the ... the steps

a whole lot more important than what happens in a while\nWe're here for you\nIt's actually what drives this entire country you do\nNot the characters on the television and oh my God are there some

Hi Erica how are you\nHow did you did better than I deserve what's up\nVery um well I'm In baby steps sick and I've been said I'm about twenty thousand dollars and found my grandma and on I was just curious if you think I should I put it\nI'm into some upgrades with my house or if I should just put it all down on my on mortgage I kind of you some calculators on line and it's really about like six or seven months\nYes I um I Do want to make sure that on a spending a little bit of that money and ...\nAs well as the head as well so I just kind of want to get to what's your homework is worth about ... what do you do on it on a two part time one of the homes on your street so far on average\nUm probably five\nOkay All right I'm sure you're right it's a barely at the top of the market\nRight yeah I read it\nIt was\nTightly I it's worth two Seventy the average house on your street is to play the five is the information you gave me is that right yeah that that puts you at a little bit nicer than the average house is that right yeah okay that's all I'm Talking about ... if you're going to spend some more money on it how much more money or you're going to spend on the house\nA ban I like the only got twenty but you're going to spend the whole you weren't gonna spend the whole twenty you said okay so what are you thinking about ten Fifteen they're cutting and how long you plan on living there\nAre a fair\nOkay and what's your household income\n\nAll right so if\nYou spend ten thousand dollars on this house you're likely not going to get it out when\nWe're currently saving to build our on a new home on property we bought in cash already we can cash flow the trip by not saving for the house for one month about three thousand dollars I feel guilty for both not taking a family vacation and for not saving money where's the balance you you're guilty a lot aren't you\nMean you're stuck 'cause you're just going to be guilty you're guilty if you go to Disney and you're going to be guilty if you don't\nYou know what I Do I'll be happy about that either one not gonna be guilty either way it's your money it's your choice you're smart either way you're out of debt you have your emergency fund and you're saving up for expenditures\nOne of the expenditures as you want to build a house for cash that some awesome go second one is you want to spend one month of that money and go to Disney about three thousand bucks a either one is wonderful you should not feel guilty\nEither way but I'll tell you what I Would do I'd go to Disney yeah little kids\nPart it's perfect age for that um if it's something you obviously do want to do something they want to do I'm just not something I Want to do but you it's fine I mean\nRachel cruise loves Disney she just took her a little baby down there they had a wonderful time not sure how great it time her husband had but they had a great time and I'm now a but but\nYou're out of that you have your emergency fund this is the point in the baby steps where you enjoy some of the money and I don't suggest consuming all of it and hitting no long term goals but I think if you don't consume some of it and only hit long term goals then you're not enjoying your life\nYou live like no one else so that later you can live and give like no one else during the first three baby steps you're extremely intense you don't do anything except beans and rice rice and beans till you're ... out of debt and have your emergency fund in place then you let your foot off the accelerator some to where you can do baby steps for five and six\nAnd purchases are in there all at the same time maybe step for Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement meanwhile you start putting some pretty good college and five and six years when you find extra money pay off the house early and that's since that's what you're working towards the middle of all of that we don't go ten years and never go on vacation\nThat's when you go on vacation we don't go ten years and never upgrade the couch that as springs sticking out of it that's when you upgrade the couch you just pay cash for this stuff and you realize that every time we consume something it slows down our long term wealth building but the purpose of long term wealth building has to be able to consume and to be able to give\nMoney piled up just for ... having a pile of money sake is not worth anything it's only or something when it does something for your family or you're able to do something for others that's all it's good for Jay is with us in Orlando, Florida Hi Jay welcome to the day Ramsey show\nThey have a pet thank you for taking my call first time caller sure I'm about two years ago I began a commercial helicopter training\nAnd I finally received like commercial helicopter state ticket um however I unfortunately I mean uh the by eighty hours or more training I've had to cover a the industry is highly regulated by and sharing and in order to become a sure why\nAnd be ready to work the upcoming season I'm as a commercial pilot up about\n... is there any way you can do it as a co pilot and get the hours\n[noise] no I unfortunately uh they are the jobs are there any ... is the single pilot\nNow that that moment you just said the wrong thing you should do the job opportunity there's only one person in Florida and you know what ... what's wrong\nWell I I didn't tell you another thing or two days I I work at a firefighter so that's my primary um income choice there's this kind of like a secondary thing that I kinda went off in bed and that's uh\nThat's kinda why I'm I'm kinda limited as far as the jobs that I I can take\nThe helicopter pilots not make more than firefighters and yell I\nBelieve it or not firefighters are definitely make more\nOkay so you're not planning on quitting the firefighting degree or a career you're going to continue that and part time helicopter pilot\nYes yeah so that's what I Want to do [noise] okay um\nAnd you show U.S forces you to stay in that particular area and it forces you to work in a regular schedule that you can control and so it does limit the number of jobs available which means that having your helicopter pilots life things has a very limited\nValue yeah it's not that ... it's not that valuable to you because of the way you're going to utilize it so I mean you have to just cash flow this is like a like a hobby you're getting paid for your own make some money but if you're not going to make enough money to even justify the expense you've gone too\nYeah so I just I feel I'm I'm too far into it to I guess\nI'm not suggesting you quit but there's just no way in the scenario you've laid out here that it makes sense to do anything except just slow\nDown and go I'm just gonna take me a little time as I got a cash flow this and I got to find the time to do the hours but\nDoesn't pay that much either and that's what I mean they're not worth that last compared to what you're paying you're not even gonna make back you're eighty hours worth of training and the first year\nNo no you're right now\nSo not to mention all the money you've already put on it so um what I Want to do is look for a place\nMean you've got connections in the fire department other lifelike guys or something that you can get some hours in the coal policy can get some takeoffs and landings and get some of the council virtually\nA fork saying those are more complex aircraft and I'm I'm currently find a lot of them that we're at\n... and both have prior craft gotcha not even a\nTurbine yet but um I mean I I've even reached out to people that own their own aircraft and and you know offered to pay for fuel and things like that to kinda do get those are ... and unfortunately a lot a lot of those guys are very busy\nSo I can get in our area now are there but nothing really counts as\nTo who you're going to end up paying for these hours what does the eighty hours cost\n[noise] well considering some of the hour and a place of a you know on the cheap you can get some at two fifty or three hundred five hundred at all and on the aircraft and the kind of a deal you can get you know so\nBecause you know twenty thirty thousand bucks yeah pretty much pretty much yeah and you don't have that laying around obviously negative negative on\nJust take your time and cash flow it because you you now have as we continue the conversation you've even narrowed your opportunities down further because you're in an entry level\nUm ... the simpler versions of helicopters not all of them which is limits the number of jobs you can take even more and so this is slightly above a hobby\nYeah yeah definitely so passionate yeah why not I there's nothing wrong with that as long as you pay cash for it yeah\nBut it's a ... I don't make any money during um I'm trying to make money doing it but it was just a hobby and so that costs money hobbies cost drawn and this was not going to cost you money is actually gonna make you a little once you get past this but up until the point you actually get a check it's going to cost you money and you know you're just going to put another twenty thousand bucks into this thirty thousand bucks in this before you get paid\nAnd um that may take you two years to cash flow that instead of one you're not going to make this year unless you can find some way that the guys that are hiring for the season\nWant to pay for it in return you promise to work there are three years or something like that you know and they want to pay for your hours or something maybe there's somebody looking for a pilot that you know that much intensity\nOr sometimes are unemployed here or will pick up some education costs in order to get somebody on board if they're having trouble finding the help in that area of the health interesting destruction [noise]\nThis today Ramsey show [noise]\n\n\nIt's time to take another look at your budget that\nMeans scouring every expense and making sure you're not leaving any money on the table one of the biggest expenses is your mortgage payment I recommend the quick Churchill checkup and just five minutes our friends at Churchill mortgage\nCan tell

I Would have had checked a I Would add Mitch McConnell\nJust they would have poured Gatorade on them like the big thing would have been it would have been so much more entertaining\nBut they failed to do that\nAnd I just I don't get it I watch some of that but comedy is one of those things though where I look at something like Saturday Night live and I say to myself you are appealing to ... New York\nChicago\nLos Angeles San Francisco maybe Seattle\nClose three two three five three twenty four twenty three at you had been to chose your Twitter you can tweet at me I Love to hear from you Bill Maher over the weekend talked a bit about ah this whole situation with with Kavanaugh\nAnd there are social justice warriors who are crazy enough in this country I fight with them all the time [laughter] who they they lend an acquaintance to this to make people think oh you know what they're going to go after my high school record that's fair game now and it becomes sort of a privacy thing\nYeah it does the high school record now when he was talking about absolutely social justice warriors one hundred and ten percent while they're not as big as we make them out to be the issue is is we give them way too much power in this day and age and he talked about the whole believes thing\nIt does seem like things are more more from listen to any woman who says she's been wrong which is the right thing to do to automatically believe here's the new ... scale here's what Republican\nYes yes that's what's scary\nBelieve believe period\nNeed you process we don't need a trial we don't eat anything you just make the accusation and that enough is all alone is to be believe one hundred percent and due process and everything is out the window\nAnd I don't think that's good for anybody and I think that's what Susan Collins tried to say the other night about Kavanaugh and and I dare say any of the stuff that goes on anymore with social justice warriors because you only have to hear a tidbit of a story to formulate your opinion\nAnd then you run with that even if it's taken out of context even if it's a or whatever is dead or whatever happens we just we just run with it automatically we pay no attention to the rest of it because you're not interested in the full story the facts and the data you're interested in in affirmation of your belief and if you can find a nugget you're going to ...\nOver the weekend show just to Mitch there\nWere a fight how did it go God I got a way it did and I'm not talking about the fight and talking about the fight after the fight back to the program I Love hearing from you could tweet at us as well as Germans Joe also Neal Instagram to the gym at the shoe\n[noise]\nSuch adventure and show [noise]\n\nA good night's sleep is the foundation for good health not getting enough sleep can compound the effects of stress on the body not to mention lack of sleep contributes to premature aging an awakening\nSleep is just as important as diet and exercise but I tried my pillow for the first time and started staying asleep longer and sleeping more deeply I knew I found a real solution to the sleep issues I'd been having like no more ...\nThe differences real you need to experience of yourself that's why I'm working with my pillow to offer my listeners this great deal backed by popular demand\nThe my pillow buy one get one for us here\nGo eight hundred nine four four forty nine Seventy five or go to Michael dot com used promo code Benson to get to my pillows the price of want to get a better night's rest with the world's most comfortable pillow\nMy pillow dot com promo code Benson oracle eight hundred nine four four forty nine Seventy five or visited my pillow dot com and use ... Benson\n[noise] are we going to find jobs [noise]\nYear Akron, Ohio failed to rename Columbus Day after two previous failed attempt Cincinnati renamed Columbus Day indigenous people's day\nYeah because Columbus was a bad do you mean that's that's the\nCame here and he killed untold millions and he brought disease and all of these things with him and he's just an evil person and it it it's ... it's very interesting the way that people\n\nCome at this because we take our modern sensibility right so we have all were woken now we're such a ... society seal woke we are with everything\nEquality all of this stuff the way it is it the quality of outcomes where we're headed everybody's getting stuff everybody's great if you if you believe in this then you're a great person if you believe on the side you're some sort of phobic which I never really understood I got a huge argument somebody over the weekend when people are saying you're transferring making homophobic and I'm like\nI'm not scared of any of those people who want what you think that I think you're getting it wrong but\nIt's funny the way that we we approach this 'cause I look at it like I can I can de compartmentalized time so I like I can look at this day and age say I'm going to put this over here in this thing let's let's break this down and look at his\nIn his day which is not today right\nWhich is five hundred plus years ago and his day he was a bowler\nIn his day in his day\nHe was the Neil Armstrong of his day we're trying to open up new trade routes were doing all kinds of stuff look at the way we're going to check this out like a lot of those people back in those days Magellan and and and all of these these ... it was a dangerous thing\nRight so in his day he was the mayor\nDid he understand that he was going to bring with them diseases that ... that the natives in there you know an indigenous people in the areas that they were at ... we're going to die for God's sakes come on now\nCome on we understood that we sent our\nRight we've spent you know the Russians beat us to space you know and then we were there and what is the first thing they do they they take these guys and they put them in areas where they can't contaminate anything because the last thing they want to some sort of weird superbug we get that now they didn't have that kind of modern technology\nThey didn't they were just a little bit behind\nBut the the way that ... was he a bad dude at times he was but they were also we again we're coming out things like this in our modern sensibility of were were politically correct were well we understand all of these things and blah blah blah blah blah\nAnd we look at and we say it's bad because we look at all of our ... it's not just Columbus I mean look at what they're doing in schools now when they're getting rid of people because well in this day and age\nHe he was for slavery or he owned slaves or and we go back and we start picking apart things and that to me it's ridiculous\nIt really is you have to be able to to look at this and say I can look at you in a way where I can understand in your day and age who you were what you were about and in that day and age in that\nTime that you live that's how things were done\nAnd I don't think you're a bad person or or anything I just think you are who you are in that day and age you don't think a hundred\nYears from now people look back at us and they got stupid we are\nThey're gonna look at computers thinking oh my God they had to play in computers that's what a while they didn't have special eyeballs it became computers got out of the loop\nRight how do they live of course they are\n\nAbsolutely but people can't do that nowadays they can't take a situation\nThe goalpost move and politically correct we all want to be\nFor the world\nBecause they don't like who they were based on the time that we live now and you just can't do that right you just can't do that and if\nAnybody should understand that it's people like sports right like this is a perfect example of ... always trying to compare sports Eris right like oh this era was so much better than this era and that era and they fight it all the time but they don't want to take away any of those areas they just want you know talk about how great that\nWe just want to race all the history could you imagine back saying let's get rid of Babe Ruth altogether\nRight\nBaseball has one of the most infamous human beings that ever played major league sports Ty Cobb wasn't racist anti Semitic awful human being beat up a one armed black grounds keeper and when his wife came to help he beat her up he shot a man\nHe was awful\nBut people can look at it and go you know what yeah okay but we're not going to get rid of all the things he did out there but we want to do that and we want a race in history is where we are now we want to raise our our founding fathers ruined ... all of these things and it's funny because you know having lived in Europe and done all this stuff\nThey look at their we we we look at our history\n\nAnd we want were shamed and we talk about a horrible you are with all these things and in Europe when I was there they didn't do that they they touched a little bit about that but they didn't they didn't want to rewrite it now they're snowflake heat world is starting to try to do stuff like that and you're seeing a lot of that especially in in in Britain but it it's amazing because\nWe have this generation that wants to rewrite history wants to get rid of everybody and we want we we we want to look and say we\nWere so bad here let's just a race all of this together\nThat any more now it's just you're evil and I find that to be ridiculous I don't think Christopher Columbus was anything other than a man\nWho had some ... to say give me a couple of votes could take three of those men give me some money we're going to go do this right some are you still they were going to fall off the earth right that is just that some of your flat or if there is out there they were going to fall off the earth I'm a show you guys that's not going to happen\nNever understanding the ramifications long term and and it's so funny 'cause some people are like well look what he did\nIf he didn't come here somebody else would have\nRight it's like it's like the the people think if if eldest one to come along right like that we would never found rock and roll when that happened and wrong it would have somebody else would have come and maybe that
