captain makes its decision on the spot or we see under orders is he talking to Beijing when he does\nYeah I'd be really really really surprised if the Chinese captain was making decisions on his own because that's not the way the Chinese military works\nIn addition to all the chain of command issues because for instance our captain was not making decisions on his own but you know in China is much more tightly controlled you've got political officers at all levels in the military so these decisions were being made back in ...\nTo can you explain that\nYeah this is the freedom of navigation operation these are not planned by the commander of a ship these are plan not even at the level of seven fleet or I think that we're talking about\n... of the commander of the Indo Pacific region which would be Honolulu and probably even up further up the change to the chief of naval operations top admiral\nAnd indeed I I wouldn't be surprised if the president himself were generally a prize of what the navy was going to do maybe not on a specific um pass by like this one but in general what the plan was\nSo clearly this politically sensitive on both sides and you're not going to have decisions being made at the lowest levels\nA detailed garden we're told within these last hours that Secretary Mattis you will not make\nA trip to China a it's a little unclear whether there was a trip planned and they called it off or whether they were planning and they just decided not to go forward do you find any significance Gordon given Mr Madison's last visit where there were a sharp words that the Chinese are no longer talking ...\nYeah well this is significant you know there were going to be a meeting um they had maybe specifically a ... a set the time but they were definitely going to have it because this was part of an established dialogue\nAnd what happened is the Chinese said that um Secretary Mattis is counterpart was not going to be available so of course the Pentagon I'm\nNo called off that trip\nYou know this is one of those cases where you've you've got the Chinese throwing a temper tantrum is in their interest to have these Milton ... exchanges\nAnd they're calling them off because they're upset about one thing or another and we're seeing this temper tantrum play out it's like you've got sucks in Beijing who are now acting like three year olds\nThat that is\nOr does he accepted meaning does he know where does he said well you know I might not be available now myself\nYeah I ... that's a great question Thaddeus and that decision is not going to be made by Mattis that's going to be made um maybe by the president in consultation with his senior White house staff\nUm you know clearly I think that the administration should say look you know we're not ... not available for meetings with you until you guys decided to act responsibly that would be my response unfortunately that's not the way people in Washington think people in Washington thing that you've got to have engagement you got to have these contacts\nAnd so therefore they appeared desperate to the Chinese to have\nThese discussions these discussions do produce anything except we produce a lot of carbon as we fly over to Beijing are they fly here for really no purpose at all the Chinese are not willing to talk they're not willing to act responsibly I just don't see the point of talking to them\nCoordinate question because you do a great deal of Congress have a great deal conversations with major media figures and you travel\nHave we passed a point guard and where the relationship is broken how we how are we past that now are we are I Know we're very well informed this audience is very well informed China but I Can't tell whether they're still feeling whether there's still some sense that we can repair this I Can't tell\nIf we can repair John but we shouldn't try to repair it because we appear to desperate in the past\nFor like you know what the you know the past were ongoing\nI think the Chinese right now are not willing to talk so I don't see this being repaired um because we're not going to make the effort they're not going to make the effort we have got to raise all sorts of issues of their objectionable conduct they're going to react badly to this\nSo I don't see that we're going to have good relations as people to find good for a very long time\nFor very long time John and you know people can complain a lot about this president but he's doing the right thing with regard to try to and we need to support him\nLater on this evening I Will

goes on from there\nAnd then I was reading earlier we'll get to a little bit later\nThe city festivals there having in San Francisco the children are taken to where people deprecating each other's

a hell of a home they take beautiful good places in one of the decade creates abject\nNightmares what is it about these people\nI think right at its core is the fact that they are motivated frankly by the forces of evil but quite a side of that in order to move forward\nWith their socialist that's really what it is at the end of the day agenda they have to create crises that when ever expansive

they do is they run completely counter to all the things that I've made the west rate which are really a foundation on frankly Christian tennis things like personal responsibility\nEquality of opportunity and um freedom and and so I think that's why we see such a push back and I will say that the reason why they have become so much more militant\nAbout just engaging their agenda and achieving it is because this they couldn't be higher right now for instance in my jurisdiction Toronto has become a sanctuary city to our self professed\nFeminist prime minister as crazy open borders policy an undemocratic open borders policy\nAnd there are shipping and these people by the thousands and to Toronto shelters well our guys who you know have been taxpayers who might have an addiction

show that's what was your show mhm uh but the ignorance of the American public shows up in the capital polls and when you tell people well you know the witnesses that they even clean you know for example for the witness was she claims\nOh say we don't know what you're talking about\nThat the witnesses that she has used\nHave not cooperated what she has said as soon as they do I think it's up to\nYou know a a fifty cent fifty seven percent of people believe that he should be confirmed for that means roughly forty you know because I'm sure there's a few people that go on and so I mean somewhere between thirty five and forty percent don't believe he should be confirmed and of course that's roughly the number of Democrats practiced yeah so as we've always said in any of these\nUh in

else have you paid attention to social media\nBut you can make these people don't even use their real name on so familiar most often I mean it's just and and it's\nTo me it it shows you know that NBC don't ever ever complain\nAbout President Trump using the term fake news and directing it at you right if you put out that kind of pizza trash story yeah based on an allegation and you do an interview knowing going in\nThat this person is walking back everything that they say and you can't find anybody to cooperate if you don't go with that story it's the same thing\nAs I mentioned from I was we talked about yesterday from Eric Brady at USA Today when he\nWrote will shut Brett Kavanaugh will be coaching girls' teams not until the investigation is done and then talked about in its original article a credible source by the way just the amount as I said on yesterday show I I Know Eric Brady um was it used to knew him as a kid he was a really good friends with my neighbor across the street just\nSo people know but it's important history that's what you do in your you let people know that [noise]\n'cause somebody might find out in and I as I said last night I said you know I've I've uh since I knew him when he was young\nAnd you know we've kept in in touch over the years just on Facebook a which is a spate who's Facebook vows to lead but that was a piece of trash article that he wrote and said you know claim that as a news story not an opinion that credible\nAnd that's why when you said that during the break it just it hit home with me they're never going to get off the break here no no this it and it won't end when Trump has no longer president this is not going to end no because in fact they'll feel more empowered\nTrump is the one who called him out the next guy or gal likely won't\nAnd here's what's interesting too so NBC goes with the interview from sweating they admit they can't find anything to back it up anybody else to back it up they go with the interview an interview\nStory on the ... this is the prosecutor brought in to do the questioning at the hearing and the memo was released\nAnd on Monday\nNBC News decided that wasn't worth reporting now if Mitchell had reported that my finding is that judge Kavanaugh is not worthy of being seated on the highest court that would have been the lead headline in fact it would have been an NBC News right\nNow if you're wondering NBC News why\nNightly news is that an all time low\nThat's it nobody believes you and I see right through you\n\nYour hats nothing more nothing less and it's shameful behavior yes oh stop feeling insulted when Trump says your fake news right you're not even worthy of his recognition frankly because you're\nIf you're going to put somebody up there you admit you can't backup independently as a news organization anything the woman is about to say you put her on the memo which is part of the official process that from the prosecutor gets zero to ...\nThat's in and that's what ... that's ... and that by the way coming from a guy who ... who has how many times we sat on this program there are times when somebody needs to just take the the his Twitter account way for a few minutes\nAnd and there are times when he doesn't speak effectively we're he says something that totally doesn't work the communications from this White House have been horrible but that's how bad and NBC but it's all you don't\nOr you shut it you have an earned the right in him because it's also what you get from the left that well because of this president's than there were changing the way that we do thing yeah we haven't no we haven't shall we don't care less active communication we we we never we never change our standards of what we will do whether it's Obama\nWhether it's Bush whether it's Clinton while we were working together with Clinton [laughter] whether whether it's a a Trump we don't care no or certain ... and if the two idiots overnight can do it NBC you certainly have the ability to do it you don't want to do\nAnd no they go out of their way to put somebody on do an actual interview with somebody and that they themselves as a news organization camp backup and one word she's saying but ignore part of the official process and that statement was part the Mitchell a release the memo was part of the official process\nThey could take it and take it to another prosecutor and asked that prosecutor well what did you think did you watch it did you what do you think of Kavanaugh's and Dr Ford's claims\nAnd would you say the same thing the memo did not even that they completely skirted the entire thing\nAnd then you're going to have all these guys and gals chomping on cigars in the boardroom at NBC News trying to think what's going wrong wow are are ratings go well what's what's what's the problem here well it's interesting because one of them\nPolitical this coming from a guy who's clearly on the left and as the founder of the network\nAnd then you have a the the uh the the former show runner really at the Greenfield Jeff Greenfield yeah or who ran CNN for years comes out and says\nThe people that work at CNN [noise] think that they're part of our act as if they're the quote a they they count themselves as part of the anti Trump\nResistance but we know that we see it it's it's very obvious but when you have other people that were you know there before that can look at it and say this is clear what's going on these people are active it they're not journalists\nThey instead of opinion they're not even they won't even be a ... they they like cowards tied behind the word analysis that's the new word for opinion right opinion at\nThe top yeah but opinion should be based on some well see I Know why your hand analysis should be\nHere's the situation but it's not it's here's my opinion so if you're going to have an opinion piece called opinion but you know what cats already out of the bad people see right through these\nNews organizations it's not tolerated anymore and you wonder why they're not trusted and you wonder why those CNN shows are at the bottom of the cable news and NBC it's at the bottom of the

reading the political article about Mitch McConnell are saying ah you know hey would like to vote this weekend in American really are saying well if the FBI investigations finished by Wednesday\nAnd I've been hearing this even though not officially different articles stating that yeah the FBI could get this wrapped up leaving heard Tuesday right or that or what Sunday or Monday I forgot what I heard that ... and now I hear in Wednesday it can be of a you know wrapped up even though the president has said\nYou know you can expand it but how far do you expand what does that mean expanding it expanded what\nWell what allegations and it well it would be expanding it too and in the in fact the coverage that I read was expanding it to essentially anybody that might be connected with these allegations which is the any other claimed witness along the way\nAnd if you expand it to that\nWell you may first of all you may or may not get cooperation from that person this was not a criminal investigation so they can they can call you or you know ask you\nA show up at your door and ask you if you would mind talking to them about this but that person doesn't necessarily have to do that legally they don't have to talk to them and they're not they're not this is again not a criminal investigation and that person is not the target it if it were\nAnd there are some people that don't want to be dragged into it\nThis is why we we thought it was interesting that that Kavanaugh pointed out the many women that supported him because he said basically his point was they knew full well

they'll tell you you don't have to go there you don't I don't know if you really don't I don't have to go anywhere to know what a significant portion of the middle class is thinking well even remember the ... the reporter who worked for the times\nThat didn't even leave in his apartment to through the stories they said he went to was the name Brian Williams I don't think it was [laughter] but but [laughter] you know you don't even have to I mean\nIs this real analysis not the opinion how can you be doing that\nIn an election year if you really don't know what the sentiment is\nI'm not expecting them to have the same internal by the campaign without or that a party would have but I Would expect that they would certainly have somebody maybe inside those campaigns are parties\nThat would see some things and say okay it's there are real because Obama is always a twenty percent chance he said that after the election but really you know it was a couple of idiots overnight said\nDon't don't buy the hype and Pennsylvania watch Pennsylvania watch Pennsylvania\nBecause there was something else going on and it was anecdotal but if if we could see that really with out and we did research that we're not going to say there were no tools but we don't have the tools that are available\nThat a news organization like the New York times or Washington Post or any of them have they have rooms filled with people that can whack and do that we had to restart\nWe didn't have what either party had that two weeks before they started seeing the turn in Pennsylvania right uh in Michigan and Wisconsin then and we you know we might have had anecdotal evidence but we didn't have the same information\nThat they had where they started seeing that that the turn and and you know remember that as you look at the polls now I mean we're ... we're I'm very interested in what the polls are going to do\nNow for those people that because we always get the people who call a pollster number right actually they are ... you can find polls as we have done if you listen to the show for any length of time\nWhether it was really twenty twelve and twenty sixteen will really started looking and saying okay what polls were actually correct and what you find out is\nA yeah two months out three months out four months out the polls aren't they\nTime you get to a couple of days beforehand or people for example say that the polls for drop are completely wrong or they weren't you know there were polls that were dead on for the numbers\nThey may not have the poll didn't figure out the electoral votes and you know you and I said well maybe they should start doing that I don't know how much money would cost them to do it right but the the by the time you got to the the the polls are done on what the people are thinking\nUh and and so to get to those specific districts and and break them down you would probably need more votes you wouldn't be need more numbers than what you what your sample sizes\nYou know country countrywide so that might be a very tough thing to actually do to predict\nBut they did know the internal polls they started knowing about two weeks before that there might be a shift happening uh in in certain districts are in Pennsylvania and and uh Michigan and in Wisconsin\nBut the fact that the polls on the where the people voted some of them were dead on yeah you're right I mean just within a half a percentage to a point of the actual numbers\nAnd they said don't show Hillary winning Leno show with Hillary would get in the raw vote and that's what she did get\nVery close to it and the same thing for Trump he won the electoral college ... so you know that's something that they've since we've had to elect ... you know two very close votes ... ah you know back in two thousand and and uh in in twenty sixteen\nYou know maybe they should start looking to see if they could pole and then\nFigure out the electoral college you know that way if there's a better way it was a better way to do it but\nWell you don't you start back in the day with Tim Russert he would he would sometimes break it down and say and paint scenarios going look if this happens here and these districts here and those districts and this this priests\nHe would break those down but you couldn't really I don't know that there was a that wasn't so much of a poll as it was really a demonstration\nAs to where it might go it wasn't based on sentiment that wasn't based on respondents that was based on basically history and indeed given precinct or or any given

voter motivation\nOn the right to me is much greater than it was two weeks ago I don't know if I can necessarily say that about the ... because I think the left has been on maximum overdrive for the

[noise] I just want to talk about the the the president and the agreement on the new trade deals [noise] uh yesterday this was the president's talking about it yesterday by the way without tariffs\nWe wouldn't be talking about a deal just for those babies out there that keep talking about tariffs that the truth Congress so pleased don't charge tariffs without tariffs you wouldn't be we wouldn't be standing here\nAre just want to spend a couple of moments on this we know people want to talk about the cabin all thing but uh this is really a huge deal that I and I do think that\nUh this is something that the president politically can use a ... to help in the midterms when he's out there doing the rallies you know the the ... we got the trade agreement and everything else\nNow the specifics of the the the trade agreement some good some bad mhm uh now the good is we don't go to a situation where we don't have any trade deal with Canada and Mexico that would be bad if the president decided to go in that\nIn that direction I still don't think we won't know and it's very tough to predict what's going to happen\nUh but I don't think the president would have ever gone that direction to begin with because there would have been pushback from the Congress\nBecause he knows that terrorists aren't good he's admitted it yes\nUh but the the the when you look at this the free trade agreement and I got an email today from guy saying you guys are the only true conservatives the think this deal stinks well number one we haven't really given her opinion on the deal and as we said last night\nThere are some parts of it we don't like at all including the major portion that the president has promoted but there's some good things in there are now we did open up some agriculture and dairy\nNow we heard about the dairy that was one of the big things the president promoted but as of Wall Street journal points out\nWe will only expand our market by one percent when it comes to dairy in Canada but still it's movement in the right direction mhm and if you're making that more free trade world for that and that's a good thing\nOr one of the reasons we didn't hear about timber is because that's one of the victories of Canada got\nWhat Canada got was the president remember what the tariffs on soft timber or in April I Believe it was\nWell that's going to be retracted and the president just can't do it again under the new free trade agreement that has to go to a basically an arbitration panel a panel would have to decide whether a tariff was justified\nThe president used the term and talked about the babies when it comes to ... be known as the tariffs babies which I\nBut I don't know why but I Love that I have a bunch of babies the [laughter]\nThe [laughter] the the\nTerror of babies [laughter] and and uh our opinion has always been based on economics or is nothing personal here uh it's it's all based on economics here's look there's a couple of things with the president promoted clearly when he talked about what he wanted in a trade in in ... in the trade\nTrade deal isn't going to help him accomplish that at all you know she didn't bring that up is going to reduce the trade deficit and or the other thing that the president said he wished to do is she wished to bring manufacturing back to the United states right now

because I think they specifically didn't put the effort in there but the trade agreement with Canada and Mexico had just say this this might have been a little bit off the topic and moving more

deprecating humor from Donald Trump yeah\nYou know the last time that I've given came close to that was and no one saw it because it was in the middle of the night in the U.S\nI said two things about uh you know the president and and the timing of things so when he was that the the summit in Singapore ... after they did the the photo up with Kim Jong il and he had his own press conference\nAnd he said to reporters these were global reporters saying look in a year from now I might be I might tell you that this deal did not work out didn't go the way I wanted and I'll probably make up a story you know make up an excuse\nThat was self deprecating humor and the other point that that I think uh that the other thing that America Mr course was his his wind in his victory speech that night of the election and and twenty sixteen um because what I what I heard was a humble public servant speaking and\nYou know the president I think in in front of the people\nEspecially right now we talked about his cabinet being settled in after the first year how he started to appoint people and we said look this is going to play out differently because they the people who are being appointed\nIf they accept that you know or if they're that nomination than they know what they're in for right so he's getting the people that the put the cabinet and place and the staff in place that he really wants in his second year\nI think the case could be made by recent activity or lack of activity\nThat may be the president did this also settling in with the media or he's been directed to tone it down a bit until after the midterms it could be either or but I I I Do believe that the president has always been\nIn the private sector comfortable in his own shoes\nThat changed when he went from having zero bosses to having more than three hundred and twenty million bosses in one night and I think it you know I think it it it had him kind of all over the place or for a number of reasons during the campaign and after the campaign\nAs he became president and I think there's a case to be made as he's settling in and learning the job and and is now ... knows what he can do and what he can't do\nI think there's probably a little more thought\nBased on recent behavior going into communication and how you interact with media\nBecause here's the thing he's winning\nOn the cabinet nomination they wanted an FBI background check he gave it to him then expanded the whole thing on Monday he's winning when you look at the things that that he's put out there\nBecause they think that they're winning they know he's winning they know he's resonating in the media especially that's why they call it the resistance than the first place\nIf you want to get in lines are open eight six six Ninety right I

[laughter] [laughter]\nI guess I guess they were all end up on this big part out together now [laughter] [noise] well I mean what you think about it if if Republicans are because\nYeah and we're not at war no it's not that and it's the Republicans and we're not into recession throwing seven hundred a ... billion dollars that at a banks or\nAny of that it's it's the Republicans spending I asked this question in all seriousness if Democrats were able to take over both or the Senate and the house and what would there\nNever will move the president's budget B that he would hand them and what would the Democrats want\n\nThey're Republicans and I don't want to use a drunken sailor analogy because I I think it's unfair to to drunken sailors but at least a drunken sailors route of high school how did they drink yeah but and they were out of high school and they were drinking and did they throw out ice on anybody got it all relates doesn't it uh\nBut how much would Democrats ... Republicans are ... are spending this much and and the fact is I look I don't blame the Republican Party and I don't blame the president why the American people don't care can people don't care 'cause there's no political pressure this will continue\nAs I said this is this is my uh twenty ninth anniversary or this week uh doing talk radio uh the first issue that we hit which was back in eighty nine\nWas the whole clean sweep that Congress will spending too much money\nAnd it's time for a clean sweep and monarch forget to protest all over the country people in front of congressional offices saying we need to cut back I think the deficit at that time was\nFour trillion or less ... maybe even three ... don't even remember what it was at that point right but it was nothing and people were upset about it they were actually marching in the streets about the debt [laughter] [noise]\nYeah like donate some of them are marching Larry's what are you guys marching for that\nAmerican uh uh went into debt eighty I think it's eighty\nOne hundred dollar last year from the fed or get them every working American the the that's that basically as it is split up on every working American that adds eighty one hundred on your behalf\nBut remember in the tax bill last year mhm the only the only kind of people that are actually paying more for the debt paying more in taxes are people like Eric and myself who's taxes actually went up yes\n'cause we're enormously wealthy exactly that's why we're as the one caller said a couple of years ago billion a billionaire yes which was a surprise to all of us yes keep it up\nI'll tell you this if I was a billionaire ... I'd get rid of the my Fifteen year old vehicle that has two hundred and ten thousand model oh yeah yeah yeah no I put that out what the trash [laughter] that would be going my butler would I Would\nBut because of certain business ... we both share a we can't take them anymore and therefore our our businesses did matter [laughter] no nobody cares about oh we're not upset\nThat we are actually looked at the tax by the tax thing was the right thing to do is we evolved in state of before a irrespective of the unfairness towards us other problems 'til the spending a and\nAnd that's what it comes down to ... because the the the fiscal policy\nUh you know you you look at the the monetary policy of this this nation and and while all over the place especially in recent years but like over the last Twenty years especially\nBut beyond that the fiscal policy become something very different because and this is it once you start creeping in once you get the foot in the door it as the government provides is provides this provides this will start talking about making cuts start walking\nBack on a this program this federal program and yours your child's school no they'll start taking things away that's when people start getting motivated that's when they start paying attention now they wouldn't they still wouldn't be able to tell you the majority of them\nAre they still wouldn't be able to name the three branches of government but they would tell you to get out and you are not welcome in that kind of policy is not well there is because this is what it comes down to for a Obamacare spending\nAnd a number of issues that conservatives are watching and had been watching for ever enter important because they've always been important but this does it end Obamacare as one of those\nYou know on the way to getting to what the single payer system but the idea that you're going to get something and somebody else is going to pay for it well then the liberals like that one couple in California well we'd like to Obamacare we voted for Obama we didn't know we were going to have to pay for\nWhy even though you have when you had Jake Tapper of CNN and and even Chris Cuomo\nQuestioning occasional Cortez reality and get them in Florida and and and Gillum about you know the ... of Medicare for all right they understand what we're spending right now how do you pay we're already going to be a trillion dollars in debt audio ... you can't pay for all ... or what we're paying\nFor it today it's impossible so the only thing you could do is put massive debt\nOn the ah on the American people the other thing that isn't being talked about either as the because interest rates are going up and how much of a bigger bite that's taking in how much interest payments the American taxpayer it's growing exponentially yeah every single year now and we've talked about that over the last year but a\nA until it actually starts affecting people and that may be you know you know too late it could be ten years\nThat is immoral and nobody wants to hear it but it's absolutely immoral and unethical to be putting what we want today on the backs of future generations we have is we have stated before\nWe found a loophole of taxation without representation we found the loophole your tax the future they didn't vote for it they had no representation they had no say in it they're completely innocent and all of this\nAnd we have found the most moral way and we just hide our heads and the stance than let's put it on them and because I said that I expect\nTo get the emails today which I always get whenever I said that oh you're exaggerated the debt really isn't bad it's all in control in debt is all part of it\n... ...\nI Hope that sues you're guilty conscience

not named the freedoms and the first amendment to the constitution of the United states\nThe majority couldn't name ... uh you know a ... more than one freedom which was no no no the majority good named one freedom which is freedom of speech they couldn't even they couldn't even name that that's more we understand how people may not know the story\nForm our opinions and that's the way that you should do it but it goes more than just the news stories it's that after a while I was listening\nTo multiple sources shark and my for my own opinion\nAbsolutely that's what we always say don't believe us go do your own research ship\nAnd as far as the computer goes well I'm sixty years old and I've done killed three of them so I'm not really that good with\nThings that are in a [laughter] I\nSaid wait a minute is that what it is that I'm waiting on saving up for a new computer now 'cause it just died but is that the Internet is that the Internet's fall during the fall\n[laughter] and I had one of those [laughter] little fiction and I bought a sixty dollar for stuff ...\nI don't know why my computer dry cleaning a ticket to professional repair abortion and they said they couldn't fix it they didn't call more than the bottom of the computer [laughter] wow wow I log on to buy a laptop I'm no go stand alone computer goes they're cheaper than a lot\nYeah Robert thank you so much for your call but you think you know when when I used to when I used to work or the six days a week working twelve hours a day at the the steel mill\nA A R I remembered that uh I I remember 'cause\nA lot of my work third shift remember listening to Larry King of the radio wasn't listen to music as well as in Larry King ah there really wasn't much other talk radio at that time but you know gangster when everything else and you know paying attention to news reading books reading the newspaper I wanted to know what was going on\nBut it isn't the fact just to let you know Robert we understand that people are busy\nI Know some of my really good friends part of the reason I'm good friends with them is they never listen to me they really don't know a a ... there are so busy in their career\nThey really don't know them a new show what's going on like a lot of our audience does because you're really into it\nBut the fact is they're not out there promoting and opinion that's to me the problem the confidence or the arrogant or or you have a particular narrative in your head of what's right so you pick up bits and pieces\nAnd you pro claim that you have absolute authority on a particular topic when after five seconds anybody in the know will tell you you don't know what you're talking about right and that's it the air is not having the lack of knowledge on a particular area\nThere's too many things for people to know there's things\nOn on topics that I have no clue love and I'm not going to try to be asked my way through it I'm not going to go into the mechanic today\nAt one time I was able to tear apart an engine and put it back together again I couldn't even attempt that today and if I went in and started pointing out tubes and started saying well this does that and that does this and this does that\nA modern day mechanic would look at me and say you're full of it you have no idea what's going on and that's the problem that I see people that are so confident or maybe it's arrogant\nTo believe that they know exactly what's going on and after five seconds anybody that with any critical thinking skills will say I don't have a clue well where does that come\nFrom there's it's it's the citizen is greatly empowered by enact a or acting on\nInformation real information but\nThere's great risk to this country by people acting on lack of information that's a different uh being ignored for whatever reason whether you just choose not to follow the news or you're too busy or whatever it is is one thing\nActing\nToday's ... not just issuing an opinion anymore on social media remember we saw last friday that's why we're still talking about Kavanaugh it is to get in your face or what they call the direct approach\nAnd the media is helping the media\nIs NBC and all of them are helping spread the lives just by giving them a forum\n[noise] you're you're there's two problems so there are people that are ignorant and willfully ignorant and wanting to form an opinion based on their ignorance and then there's those in the media that understand the ignorance and understand if we lie to them and as we've said before and we talked about this last week lined by omission\nWere newspaper articles will say we didn't lie it there's not an untruth in here yeah but you let this out and you let that out right which gives a completely\nDifferent slant until the story and leads people in a different direction from the truth that is a lie that's lined by omission right and they understand as we said Jonathan Gruber set it we can lie to these people I'm sure we can lie to the stupid\nAmerican public will remember buzzfeed politic claim or a disclaimer on that story they knew they couldn't verify we have no way to verify any of this we're ... we're going with

of this the New York times\nInterviewed dozens of individual individual people and could not find anyone with first hand knowledge of her claim and she's now walking back her own claim\nNow that

lose like six hundred calories but then when you're done jogging you drink a milk shake yeah that doesn't ... lost about ... gained about three pounds right\n[noise] yes I'm In you have to plan things out\nBe a little bit good ahead of time so you can dream you know because I think that for people it's so hard to deprive themselves or something\nSo really learning what better for you than not is very important\nAnd I think working with a physicians who can help you like an empty VIP there that physicians have the time the tools that technology to work with you\nThat is one of the problems with our health care system today is in primary care you know if you go to your physician and you're talking about your blood pressure or the sinus infection that you have or your diabetes and before you know it they have their hand on their door knob because you've had your eight minutes and they're running out and this is a\nLong conversation this is a serious conversation\nI mean you talked before about sort of a stigma you know obesity has been named the disease by American Medical association and all of the Medical Association so it's just the same as having diabetes or heart disease and in fact sure obesity leads to both of those things and\nYou could just have America you lose the weight to stay healthy we would decrease like two thirds of cardiovascular deaths and all the complications a lot of the complications from diabetes I mean there's so much and and decrease the rates of cancer because obesity leads\nTo cancer diabetes and heart disease\nAnd I know oh the body type a studies there are the relatively new and how does one or try to find out who do they go to work with\nA possibly their primary care physician beginning start on learning how to find out your particular body site\nRight yes I mean working with your primary care physician I'm an empty VIP we also have a body composition analysis scale so that you find out what you're saying\nBurn off just breathing and living and\nYou know some people say they have a slow metabolism yet that number will show them they do not but you can then work with your physician to say this is how much I burn off so let's be scientific about it so if I Want to lose weight I Need to take it a little bit less in calories\nExercise a little bit and\nAll of that will help you get to your goals\nInteresting now ... ah and ah I I don't like to you to put the the light on myself much but I Know there seems to be a higher incidence of women and so I ruined problems over the last twenty five years and my own wrong on that\nYou are not in fact a women always have had higher thyroid disease or more\nCommonly have thyroid disease then men with a lot of the independent type of things women can have it more often than men um I think there is because the blood test for identifying thyroid disease have gotten better over the last Twenty years that's likely why we hear more of it because physicians believe\nThe testing now to say we know this is accurate and I can't follow it so that I can determine if you truly have a thyroid problem\nOr if you do not I mean the one on one biggest we're glad\nWhen I'm really afraid of in the future I see too many fat kids and I believe that we're going to start seeing the average age of death start going back down because there's no way when you are\nNine years old and a hundred pounds than you are going to have a long and healthy life ...\nNot at all because in fact life expectancy has started going down in the United states\nAre total in karate this morning about exactly that\nAbout diabetes most people got type two diabetes when they were in their seventies and eighties and that's why they call today\nI mean can you hear of people who are you a couple in their twenties would type two diabetes and to your point nine ten year old the type two diabetes and it was related I'm related to type ... diabetes tendency to run in families by\nYou keep yourself healthy and at a let's say fighting then you can push off incidents that starting of diabetes for years\nAnd we know that for what it is also a I mean I don't mind rain and sugar will will stressed the system more so you really use more insulin to bring the sugars down and you know she you know yes you will end up having diabetes earlier\nAnd said something so boy double or at least

seemed ludicrous to me as it is because he wasn't from politics and then he starts to win and I started to think about like why is this happening why is the public supporting Donald Trump nothing

don't drink\nImagine if I had what a mess that they would I be I'd be the world's worst\nAnd people love that even the trade group with standing behind him or her leave for an hour well he took questions Tucker\nTucker you're you're very interesting because as much as you're into the traditional\nWashington speak as as a way it's always done you wide open to doing something to do with taking in Trump and noticing rather than judging notice he's doing things different but saying not necessarily he's doing things wrong that's different than a lot of a lot of Republicans in a lot of Democrats why you open to that\nBecause it's needed because the decisions that the people in charge made have been disastrous not just small decisions for big decisions on the economy and foreign policy on the culture they're having to work that's why the middle class is dying that's what Trump got elected\nThat's the best part of the downside of Trump because he doesn't know how to get things done because he doesn't understand government doesn't care about details but the best part\nIs his willingness to say obviously through things like maybe we should secure the borders or what are we still doing in Afghanistan or why are the other signatories to our trade deals not living up to their end of the bargain et cetera those are all totally true things that everybody agrees with except in Washington or the people who made the decisions are embarrassed to admit they're wrong\nTrump takes a lot of crap for not apologizing that's a fair criticism but how about the policymakers who got us into all this garbage in the first place where they apologized never what did they learn from their mistakes nothing\nI mean do you know what I'm saying like that's the best part about Trump is telling obvious truth is\nAlways know you as an opinion guide the Daily Caller is part of that you know so do you decide to to launch that\nUh and it's doing shit incredibly well it's on everyone's punch list in the morning you have three o'clock in the morning for me later for you to find out what's happening new and get a perspective but the other thing is you choose to do something almost nobody else does you choose to book and engage people that disagree\nThat is you want to have to defend your argument in your a block almost every night\n[noise] no I mean that's organic that's what I Believe it I mean I'm very liberal in the truest sense of liberal I Believe in free speech and the free exchange of ideas I Believe an openness I really do\nI don't I'm exactly the same on the air as I'm off the air I only say what I really think you might think I'm a total buffoon maybe you're right but it's in the early who I Am and I think that you should if you're advocating for something explain what it is you're advocating for\nExplaining reasoning what exactly are you saying these are not hard things you seek to influence public policy and the weigh three hundred million people live their lives you should have to explain it\nI I sincerely believe in that it's a core belief\nBut you also research you're not just winning it and going on instinct you are to defend your argument but you research and go to be you can go deep on your argument you can go layers deep you're not going to just out a out yell somebody\nWell yeah but I mean the the good news for me is I control what the terms are so\nI decided what we talk about and I don't know I don't know much about the law the sea treaty or abstract art so we don't do a lotta segments on those things which is a shame it is a shame actually I'm I'm against both just for the record right but we do topics that I care about that I think are really important immigration is one of them and\nI don't know that's what I'm paid to do is to learn about stuff so I Do write you\nYou're the one who gets paid I did not know who that was so we did Britain hear the topic was the name of the book and we're gonna talk about this uh of on a ... as long as the book is a out and you want to come back\nBut you look at the Democratic party and under a minute and you said this thing has changed I guess this is a different debate we're having I asked you sent TV Patel wait until the radio audience the bottom\nLine is it's a mirror image of what it was when I grew up in the things that they once defended free speech due process colorblindness they now attack why because now they're in power and so the people in power always against free speech because it's inconvenient for them it's\nThat liberals took power and so they became the opposite of what they were and that's the best found on college campus exact exactly sadly yes right Tucker Carlson up and said about the new it's always great congratulations on the runaway success of your show\nAnd good luck with the book ship a fool's how selfish ruling class of bringing America to the brink of revolution Tucker go get him you Brian [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] I talk to one of those points in K I find I'm going to teach me the station [noise]\nOr in the ... in in the in the legal system in the law in the community\nAnd have this reputation so a couple of things\nWhen it comes down to the actual vote itself\nIt's got to come down to Murkowski Collins and flick so Senator Jeff flake asked say I've been to vote this out of committee but I'm going to give it seven days by friday I Want to investigation and then we'll move forward or not depending on what they find try to read between the lines I sense he's hedging cut seven\nDoes no good to have an investigation that just gives us more cover for example we actually need to find out where we can find out how we have to realize that we may not be able to find out everything we've got to do for swimming us to\nKnow what does that mean now to the president's credit according to the Washington Post and he said it publicly I said to these I told the FBI expand if you have to you know whenever you have to follow which you have to follow\nNow that said you were a person who comes out and sat down with Kate Snow of NBC her story is almost farcical it's a bad fiction novel\nI challenge you to listen to her speak and not have all the all the fire alarms in your head go off and say not telling the truth not telling the truth not telling the truth sadly if she was the victim of of ah what she claims is a group set on unwanted group sex\nThat is terrible but she cannot link Kavanaugh's to the scene that he had a red caught that he would add to women that the punch was\nCan your life would stand these types of wild cat allegations so Lindsey Graham looked at this is seeing how this has developed obviously he knows Kavanaugh for Twenty years fan of 'em on every level and says this cut their team\nI don't think we're going to find anything new from this supplemental FBI investigation to take Jeff from a yes or no I think than or Murkowski answer Collins want to make sure that the FBI\nThat their homework to check the committee's work that that ... that that are were was good I think that's what this is all about no more not expanding it to all this crazy stuff\nNow listen ... Lindsey Graham has got to do something that they used to do that you would expect which McConnell do and I think he would just sit down with her and say listen you're Republican forget about this guy the sexual assault thing does not stand up it wouldn't stand up to a relative in your house or good friend of yours you would not accept it\nSo you saw his record you see President Bush making calls and kind of leads to rise backing them thoroughly Brad Blakeman who work with them every single day you see the people that know um don't get caught up and pay back for not ceding talking to Merrick Garland that is what the foundation of this\nAnd a lot of these people in jail or liberals and see a change in the court and the change in the country if he ceded and they're willing to say yeah I saw him drunk maybe it was having a few beers in the hallway doesn't mean he did anything wrong\nAnd Deborah Ramirez says I have some people that will cooperate my story will see because if you want to corroborate just story maybe you should have told the New Yorker because it didn't come up in the New Yorker magazine story a jealousy on news Ninety six five in Orlando Hey Joe\nHey yeah obviously the Democrats ... but I Do want to point out that when you're accused of a criminal act you should take the fifth and I think the judge was\nWell he was ...\nBut he would say this was a criminal accusation it's like the ...\nI don't get what what's the what's the point of view there you are in other words but if you're innocent till proven guilty and you're innocent why wouldn't you use that opportunity to show you were innocent\nOr the point of the Fifth Amendment is to put it on the prosecution and say you prove it I'm not even talking about it\nBut you know we're not in a criminal proceeding\nNot in a criminal proceeding he's in he's testifying on his background where there was one of his three hundred nine cases or is a ten year was eight years with President Bush or his years on the on the circuit court\nThis is one of ... and now it's personal behavior these are just questions it's beyond a job interview which was supposed to be I get that but you can't say it's a criminal behavior I mean criminal proceeding\nThanks so much for the call a you know way should have taken the fifth I I don't understand from that\nUm so ... there's there's a lot going on here the person that makes the most sense who isn't just a right wing zealots and a right wing or defense counsel is Lindsey Graham\nHe has a really good idea he said they want to mix this entire thing if they want to just say oh we're not going to pass him if these Republicans won't get on board we know this is ... by Jeff Flake he is out so he will not be a problem in the new uh with the new term\nWe know it's probably going to be Senator Rick Scott so that won't be a problem he will probably be chairman is Senator Lindsey Graham of the uh of the judicial branch of the judicial committee\nOf justice committee so it looks like grass is going to step aside and he basically says why don't we put it to the American people again let's decide\nTo the people who put us there and see things Trump state that elected President Trump to do exactly what he's doing I'm cutting taxes and appointing conservative judges they're okay with the decision there senator I don't think we're going to get there I think we're going to get fifty plus but if we thought one vote short for the good of the nation\nOut with a pill this to the people of the country and let them have a say\nAt the ballot box Joe listening in Boston Joe\nHey Brian it's just it seems so profoundly juveniles if they're going back to high school and seeing how many beers\nYes yup and also the same time really hypocritical when in the last administration you had a president but admitted to cocaine use in his own books\nIn that it at that age\nYeah exactly exactly so apparently you can't beat Supreme Court justice but you're going to be the guy that picks the Supreme Court shows\nHuh that is a great point which I'm not ... brought up before now some of the media say that he no longer has the credibility of the accuser it's about Kavanaugh approving his credibility which I think it's scary\nThe White House does say they will expand the investigation but they're not going to just look into how much he drank in college to look at incidents and it's not clear if he's going to talk to said you work or not\nBut they are talking obviously Deborah Ramirez already there talking to mark judge right now they're going to talk to Patrick Smith they could have done that already I imagine they're always going to talk to that woman Leland who was friends with a doctor forward when they were younger ah I'm not sure how much further they gonna go\nCarl is you know like K O L T and Scott's bluff Nebraska Carl\nHello Brian and love your show thanks so much Lewis wondered\nBet ah just wanted to mention that uh the remember a Senator Reid in Nevada during the Iran election and he brought a thing that he had information that they had ever pay taxes\nAnd his response was well he didn't get elected that ... that's exactly what's going on here [noise]\nAbsolutely I mean in that idiot Harry Reid or from the Democratic perspective decides to make it a simple majority and nuclear option getting these judges passed\nAnd because of that now you have Trump doing the fifty one fifty one votes these judges get through despite the thirty hour delay of game per nominee from a Schumer and now it's Supreme Court justice you could have the new you have the nuclear option or else they would really have to weigh in this process because you need sixty votes\nBut that was all Harry Reid's a bad play Chuck loose on W. L. A. D. and Poughkeepsie New York hey Chuck\n[noise] yes which any Milo will tell you my truck\nOh yes I Want to talk about the FBI or the seventh and investigations yup and they've done six before is on told everybody told and what I say is that if they turn up something now or the seventh what does this say about the other six one\nOf which are more with more which for them with our with their arms and legs of the president of the United states and all of world visitors versus a very long time so I Would go back\nAnd look at the certainly somebody ought to go back and look at the previous six ah inquiries that he's been through\nWelcome to the Washington Post the president was not happy according to his advisors they cannot talk show which tentatively about drinking with his last hearing a and at the news conference Trump was somewhat under caught\nCabinet when he said this or he did Kevin knowledge difficulty with alcohol let's listen I watched him I was surprised at how\nWas about the fact that he likes beer\nAnd he's had a little bit of difficulty I mean\n... says that he was perfect with respect to alcohol I Know I thought he was actually going back so many years I thought he was a excellent\n[noise]\nSherrie Westin over three hundred thousand Amazon workers will be getting a raise in less than a month\nBefore dawn that Amazon's facility in ...

I think I might have done something I regret in high school and college do you think anyone listening right now has done things in high school and college they regret\nI can be perfectly honest with you that I walked the fence mostly through high school and college and I was fortunate enough to fall on the good side I turned out to be a pretty good guy a but I'll tell you I had some close calls\nYeah and a lot of people that say no no I'm not as if people say well what about sexual okay it's an accusation\nThat Brett Kavanaugh vehemently denies and he has a thirty year plus professional record which is the envy of almost every professional who is often the justice system on any level legal system on any level that I Know of\nSo you have to get him by going back to Nineteen eighty five while acknowledging from Nineteen eighty five to president which is a lotta years\nNothing went wrong so if she was assaulted at a party that she doesn't remember where she was how she got there how she left\nAnd who invited her and he doesn't remember her and mark judge doesn't recall any of this and our best friend doesn't remember anything why should we ruin somebody's life because Debbie were mirrors drink so much as a freshman she blacked out and has claims\nThat did that a judge Kavanaugh now did something exposing himself to her and now she has ten witnesses to it even though at the New Yorker magazine ruining fatter oh couldn't find these ten witnesses the New York times couldn't find any witnesses now she's got ten\nIt's amazing what could happen if the whole Democratic Party comes out in force for you [noise] thank Steve please I Hope you don't undercover an ice scandal in my ... and my background or next let's go out to Thomas listened W.

[noise]\nI cannot specifically say that he was one of the ones who assaulted me\nIf you ...\nSpring quite well I agree we have no choice guilty is you have is number ... this is horrible if this happened to her and I don't believe anything she says because none of it seems credible but if this happened to urge terrible why she went to a party with a with groups ... going on ten times\nIs also worthy of a question\nYou know I just thought of something also you know where was he a the days that ah OJ Simpson didn't kill his wife right exactly you're right I think I think I mean I think you know and what about all the times he didn't try to kill her [laughter] you know what why did he get credit for that if the glove doesn't fit you must acquit right\nSo ... as long as there's nobody in her life that knows her well the thing she might be up to something\nI'm willing to believe Julie sweat Nick so let's just see what her ex boyfriend thinks cut their history\nIf you ask me personally I Believe for a I don't believe in you know personally I don't believe her I really don't believe her no one knows better I mean nobody knows Julie ... I mean and uh you know he can say that the ones but the fact that I Know and that's what I came here to tell the truth I mean I Know how she is\nYeah okay uh as you have any more to say Richard ... thirty four\nYou know she was always wanted to be the center of attention and then showed it was way to do something major so we're trying to impress me where everything she basically was telling me that she was exaggerating everything if anybody knows Julie on the person I mean I Know because they were her\nAnd everything that came out of her mouth was just exaggerations and that she never mentioned that to me at all and it's something that I was very surprised to hear this is actually that was very surprised blocks from the are making these concessions because you have never ever mentioned that to me at all\n[noise] Michael I have an audio to stick with district to porn stars this is this is going to hurt him he was not been hurt by the Stormy Daniels thing at all it actually can of ... you think you think it will hurt him I mean I Hope it does\nDemocrat out there I think any lawmakers going to say that you made a lot of sense are you kidding me Chuck Schumer on the phone

her Shelly thanks [noise] I've never had one of our\nTroops should charge [noise] I talk to those points a tea and K I find off each station [noise]\nIs the chances went up that Brett Kavanaugh would be the cute and the Trump would have to pick Amy Coney Barrett or ... or another of the twenty four\nJudges who are on his short list\nNot a very short list uh so the chances of that happening went up but what also went up where the chances that Kavanaugh would be confirmed with fifty five or fifty six votes with a bipartisan vote\nAnd that went up because if the FBI comes back and says look we looked into everything here we can't find cooperation to prove or disprove this yes and ... and and that's what they get if if we get back to\nA there is no evidence there is no way to corroborate this story in any way then we're back to the chance that Kevin gets a bunch of democratic votes I looked at a poll out of North Dakota that was yesterday\nA Heidi Heitkamp to the poll said two things uh Heidi Heitkamp is not going to be a U.S senator for a lot longer but it also said that um the issue this is a galvanizing focusing issue\nFor a Republican and independent voters in red states watching this happen has put a Joe Manchin has put Claire McCaskill has put Joe Donnelly in a very difficult positions [noise]\nBecause Joe Donnelly came out right before Jeff Flake to reverse course and said not voting for him so he took a bit of a political risk now now they're back and play that well I might change my mind it might change his mind but Chris but Chris you should know this I I always think Kevin guys like Chris Coons to be sober and and\nWhat changes by now that he yelled at him\nKnow that uh if flake so here's the thing about good well\nUm if people are ... are preferred belief about politics and our preferred believe about Washington and our preferred belief about the Senate\nIs it has been informed by a deep deep cynicism and I mean rank but Chris Coons is a guy who he got through ... he he was worried about having a primary challenge this year but he represents the states it's very moderate\nDelaware is has a strong preference for moderation ... no no extreme is a a prosper in Delaware politics and I I Would say this\nIs Jeff Flake extends to good well to Chris Coons to say you know what you're right and by the way\nCoons inflate for right if the Republicans would have tried to jam through a and start a votes of falling off the side as you get down to decision time Murkowski Collins or maybe others say I can't do it that's a real catastrophe I'm also a catastrophe for Republicans would have been\nGrinding it through with all the dad still in the air grinding it through with Mike Pence casting the deciding vote\nThis was a good this was a good compromise for the Republicans\nWhat somebody like Coons wants to do is generate goodwill so you go from a no vote to a ... vote to potentially really a yes vote if the FBI investigation comes back in their background check and they say now we got nothing\nUh you know what I think you're right in and Jeff Flake if he is or if he is a conservative he might not be but I think he is a conservative who doesn't like Donald Trump which happens to people like George Will and others I get it\nIf he is a conservative Brett Kavanaugh hits hits it out of the park if you like George Bush and John McCain Brett Kavanaugh hits out of the park if you like Lindsey Graham all off it goes against his party or Brett Kavanaugh is not Donald Trump junior so don't worry about it so if he\nAnd listen to a Newt Gingrich a concluded and he knows how to make deals\nThey talking about this deal comes my comes cannot nothing I mean Republicans sometimes have this passion for being stupid Frank got nothing out of ... nothing so tunes playing this game really bipartisan let me see I hadn't rip you off again and Republicans around the only I Would you please help me off a little bit because I feel so much better when you take advantage of\nPeople there that there's a reason people get fed up with this stuff Lindsey Graham leave that on a while ago is the most affecting the Judiciary Committee told the truth and I think we ever did come Eric and people got to stand up and say they don't want a country that has dominated by these kind of people and I think it's a really serious threat\nThought that was new so that that's what I see it I didn't see that you know and and I think Scott ... great but I just wanted one question he if he turned out to pass this FBI background report over the next seven days would you vote for him would your colleagues vote for him because the answer is no\nThat's the honest answer Blumenthal changing his mind nice science that changing your mind you know and I ...\nBut can I call can I call a little malarkey call here go ahead I'm when\nUh people in and people in both parties do this and they say if only everyone would just do what I say then we will win if if only everyone would simply follow what their follow the the instructions and do what they're supposed to do then we will just went well guess what\nThat's not the system that's not how that goes yes obviously if the Republican there are fifty four I told you we talked before about the fifty for for this was really surprising to me um and it tells you something about our politics fifty four percent of Republicans said even if Brett Kavanaugh tried to rape but girl when he was in high school that he should still be confirmed to the Supreme Court\nBecause the argument here is nothing matters anymore just winning just smashing them in the mouth now the overwhelming\nTried to rape or grow in high school or on the Supreme Court there are other options at hand\nAnd but the fact that we're at a point here where both sides embrace this concept of right or wrong just do it for your team and smashed the other guy in the mouth is ridiculous because that's not in Lisa Murkowski's interest that's not in Jeff Flake centrist that's not in Susan Collins interests nor Joe mansions nor Dean Heller is nor a bunch of members\nSo one of the fiction that frequently get sold to members of both parties is that the answer here is that everybody just quit sinking lash themselves together and go ... like a wrecking ball into the other side whatever the issue that's not how the Senate supposed to work\nOr I Want you to hear a I Want you to hear what we heard yesterday let's listen\nTo Senator Flake you've announced that you're not running for reelection and I wonder could you who have done this\nIf you were running no [laughter] no not ... not a chance\nBecause politics has become too sharp to Puerto ... there's no value to reaching across the aisle there's no currency for that anymore there's no incentive\nEvery bit of moral fiber a more you know what to say well he acted morally what was his conscience he couldn't do it any more he\nSaid well you know the fact that I'm retiring is allowed me to take on my party if I say I would never do it I I'm I was thrown out of the mouth\nIsn't that sad I Would I Would only do the right thing\nBecause I'm retiring yeah and that and that is maybe he didn't mean it that way maybe he meant it differently somehow but the take away what it really sounds like is a man who admits that he would have been craven otherwise\nAnd that is not a good look that is an eye on it it is depressingly clear about the way that our primary system\nA has made our politics so much worse than all of this direct Margaret in primaries has left us in a place where people\nThe things they think are right right and that's how I described a Crazy Artist and I I Know that that's a that's under the state's Brian things brain would never say\nThat that's why we're different people Chris but I like to end with something where you a hundred percent agree with Donald Trump resent agree already curious I'm curious yes\nI said he didn't live out his drinking does that mean you'll pull him I don't think he did\nAnd I look here's here's what I'm just saying I'm not a drinker\nCan honestly say I never had a beer in my life okay\nSo one of my totally good traits I don't drink [noise]\nWhenever they're looking for something that I say I never had a glass of alcohol I've never had alcohol I guess you know for whatever reason can you imagine if I had what a mess that they would I think I'd be the world's worst [laughter]\nDo you agree that if he had to drink he would be a mess\nWell I I think one of the the underappreciated under told stories about Donald Trump or is it is the demise of his brother John ah from ah alcoholism and that was a a formative a in a kneeling moments in his life\nAnd I think that you know he was being facetious but I think that yes very obviously his decision at a young age to avoid the fate of his older brother whom he really loved him he really admired a that his decision to never drank\nHe would not be president today if he had done that right because we already know what he was doing it in the Nineteen seventies the Nineteen eighties I think if you would have added booze yeah true true that a drug mistake mix of you put booze into that he missed an ex I don't think you end up with I don't think we you end up with a guy who would have Seventy one is out doing what he's\nDoing exactly I think it's right because he did make a lot of his deals in social settings usually workaholics avoid that and say I you know with the Henry Ford to the world I had no time to drink I was working with them\nBut he never was part of the drugs and alcohol so that have been a studio fifty four for reasons some reasons other than making deals\n...

just about had enough\nSee what the mainstream media they see what the Democrats are doing they're moving the goalpost every single day sometimes two or three times a day when it comes to judge Kavanaugh\nAnd they say you know what we got to teach these people are less than they did learned their lesson and twenty sixteen we're going to have to teach them another lesson [noise] Heidi Heitkamp by the way I saw one poll she's down almost double digits or in one poll that I saw and again you you know you can take the polls with a grain of salt [noise]\nBut but when you when you add that many people coming out to see the present\nWe found a bar and I promise you we were going to get to your calls and we're going to try to sneak one in before the break let's go to show Arizona Rick listening to us on serious accident channel four fifty hello Rick\nAmos just orange thank you so much for all that you do for a president for our country we appreciate it thank you gave me a say\nWhat my my process thought was obstruction of justice if you give me a second I'll give you a line of what I feel is a clear case on the Democratic side\nIt's the crime or active willfully interfering with the process of justice and law especially by influencing threatening or me\nOr impending a witness potential witness jurors you just saw a legal officer or by furnishing false information\nIn or otherwise and eating an investigation or legal process\nPeriod now why is it that when we [noise]\nOn the other side do something wrong and were thrown in jail or the key thrown away or were automatically process and these guys on the other side are not\nWell ... that's a great question a wreck and it's going back I think the answer to that question you have to go back to the Obama administration\nWhere Obama and his team weaponized just about every single government agency and they were instructed to go after conservatives\nUm that's I mean the ... I hate to say it but this is again part of that deep state part of that\nSwamp that President Trump promised to drain well that's what he's talking about and that's why conservatives do not get a fair shake here but I Want to say something Rick if judge Kavanaugh if someone had come forward and said you know what I I thought I\nSo far Rick and we're going to get we're going to get into this we're going to get into this ... a day to day\nSo far a lot of people had been changing their stories but one person has not changed his story\nAnd that's judge Kavanaugh Rick we appreciate the telephone call by the way I'm this information just coming in so apparently a Senator Flake\nWas walking to another elevator just a few moments ago\nAnd he was accosted by a protester with a neon green anti Kavanaugh side [noise] we do not know what happened um we cannot confirm if Senator Flake was found in the fetal position inside the elevator sucking as them I Know I\nThat's just a rumor that's just are we cannot confirm that\nOh one other thing we can confirm do remember the initial elevator assault that occurred uh with the uh the females the feminist and and Senator Flake we can now tell you that one of those women is works for George Soros\nYou say well Todd why does that matter\nBall because it demonstrates that this was all about politics this is not about Dr Ford this is all about\nPolitics that's what this is all about [noise]\nAnastasia you were talking to me in my ear and I couldn't hear what you said okay let's go to a George North Arlington New Jersey\nA thought to get it from the again listen I'm Democrats now that the FBI is investigating everybody are going to move to the point that says oh they didn't have enough time to do a good investigation therefore if is flawed I'm going to debunk it quickly if I work on a farm and my boss Tony ...\nSo close and it would have got to finish the day the FBI tons of aid just doing nothing around the country they can double and triple quadruple that agents and they can finish it in two days even if you are more stuffed with a project\nOr two Democrats are going to like you got to be a a ... you know any manager with opinion outside it's a brain knows that so the Democrats are going to say that they are they have raised smaller than peanuts or they're lying to us right\nA lot of joy to investigate you because I heard that you're eating a snowball fight you fall to a kid with a snowball and you cannot defend yourself while you have you're going to get angry at me that proves that did it because only the people are thought people ... it's\nA great point that look we're coming up on a break George I'm gonna have to I'm going to have to let you go I Am so sorry but uh books\nAh we've got so much information to share with you and we're going to debunk a lot of the these accusations out there I just have one question for you are you mad are you angry or you fired up are you ready to get back\nAt the Democrats give us a call triple eight seven eight nine nine one zero was one question just lots of questions in the one question that's AAA seven eight nine nine one zero Todd Stearns downtown the website we got match slap coming up [noise]\nUm [noise]\nVoter yeah oh the oh yeah like a few things you'll ever see um you know I have moderate Republican friends running for officers for state legislative officers who are texting and emailing me saying my race depends on Kavanaugh's confirmation so it's not just about people running for the Senate it's about people running for the house\nThere are a lot of House Republicans in trouble who don't realize this they would be smart to step into this controversy\nAnd to defend Brett Kavanaugh because this race is not about swing voters this is the midterm elections this race is about getting a Republican\nDoing so well in polls is not because they're getting swing voters it's because their face is supremely energized and what I'm seeing in many polls is that the uh is that the energy level on the Republican side is starting to equate to that the Democratic side we're finally getting to the zone we can make this a match\nYou know it's interesting a man I'm I'm not trying to read between the lines here but you've got Chuck Schumer out there yesterday saying you know what all we need is a week you know that that's good for us as long as they can investigate everything now you have a Senator Whitehouse saying the same thing that he's satisfied so far with where the investigation is going\nDo you think that uh that the Democrats are starting to realize that this that whatever their plot was it's not working and beat the these so called accusers or alleged accusers their stories are starting to unravel\nYeah of course I mean there's nothing uh\nThere's no amount of reporting on these accusations um that is adding any credibility to them because there really are no facts there's opinions and subjectivity\nAre and you know and so that's why I ... yeah investigation will do nothing to undercover anything now an FBI investigation could undercover do things that people want to say because\nYou know Brett Kavanaugh has become the ultimate political PIN gotta if you want to take a whack a I guess you're allowed to do that um but I Do think for Chuck Schumer thinking about this you know the ...\nThe ah the majority in the Senate goes through red states it's just the way the ... this time and if if you actually were really wants to be the majority leader to the Senate he's got to figure a way to make the politics work for people like Heidi Heitkamp\nAnd a hash tag resistance doesn't work so well North Dakota either as being unfair to a man who doesn't deserve it\nWell no you're right about that Matt and and I do think you know ... people are really angry about this uh our phone lines have been passed\nHere is one of the Republicans going to do you have got Jeff Flake and ... and Lisa Murkowski those are the great unknowns right now\nThose are the great unknowns and let me just go through the step by step Jeff Flake is not done with politics Jeff\nFlake is flirting with running for president Jeff Flake will have to run as a Democrat if he does anything to harm Brett Kavanaugh period Lisa Murkowski is running in a state of Alaska where she lost the primary last time\nA if she does anything to harm Brett Kavanaugh she will not with her primary this time she wanted an independent and her last time she was on the ballot that was a very difficult thing to do she won't be able to pull that wrap it out of a hat twice and Susan Collins one in the state the state of Maine\nThat Donald Trump for the first time of the very long time of the Republican nominee gotten electoral vote one half the state so people are reporting this at its heart for Murkowski in college because states they come from it's actually exactly the opposite if they take on against Brett Kavanaugh the politics back home are going to be terrible for them\n[noise] um so we've gone out and you know\nI haven't heard any when we're talking about this a mad but we've gone from judge Kavanaugh being a a a a raging alcoholic or who gang raped women to now now he's been accused of throwing ... someone in a bar fight 'em\nThis this is the whole narrative that like he's an irresponsible drinker and he's kind of reckless in his behavior\nAnd uh let me just be clear this is the man I Know really well and I know for a long time and I told him into those high stress situations I knew and we worked side by side during nine eleven during the prosecution of wars do the times when we're on the road in the White House dealing with judges ironically\nHe is one steady guy Brett is the guy you turn to when you need some\nUm and he works all the time\nThere was a time for a party because we were working and he was working and I I never recall a time where I couldn't find him on the work site because he was always working\nAnd there are those people who are just emotional I tend to be\nA you know people who get fired up for it never got fired up Brett Brett with steady guy so this portrayal of him or is a sophomore work literally a and try to make the worst of of of characterizing a boy\nAnd trying to make it seem like that's how we as as a fifty plus year old man and any man in this country in any woman who loves a man in this country it finds this for ...\nIndeed Matt we're going to have to leave it there as always appreciate you out there fighting the good fight\n... thanks for having me on keep up the good work\nAll right Matt slapped ladies and gentlemen chairman of the American Conservative Union and you can listen to our entire interview on the other ... radio program pod cast a you can get it I tunes a tune in wherever you are you download your podcast\nI he you know before we get to the phones here I Want to say something about this bar fight [noise]\nUm [noise] it seems to me I I I understand that the Democrats believe that anybody who was in college and was engaged in a bar fight or is disqualified from public service I understand that\nBut it seems to me that that maybe the Democrats are looking at this from the the wrong perspective\nBecause it seems to me that a judge Kavanaugh's ... here in this bar fight is is pretty darn American I'm here is a guy he was at the bar with his friends his buddies and there was some sort of an incident\nI judge Kavanaugh could've cut and run he could've he could've screwed it out the back door but he didn't do that\nA bucket of ice cubes I I I look I think that's ... I think that's pretty noble of dying I mean if you're going to be at a bar fight you want to make sure your buddies got your back\nAnd he had his buddies back in in this particular incident says the story goes\nI'm not no I'm not saying that we need to go out and have bar fights down to be Applebee's no I'm not saying that but I'm just saying that they found themselves in a situation\nJudge Kavanaugh stood there like a man and did not back up didn't back down and to be honest with you I think that's the kind of justice I one of the Supreme Court to be perfectly blunt about it [noise]\nAll right I'm here's what we're going to do we're going to take a break Kevin in Harrisburg Christine in Delaware hang on we're getting to your calls triple eight seven eight nine nine one zero but triple eight seven eight nine nine zero back after this\nOnly can you hear John starring but see him to keep the live video stream of the dogs don't show time zone show dot com and click on watch [noise]\nUm [noise]\nHere's a special message for those who owe the IRS at least ten thousand or more in back taxes the IRS has special programs in place that could eliminate or reduce your tax dead by thousands of dollars\nA call the federal tax management help line that has been set up for you eight hundred to three three eighty five forty stop the wage garnishment celebrities and tax liens now\nOnce you've qualified and enroll the IRS will stop all the collection activities against you these unique programs have been allocated to help the economy and significantly reduce or eliminate your tax burden the IRS is currently accepting reduced settlements and other favorable programs\nYou may qualify for substantial savings\nWhy take down the number now for the federal tax management hotline eight hundred to three three eighty five forty that's eight hundred to three three eighty five forty eight hundred to three three eighty five forty\nDo you have an idea for an adventure new product do you think companies would be interested in your idea do you want to try to get a patent been told him that help no it helped each year I'd be confidential unexplained every step of adventure process we create professional materials representing your idea and submit it to companies who are looking for new ideas we have more than nine\nThousand companies who agreed to review ideas being confidence if a company shows interest in manufacturing your adventure we can negotiate on your behalf we have helped over ten thousand clients receive patents we also offer services including breathing modeling an animation demonstrating your idea rotor typing services\nAnd we use state of the art technology to show it been helpline ideas to additional companies joy but dozens of people just like you chose invent help to pursue their idea we're experience we are working for you we are in bed\nFellows for free information to one eight hundred and five four or five zero Seventy five that's one eight hundred five four or five zero seven eight five again one eight hundred five four or five zero seven eight five\nI'm Scott Goldberg the Senate will vote on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh this week that the promise anyway for majority leader Mitch McConnell\nThe FBI is still conducting a background investigation into sexual misconduct allegations made by multiple women against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on Capitol Hill Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell accused Democrats of smearing Kavanaugh's reputation in order to derail his confirmation\nOf course mirror hours after judge Kavanaugh was enough for on the Democratic leader made the announcement that it's now become famous I'll oppose everything I've got is a\nDemocratic Senator Chuck Schumer says there's a double standard adding that McConnell delayed President Obama's Supreme Court nomination for ten months\nMaybe see Stephanie Ramos the FBI has now completed its interview mark judging the Kavanaugh investigation Christine bosley barzee Ford claims judge was in the room when she\nAnd sending a warning to China white house economic adviser Larry Kudlow says the ...

was assaulted years ago and I remember every detail and I had more than one beer\n[laughter] but I I stayed with him a hundred percent and I think it's ridiculous what it's going on with the Senate and the Democrats and actually the first time I heard about\nThis allegation against him my first thought was this was the mayor yeah this is the Democrats playing the game\nChristine I Know you're going to be shocked here [noise] um the Dianne Feinstein just said that um [noise] uh that the Senate vote on Kavanaugh it would be too soon to have a boat on friday I Know you're just shocked by that\nYeah it's they they just keep pushing it and they are they going to hold just trying to find every little thing that they can get on him just to keep pushing us yeah and yes Dianne Feinstein don't even [laughter] she she didn't retire\n[laughter] unbelievable I'm a\nYeah it's just ridiculous and I believe there is a civil war starting I heard what you were saying earlier with Ted Cruz and what happened at Capitol Hill and I'm like this is crazy like it really is a civil war going and I hope I'm wrong and I were all wrong but just seeing what's going on it it's you know possible now\nWell it's a and sadly this is this is where we are in the country right now and a lot of bad has to do with what they're teaching these kids in public schools I mean there is a ruling radical radical indoctrination going on and el absolutely\nI totally agree yeah\nChristine appreciate the telephone call thank you and thank you for holding on we appreciate that [noise]\nUm there is a little bit more um information I Want to share with you this was from breaking nine one one dot com I follow these folks on Twitter they do a terrific job here\nUm at least two people were rushed to the hospital after apparently being exposed to a white powdery substance that Senator Ted Cruz is office at least two people are used in fire department hazmat team is responding and working to determine the nature of the substance\nWhile that was going on the Pentagon received something in the ...\nSecretary Mattis and the Navy's top officer admiral John Richardson the FBI is currently doing analysis to make final determinations about the initial testing shows that the um the packages tested positive for rice and\nNow Anastasia I Know that you had been in touch with the congressman Harris's office or tell us what happened what do we know from from that incident\nOn the information that they provided so fires from his press secretary Julia she said that there was a marijuana protest outside at the office and they are going to provide us more information soon but there are police officers outside from Capitol police and there does appear to be someone who was arrested\nGood I mean the I mean you don't go around barge ing into to lawmakers officers like that that's just unbelievable unbelievable you know it seems to be somebody should have been at least taste [noise] yeah I Know I Know you're probably not going to shoot somebody but you can at least have some [noise]\nMake 'em think twice the next time they do something stupid like that [noise]\nAnyway thank you Anastasia and they keep us posted there and also um I Know it's busy over there are guys but let's we will also check in with our news sources there in Houston over this incident at senator Cruz's office out here's ... again we don't have a lot of information here all on the incident\nBut I I'm suspecting that this was all precautions you know they just want to get the people of the hospital make sure everything checks out\nAnd we have seen several reports some one report says two people taking the hospital from the senators campaign office or for people is is what another one is is telling us so we will stay on top of both of those stories all that to say folks\nYou've got a professor at Georgetown that says you know what\nThe Republicans they need to die\nYou're still protect your family\nBe on guard you

... be sure to subscribe to the newsletter while you're over there will be right back after the break stick around [noise]\n[noise]\nYeah well the whole thing is ridiculous happy but I I Will say this or if in fact he is confirmed which is a long shot right now but based on what Jeff Flake said earlier today\nUm I have no doubt that if he is confirmed the Democrats are going to try to impeach him regardless uh and and that's troubling because this was all about politics kept me this is not about Dr board it's not about Julie sweating and this is about politics it's about stopping Donald Trump from changing the direction of the Supreme Court\nAbsolutely absolutely and if you don't see that if the Democrats are the the left do that if they say they don't see that one either very stupid and ignorant for their line through their teams because it is an out and out of this situation\nCan the ... the telephone call great a great comments All right I think we've got a Allen worked out here

S. G. F. great radio station there in the\n... part of the country I'm just got an email from our friends over at senator Cruz's office or they are confirming what the reporting has been down in Houston\nThey we do have some a bit of new information um we're being told that the um that the people who were injured may not or at least take in the hospital may not have been with the campaign staff but I Want to read this or to you this is what we receive from Senator Cruz's office\nOr we can confirm that had happened a piece of mail with a powdery substance was addressed to the campaign headquarters authorities were alerted on our on the scene\nThe building is still secured upper entrances and exits fire and police we don't yet know what was the substance the two people ah that went to the hospital are not our staff and we do not know how they are so that's um that's the latest from\nFrom Houston, Texas it's getting dangerous out there are folks it's getting dangerous\nAll right

I don't know if that's even ... they're not\nOr nothing like it was not always that accurate but it's probably not that far off we could use that for discussion purposes\nOkay\nIf you if you found a house that was worth a hundred thousand and you could buy it for Ninety five thousand that really wouldn't be that great a by\nJust being okay by it's not like you're getting re great deals are where you just went wow that's the best deal ever ride yeah this is I'm not sure if um\nOn the long term or that you want to own um\nWell my wife she we kinda do want to own 'cause we are I got a daughter she's four and my wife she's in school and now so we just trying to kind of settled down right now\nMhm have you got every angle area it's like I said my wife great grandma's house and she'd been here her whole life so she likes it it's like about two and a half three acres mhm\nAnd um it's kind of in a country will part of Atlanta\nGotcha okay and how old are your\nOr my wife she turned twenty yesterday and and I'll be Twenty one and a couple of days but we both twenty now\nMhm and you got a a one child you said and how much debt to your house\nOr we don't have any debt okay and what's your household income I make about every ... here but I'm trying to get in school but I had to kind of work with a fresh answer that was that much I don't know what else\nUm I pay about six hundred and Seventeen dollars a month and your wife done work mhm\nOkay that's pretty shy and that's where we live on your budget\nIs is very tight on your budget\nAnd we just found out about you not too long ago one of my friends from church you recommended me start listening to you so now we actually kind of made a budget and stuff on how to eat and we're already kinda you know trying to start it off a little better and you\nDo it good for you okay well here's the thing if you wanted to buy the house the only way you can buy it is the uh the relatives that are involved that would be the eight years uh this would be great grandmothers children or grandchildren\nThat would be the air since there was no will someone would have to petition the court will get a lawyer and go to probe a court in probate courts\nTo be able to give it to you you're going to have to have a court action to do that that's going to cost three two or three thousand bucks to get all that done okay I don't think you need that expense right now\nYeah though with all the with the numbers you gave me in the situation you're in um now is anybody going to throw you out as long as that mortgages paid I doubt you're going to get thrown out\nYeah 'cause that's what I was thinking should I feel kind of want to actually start even going into real estate 'cause I Do construction that's what I Do know I kind of this house has kind of it's not ... it's kind of beat up and fight the last\nFew years she hit her head and like other relatives staying there kind of beating it up so I mean I don't know if it's like maybe work more maybe you know what I'm saying they Lincoln flipping and get another house or you know I left there\nUnless you become the owner of it\nYeah and and that's why I'm saying like I Do I Need to you'd had I see in a statement learning anything they just hurry up and now like my aunt's name or should I tell you what I Would\nDo if I were you I Would be willing to walk away from the south someday when you get I I Would treat it like you're renting it\nYou're probably not gonna ever bother to own it and if you do you're going to go through a lot of hassle to become the owner going through this court action that I'm Talking about okay\nSo uh what I Would do is pay that rent or pay that payment of rent I Would not spend any money on this and I wouldn't fret about becoming the owner today\nIt's inexpensive rent in the Atlanta area it's a place you like living any money you spend on it just say to fix it up is money you're probably gonna lose you're probably not ever going to become the owner of this thing\nYeah it's going to be in it's going to be a really strenuous process with the courts to become the owner of this because we don't even\nAnd um\nOr that they actually even know about it like I said we we been here for a year so I don't know like should I I I'm not like should I be worried that I'm staying here paying it or not I just keep paying it\nIn because that's not that you shouldn't be worried because it's not bad rent\nYet but I'm I'm just worried like can't nobody commanding me out because it's not in my name\nYeah they can get you out the people that own it can there the air's but they'd have to all get their crap together and they're far from doing that\nYeah and they're they're they're far away they're like in another state and\nYeah but they're not they're not worried about this is what I'm saying yeah they're not worried about this at all it's not bothering them one way or the other they're not going to get any money out of it when it sells 'cause it's not worth much more than his vote on it\nIf it was valuable now there'd be some sharks and the water circling right but it's not got any ... because it's not worth any more so you're not going to get kicked out but some day you're going to want to move on so don't spend a bunch of money on it 'cause some day you're just gonna walk off and leave it\nYeah 'cause 'cause I've already done paying eight and scrape the before they did a little some something you know to make my life had because\nLike money whatever money you spend and make her happy is money is gone\nWhen you leave 'cause there's going to come a day two years from now that you guys are going to stand up and walk away or you're going to go to the trouble to get the heirs to take the thing the probate court\nAnd get to the transferred to your name and you can probably do that but again it's going to cost you a couple of thousand dollars and you'd want to make very sure that the property was worth more than the mortgage before you did that and um\nAnd you don't want to spend a bunch of money renovating his house because you're going to very likely move on in about two years but in the meantime I just looked at it as cheap rent\nTo a place you kinda like living and ah\nIt's not hurting anything no one's you're not stealing anything you're not doing any more harm the mortgage companies getting paid they're happy the relatives that aren't going to get any money anyways still aren't getting any money everybody's happy but just look at it like you're a renter and some day you're just going to move on\n... worried about being the owner and then if you really want to be the owner then get ready to spend three or four thousand dollars and six months or pain in the bud court actions and you probably can work this through if you can gather up all the people you need to sign on it\nAnd that's what you're facing so it's an interesting situation but um my guess is it's not worth any more than his old on it\nMy guess is ill as probably fairly close on this\nIf we thought it was worth two hundred thousand bucks if their relatives thought is worth two hundred thousand bucks and Ninety thousand was old and they were going to get a hundred thousand their pocket when is old no sharks would already been circling\nThey would have been trying to figure out some way to get that thing sold and get the courts do it when you die without a will and you have to go in and the judge has to\nYou know authorized the sale of the asset and it has to go into a pool to be dispersed too the heirs\nAre just like it would in a wheel but it's just a lot bigger mess\nAnd do you can't get clean title to this thing unless you do all that and you do not want to become the owner of it any other way than doing it properly and getting clean title 'cause you won't be able to sell it if you don't get clean title so that's how you do it if you decided to do it later but for today I Would treat it as cheap rent\nIt's a rental house how much money would you spend on a rental house that you're going to move off and you don't home not [noise] not any that's what you would do hope that

those kind of show and um she and I ended up talking on the green room after that and she was the one she gave me some study and I read through the whole study I was amazed there was a huge

if you have a friend that is not allowed to touch money in any way because her husband her boyfriend is incomplete extreme control of every decision around the finances I'll give you a Ninety percent

Twenty years that was our first family home and we have turned it into a rental and has been for the last Fifteen Years and so our monthly mortgage is about eight fifty per month\nAnd we are in the process of looking for new tenant and we have um narrowed it down to three of our top picks\nBut they um unfortunately all of their credit scores are in the low six hundred and they do have little marks on their credit such as a bankruptcy\nI'm due to divorce or medical bills and a collection and um some uh one of our perspective tenants actually just has a um a credit card debt that ...\nAnd had chicken ticket that they've all for it at me and and they had their Americans have minded and they have\nUm a parasite and can you tell them I Am wondering it is that um the show as a

handed it to the extent that they are past as an indicator of their future you don't rent to them if they got an ugly past\nBut a lot of the authors of those stupid stuff in the past the question is are we still on that road and they turned it around in this case all three of them are at least making some level of effort\nTo learn how to handle money and not be in the mess anymore dust financial peas university certificates that's pretty cool I never thought about man go through after you maybe I should do that [laughter] I don't\nKnow it's really interesting though because they all volunteer that information on their applications and they're all very proud of that I Know\nI'm going to interview them and what I'm trying to figure out is two things is there anything in their past that's going to come up and tackle them like if they got an outstanding judgment that's getting ready to seize all of their income and they wouldn't be able to pay the rent\nOr something like that is there something in the past that's looming\nThat even though they've changed its gonna still tackled them from behind okay\nSo that that's going on I'm going to try to ascertain and then thing too is and I think it's just an interview process and um we many times I differ required financial university and it goes real stupid that as I should have done it but I'm a we many times have asked them for a

to get\nOn board so you guys are looked at it and together in all seriousness other than the overdoing the Dave Ramsey part I'm you looked at it together and said hey if we really rolled up our sleeves we can pay off the show that's it you had an a ha moment huh\nYet and we're we're a good team we bounce ideas off each other and we always came to the same conclusion as to what we were going to do and and here we are\nNow you don't have a payment in the world not that and the grass does feel better when you walk on it I'm telling you it's not an exaggeration it's a great metaphor but it's

I'm not gonna start buying bonds to offset the fact that you don't have insurance so it's not you know that's what he's doing and that no thank you um\nI mean you you need to build up a big pile of money he called Wilson and you don't have to worry about life insurance so that's the general principle that you move towards a or about\nTo pay our house off in December so they don't have any that um\nAnd so you know I and the more well if you have the less and less we need to worry about replacing your income for the good of your family\nMhm right if you have enough wealth that your family is fine and you have no debt and your family's fine without your income than we don't worry about this subject anymore because you become self insured your family's morning 'cause the point is is the family major income to live\nRight on to the extent they don't need that just to the extent you don't need life insurance now have you actually shopped or are you making an assumption that you can't get insurance\nI got denied about seven years ago and I tried\nCalling ... calls and their insurance then the market has changed dramatically\nWell I got another diagnosis back in March that when I looked up life insurance and this diagnosis that um they basically said you'd get denied but I haven't tried Zander\nTrying them I mean there is no it doesn't\nWe found some research and probably not insure all you know so the only question is just you know if your family only got a hundred grand instead of getting five underground how old are you\nThirty eight\nAnd and uh the auto immune that you've got I mean how are you know you're a healthcare professional uh does do you have a real threat here of losing your life\nYou can there's different degrees of it and mine mild but I um when they hit your record it kind of\nNon down by the actual fact you Diana I Am Lee is left without you what's the probability of that\nLand on that it probably is going on and on and get help so I mean could get worse you know I mean that's how old are you thirty eight okay\nSo I mean in the next ten years a typical thirty eight year old would have very low probability short of an accident of passing away and yours is slightly greater resolve it's not like\nTo have a terminal cancer diagnosis right right okay so I'm not going to worry about it I'm gonna take the job I Want\nAnd then use your fabulous income which you have to build wealth and to become debt free in the family but I mean if you're sitting there with a million dollars in mutual funds and your four one K. and mutual funds and everything's paid for house and everything and you passed away I think your husband can struggle through\nYeah I think\nYou know and that's what I mean by self insured by becoming wealthy and\nThey got about three hundred thousand in retirement yeah and your house was painful so and you get a hundred thousand and insurance so you know he is he going to be OK yeah you'll be OK yeah plus I'm guessing he worked right hey we're here now so I mean he's going to be okay so I'm taking the job\nBecause the call Center for informational purposes and just double check your something's okay okay

find a AAA eight to five five issued by Jim is with us here in Philadelphia Hi Jim how are you\nGood Dave thanks for having me on sure what's up [noise] um my wife and I work currently in baby steps to uh we started this time last year with about a hundred and sixty thousand dollars in debt or we've been on ten and paid off our thousand dollars wow how's the smog\nYeah or sold my brand new pickup truck\nThe situation a we have one child and we're looking to expand our family however we're going to need to um we needed to ivy F um we still have another sixty six thousand dollars left or to pay off\nA rational into\nA were making about a hundred and forty thousand dollars a year right now\nSo you did a hundred and a year but a lot of that was from selling stuff are pretty much a large ... what's that what's the math telling you that it's got how long is he going to take you do the show the sixty\nUm [noise] if we if we continue on this course where how are you from literally sold everything so the rest of it's just going to be working really hard I think it's going to be probably about another year maybe a little bit more\nThat's what I was thinking that's what I Would ask him on a cell that OK cool and so what is the uh pricing model of uh VS that you guys are looking at\nUm well we actually met with a doctor a few months ago and got a ballpark of about twenty thousand\nMhm I'm uh just you know we haven't\nFound anything or start any any process is yeah we're just still kind of shopping around but ... what we're looking at a we've spoken with other couples and it looks like Apple's got around there\nLet me give me a little inside okay this comes like a lot because babies are important\nI mean having kids is a big deal it's an emotional thing and it causes people to uh\nYou know to to change their financial directions and the to violate things and everything else so let me tell you I I absolutely know nothing about medical things I I'm a medical idiots okay but uh I have actually been involved in about this decision probably a hundred times over the years\nAnd what I Am hearing\nEven as late as last week a with couples that we are coaching on this is that when they press in they find several different ...\nOn how you go about this okay right in other words I heard the other day are thirty five thousand for one pricing model but that was like a guarantee as many times as you need to do it till you get a baby right mhm okay uh well that's not one we're going to do [laughter]\nAnd then I heard the other end of the spectrum I'm hearing a you know a single tries as low as Seventy five hundred a try\nMhm and uh but they they want to show your packages and or guarantees or whatever because they know you want a baby and they want to help you get there I understand that but this is a\nYeah I don't I don't know a I don't know exactly who is if my wife I'm with my wife so great grandma so I Know where I live on the lowest say there was a it's a hundred and thirty thousand but I don't know if that's even ... they're not\nOr nothing like it was not always that accurate but it's probably not that far off we could use that for discussion\nPurposes okay\nIf you if you found a house that was worth a hundred thousand and you could buy it for Ninety five thousand that really wouldn't be that great a\nBy I just being okay by it's not like you're getting the re great deals are where you just went wow that's the best deal ever ride yeah\nThis is I'm not sure if I'm like to even get kicked out 'cause someone gated or should I leave or should I should I go back ran over\nWell where no one on the long term or that you want to own um well\nMy wife she we kinda do want to own because we got a daughter she's four and my wife she's in school and now so we just trying to kind of settled down right now\nMhm have you got every angle I only like an area it's like I say my wife great grandma's house and she'd been here her whole life so she likes it it's like about two and a half three acres\nMhm and um it's kind of in a country will part of Atlanta gotcha okay and how old are you to\nUh my wife she turned twenty yesterday and and I'll be Twenty one and a couple of days so we both twenty now\n... and you got a a one child you said and how much debt to your house\nOr we don't have any debt okay and what's your household income I make a\nThat was that I don't watch I don't know what else\nUm I pay about six hundred and Seventeen dollars a month\nAnd your wife done more mhm okay that's pretty shy and that's all right on your budget is is very tight on your budget\nAnd we just found out about you not too long ago one of my friends from church he recommended me start listening to you so now we actually kind of made a budget and stuff on how to eat and we're already kind of you know trying to start it off a little better and\nGood good for you okay well here's the thing if you wanted to buy the house the only way you can buy it is the ah the relatives that are involved that would be the errors or this would be great grandmothers children or grandchildren\nThat would be the air since there was no will someone would have to petition the court will get a lawyer and go to probe a court in probate court would have to rule that the house could be sold hand would assign someone to sign the deed as the cellar\nTo be able to give it to you you're going to have to have a court action to do that that's going to cost three two or three thousand bucks to get all that done\nOkay I don't think you need that expense right now\nThough with all the with the numbers you gave me in the situation you're in um now is anybody going to throw you out as long as that mortgages paid I doubt you're gonna get thrown out\n'cause that's what I was thinking should I because\nI feel kind of want to actually start even going into real estate because I Do construction and that's what I Do know I kind of this house is kind of it's not ... it's kind of beat up and fight the last few years she yeah\nShe didn't like other relatives staying there kind of beaten it up so I I mean I don't know if it's like maybe work more maybe you know what I'm saying\nAnd that's why I'm saying like I Do I Need to\nYou'd had I see in a statement learning anything they just hurry up and now like my in my name or should I tell you what I Would\nDo if I were you I Would be willing to walk away from the ... some day when you get I I Would treat it like you're renting it\nYou're probably not gonna ever bother to own it and if you do you're going to go through a lot of hassle to become the owner going through this court action that I'm Talking about\nOkay so ah what I Would do is pay the rent or pay that payment of rent I Would not spend any money on this and I wouldn't fret about becoming the owner today\nIt's inexpensive rent in the Atlanta area it's a place you like living any money you spend on it just say to fix it up is money you're probably gonna lose you're probably not ever going to become the owner of this thing\nYeah it's going to be and it's going to be a really strenuous process with the courts to become the owner of this because we don't even know who the errors are\nYeah well I don't I Know a couple of the day is this is not that many on 'em\nOr that they actually even know about it like I said we we been here for a year so I don't know like should I I'm not like should I be worried that I'm staying here paying their oil and I just keep paying it\nIn because that's not that you shouldn't be worried because it's not bad rent\nYet but I'm I'm just worried like can't nobody commanding me out because it's not in my name\nYeah they can take you out the people that only can they are the heirs but they'd have to all get their crap together and they're far from doing that\nYeah and they're they're they're far away they're like in another state and\nYeah but they're not they're not worried about this is what I'm saying yeah they're not worried about this at all it's not bothering them one way or the other they're not going to get any money out of it when it sells 'cause it's not worth much more than ... vote on it if it was valuable now there'd be some sharks\nSome day you're going to want to move on so don't spend a bunch of money on it 'cause some day you're just gonna walk off and leave it\n'cause 'cause I've already done paying eight and ... before bed at NATO or some something you know and I make my life had because\nMoney whatever money you spend and make her happy is money is gone\nWhen you leave 'cause there's going to come a day two years from now that you guys are going to stand up and walk away or you're going to go to the trouble to get the heirs to take the thing the probate court\nAnd get to the transferred to your name and you can probably do that but again it's going to cost you a couple of thousand dollars and you'd want to make very sure that the property was worth more than the mortgage before you did that and um\nAnd you don't want to spend a bunch of money renovating his house because you're going to very likely move on in about two years but in the meantime I just looked at it as cheap rent\nTo a place you kinda like living\nAnd ah you know six hundred bucks written Atlanta is not a bad gig on two and a half acres so I'm sitting there in front of you for now\nOr it's not hurting anything no one's you're not stealing anything you're not doing any more harm the mortgage companies getting paid they're happy the relatives that aren't going to get any money anyways still aren't getting any money everybody's happy but just look at it like you're a renter and some day you're just going to move on\n... worried about being the owner and then if you really want to be the owner than getting ready to spend three or four thousand dollars and six months of pain in the bud court actions and you probably can work this through if you can gather up all the people you need to sign on it\nAnd that's what you're facing so it's an interesting situation but my guess is it's not worth any more than his vote on it\nMy guess is ill as probably fairly close on this\nIf we thought is worth two hundred thousand bucks is a relatives thought it was worth two hundred thousand bucks a Ninety thousand was owed and they were going to\nThat things sold and get the courts do it when you die without away all you have to go in and the judge has to you know authorized the sale of the asset and it has to go into a pool to be dispersed too the air's\nA just like it would in a will but it's just a lot bigger mess\nAnd do you can't get cleaned title to this thing unless you do all that and you do not want to become the owner of it any other way than doing it properly and getting clean title because you won't be able to sell it if you don't get cleaned title so that's how you do it if you decide to do it later but for today I Would treat it as cheap rent\nIt's a rental house how much money would you spend on a rental house that you're going to move off and you don't own a nod any that's what you would do hope that

the things I mean all of this stuff that goes into these things\nAnd that's the thing I mean I look back and I think about all the movies now that can't be made that we look at and go oh producer Phil

changing Mark Twain's books and others were books were were getting rid of Laura Ingalls Wilder books because it was culturally is not sensitive to the day's world and that is insane\nYou know I when I made those movies with John Hughes um his intention was to not make Porky's or Animal House um but I think you know as everyone says and I do believe is true that the times\nWere different and what was acceptable than is definitely not acceptable now and nor should it have been then but that that sort of the way that it was\nYeah again yet Porky's I I don't know how many times I've seen Porky's I support is much Animal House one of my favorite movies of all time\nAbsolutely these movies were a little bit they they were definitely different it wasn't just teenage aunts there was all kinds of things that they were going through where the other ones were just anxious and it was craziness and it was wild was about the drinking and all this ... revenge of the nerds is another one\nYou look at that and that was another movie that I ... a lot of us watched and we liked\nDon't look at the end retro rage back to back then you look at it he said that's what it was back then obviously we've

of course I don't want to appear ungrateful to John Hughes but I Do a pose a lot of what is in those movies\nThat's only ... well guess what you're famous because of those movies you're famous because of those movies\nAnd I'm sure if we look back I watch shows all the time and I looked at the way that that that that you know whether it's Archie Bunker or The Honeymooners or or gun smoke and the way

teenagers to talk\nNo it's not because they're too busy playing on their damned phone's right that's what the movie would be today that wouldn't be any of that because you mean girls today

what it was at the time the problem is people get separate that any more\nThey want it to be they want to move their modern sensibility if you will their inclusiveness they're all of this stuff and they want to they want to move it back to there and say look how horrible you were on some kind of wonderful is one of my favorite movies of all time I love that movie\nI feel like the movies that I made then we're very much representing the culture at the time\nYou know and and I feel like that is why they resonated with people because it it was their experience and they did feel like they had these films that were that were real they weren't they didn't have that sort of after school special feeling where somebody was you know teaching them a lesson and you know it didn't it didn't feel like that\nNo no it wasn't it was interesting it was fun and it wasn't an after school special it was something more than that and I don't want people attacking my childhood\nAnd sick and tired of it

I think fair to Clarence Thomas I Will give him credit for that\nYou said before the hearings he was going to vote on purely idle logical ground it was a Republican nominee he was voting against Clarence Thomas something that Republicans might want to think about doing um but no it's it's ... Democrats of course have to\nHave to pave the way they were the first ones who can be absolutely naked vicious partisans once they've done it you'd think Republicans would say okay you did it to our nominees were voting against your nominees but Republicans have this idea that there are good sportsmanship will be rewarded by better with better behavior by the Democrats\nIt never ever ever works and yet they keep trying well let's try it again this time um\nBut yeah ... uh he did at least run the hearing was you know honorably unfairly\nYeah well I mean that but again that now will come back and bite him because as we all know what do you make of this retro rage I mean that's what I call the retro rage where something you do a joke today on Twitter or whatever I mean you'd like today I got a bunch of people because we put up a fake movie trailer about you know cannot be the Boogie Man and people like I hate you and stuff like that\nAnd I expect that from certain people but you know you go and sweet something today and then all of a sudden six months a year from now what was funny we we we moved the goalpost and and now it's evil and bad\nI mean at one point in time just got to be like a drop dead date where that's five years you can't go back five years now we're going back twenty plus years because he had a few drinks in high school or college in ... it's insane this retro rich\nThirty five with him while I really think it's ultimately it's ... it's the substance I'm I don't care how many years ago it was\nIs is is utter madness um they try to as always ... um they take\n'em a silly charge\n'em Trump used a bad word and the Access Hollywood tape and instantly that goes through the chapter two of my of my book no resistance those few tile um the hysteria over the Access Hollywood tape and how uh the left and the media ended up hurting themselves with their typed\nAn outrage over that um if you listen to what he was actually saying it was the same formulation\nAs when he said he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and his supporters wouldn't leave him he takes something that is acts magically unacceptable to describe the passion of a certain group of people in in the case of the Billy Bush Access Hollywood tape when he was saying is\nThe craziness of celebrity culture when you're a celebrity they let you do it that's what he was saying and then and then so I did something axiom radically unacceptable using a bad word yes he used a bad word um um it ... it would have been you know sophomore embarrassing\nBut known as the media instantly has to go to he's\nAdmitting to a sexual assault no he said they let you do it and we're seeing the same\n... dumb follow the same path right now with the beer drinking 'em knowing it proves he lied he lied\nNo he said he drank he said he cringed over some of the things he did um he said sometimes he drank too many beers um there are no taking a college kid getting drunk and claiming that blackout drunk\nNo no I'm Sorry not that I Would care if you'd ever um you know ... blackout blackout drunk um but you don't graduate number one in your classroom high school do so well end up at Yale and do so well at Yale that you go to Yale Law school I'm no he he's he's\nAnd again it go and ...\nHere that's what they're trying to come up with\nPerjury it's crazy just doubled the region for anything talking to had called the resistance is futile are\nOr how the Trump hating last last collective mind and they lost more than anything\nUh lets flash forward a week and they get some of this stuff done that they think they're going to get done because again there's no ... no they're not going back and taking out something DNA there's no crime scene\nWhere do you think happens from here if it is it going to satisfy Murkowski Collins and flake enough did they did they get this thing done or is this I think that the way that Trump's looking at this now say we can make lemons that dilemma we can take a we'd make lemonade out of lemons and make this big push for November ... and maybe steal a seat or two in the Senate\nWouldn't count on it I I ate all look if that's what it takes and if it comes to that I'll discuss it then but um it's hard to keep an anger building\nUm we have a lot of ... weeks left ear and I think the number of people who will be angry on our side will also be matched by the number of people who are demoralized they've got to confirm Kavanaugh um there are that pressure has got to be put on if\nIf they're wavering um and I probably shouldn't be attacking them so much on Twitter because they haven't precisely sad um but I tend to think we will get Murkowski uncalled ones I also think it's very likely we're going to get 'em\nMansion and hide camp looking at the polls in their states and they're up for election and there is a lot of rage on the other side I'm On our side that is to say\nI'm for the first time real rage over there so don't start no I'm I'm I'm sick of Republicans saying just as a general matter okay we lost this time but we're really set up oil for next\nTime no I've had with next time I Want to win this time and there is no reason this man should not be confirmed this report said so I think today they come back\nLuther our time and demands there are time constraints we need to get Kavanaugh confirmed this is nonsense is just allowing the nonsense to go on and on and on it's been what how many ... a hundred hours since since Dr Ford's early substance little substantive lists\nEvidence free corroboration free allegations and an chock full of lies herself on her testimony has any additional evidence come out to support or no none none now now we're down to whether Brett Kavanaugh's a bureau ... know this is nonsense\nA beer and coal to love having you on resistance is futile how the Trump feeding left losses collective mind look forward to talking to you again I appreciate that as always thanks so much\nGood to talk to you by by by\nShe she you know what you don't have to agree with her she's got past year and she's got her thing she does her thing I don't always agree with everything she says she was like an agrees with everything that everybody says on either side\nA and it's it's funny but she's got passion and there's nothing wrong with passion of beer holiday that's kind of where we're at now that's the way it does feel and if you notice she had not heard a lot about Dr Ford since then\nYou haven't heard a ton about it\nJust been very quiet like where is she in this ... you know sweat next thing is just full of port big time and now you're talking to somebody\nWho I Believe the funny thing is the second lady they talked about I think she was actually in a wedding party like ten years after that supposedly happened this picture of her that just it's insane can look\nI don't care what side you're on can you would leave step back for a second ago okay it's either this is only game\nI can be honest enough to say that three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... and Joe is your Twitter you can tweet at us loved hearing from your she had been to Joe",
