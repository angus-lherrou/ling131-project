I but I\nBut I did say uh-huh you remember what I said I said we good they are going to buy two games for the next time we talk mhm they could be\nYou know at the bottom of the barrel or they will be back at the top I did put that out there was there that accurate yes\nBut I did say though you did right was that out there you did\nBut you are doom and gloom how well the patriots ... no no no no\nYeah well so much for so much for what I Know [laughter] well hey man I've I've gotten plenty wrong myself so I Would not throw stones and a glass house so [laughter] but I'll tell you what\nIt's not just that the patriots have recovered it's how they have specifically in week five because they beat up on the ... last week in week for or I'm Sorry that would be week three goodness I'm getting really confusing over here so it was\nIt doesn't matter they beat up on the dolphins in week for then at the beginning of week five they crush the cold but you get Julian Edelman back and then you also had this touchdown reception on WB Z FM in the patriots radio network\nOr a plane ticket Michelle [laughter]\n[noise]\n[laughter] [laughter] well [laughter]\nThey got Julian Edelman back up from his pd suspension Mm and he's had\nNinety plus receptions three of the past four years the only year he didn't he got injured right and so to get him back it's a big deal and Josh Gordon his first touchdown reception as a patriots player\nI mean those are two big assets to go along with ... yeah and\nOnly Michele looks really good too does the guy that running game that they've been missing a almost broke a hundred yards but\nBrian ... is when he's when he's out there yes you know and\nYou literally ... defensively you have to change something like I it's only been one person that I've seen cover him one on one\nWithout the help over the top and that ... for the ... ... he's the only one that Rob can't physically dominate when it's one on one\nUm but just watching him manhandle in in you can when you watch them you know he looked a little\n... on Thursday you know he because he takes hard ... hard man ... she's so big when he hit and he falls he falls hard\nAnd I'm I'm just looking I'm like man can he last the whole season now that they have other officers of weapons they can take some pressure off of him because they were going to run him into the ground yeah\nAnd they use them in the running game a lot yeah he's a very silly domineering yes yeah very\nDominant run and pass and I was just watching I was like man if they do not take some of this pressure off of him then this is going to be a short season for Rob Gronkowski videos it is\nYeah and I'll tell you what it helps the patriots next Sunday you get the additional raft\nAnd on Sunday Night Football they're hosting Kansas City or the company who is hosting Jacksonville on Sunday you know that helps the page rates when you face one of the best defenses in football\nI think that game's going to take a toll on the chiefs and for them to turn around and then play a road game nationally televised Sunday Night Football\nCan be a heck of a ... but the chiefs are playing the jags tomorrow helps the patriots next week\nIt does um\nThey're going to get a lot of time and you're just going to be able to get his hamstring together with the extended rest or I mean there's no promotional issue or anything right right ... um and then but you look at their offer and so I mean the pages last week they've average thirty eight points a game\nYeah right and deep into shown up and so now\nIt gets interesting it gets interesting so now you're looking at I'm like okay they're three and two three and or at home\n... alright\nMiami was a fool's gold you called it yeah I hated to do it you know what you do you call it in which was you know [noise]\nIt was there and we're not worried about buffalo we're not worried about the jets [noise]\nIs this kind of like the equivalent of the forty that you can it's still a little bit out for the ... that are no longer with a\n\n... remember a D. R. as this song dedicated this songs dedicated\nTo my home is with the game still live in rural [laughter]\nMiami's gangster leaning right now a man\nThey're well they're leaning I don't know if it's against Elaine and they're just leaning based on the patriots just you know putting that weight on them yeah ... let's\nGo and they they weren't ready they weren't ready for that they're not ready for primetime no no no no they weren't ready for it they thought they were but they're they're definitely not ready for that and then you look at the patriots\nWell we know they're ready yeah you know we we we know they're\nYou know gearing up Kansas City bears those are going to be too great games and they get a break\nA go into the bills so\nThis'll be the next two games for the patriots are really\nKind of show\nCheck after the game Brady throws his five hundred career touchdown pass and for\nAll that's been talked about Brady and ballot jak not on the same page there at odd they aren't getting along here's what Bill Belichick had to say\n... to a lot of different goes to so Tom's [noise]\nNo quarterback I'd rather have uncovered so this is a great weekend a week or you're in the euro\nAll situations as it was a great job\n[laughter] [laughter] than tags on that but it's just funny to me from if you look at both the patriots and the Packers after the Packers didn't play well offensively against the bills Aaron Rodgers questioned the play calling\nAnd there was a little more subtle\nOf hey Rogers and McCarthy aren't on the same page exactly over here\nBut it wasn't anything crazy it wasn't like candies to co exist it's the beginning of the and nothing like that but with Brady and ballot jak throughout the entire off these and that's all you heard which tells me it's so emotional for fans and they just want the patriots the fall of coercion that everybody's emotionally driven\nBut that is definitely at the base of a lot of these hot takes in terms of the patriots unravel\nHere because you don't want to hear more because they have been habitual lines crossers so you don't want to eat and no one ever wants to unless you're from there and no one keeps cheering for the people who are so dominant\nThey probably could still do it right now it given the state of the kicker is in the league ... man yeah Morton at Seventy five [laughter]\nWhich I'm estimating him being right now because I'm forty two he had to have been in the league Fifteen Years\nHe'd at two hundred and thirty five oh yeah yeah oh yeah he was in the small by any stretch of the imagination but I didn't see him at two hundred and thirty five it was solid he'll let you out to man yeah he was\nHe was that big that he's put on about twenty pounds we're talking about tacos and all kinds of stuff that was said all this stuff that you put on his tacos because it was national taco day on Thursday\nAs we're having this random conversation and I'm like how many pounds of you packed on since you're playing days more than even thrown on like coleslaw and talk to those you know as I Am about twenty pounds about two fifty five right now I played at two thirty five I was like what\nYou played at two thirty five that's crazy or he hid it well you have to use in good shape\nSo so limited Morton came into the league in Nineteen eighty two\nWow drafted by the saints I got into the league in Nineteen Ninety eight [laughter]\nYou're right you're short changed him a couple of years ago yeah and he left the league in two thousand seven so from eighty to two thousand and seven Morton Anderson was in the national football league yeah come on man\nLet's think about vinegar theory it's very similar with him he's been around since Ninety six\nCrazy yeah that's that's nuts man it is and for both of them to be so good ... good career so unpredictable yep that's ... that's what you want from your kicker though but you want that you want that don't worry about the guys I got it that's right\nThat's right a lot of teams could use that right now there's no doubt are coming up next to the guy go studios it's one of the best individual match ups of the football weekend I'm

receiver tips you didn't do the air into Ramsey hands so it's not like\nYou know do I think you'll throw a clean pigs six or or a clean intercepted and he's been very cautious with the ball kind of like we saw that breast got his rookie season\nA window I'm I'm a\nCarson when it's his his rookie year just very cautious with the ball and a lot of people are considering ah\nBecause he didn't play it all as your except for that last game but he\nIs playing the way he's playing because he had a full year under a good quarterback and he was able to learn how to be a pro\nThat in itself is valuable for young quarterback and it it I mean it it means so much for him to get all of those represent entire season of reps in learning and film study\nSo where he's out here and now we're like oh okay well we know why they drafted we get why they wanted to remember they wanted to put them in the in the game but Alex Smith was on fire last year\nHe played great yeah led the league and pass or rating I think it's funny because I agree with you eat from where\nPatrick homes that helped him to sit a full season and it's just funny to me because some people are calling out Hugh Jackson for not starting Baker Mayfield from week one\nAnd it's like if we're going to praise Andy Reid and attribute some of the success that Holmes is enjoying this year to him sitting out every game but one start last season why would we turn around and crushed Hugh Jackson for not starting Baker Mayfield a couple of weeks earlier\nI um because no one considered Dr Taylor the caliber of quarterback\nSure that should be studied\nMy ... but I myself have thought Baker could get some valuable information whether even if it was what not to do\nRight we know to ride was cautious with the ball\nYou know he didn't ... and his career as a starter heat in turn the ball over a lot right so there were certain things that you can take from his plane that germ use and and learn from it just so happened that the injury happen and you know they were just on the customers\nTen years but when you have someone like a Alex Smith that you have your quarterback blame behind then yeah you want him to to learn\nRight because it's one thing about Alex he's professional he's accurate\nHe's a leader we know throughout history even in San Francisco\nEven when he ... his position was taken from Mumbai horrible he was leading league in in a passing completion present it it's just what he was he was very accurate and he was very protective of the football those are great qualities are young quarterback can learn from\nThey are they definitely are and I just started thinking about that where some of the quarterbacks that have had success\nSitting for a little bit you have to look at who they're sitting behind because you start thinking about Aaron Rodgers behind Brett Farr if you think about Philip Rivers behind Drew Brees it's rarely a good quarterback who sits a year or two behind a ... you know normally I rarely good quarterback that they're behind\nSo you like like Josh Allen sitting behind a native ... that's not that's not doing anything for right\nYeah I there is something to be said for a kid you're going to learn the most on the job I think you can go the other way because they're the David Carr situation when he goes there with the expansion team at the Houston Texans and he's just a ...\nBack there he developed a lot of bad habits so it's a whole set of\nCircumstances whether it's good to start the guy right away or give them a little bit of time on the bench and let them go that way I just find a dynamic interesting where my home that we give the we attribute some of his access to that\nAnd yet you Jackson will get called out for not starting Baker Mayfield from the get go but let's move on from that from and I think that if you look at this week\nThe week that was the Baker mates\nRob Lowe bandwagon there\nLike I don't know if they have a home where they have to go we are jump on some ...\nSomewhere [laughter] but no one else driving that [laughter] okay where do we go [laughter] oh but right now there is the major may feel bad when you go over there yeah on it that's exactly what has happened Brett Farr\nUnserious XM NFL radio he is on the Baker bandwagon\nThe winners they just have it you know some may call it talking as somebody call it over confident some makeup you call it whatever you want\nBut the winters have that little bit of air about him and how they care of themselves and then they're probably making ability and just held to me are equally as important as you could just see a heightened uh enthusiasm when that players in the game\nHe's now he's not wrong that the tangible thing when I was really it\nReally is it is but the thing I Would point to a couple of players in terms of confidence cocky notice that didn't do anything in the NFL I Would point to same CBO mhm who just\nWait wait till the Florida ring of honor he did do that I'm being in the NFL he did have a I mean\nYou can minimize it because it was a small sample size but he did something no one thought he could do now we know he's not a good thrower of the football that's ... ... we we know that but it was something about him that his teammates and his head coach\nBought into that allowed them to get to the playoffs and then when they play off game against a ferocious Stiller defense\nI hear ya okay they have six game when you hit it but you\nArgue that like so no matter how you feel about it that\nBut we can't we can't as much as we didn't want that to happen or didn't like to watch it we now we can't take that away from the I thought it was fantastic to watch but that guy\nWas the first round hit if that's the thing was trying to get the return on that invent oh gee the twenty fifth overall peculiar he picks after the Mary in St Thomas and you know that you didn't get the return on that I'll give you a better example confident talking is didn't do Jack in the NFL Ryan Leaf\nOkay yeah that guy\nExude confidence until he couldn't play and all of a sudden just fell apart so I look at Baker Mayfield nights they yeah he's got some of those tangible qualities\nBut is it going to translate to great success in the NFL I hear all these think Tim ... is the winner in college colt McCoy was a great winter in college

Kelly doing a tiger fist pump\nRisk is not what you want to take and even though the ball down the field where there's not risky and then there's force and things and that leaves the you know turnovers it leaves the mistakes and I'm not like you know having shots down the field that are not taking it just a matter of you know kind of way and those options on top so it's just kind of have in that field and\nFill in the Russian having a good understanding of it when you can do it when you camp\nOkay so I look at Eli Manning in terms of this reaction to you can't hit the quarterback you can still hit them the main reason ... ...\nBack in the junior can get open down field\nSo you can still hit the quarterbacks granted it's definitely being down sized in terms of what you can do legally while hitting a quarterback but you could still knock them around it's not like all those fifteenth tax when the gated because of all rushing to pass or penalty\nThere'd be zero sacks given up\nSo it can still happen but I think we overreact to some of these calls because they are a noxious ... tend to be you can't touch them at all you can you can knock them into next week it's just you can't land on top of them and it better not be late\nYeah but you can knock 'em in the next week with four or more you helmets though like it it's no knocking into next week or ... you can't read enough force anymore to knock him into next week because you can't use any of your forcible assets\nRight so it's a hug you hug them to the ground are you a hug them you know earn go for the ball like you know von Miller and I'm\nGoing to ... they are just going for the ball if you hit a ball out of the quarterbacks hand without him getting hit its effect\nThat's right where I Am still do it and now you have to go for the ball which bodes well for quarterbacks because those who are in the pocket and who have great ball awareness and control with in the pocket that serves the better because guys aren't teeing off on them now they can ... you know move within the pocket step up took the ball\nPeyton Manning was great with that took the ball away step up Tom Brady is great at it you know what I mean Aaron Rodgers these guys no arms are being swung in all of that so if you're just going for the ball chances are you're not going to get it\nBecause those quarterbacks who have pocket awareness aren't going to let you get it\nSo you know that's just another problem you\nSecond the quarterback [noise] but you\nReally careful we are talking about like Russell Wilson being judicious while running the football ... taking additional punishment can be really judicious\nAs a defensive player these days when you hit the quarterback that's where we're\nComing up with ... found the fact that the bear [noise]\nIt sounds like um [noise]\nIt sounds like second place in the big twelve in\nThe ring do have a a second wavering too yeah [noise]\nHe knows that you can hear in his voice is

open it's a nice and cool you you know year or get under the blankets you're comfortable I Do not miss the winter though I don't miss the snow I don't miss the slush I don't miss\nThe cold I don't miss the waking up and not wanting to get out of bed because it's it's freezing so I Know you're getting there I Know you're not there yet not yet so I I miss elements of it but ah when you're digging out from under ten feet of snow and I'm sitting here in beach weather I don't think I'll I'll miss it that much\nDo you think we have enough to talk about today and I'm not kidding around if you want to go and get a hold of us Aaron underscore tour as an ad stinking genius one\nUm let's just kind of updates some of these waves scores going on in college football or some of the big ones Georgia's just putting away Vanderbilt right now forty one six late in the fourth I think a little bit over three minutes left there\nAh this just a final I Believe\nI I just had a final Notre Dame of thirty one sixteen uh over Virginia Tech that was in the fourth so I'm as a score start coming in and we started getting the vitals will pass a blog\nOr Washington knocked off UCLA thirty one twenty four UCLA hung tough though they're arid I mean it was it was it was a a tight game for a little bit there at the end if they would've scored that touch on which I did get the psychic but they weren't able to do that\nYeah I'll say this is that first of all I I and I'm a guy I think you are the same pick to Washington to play in the college football playoff yeah um that often Jake Browning the quarterback I think he's gotten worse every single year and we've had a last year he was heard\nI think part of it is chip Kelly is a good football coach now is he ever going to reach that success level yet it Oregon where they won four straight packed twelve titles that pack ten at the time probably not but this guy is going to get things turn around he's going to get this team competitive I\nKnow that right now they're sitting here and oh and five but\nThey are going to get better and they certainly showed\nScience I think they'll have a lot of patience I mean obviously this is in his fault this is the team that he inherited and you just don't turn around things overnight but\nI don't know if I even expected that this team was going to go out and start off over five or or be in this situation um I I mean really doesn't make much of a different style if if you're not competing for like a nine or ten when season what difference does it make if you have five wins or zero in for the most part\nYeah I and I think in like defense of chip Kelly first of all they lost to Cincinnati early in the season nobody thought Cincinnati Cincinnati right now is sitting after today\nSix you know I Believe they were actually the first team to become ... I could be mistaken about that but there are six you know\nColorado is undefeated I don't think anybody thought they were going to be that good Fresno state by the way is foreign one and so you sit around and you look around and it's not an excuse for being when list at this time and I agree with you I expected him to have a winner or two on the board but some of those teams on that schedule maybe a little bit better than we thought that\nBut I mean you talk about a system where you actually need the right players um you really can't plug anybody just any person into that system and and it starts with the quarterback ... with chip Kelly so next year obviously they'll get better they have no wins out or get the get go down\nAnd I expected with about two three years be right back up there in the packed twelve I mean is it it's too great of an institution to great of a school and two great of a program right to the heart of Los Angeles for not them to be significant in and be relevant in college football air and while I Would say\nThe way especially with us she kind of struggling you think maybe they can sneak in get some players that they normally wouldn't if USC was on top of their game I agree UCLA is going to be fine and oh by the way they play in the same divisions the Arizona Wildcats you know they got one went on the schedule every\nOh thank you speaking about my Wildcats Arizona ten couch seven I'm I'm I'm In the semi good mood was my team's never winning when we're doing this show together which seems like every time we're on the air the game's going on so at least my Wildcats have I Believe right now\nOr let's give it ten minutes we'll check back [noise]\n[noise] you know who they several of lead over fourteenth rank Stanford\nOr that one at the end of the first but we've had some upsets but a starting early today we set the pace with some really really good games\nAnd that Texas Oklahoma game when Texas was up by three touchdowns\nI pick up my phone and I'm saying to myself okay what do I put on Twitter right now do I go after my Sunday partner Chris plank do why wait till the game's over a ... not that I'm worried about him getting upset mind you Erin\nI'm I'm worried that if I put suddenly got on Twitter he'll get getting bombarded with tweets while he's working at that on that that you know what I mean\nI just feel you know would constantly go off or something like that wow what a classy individual you are not just about being thoughtful I I have been thoughtful so I I gave it some time afterwards and then of course I tweeted out what are the odds of him coming into work tomorrow I think I I put it at a no\nA minus three hundred which is the big favorite right now um but I never thought that they allow Oklahoma to get three touchdowns and get back into staying tie it up and then Oklahoma but Texas come down and\nGet in field goal range um and and oh jeez thicker the kicker everybody's talking about it\nAnd nails at and they go onto the victory that so when that propels Texas maybe back to national prominence it's been such a long time Oklahoma I'm not going to say they're out of it but wow that that hurts big time right there\nYeah I agree on all of it ah first of all yeah Texas certainly back in the thick of things I mean look there five in one everyone kind of points to that opening lost to Maryland\nBut there haven't been many teams since that game that have been better than Texas I mean look they beat us see they beat a good TCU team today was obviously the signature when look you know obviously you want to win [laughter]\nYou don't want it to come down to a field goal when you're up as much as Texas was up at various points in this game but at the same time not only is a winner when but\nSports

dot com that Vegas covers dot com good evening he's Aaron tourism only\nSpend your race Saturday Night I mean so much going on well updates on what's happening on and baseball Yankees\nLooks like they're going to go ahead and even this uh best the five series at one game a piece of six to read right now over the red Sox um yeah said just standing at home plate watching his home run\nOr like it was the whole left home when he was ever going to hit the life I'm sure the red Sox are not happy about that but since the playoffs or they were throwing that anybody so All right that was six to Yankees lead the red Sox I like I said if you want to get a hold of us Erin underscore tourism at stinking genius one\nI like this one area that says part of the appeal of the red river a well rivalry I'll say is the game after losing\nA fan base gets to play got a town in the winter stays and parties in Dallas all night Mike in Jacksonville says trust me fans don't want a home and home for the Georgia it is awesome that there's one rivalry per season that transcends ... a conventional scheduling so\nI guess some people I see a neutral site out there and it's got dumped on by or\nAs is right Spanier is wrong wish I'd rather get you for the rest of the show you you go sit in the corner and think about what you\nDid I think that can you imagine if UCLA and USC was neutral ... you know a neutral site instead of you know beat at the rose bowl in at the at the coliseum they you know just put it it's a neutral site place would you like that that'd be horrible\nNo but it's not the tradition we said I said earlier I said the thing that makes college football great is the tradition um and so I obviously every rivalry is different um every um you know it's just\nHorrible that's terrible it was played in Birmingham every year for like thirty\nSomething years I don't know I'm like well look at this amount of Wicca PT are right now yeah it was played early on in the Eighteen hundreds\nIt was in Tuscaloosa but that's what I was first on the air I think yes I Know yeah that's what I mean the ... that I said oh I'm so proud of you ... quickly so from\nNineteen oh for until Nineteen eighty eight it was in\nBirmingham there goes your to the tradition out the window then right\nBefore they realized that they realize that tradition sucked in they put it on neutrophils actually I'm looking at it now yeah it looks as though it remained alternating between all burned in Birmingham for a number of years until it finally went over in Tuscaloosa just in the two thousands\nWell let me I was just what are you you're the college basketball guy also do like neutral site\nCollege ... I mean I Love the tournament but I mean do do you like when they have these like pre season tournaments in Hawaii and Alaska\nAnd places like that because I I just love the fan base I Love when games are played in North Carolina or or at Duke or you know and one of these great places great Venus it the fans go absolutely crazy\nI like them both I mean I think that's a great thing about college come on I like them both well I mean look that's like your dating two girls I ask how old are you like better I like a ball stop at\nWas first of all that's not a terrible thing [laughter]\nThat or if that's the problem I got his picking which one of my girlfriends I like the most that I live in a pretty charmed life but hey I'm engaged now I'm joking about health care me in trouble yeah um so I mean what I was gonna say was so this year college basketball hate to brag coming up soon\nYou can Kentucky open the season the first game of the year is Duke in Kentucky wow that would never happen if it was a home and home but they're doing it on a neutral court it's in Indianapolis I think it's going to be most\nIs willing to play that game if it's played on the road and so to me and and obviously look when did you do Carolina then they play in Chapel Hill then they play in Durham will get good or out of conference games in the I'm\nOn a you know in in ... road games Israel so I don't know to me I think I like the balance I like the difference I like when sports kind of mixed things up it it doesn't always have to be at one place where the other as long as you get a good crowd as long as the fans like it I have no problem\nWith tried the top twenty five right now Notre Dame thirty eight twenty two or this game was Seventeen sixteen at the half Notre Dame and taking a Seventy nine lead on a fumble scoop up at a touchdown with about two minutes up Virginia came Virginia Tech comes back\nGets the touched shouted totally Seventeen sixteen it the half of them said to myself while while I got to put Old Dominion in my in my time I was one in five right now but I'm Notre Dame now pulling away all and the second half\nA look ... Virginia Tech not as bad as they saw that Old Dominion game not as good as they put in the first half against Notre Dame they'll lose this one I don't think those are they going to lose any spots over this to be honest with you I think\nA little state number six or move up just slightly because there was a couple of upsets one of them are in the Mississippi State Auburn gay but other than that I don't think there'll be any penalty for Notre Dame for that the Virginia tech him\nAlthough definitely move up they're ranked a head they were ranked are behind LSU in one poll and they were right behind LSU in Oklahoma in another poll right LSU of course yeah I was going to say I think the story with Notre Dame now as you look at the back half of their schedule\nThere are not a lot of good teams on that schedule no there's not they play a pit navy at Northwestern FSU\n... watch out for northwest of look how they play tough to you know the Michigan State game um you know they are the Michigan gay but they are Seventeen nothing lead you gotta watch out for that team\nAbsolutely but I I think to the broader point they're still gonna they're gonna be favored every game going forward\nThat's going to make the play off and that's going to shake things up from the perspective of does that mean a cleansing gets left out a Big Ten champ gets left out Oklahoma I mean imagine\nWhere we're going to get two teams left out if Notre Dame ... not one to two conferences I mean a yeah I mean if you of Alabama\nAnd you have Notre Dame let's just say those two teams are in their um now you're going to have you have an independent and you have an FCC team oh so you know you you still got what uh for the coverage has been only two spots open there\nAnd I'll tell you this ... this is already something that people need to start thinking about\nWhat if Georgia goes to the SEC championship game undefeated or Alabama for that matter they both do\nAnd the loser of that game is twelve in one and they're only lost his to whatever the number one team doesn't look as we've got to be two teams from the SCC\nAnd Notre Dame and everybody's going to be a all upset about that and probably Ohio State of discontinue you want the fastest way to get to eight teams in the college football that's the way to do it leave three power conferences out\nAll those commissioners there'll be sitting around on New Year's eve\nBe drinking champagne not not happy Sam champagne sad champagne mad dog twenty twenty champagne yeah there'll be out to be drinking out of a paper bag saying well\nThere is wait we are leaving a ton of money on the table here look at this Notre Dame is in second year in a row hypothetically in this area that we'd have to SEC teams\nOh my goodness I think I think before the end of the play off we would already be an eight for next year a that is the fastest way if you want if you're a person guy or girl that once that Eighteen playoff I think that's the fastest way to get ...\nMe give you an analogy here and then what are you Cindy Crawford is that an algae beautiful beautiful woman\nBut she has that mall now some people go oh why don't you have that more removed I think that bowl is sexy and that's part of who she is you\nTim nit picking it to like the beautiful girls that his name nit picky at a team that is destroying everybody but they've scored sixty five or is there real blemish on this Alabama team\nYou know I I'll say this first of all you gave Ohio State crap for about four weeks I gave up thirty three to Oregon State and I just came out I yeah and you're just going to give Alabama pass for given up thirty one does to Arkansas\nTo because they're Alabama when your score and sixty five point and I know that's what a wild they probably had right around there also but I mean jeeze I I I'm not I'm not going to be too much of it because they've just been destroying everybody up to this point and and and look I'm supposed to knock them for what do you make thirty four points\nDoesn't matter get the wind move onto the next one nobody's going to remember if you were sloppy this week or you were good that week or does it matter just get that winning keep racking up wins because you do that you'll find yourself where every Ohio State fan wants them at the end of the year which is competing for national champs\nToo big upsets one Florida will not big but for the ... B L issued twenty seven Nineteen um that Trump's LSU not five in one\nGood game Florida when a head got the pick way to put the ... that made the difference or from one to eight I Believe it was she was still tried to come down tried to get to touch other to point or um turned over yet or I I think it was actually\nA turnover turnover I'm ... I'm not sure but any way\nForward it gets to victory in Mississippi State we're not talking about this stuff they beat Auburn twenty three nine wave goodbye to Auburn um they're going to be nowhere near the top\nTen after this loss no they're not an eminent brought up a good point before the show that Washington who's obviously probably in the best position to win the pact twelve yeah does not look good that they lost to operate in week one real quick I Want to go back to Ohio State for a sec yeah\nWith Alabama Alabama is going to be such a heavy favorite against everybody\nWho do you think is the the team that matches up ... like if if you had to if you had to pick one team that could potentially pull the upset against Alabama's only college football team's not the Buffalo Bills not the Minnesota Vikings like who is that team because we're talking about Ohio State\nAnd they looked a little sloppy today and between them and Georgia I just I don't know who that team is going to be before the in the year that steps up to challenge Alabama\nThought it was Georgia I liked Jake from you know I like that\nI think a Notre Dame ... you know they got that X factor um they got a really good defense though at times they don't show it I feel like they've got a good opposites but at times they don't show it also\nAnd when the clicking on all cylinders they're not that far off from Alabama but just sometimes you know they can't get out of their own way are you supposed to be with penalties so you know I guess is that type of team that you'd never ... you never know what you're going to get the intangibles but I Would I I'd say Notre Dame of I was just going to pick one\nYeah and I I don't know that I Would disagree with you on that I mean first of all I Know Stanford's and not looking very good right now but overall you look at Notre Dame resume they they have that went over Michigan early in the year that when looks better every single week they beat Stanford last week to beat Virginia Tech this week that game just one final\nBut since they switch quarterback since they went to ... book the quarterback who's been starting from here on out they put a fifty six points at Wake Forest\nThey beat staffer thirty eight Seventeen and then today a twenty two point when at Virginia Tech he seems to be the difference maker for them and I'll say this I Know Notre Dame traditionally they they're overrated there are ... are there are a public team and Vegas everybody loves to bedroom\nThey look like the real deal to me they have the size of the speed the athleticism defense I really like when I see out of that team\nI was a check in on the lake games and I think the baseball is about the wrap up so when we get back we'll see if that becomes a final or for the last segment you there and tourism only Spanier ... says Fox Sports radio\nOne college football is a winner and mocked sports radio Facebook post dot com slash Fox Sports radio\nAnd don't forget about our podcast just go to Fox Sports radio dot com [noise]\nNeed your social media fair for you see these Fox Sports radio\nHey it's been male or here everybody's got it\nIt's and the good thing is you don't have to drop off or pick up anything\nYou have to do is go to guy go dot com and in Fifteen minutes you could be saving Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance that extra money in your pocket it just may be the most rewarding to do that you do today\nIf you love football yelling at television screens with friends and we're including with someone else's name on it [noise] there's a seat waiting for you at buffalo wild wings where you can enjoy football food and put all beverages on our new five dollar game day menu\nCheeseburger fries brought cocktails and pitchers of beer or just five dollars each escaped to\nBuffalo wild wings Bryson participation vary by location knock ballad with any other offer police drink respond\n[noise] Saturday November seventh seen it the first annual stopped dropping run five K. race to benefit timber Mesa fire and medical auxiliary at station Fifteen sixteen or six street in shallow competitive he and his at eight\nThe cost is thirty five dollars for adults and twenty five for children ages six to twelve\nOur free register online\nT.

he played at rice memorial high school in South Burlington yeah I Know where that's where my son when he went on drafted yeah\nAnd then he uh I'm having trouble finding an end well there you go well maybe I'll be the first to get back into the NBA\nSo I mean we're we're dead ringers but go check it out I real quick you know we were talking while we were talking about this last hour when I I kind of not solely mentioned you know I'm not too crazy when we mentioned about the river Red River rivalry about that putting on a neutral site I think it'd be a lot more exciting if we did home and home\nA and I and I said the same thing about um you know Georgia and Florida of course a or it used to be the world's largest outdoor cocktail party\nWhat you're missing Aaron is that sooner or later this is where college football drops the ball\nIn college basketball at least for the first couple of rounds you're at least clothes or semi close um work fans can travel to the games to some of these neutral site games in football you might not have that luxury and if you're going to go to eight teams you have to have\nHome field or at least for every round until you get to the championship because fans can travel that often or if you win more than one game it's tough to do it around the holiday time because it it gets expensive and three you don't get the real football fans the real students\nUm if you have these big neutral site games that are far away so I think you're gonna miss the boat if you don't have home field advantage Aaron\nYeah if we expand eight I totally agree and that's another reason why I don't know that expanding to eat is the best thing by the way another thing that nobody wants to really admit because everyone wants to make their everyone's so anti NCAA yeah but the reason that there's that big gap\nOf like a month between the end of the regular season and the start of the bowl season slashed playoff is 'cause kids actually have like finals in classes and stuff like that\nAnd so I think from what is that\nIt's it's the classes like Illinois on my list and I know I never got a seventh grade but ah you know the rest of us that went to a real ...\nThat's another thing reason why I'm against expanding playoff\nIs for that reason and I think it gets convoluted too with the idea of if you keep a conference championship game because like I said some years you have two or three teams from one division that are clearly better I mean look at the Big Ten this year it's very clear that the three best teams\nIn the league are in the Big Ten east it's ah Ohio State Penn State of Michigan and so I think that everyone just wants to go to an Eighteen playoff but I think the point that you bring up the point that I bring up it will\nCreate a lot of headaches that nobody talks about be at home field be it neutral site be it figuring out how to get to those eight teams I don't think it just moves everybody thinks it\nRight there you go he's Aaron underscore tourism ads thinking genius one if you want to get a hold of us I'm a couple of the things I Want to get to before we finish up looking at the top twenty five\nThousands and thousands of college football player well high school whose me of a high school football players you got the great state of Florida Pennsylvania California Texas I mean some major hotbeds for some high school football you up\nThousands of kids to choose from\nFor NC double a division one simple question why as Alabama though head and shoulders better every year\nThan everybody else it's not like they get every good player because there's so many to choose from it's not like they're dominating a quarterback before this year because it's jailing hurts wasn't crushing it statistically even though he was like what forty into the store or something like that\nSo what makes ... not just better than everybody else but significantly better than everybody else would you have all these great out better job of of a high school students out there\nI got an answer for you it's two words it's a Knicks saving\n\n\n\n\nGo mobile was the last seven mobile labs they dont want to have a ... times are details\nTrash the gasoline price Broussard Dr Parker changed in my car man archery bows no amount of people say it's good these are the names they bring you the best sports stars\nOr your weekdays I agree I think so it's a wonderful thing are you with us they walk sports radio\nIn LA I'm In actually I Know here John Glenn was going on me I\nThink is the only thing that matters is October\nAnd that would be asking seniors ... [noise]\n\n[noise] um\n[noise] [noise] [noise] I become a new card members discover card will match all the Cash Cab Hubert dollar for dollar at the end of your first year or more\nI discovered dot com slash match remember that limitations apply easier and Torres I'm already spanned your great Saturday Night a six day of a whole bird or we'll get some more of the top twenty five we'll get to our top four or five I Will do that all of it will get into the patriots sex act but also because\nUh people going ballistic up here like the patriots are back to the super bowl ... they've had a couple of words in a row over the tough dolphins and Indianapolis call to the coast may be the worst team in football I I actually think they're worse than the\nFire you were running Bill Bill a check out of town you were sending Tom Brady to the retirement home here they are three into\nAs I said [noise] first place in the division [noise] they're like we all know they're going to finish forcing it to get the number\nOh stop it they're they're not you know let me tell you something you will get into this next segment but you're getting a false sense of security if you think of this team is back on track\nWe gotta we gotta get a bet going over under ... what is what is so you think they're going to go eat and eat\nNo I'd I'd probably take more like at night and seven member they got Kansas City coming up they got Chicago coming up that that's definitely to us as you put that in the book that that's going to be two officers right there yeah and you said the dolphins were definitely in the last I don't want no points\nDo poor as to how I feel that your wife's out right yeah a little bit older and cranky or but other than that that I had my warm milk yet so I'll Try to get that at the ... tried to go ahead and do that we ought to get an over under back going in and it's got to be for something because I'm going to win that that and I want something good and I will send me some food to\nFresh table table to rush maple syrup or\nYeah where do things like that farm to table you gotta send me some of that or a farm to table you love that you're just love that I Do I Do well when a ... listen next segment will will hash out of bed here 'cause the patriots are going to win the division as they always do get to ten wins that I don't know when something good for\nMe a couple of games to go on Washington state now forty nine thirty over Oregon State cows still with the fourteen ten lead over Arizona but they are driving now and your child looks like they're going to pull off the up said I Know it's still in the third but Utah twenty seven\nStanford seven separate coming at it and the inside the top Fifteen to the country nine forty looked into thirds will still plenty of time um but ... has done nothing a Utah now with the twenty seven seven lead I'm surprised about that when considering I Believe it's ... it's the home team on that one and they're getting men handled by\nScott yeah laid out a ... um well I I just kind of looked up because I I Can't watch the game and do the show because I get cranky put Arizona intercepted they were running it back then the ball got smacked out of the guy running it's a back out of his hands\nWhen flying in the air and another Arizona Wildcats player picked it up and read it the rest of the way for a touchdown\nYes that was the most I Would say the most bizarre touched on the day but Alabama actually had a very similar touchdown against Arkansas\nI'm waiting for like you can't advance into where the guy fumble that that that this and that I Am waiting for something like that to happen\nI sure hope so man I'm like hello in this game\nSo thank you I I Know you're just going to get an aggravate the hell out of me on that so um that's still some of the top twenty five still going up I'm editing really surprised I mean of course there was a major upset it's we\nNot got we got into a little bit in our number one but one of them being LSU going down to Florida a lot of people were jumping up at LSU bandwagon\nAnd coach oh um they've had some really good victories\nThough I get all this against the way this Florida deep tough this ... this was a pretty good for the ... that a good game\nYeah Flora looking better every week under ... and it's amazing they went for an eight last year which I'm echoing there already at five in one right now and I'll say this with LSU too is that it did feel like I don't want to say unless he was on borrowed time or anything but\nThey they had those two wins over top ten teams first of all I think we can all agree after tonight all burned is nothing resembling a top ten team I don't even know if their top twenty five team at this point right and we were fooled by that Martin with a hundred percent and if you looked at the stats on LSU specifically on often\nThey did not look like a team that was going to be able to run the table that was going to be able to compete with Georgia who they play next week Alabama down the road when they play them in November they look like a good seven five eight and four kind of team but for whatever\nYour point already the better team Florida one today a Texas winds forty eight forty five now Texas at a forty five\nI'm forty then it's a three touchdown lead so what was it forty five twenty four and then of course Oklahoma scores three touchdowns in a matter of like five minutes they tied up with Texas give them credit Ellen Ellen gr just phenomenal and that was Dr they get a game winning field goal\nTo get the forty eight forty five victory in this one\nOtherwise if they lose this oh my goodness the Texas faithful I mean who knows what they do after the game if they're going to drop something like this but big victory this could go ahead and change the landscape a little bit I mean Texas has been on hard times for ever since a background was gone so massive victory to get over Oklahoma\nYeah absolutely and it's funny with Texas and in any team and we see this in sports all the time is that sometimes when you've lost for so long you kinda have to learn how to win right and I think this was one of those games where they were up so big\nAnd they were even talking about a Gostin joke lot we're talking about during the game is they kind of changed their strategy they kind of changed the way that they were approaching things specifically on defense they weren't they weren't as aggressive on our fence they weren't kind of playing at the temple that they normally work and all of a sudden you give that game\nA basically a way by giving up all those um you know all those points late\nI Would that had also with Texas is that um you know they just got so sloppy obviously that big collar Murray run which is what like all these something yards high you let him get down on the sidelines I'm not I have no idea what it is so random but\nYou know everyone is this is kind of a well known thing but he's a he's a baseball player he's already been drafted in signed by the Oakland A's he's a millionaire first of all I'm Amazed at the Oakland A's let him play baseball let him play football\nBut to Oakland I write what I say Oklahoma yes yes go ahead whatever so\n... says Chris plank ever mentioned it's you know kind of curious\nBecome well you don't you know what's interesting about that whole thing is\nI thought I was going to be able to watch them this year because the uh Vermont lake ... says here in town or the or they're not ... they're like the rookie league I don't even know what they call it for the uh Oakland they oh oh so I'm assuming once he does decide to get into baseball he'll be coming up to Vermont and and start the year with the Vermont lake\nMonsters yeah I'll just say I ... it's come on out okay I I Would assume Chris plant that would make more of a sense for Chris play kind of deal but one you know I'm Down I Love my my east coast my New England\nBut to a he must be a heck of a baseball player if he's given up football and by the way it makes sense baseball longer careers more guaranteed money I get why he would do it but to be so good at football and to basically be given it up it you know the uh basically everyone sing at the end of the season to focus on baseball he must be really\nOh look a big deal you know when I went to high school or high school quarterback was a pretty damn good baseball player also okay so you know so you're just our our high school quarterback went to a Super Bowl and was also the number we're picking the baseball draft I bought that who is that\nA J Schrader oh I think he told me that you have is the number one pick in all the baseball and uh things didn't work out what you see a way to play football and then um went through a Super Bowl with who is an Oakland or why she did I don't even remember anymore to be honest with the wow not all that are that way we are about weeds in our school did we not are\nThe culture like two or three plays from being three and two for one instead of one in four so I just don't buy that they're that that\nThere were so banged up for that patriot game do you saw that like five or six guys didn't practice and they were dropping like flies during that is the culture yeah they're against the patriots exactly so then how can\nIt gets credit for winning the game against the colds and the dolphins them because you got to win the games that you're supposed to in the NFL good teams ... listen let's not forget Minnesota got blown out by the Buffalo Bills rightly or this year I'm you know a Philly has lost ugly games this year\nPittsburgh got embarrassed at home last week by Baltimore Baltimore is a good team but that's a gate Pittsburgh supposed when I'm not going to discredit the patriots\nFor winning the games that they're supposed to be out at this as well you look at those two lost his first of all Jacksonville I think we're going to find out just how good that team is this week when they play at Casey but they are unquestionably the best defense in the sport I give the patriots of past that was the jak about Detroit ... what's the past there\nThat Patricia he knew everything all this heavy lift his hat around in the ... back to them you know so no I mean look it was on the road it was a Sunday night game Detroit needed it\nI just think we do we do this every single year with the patriots they always lose games in September they always learn from it they always get better now I look at that team Edelman back\nThey don't have to rely on ... every single possession and make plays James White was obviously phenomenal and oh by the way I don't know if you saw some guy named Josh Gordon five hundred career a touchdown pass from Brady to Josh Gordon the patriots are back then\nThe McGregor fight is about to start what are the chances that this is still going on where we get back from the break we'll let you know what's happening or as the

radio studios out in Vermont we got a lot of football to get through obviously for\nNFL week six out there but uh and the last things you want to hit on a college football before we move on from that good day upsets in some uh some really great games\nYeah I think it's pretty cool I think the the playoff pictures started takes shape obviously a it is too early to say anything definitive but we've talked a lot about Notre Dame where they fit in\nUm Georgia clams and those kind of teams but then also the teams on the periphery Miami's still only with one moss Washington wins again they looked like the best opportunity for the pack twelve to get a representative there is a lot of football left to be played but I Do think it's pretty cool that we're starting to get a feel for who those teams are going to be\nA you'll keep us up to date on what's going well keep up with what's going on in the fight the Gregor fight 'em so you have the latest on that Aaron or what my friend ah\nThe stream that I was using maybe ...\nRound yeah ... what happened out he's done ... still undefeated\nBreaking was yeah it was pretty much just man handling him every which way possible to say it was uh what was the official time about when they stopped the five what was the official time\nIt was in the force still awaiting the official time they are in the ring a lot of confusion of course in the rain is it just ended so there's not even an announcement or PA announcer in there but he was being choked McGregor and finally tapped out can be twenty seven oh\nWow wow and that's what I saw in the first couple of rounds to I'm surprised that even went that far ah macgregor was on his back just absolutely getting humble\nAnd that standing left right before they went to the ground in round two that you mentioned last hour and plenty of shots delivered by could be on the ground more standing in round number three so with a tired could be counter kind of out boxed in but out of the four rounds that was maybe counters only round he would have had an advantage\nAnd I I bet you are a lot of people that are caught him McGregor because he was a a plus one fifty five anytime you get ... yeah yeah they were there are probably getting some serious do on that so I could imagine they were running to the window\nThen you've got the call about on a counter oh he's\nNot going to get that money back that's for sure\nSo apparently could beat after he submits Conor McGregor Yahoo says ... jumped over the cage to go after someone in the corner of McGregor why was the reason for the confusion immediately after\nSomebody that uh that was a one of the corner meant for McGregor\nYeah to go outside the cage to where the corner men are and then he was taking a course security intervene\nYou guys know you guys know the whole story about during the building to fight the Connor was going pretty hard after ... coach and the whole bus incident with relations so this this is deeply personal\nContinuing being undefeated being a ticket that moded you know I I thought I thought was going to win I Love Connor but I was like to be I I talked to so many people about this and Jonah\nI lean on him a lot for us the analogy that could be business Savage and it's like as much as I like Connor and how he can still fight that doesn't mean he's better than this guy the guy's a defeated for a reason\nAnd it will honors first and then they fight in nearly two years memory at the boxing a year ago but as far as this and it's starting again the U.S the contract now that he has but it's a loss I should say another loss for him in the early ... how do I get back in the boxing ring up [laughter] it was a wild yeah it's a fake and who's to say he won't\nI won't get public make ten times more money to get me back into the box cigarette what are you\nKidding me can barely count the money he has his it as it is now you know wow so we have an undefeated lightweight champion still ... off so what what's\nNext for Conor McGregor there's not going to be a rematch here right those are these done with this guy right\nYeah I was kind of wonder that myself I mean I Know that earlier in the week there was buzz about another fight when they see as an aid he has basically said nah already beat him that was like ... ago wasn't it or what well there was there was a whole controversy\nBecause at two thirty Nate Diaz is supposed to fight Dustin portray a and both of them were really irritated when it was announced that he was going to face could be at this pay per view to twenty nine so\nI mean he could go back and face Diaz because the second fight that they had was one of the best\nOne of the best us She's seen in a long time so maybe he goes back to their maybe takes time off you know guys to me this kind of mirrors and I I don't know how much does\nWhen Ron drowsy went away and after she lost to Holly home right and then she was like a year she took like a year off and comes back and get destroyed by Amanda noon as and now she's in WWE so I'm not saying that this could be it for Conor McGregor in UFC but\nCan like find some interesting match ups for him to potentially like continue to celebrate cards because this was supposed to be a great fight and there was a it was a massacre with the ... thing though the thing that I think it was different with arouse the thing\nIs that I think that when she got beat by highly home she had never even there was no contest I mean they were talking about she's the bad is woman on earth she's got a member of people were like we should put her in the ... I guess right or it may well women\nAnd I I really think that once she got hit like figuratively and literally when she got hit in the face for the first time she didn't know how to react and and I remember watching that Amanda Nunez but I remember where I was I remember what I was doing\nAnd I remember watching them in at noon as fight and I ... you could just see she was scared in the octagon I don't get that sense for McGregor but the question that I Would ask you guys is how long does he remained the faith not scared but I just don't think he will confident about that\nYeah I I think very early on it was very clear that a ... kind of style wasn't suited for him because then the third round\nThey stayed on their feet and kinda kinda traded punches with 'em right and so I I live in the first two rounds where he's lying on his back and getting pummeled though exactly and that's what I'm saying is and I just think the style didn't work out but I I\nThink it'll be interesting to see going forward I mean he still Connor the biggest draw in the sport by far\nBut if you keep losing these matches I mean at a certain point people stop paying to see it you know and so I Know we just sign that big contract I'm not saying he's leaving MA anytime soon yeah but but I mean you know I mean he lost innate Diaz once you ... you know he Avengers that loss with a win\nBut now this is too and what his last four or five fights and he beat Eddie Alvarez if you are you know in his last UFC fight but I mean it you know we're looking at you know to losses in like I said is less four or five flights I just wonder how\nOf course my Arizona Wildcats can't pick it up on second or third and wants to put that back the cow with three Twenty one left in the game\n[noise] only has to do is think about the\nYou don't do it with the ball down by three uh three Twenty one left in that one so that's some of the games going on a matter of fact there's\nA few non top twenty five Utah oh this one is Utah still with the thirty seven Twenty one lead over Stanford Stanford coming in\nAs a top Fifteen of the country so not looking good there it was down to thirty Twenty one but Utah just getting a touchdown now on the board Colorado State twenty eight seven over San jose state other in the third in Fresno state fourteen three over Nevada\nThey've started the port there and of course the Hawaii game Wyoming or why all tied up three there and the second quarter in that one but weeks six and\nF. L. action I gotta tell ya\n\n\n\n\nYou'll mobile what the what are we going to be going to have a calm for [noise]\n\nFor the a lot of ...\nIs boxes horse radio dry\nLegit in college I talk ... accent and takes on ... in the red river showdown\nSaturday at eleven eastern box every game is everything\nErnie Ernie Ernie [noise]\nArnie Ernie Ernie Ernie Banks and wrote you buy a car and he you way you treat your ... thanks to all over I discover card we bring an amateur them\nAlong with their tours I'm already Spanier water brawl oh my\nGoodness this is ... ... after the this is unbelievable like this is everybody's talking about oh could be and unfortunately we had technical difficulties Aaron alluded to this we're always at the same ... and after all this happened\n... gets out of the cage it proceeds to go after somebody encounters corner right those his mouth Pete Rose mouthpiece Adam climbs over the cage and starts a brawl lake circa like the two thousand four malice at the palace it was like jumping into the stands\nAnd then as that is happening you can see a trainer for it could be jumping in the cage and slug Conor McGregor from behind yeah I'm surprised they didn't take my goodness they should have taken him down like this this it it's just like next level broiling because I told you guys\nThe buildup to this spike Connor ... right after could be and what made this really personal\nTargeting his trainer make little talking about him being basically a terrorist it was like it was all this really deeply personal stuff in the buildup to this fight because these two do not like each other you remember that you remember the ... the ... incident that was hacked\nPeople there were there was a ... you're right there was a second guy yeah who came in and I'm assuming\nThat person was could be because like I said this is this is not just\nConnor versus could be this is Congress people versus can beams people this is this is like a war and we're witnessing it like right in front of our eyes like this was\nI I've never seen anything like this in a in a competitive light\nSporting event like this because like you know we talk about like okay the security levels that certain things but and you see all sorts of crazy stuff happened in the cage but I've never seen somebody Stuart abroad outside the cage and then another ball breaks out inside the cage so that was that was like I've never seen anything like that before that was\nMan and what did you think big boy what did you think about that\nWell first of all say this is that uh we just got way in from Mike Tyson on Twitter ... all the guy who bit someone's ear off says watching them McGregor could be fight unimaginable never thought it would go down like this crazier than my fight riot\nSo when you have a guy who bit off somebody here in the ring saying that things got crazy that's when you know things got freaking crazy\nI think look this all stems back to obviously the attack with the Boston the Dolly but I'll say this is that sometimes in\nThe the lead up to these fights you don't know what is real what is fake what is being so that was taken out this one that's what I was going to say it is pretty clear that this was so beyond this got very personal very quick\nAnd um you know it's just a it was a wild scene I mean I mean you see and hear and\nYou're watching these videos on line and just see him jump into the stands and start a brawl there I mean it was but then as for people who are driving right now for people didn't see this\nTo attack a wanted Connors trainers wanna be trainers comes into the actually gotten into tax Connor I mean just absolute men\nWell and here's an update for you guys this just came in and according ... via ability to report Twitter account this is from mark rea Monday or a very prominent em a writer for him and may fighting dot com and SB Nation he says Conor McGregor ... made I've had been escorted out of the arena by police\nSo this is a this is getting real guys they got to be some criminal oh there's going to be some there's going to be some\nCriminal charges as those guys but again no no no against definitely against the guy who slug Connor from behind and gotten the cage that's that's definitely not okay like a world where the hell was security I don't know exactly because I Know it helps to break it up it was All right no and here's the thing that I noticed like 'cause I don't know if you go\nFrom watching the early portions of the flight when they got in the cage do you guys noticed there was like about five big news in jackets like\nSecurity standing in the middle of the ring before the introductions happened there was like five ... and like read jackets that were like security that was like and I and I and I ... I turned to pop up there and I was like man there's a lot to do in suits in there that are like ready to garden I I was I knew that this was really personal\nBut man where would those guys at the end of this like where are the guys when this thing broke out like I don't know what happened because it's just like everybody ... anyone could get in there and do whatever they want\nI was going to say or a year the and I'm not making a joke about this but you're the seasoned veteran you lived in Vegas have you ever seen anything like this in a fight around to fight because like I said you see this extent yeah I was going to say you know stuff in elite up you see stuff at a\nYou know you see I mean I've seen way on that I've never seen anything quite like this\nUm I mean you've seen a few aftermath of few brawls you know a punches after the final bell where people are still going at it and you know they got to get into the ring break it up but to get jobs I mean ...\nTrainer um I don't know who the other guy was but unacceptable I mean I I'm surprised so many the first guy about a tax cut them or Gregor just got separated that's what president somebody put them in like it was that guy that off it's it's just\nInsanity man and you know look we all like the um you know the insanity within the octagon within the rules but I I I I Can't honestly I mean you know I've been watching fights and and I grew up I Love boxing growing up\nThere was some ... there's been some crazy incidents I Can't ever remember anything like this and\nYou know if I'm kind of regret grow up said I'm not going back and fight for you if you can't keep me safe in their ... how would you and your three or four or five by Tom I'm not getting back in there you can't keep me safe I ... I I don't disagree and I so I don't want a lot of money I'd I'd I'd get a lawsuit going on if I'm that guy right now but if I'm caught him McGregor\nYeah and well you know what's interesting is I mean he's the guy that really did kind of start this with the attack in the Boston\nAnd throwing the dial that when you pay that price now that oh have you been settled you know absolutely in into M. and m's point or the the both fighters I Believe certainly can beep was escorted out of the ring they didn't do the thing at the end where they announce the winner officially and that's kind of a weird thing I just saw somebody bring us up on Twitter\n... has a career changing when I mean you'd be Connor regardless of whether you were the undefeated champ or not that's the biggest name in the U. S. C.\nYou get that when and it's something that no one will be talking about come tomorrow you know ... whether there's criminal charges whether there's not he did himself no favors because this was a night that he should have been celebrated instead guys like myself you Arnie and everybody that's going to come on air in the coming days is going to criticize him for the basically as you said criminal\nThat happened after their baby charges against him also I mean he he went all out of the octagon and went up to somebody\nOr who hit him in about the damage was at that point\nNow it's just insanity and and like I said it's it's it's going to be so much to see the coverage of this going forward one because like you said criminal charges all that kind of stuff but to to be the night of your life ... a night that you're supposed to be celebrated we're supposed to appreciate a you reaching the pinnacle your career we're going to be talking about you as a criminal\nAs a thug all those kinds of things yeah but they do you think the general public what they eat the stuff what do they I mean if they're ... said oh we don't like this we don't like this but the uh bought behind the scenes yeah may is probably going off and it was awesome you know\nI Do like running when sprints before the game like if you can't be fired up to play for that guy you can't be fired up to play football and this is the I think maybe the surprise team in the NFL right now I think one day obviously continue to win this weekend but I'll be interested to see if this can snowball going forward in that division\nThe ravens are going to be in Cleveland taking on the browns okay let's see what Baker me feels got going now let's see what he does against this raven defense abroad victory here next to you know there are two two and one right up there with the ravens and uh you know hopefully they stayed within the shouting range of Cincinnati\nBut a monster game here because ravens can't really afford or they don't want to lose in or you don't fall another game behind the tide would Cincinnati right now and I want to see if Cleveland is you know going to take that next step forward and become a team that's not going to be a pushover died and see what Baker may feel gonna do\nLet me ask you is this the most interesting division in the NFL right now\nI think you could make the case it is I think all four teams in theory could win the division possible yeah I mean I don't know that I Would bet on Cleveland if I was in Vegas but I mean even Pittsburgh sitting at one two and one we all know they can flip a switch we all know that lady on bill might be back sooner than expected\nAnd I I think to me that's the most interesting a division in football and I think this is one of the more interesting games under the radar games on the weekends\nA Packers are going to Detroit take it on the lions lions only victory at one of three is against who else the New England patriots um they can't afford the ... for them for you might as well right off the season\nPeople think I think there's going to be a close game Detroit's actually the favorite in this game a buy one over the Packers era\nYeah I was gonna say Detroit's and at one in three but look we all know how bad that game was against the law or against the jets to open the season but you lose by three and a close game at San Francisco you lose in a very close game last week in Dallas by to Europe player to away from being\nThree in one right now instead of one in three and you mentioned Aaron Rodgers and the Packers\nAt this I don't know if it's the knee or what it is I'm guessing it isn't easy but Aaron Rodgers does not look anywhere close to the guy that he has been over the last couple of years I think he's like six teeth in the NFL and passing right now he's behind guys like any do and he doesn't look like himself I wouldn't be surprised at the giants are the lions get the when\nWe mentioned Jacksonville going to Kansas City to take out the chiefs I said pump the brakes on ... homes I think he's a really good quarterback I'm not ready to put him in the hall of fame [laughter] I Know the fourteenth touchdowns and no no interceptions they've got a whole game but\nUh Jacksonville defense not playing as well as last year there's still what what are the top ranked defenses um I think ah bombs are going to find a little bit of a dump difficulty this time around [noise]\nUh [noise]\nI'm actually I'm bored with you is if you look at the chiefs throughout the season got a big lead against the Steelers almost blue oh held on to win same with the chargers in week one\nLast week they were down against Denver you can't mess around against Jacksonville this defense even though it's not playing as well as last year there still phenomenal portals has been phenomenal when it surprised me see the ... when I\nWhen we get back we'll give you our picks elections will finish going

previous week so you can enjoy them again and of course well I'll have my own inflection as well because why I live in Vegas too and I've been prevented these gentlemen and there are no how for many years\nAnd they have allowed me their mind share up close and personal so this is going to be a fun journey every Saturday Night at ... pm Pacific two am eastern and yes we want you along for the ride okay before we get down to business a couple of opening thoughts for me\nNow since last Saturday show the New England patriots who played not one but two football games and they won them both by double digits going Seventy six points in the process now the patch\nOr three and two so is it fair to say that rumors of their demise was greatly exaggerated mostly this we know about ... teams the evolve the improve they get better to get better is the season goes on why do you think they've made it to seven straight AFC titled games now\nThey've got some weapons back I told you last week without Julian Edelman the wind was converting third down to the twenty five percent efficiency with Edelman back last Thursday night\n... down efficiency jumped a fifty percent there were five for ten meanwhile Josh Gordon you starting looked the part stay tune that can only help run by the way the last time Britain had ... an element on the field together before Thursday night\nWas November two thousand sixteen so if they stay healthy and I know that's a big if look out now you don't think ... will find a way to improve that defense he's a defensive genius just asked bill parcell parcels never won a Super Bowl without Bella checked by aside bill\nBelichick will do what he has to do\nAnd they've got another home game next week the moral go to sleep on the parents at your own risk they want uncovered easily in their last two weeks I think that's important for more to come now\nOn the Pittsburgh will know more Sunday but I think there are serious cause for concern in Steeler country their defense couldn't stop a parade they've given up his what Ninety five points to the last three games now heading into October the Steelers was proud franchise\nA pillar of stability for fifty years they're showing Syria jinx in the armor evidenced by the fact they have one way and heading heading into October\nNow did I mention they can't run the ball\nSince week one when James Connor had one hundred and fifty nine yards versus Cleveland in a high I might add their averaging forty three yards per game on the ground that's it that translates to less than three arts for Kerry does that sound like the Steelers to you can't stop anybody on defense can run the ball meanwhile\nHead coach Mike Tomlin he's known to the microscope now he deserves the benefit of the doubt because of his multiple ten when seasons in Super Bowl pedigree but the culture looks very abnormal now in Pittsburgh and by the way it did you notice that didn't even mentioned levy on bill Antonio Brown\nUnless you give them sick and tired of talking about them for what it's worth the Steelers are home against the falcons tomorrow\nAnd there are short three point favorite frankly I Do expect him to take care of business here and I was talking to their dome team\nPut 'em outside in a hostile environment and that's tough duty and I expect Pittsburgh's best effort but keep in mind the Steelers have been particularly bad and the second half of games this year they've been out scored twenty nine to nothing and the and the second half of their games in the last two weeks so\nIf the Steelers when Sunday okay they'll get a temporary stay of execution but if they don't take covers the ordination this could get ugly [noise]\nAll right we've got ... got into accurate but first let's set out to LA and join up with a gentleman well that's\nSo I he might even pitcher before the say hello to the inevitable joined us ... joined us how you doing\nBuddy my man Bernie what's happening or listen this is craziness we've got NFL we've got college football all sorts of madness October on a Saturday Night there is fun stuff going on everywhere the talk of the sports world however though is UFC two twenty nine right now where it could be but ... made off\nChoking out Conor McGregor getting him to tap into fourth round of their highly controversial fight going into it it was talked about he anticipated but it's not so much what happened in the fight is what happened after the fight\nOr could be jumped over the cage to try and fight one of Conor McGregor corner man\nA than a ... a team jumped in the cage and sucker punch Conor McGregor spilled out into the crowd three people have been arrested\nThe Nevada state athletic commission is holding on to pay checks and it's not paying the fighters until they sort through all this data white refused to to put the belt on ... afterwards is madness in his craziness in Las Vegas per usual on a Saturday Night\nSo this is the question John as well there'd be a rematch\nI Would think so I mean come on and then you get in the end they'll look the match up if you watch the fight the match up it was it was pretty much one sided it was could be taking them down like most people expected and kind of ... McGregor did look a little bit rusty looked like he was the guy who hadn't fought in a couple of years in a cage because he hands are tied\nMoney talks and if the money is there and if this is going to lead to a big time pay per view by and they can say and people can get upset all they won the next time these two guys fight if they fight we're all going to watch it you can call them disgusting you can call the antics grows you can say it's a bad look for the sport\nBut it's a good luck for paychecks and if those guys want to fight again everybody's going to want to see it\nI'm In agreement I don't think any of us should be in denial about\nTime winner of the hill and super contests now the Westgate super contest he actually had a slightly different take about the patriots victory let's give it a listen\nLet's talk about my power ratings New England wins by fourteen years they get all that is going to upgrade New England lower Indianapolis no because the spot was so good for New England in that game and frankly I thought they were somewhat fortunate to win this game by that fourteen points okay so you're saying watching the game the way it went\nThe fourteen was a good margin for them it it could have easily won by less correct in fact I'm checking all the boxes the guys we we thought hey these guys are going to get better Edelman comes back he was good Michelle they're running back rookie running back he was improving had a really fine game and\nJosh Gordon we here's a guy we thought this wide receiver is going to get better he made a great play to basically get the cover for the patriots even with all that they just barely covered\nPhysically has appointed Jonas but look man I I'm just as simple guy hill I had a lunch tables for dinner last night in the NFL at the end of the year they add up the number of wins you have they don't ask ... just how many but you know they did let New England did let them back in the game what are your thoughts Jonah\nYeah look the patriots or do they seem to be a little bit slot at this point of course but let's also talk about the fact that they're getting back\nJulian Edelman for the first time Josh Gordon's trying to figure things out it's a Thursday night game for them to I Know what's at home I thought the the just the talk of the New England patriots being dysfunctional and and it's all going to wrap up and it's all over I thought it was overblown from the get go\nAnd look in a couple of weeks if you're ... this is where you're going to get your telltale sign about where the patriots are at and I was talking about this on my show yesterday that the next two weeks are going to be tally because they get Kansas City on prime time Sunday Night Football and then they go\nIt's just you know maybe ... beats me again if I wind up getting this one but statistical domination Jacksonville that yards per play metric at the pros love the net yards per play for Jacksonville is much better\nThan for Kansas City plus one point six think about that every time each team snaps the bald again one point six yards Kansas City is right around zero\nJonas I'm going to give you the last word on this game but let me just say this Patrick more homes looks like he's ten feet tall but it's just a matter of time having to support the worst effects in the league is going to cave in his shoulders and I'll see this this is Blake board all so I I'm kind of fascinated\nWith this guy I don't you know love them but you know he doesn't he doesn't own an interesting statistic he's three and two straight up in three one on one against the spread against undefeated foes in his short NFL career your thoughts\nYeah any any play well in the playoffs I'm ... it's it's the weirdest thing because any split up good numbers before and I don't know that people can get a good reading I was mentioned this earlier it just he's the wild card man you don't know what you're going to get game in game out from him\nBut I also wonder if it's some point some of the skepticism on Kansas City\nIs because people just aren't used to seeing this you know the unfamiliar ... creates concern down the road at some point or questions at least that I don't know how many people have seen in Andy Reid off and say look like this or any off ants in NFL history we're so\nAccustomed to Andy Reid often says looking a certain way and playing a certain way and sooner or later they're going to fall apart because they just don't have this feeling to to go deep into it and make a D plus a postseason run and I wonder if part of the skepticism on the chiefs has to do with that\nFair enough All right on the Philadelphia WC Fields where you said he'd rather be all things equal and so I think are the Vikings and this is the proverbial\nOr if a tough law so RJ infested both weighed in on this game and what they think the mentality is from Mike Zimmer is group heading into Philadelphia tomorrow several listen\nI think Minnesota is in one of the best situation all spots of any team in the NFL this year number one revenge now a lot of people\nI call them the guys who have duct tape on their shoes [laughter] okay meaning they come in they're wise guys in theory let's put quotes around it\nBut the games passed them by and they put duct tape on their shoes\nAnd to me a lot of those guys talk about revenge bunch because they got a little thing in their database it says it's revenge and then they date of mine and it ends up oh Seventeen and and twelve in this spot doesn't mean much it's not logical here's how I define revenge\nIs the loser thinking about this loss a decent amount the famous story of Alabama they lost the Johnny Football and they had at playing on repeat\n[laughter] scar face rebate they had it on in the bam away room that's revenge do you feel like Philadelphia is in Minnesota had to that the greatest Minnesota fuel that revenge\nOh you'd have to remember in the NFC title game there a three point favorite at Philadelphia they when they have the super bowl at home\nI think about that Minnesota\nJust crushing the entire off season you have to think about that disaster that occurred in Philadelphia Vikings are catching three points tomorrow and here's one thing you might want to put in your pipe and smoke head coach Mike Zimmer he brings with him before and one mark against the spread when coming off Thursday contest so they've had ten days ...\nPlaying non divisional games when coming off all lost both of those categories so that might create well would that create expectations let's see what our jihad to say about that let's give it to listen\nWith Zimmer who many would say and again we can talk about the boy genius with the rams and debate where he is right now obviously early in his career\nBut let's admit McVeigh is mighty good I'm impressed so far but to me ... ... top four in the NFL and that's being very conservative I think Andy Reid ballot checked Zimmer\nAnd then again with as a young guy let's give it to McVeigh check this out Zimmer started coaching in two thousand fourteen from Minnesota and it was five years there's only three NFL teams\nWith a record against the Vegas spread fifty seven percent or better only three Andy Reid in Kansas City fifty nine percent if you just ... them blindly\nAnd the last five years bill valid checking the patch sixty three percent if you buy them blindly and then number one Zimmer and the Vikings sixty seven percent forty five and twenty two against the spread for pushes\nThis coach has exceeded expectation\nJoin us um [noise] you know that's a lot of positive numbers and you know how do you feel about the word revenge and how it would apply in an official game\nI mean I think revenge applies if you are fully healthy and it doesn't feel like a snake bit season and it's just feels like a snake bit season for the Minnesota Vikings I mean\nLike ... I I don't know anybody that goes into this game thinking oh don't worry about it the Vikings are the Vikings are back everybody they're going to figure this thing out now Philadelphia is not the team\nCamp injuries or for the Vikings are ... they haven't been able to protect the quarterback the defense couldn't stop anybody on Thursday night against the rams the secondary was atrocious I don't\nMean revenge I get it it seems like it would make a lot of sense I just think these are two different teams colliding at two completely different times as opposed to last year and this year I just I don't think that it applies they're\nAll right well that's fair I Will say this the eagles were you know typical Superbowl defending champions are suffering the blight of being circled on everybody's schedule\nA couple of other factor words about this game course remember ... cousins coming over from Washington he's faced off against the eagles seven times in his career he's foreign

Giovanni Bernard amount but they do get Joe mixing back but they don't have ... and he opened up running lanes I think he's lost his big um overeating that\nNo I think it's a big deal I get the the numbers would speak and and there's numbers out there that will show that that Andy Dalton when he's got Tyler I for a is a much different quarterback and it's also tough to gauge how good Cincinnati is because yeah they went down and they won that game late and it was a great throwing catch from Andy Dalton AJ green but also you have to factor in\nOkay but that was that land a secondary who is banged up we've talked about them they're dealing with the touch of injuries they can't stop anybody right now so it's sort of that logic plays into two games that we've discussed\nNumber one that Pittsburgh probably do for a breakout against that Atlanta secondary and gain number two is Cincinnati really that good or did they just take advantage of Atlanta secondary to was banged up\nI mean we're going to find out tomorrow good stuff All right let's move long break up the titans they went back to ... games outright as dogs now maybe the bill Belichick coaching tree doesn't compromise variable who played head coach might read all the time to play it eight years New England\nBut they visit the titans visit buffalo they're five and a half point favorites and Tennessee only five Thirteen and one as rude favorites in their last fifty years even last Nineteen games\nRJ have some thoughts about the mental state or the titans and how they will play tomorrow after the big win last week several is if you upset the super bowl\nAnd then your next game is on the road you're sixteen and thirty eight against the spread and that's the only twenty nine percent so let's think about it the titans upset\nBuffalo fads logically make sense to me everyone gets excited because of the team\nJust beat the super bowl champions and they they were not post to beat the super bowl champions and we know the excitement about the titans is increased you can feel it in his eye guys and now because of that people are more inclined to bad um so they get expensive the next week\nAnd you've got the psychology of all it's almost like when you have a big victory we all know that next day at work\nIs a little bit tougher\nYeah so the team might let down but the better is get up on that to be seen it already in both directions they get more expensive though it's a negative for the next game and we've already seen that expense go up the they were laying three and a half the titans earlier in the week it's already tightened modest five right now at buffalo\nSee argue brings up a really good point here because we have stamps going back to Nineteen Ninety two that the team what teams are Thirteen and forty one straight up and sixteen and thirty it against the spread since Nineteen Ninety to the game after you upset the super bowl champion in their previous game so\nThat's not particularly good news in and on the flip side of the coin him the bills well there you know they're coming off a pretty embarrassing twenty two to nothing whitewash a home you know shut out last

everybody's outraged everybody's outraged\nI have no idea why all explain coming up here and just a couple of minutes Jonas knocks Fox Sports radio you can listen to the show on the eye heart radio lab you can find this on serious XM channel eighty three and all all of our great Fox Sports radio affiliates\nYou are taking part in the program we appreciate a few minutes your time here\nOn all

free rate quote so I'm listening Saturday isn't August are not as far as sports fans go I mean you really need to be a sports bar or you've got to have like multiple TVs because there's so many things going on and there's so much craziness and he got college football\nAnd there's NFL pre game shows and you got the ... the play offs\nAnd then sometimes certain events creep in\nThe U.S the event UFC two twenty nine in which could be but ... made off\nSubmitted Conor McGregor to retain the lightweight championship in the fourth round of the fight and it was a pretty good fight it was okay\nNo I mean not not the greatest performance you've ever seen that it wasn't even that much of a surprise like if you've watched ... we've seen the guy perform you know there's a reason he's never lost a fight and probably never even last around\nHe's that good\nAnd he was dominant when he got Conor McGregor down to the ground and taught him McGregor look like a guy who hadn't five and a couple of years in a\nCage he did so that's a that's a big ask to come back and fight that guy and expect him to to perform as well as he did\nSo if you are a sharp better if you're one of the guys out there that fed on me McGregor fans who showed up in your city and bet heavily on McGregor look you knew was heavily slanted towards can be made off\nBut you see that's not the story though you see the story of the fight is what happened after the fight because what happened after the fight was to be their mind made off\nBeen hearing from Conor McGregor and all the trash talk and the Dolly through the bus window and these two sides do not like each other at all\nTo be near mocking made off decided he was going to go over to ... corner he was going to trash talk an F bomb Conor McGregor corner apparently they said some things back to to be made off he jumps the cage\nDid have leaping jump kick off the cage to try and fight dealing Dan is one of Conor McGregor corner men while that whole fiasco is going on and they're brawling one of ... the other side kicks came over sucker punch still and\nStarts there it's McGregor verse three guys everybody's trying to break it up it's craziness absolute craziness\nInsane total insanity here's my question why are you surprised I I'm I'm a little confused as to why people are surprised that something like this would happen I don't understand what about\nEverything that you knew going into this fight would lead you to believe that it's all good\nSee here's what I think happens right I think people get so used to the WWE style promoting a fights that they forget oh yeah these guys are fighters these guys are savages these guys are top of the food chain don't mess with me I Will throw down at a moment's notice\nThey're not like some a hole you run into at a bar who said five pictures a Miller light and all of a sudden he's got your muscles no no no no no these are trained professionals these are guys that don't get nervous these are guys that are waiting for you to pull a weapon because all they've got their bare hands and their bare feet\nAnd there used to this violence they love this violence they embrace this violence I've said it\nFighters and football players top of the food chain man top of the food chain knowing every single time you step in to your arena somebody is trying to hurt you injure you or finish you\nEvery time\nThe fact that you expect them to\nThe bell goes off or the buzzer goes off or the fights over to all of a sudden just switch and go back to oh you know just so humbled and grateful to be here I Am surprised this doesn't happen more I really am I'm surprised that doesn't happen more\nRisk and also create an expectation and we all except that if you get a brand new pair of white shoes don't wear 'em out right after it rains\nAnd if you do don't bitch and moan that your shoes got dirty because you stepped in a mud puddle look at the weather report you had an umbrella yesterday the white shoes seem like a good idea today didn't work did it\nYou ever see those people who have pet tigers\nThey decide they want to have a pet tiger they've got so much money that a cat won't suffice you know forget the bull ... let's go ahead and get a pet tiger or you're watching the pre Roy and they're doing all these tricks with these ... tigers these giant animals and then all of a sudden one of 'em turns on the owner and attack some\nAnd people are outrage how could he do that um 'cause it's a wild eh thing animal they eat things that's where they come from\nThe idea that your all surprised or your all shocked that two fighters\nWho make their money punching people in the face putting elbows in the side of your temple twisting body parts until they break crack tear or you submit the fact that you're surprised that those guys you know might have a little bit of a mean streak after a fight inside a cage\nIs banana land to me\nThat's what this is it's sanctioned violence and when you get guys in the state of mind to where they've been going at it for twenty minutes inside a cage throwing everything on their body to maim injure or can cost their opponent\nStuff happens do you think it\nWould be okay if\nAnd that you're watching an NBA game and say uh like JR Smith and mark is smart gotten to a little altercation would've JR Smith spit on Marcus sport oh my God you outraged totally outrage ... made off after he submitted Conor McGregor spin on him nobody talked about that\nNobody talked about that spit on him before he throws mouthpiece\nWhen that video comes out I got news for yeah everybody's going to be outraged I'm also seeing some people say that Conor McGregor through the first punch when ... corner man approached him\nSo let me get this straight you've had bad blood with this entire crew for months and months and months\nThey have a salted members of your crew for months and months and months and one of 'em walks up to you and steps to you after a fights over and Conor McGregor supposed to shake his hand and say hey it's all good here man no\nFamous that will make you\nWe're doing it all for you sounds good to me than you or me anything you\nKnow [noise]\n... well either I Wonder what are you calling seven dollars an hour on super\nBowl champion Philadelphia Eagles take on the line man in New York Giants\nOn Thursday on line

the last\nYears I have got great news for you that's coming up here and just a couple of minutes here on Fox Sports radio I cannot get enough of the uh\nTo tell you are you there is like nothing about that surprised me but what did I don't know what anybody expected\nI I don't I don't want you expected bad I mean you're you've you've spent you know an entire several\nMonths throwing ... bus windows or insulting a guy's father and his religion and then you get in there and you fight there are people attacking ... I mean come on man that\nThat's fighting that's that's that's how this stuff goes I mean it's it's riveting that was amazing TV amazing television and the card was fantastic ... brilliant card so I just to me hey\nI'm going to the man I I'm a UFC die hard uh I've been watching the singer UFC wanting to when they were fourteen box and you had guys like Keith Hackney fighting in ... Gracie on these like little underground fight tournaments I remember pride fighting championships in Japan\nLike so I'm old school I'm always going to be here and so maybe I'm just used to it\nUh and and I grew up watching boxing those are my two\nFavorite sports as far as that I'm most passionate about 'em\nAnd so maybe I'm just used to stuff like this I I don't know I mean when\nYou see one guy a spit out as mouthpiece invite another guy's ear off I just don't know what else we're expecting I only popcorn ready you know like if you if you take your pants off and put a blindfold on and jumping to a pool of ... somethings getting bit off\nSorry I I don't know if you're expecting another result we're a cup [noise]\nEight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox Jonas knocks Fox Sports radio already decided to welcome and the crew here on earth is are they will be writing shock\nThem with me until six am eastern time here on Fox Sports radio ladies and gentlemen hailing from Council Bluffs Iowa Sam especially break on your mind\nCouncil Bluffs yeah yeah western Iowa I don't think that a lot of time over there why not I just I don't go over there [laughter] and I are not your place the forbidden zone like from planet of the apes\nOr Puerto let's check in or two I I always zombie when needed an update on I or should we can we get an update on I was ... later\nA playboy I on right now okay let's let's do\nIt later on because I really want to set this up so I I Will jotted down here I'm actually jotting down on the air I or zombie as a reminder because we've got to break into this and we've got so many other things to get to but I Want to make sure that we give it its proper place so we will get an update Vernon Iowa zombie emotionally and what that is coming up later on\nA legion gentleman your executive producer here at Fox Sports radio Mike the nightmare\nNightmare you know it's funny just watching that whole incident I felt like I was watching like you know how the WWE they'll promote a big national have like one of those pull apart brawls I felt like I was watching one of those when watching this and it was kind of amazing that this was all happening this is real life it was great television like you said man it\nIt was unbelievable I I Love how people go\nIt's like an insult when people say that just to WWE it's ... oh you also eight so so you mean it it's two longest running network TV show on television I was about to hit one thousand a week or so it's two successful company for over like forty fifty years so it's to\nA biggest sports entertainment event every single April for like three decades in a row yeah who would want to be anything like that [laughter] what are you talking about bad\nBut yeah it's a good thing people try and instill that like oh it's fake yeah that looked fake to me\nMore odds are looked up I was saying with the latest Sam I just wanted to say quickly my thoughts on all this is that what could be did will have consequences for him obviously in his in his entourage but I mean you know that Connor sold the fight with getting really personal and really dirty\nDo you think at some point is going to boil over yeah I mean I dumped in the crowd on that was good entertained yes and no one got stabbed just face it that that was a good result or not the not the end result but there there was no one got seriously hurt\nPeople people got ... I think what really needs to grow up people need to grow up um it's it's it's a different world out there right there just to understand that that things are different and they're different in that sport and that's just the way that it is if you expect Patty cake and you expect hobby by as and no one error NATO to hug him between second and third base that's not going to happen I'm\nSorry can be incredibly respectful guys and he wouldn't you say oh yeah no yeah he is but I mean listen leans by his home in factories listen health of dumb he also he did it he did slap corners teammate that's what sparked all this kinda McGregor and can be were friends they would take pictures together\nAnd could be slapped one of his teammates in a in a lobby in between as they were getting ready for a fight card that's what led to the Brooklyn Dolly incident so there's a lotta craziness going on on the ladies and gentlemen speaking of violence the most violent man and sports talk radio Ralph verb a new national ...\n[noise]\nMy kind of night\nAloha abroad are all the other thing what the hell is that\nOkay who who who was wearing a Mike when they dropped their pets okay what was that\nA that was a Robert does ... special a former a producer here that fits are and that's actually from a one of the Austin Powers movies and he wrote that infer route along time ago we very rarely used that up because we didn't do much sense interesting so related [laughter]\nIt's great man I owe it out there had to pull it out very\nInteresting or are you go I'm All right so a Jonah stocks here Fox Sports radio I'm All right so if you're a fan of football and you've been watching football over the last Thirty years this is good news for you okay like if if you grow up and and I've always\nLike if you grew up in your family opened up Christmas gifts on Christmas morning you kept that tradition as you got older\nAnd so when people when you get around somebody who opens it up at midnight on on Christmas Eve into Christmas you know you kind of almost take offense to that but that kinda bothers you like my girlfriend's family they open up gifts at ... at midnight on Christmas I'm a Christmas morning guy\nI grew up Christmas morning yeah we can get a lot of gifts but it was Christmas morning so when I saw people opening up gifts at midnight I thought it was preposterous like what's happening here why are you doing this\nLike I Will never and that's going to be a battle when I have kids or if I have a family or a listen we're doing at Christmas morning that's what I grew up with this tradition okay if your mom cook something specific on certain days that stays with you\nLike you know mom had a certain you know it was lasagna every Wednesday night\nYou just sort of that that becomes part of what you are in and and you can maybe get away from it for a little while but ultimately you end up going back to a lot of that stuff because that's the power that tradition as\nIf you grew up on college football and you grew up a college football fan between say Nineteen eighty and twenty Eighteen we'll put it in that in that window at any point during that time\nAnd if I said to you give me your traditional powers\nThe teams that you saw dominate or the teams that you saw when titles the biggest teams during that time period\nThree that would come up would most likely be Alabama Ohio State and Notre Dame\nNow there's going to be some other teams that are creeping there maybe you grew up in the south and you're a you're a big time Florida fan or whatever but if you just generally Alabama Ohio State Notre Dame would be three teams that would come up\nThe more that this college football season goes on\nEmma Ohio State and Notre Dame in college football playoff and if your college football you could not possibly have a better you could not possibly get it any better Alabama and Georgia are sitting at one and two\nShould they run the table to the SEC title game Alabama's going to be a heavy favorite\nWe're talking seven to ten point favorite in the SEC title game which means that Alabama should probably win that game and they'll probably be the number one seed and they'll be in the college football playoff should Ohio State run the table which would mean a when the final week against Michigan at the horse you\nYou're not looking at it realistically you got to be pragmatic when it comes to stuff like this people want to watch this that was riveting television man that that was as good as it gets chaotic crazy unpredictable violent\nThat's what people are looking for that was great television\nSo when you're talking about now there's doesn't need to be a rematch this fight wasn't even close your out of your mind man you're out of your mind there will be a rematch there's too much money involved\nFollow the money\nMakes too much sense this story lines are already written\nMost of the guys in the U. S. C. and this is this is the biggest problem I think with a lot of the sport\nIf you've ever talked to fighters especially Emma may fighters there's some of the nicest people you'll ever talk to I remember talking to Daniel core me on the phone one time Daniel ... the heavyweight champion and the light heavyweight champion could not be a nicer human being\nYeah he's also a Savage a Savage he hurts people for\nLike ... they are really really good people but the problem is a lot of these fighters don't know how to brand themselves or sell themselves that's why macgregor was different he can do that he can get the casual fan to watch\nHe didn't even win the fight he didn't even jump\nBalls there are so many more people that are going to be talking about this now you can break down the fight and do the ... knows thing all you want\nBut this is about price fighting this is about what's going to make the most money it's not so much the wins in the law says you probably don't even know that there was a a ... a championship belt on the line you probably have no idea who could be ... before this fight you have no idea what his record is\nBy you probably couldn't tell me a a ... everyone of Conor signature winds up to this point you just don't McGregor and you know it could be ... and now you know them forever and the next time they fight and they will fight you're watching don't pretend like you're not\nJonah stocks Fox Sports radio or eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox you could also give me on Twitter at the Jonas knocks coming up next we will have an update on now one of the most troubling things\nIn the world of sports right this is very very troubling is football related find out who we are talking about next on as our\nCase socks over the ... postseason it's that\nWe all know that oh\nChampion will emerge we all know on Fox Sports radio\nYear olds were three marketing messages sent the automatic ... terms of condition to test rolls out us message and they'd reach me apply to you have a passion\nFor fitness what if you could help people live healthier and stronger lives well building a money making career for yourself well now you can't the I as as a personal trainer certification program is the first step to becoming a personal trainer or even becoming a gym owner and for a limited time the I as I say is letting it get started on the number one rated certification program absolutely\nFree minutes right free just text to build the two four six eight ten now to get your special link and get started on your certification free with over three hundred thousand certification students at night\nVacation means access to a great job opportunities ranging from the best chance to top sports teams just tax bill to two four six eight ten now to get your special get started link free don't wait another day to start your career and fitness just text billed to two four six eight ten right now to get started with your I.

with\n\nFrom the guy go talk sports radio studios in ...\nYears she only\n\nKnew him\nWhen he got screwed over in the NFL\nThe radio you can listen to the show on the high heart radio lab\nYou can find us on Syria sex Sam channel eighty three and on all of our great Fox Sports radio affiliates wherever you are taking part in the program we always appreciate a few minutes your time as we can be alive here from the Geico Fox Sports\nRadio studios were Fifteen minutes could save you Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance visit guy go ... for a free rape quote so obviously a madness absolute madness craziness UFC two twenty nine\nI'm just bizarro land a fight in the crowd or Conor McGregor getting tapped out\nBy can be ... made off not that much of a surprise if you follow college career you know was a pretty bad match up for Conor\nUm but then afterwards could be jumped into the crowd to fight Connors corner man a ... a a corner actually uh jumped into the cage sucker punch Connor three guys from ... camp got arrested Conor McGregor refused to press charges so they were released a everybody is outraged\nSorts of craziness so we will be hearing from Dana White more from Dana why us the president or coming up in about Fifteen minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio\nBut this is the time where we do knocks locks and the way that this works is during the football season I Will find a few games in the NFL each week\nAnd I will go through and I will try and find something I like now could be a standard betting line and I'll make a pick or could just be something uh uh could be a ...\nIt could be a whether I think somebody is going to turn the ball over to a certain point in the game it's kind of a different spin on how you look in preview and pick games right a lot of people pick point spreads to me first of all I'm not good enough to do that secondly why don't have a little bit of fun with this you know spice it up a little bit\nShould have been foreign one and I'm pissed then I'm not\nAnd I will get to that here and just a second now the games that I did when\nI had the patriots minus six an apple but the Miami Dolphins I thought that was a pretty much a lock I didn't buy into Miami about new ... who is going to rebound and respond and they did I add Josh Allen to turn the ball over multiple times against the Packers and he did\nThat felt pretty good just based on where they were out the week before I didn't anticipate the Josh Allen was going to come out and light it up like you did against the Minnesota Vikings I said that both quarterbacks would play for the Tampa Bay buccaneers against the bears and they did I called my shot on that\nThe games that I lost the first one I'm okay with\n'cause the first one was a little bit personal Iowa Sam our technical producers a die hard Iowa Hawkeye than he loves CJ bath third he's got a CJ battered stuffed animal he's also got a CJ bath or a tattoo on his lower back oh hey he is passionate about CJ bath or your legs news so I bet\nThat CJ bathroom were thrown interception before touchdown last Sunday\nHe did not because the chargers apparently aren't as good as I thought they were without joy both says so I lost that but I was willing to go ahead and concede that whatever you can't win them all I got absolutely screwed in the Texans Colts game I'd Cole says a pick them\n[noise] yeah\nShould have pushed that should've been a tie I should have actually not be talking about a loss I should be talking about a tie but unfortunately\nI'm Talking about a loss right now because Frank writes decided he wanted to set the tone and go forward on fourth down in overtime and his own territory because he wants to show his guys that he's got confidence in him\nHey Frank don't worry about whether or not they got confidence in you worry about whether or not they got confidence in your quarterback ... so he doesn't\nAnd bad coaching bad decision making and even worse throw and I got screwed so instead of being three one in one or foreign one I'm sitting here at three into not happy about it\nBut we're back for more\n\nThe [noise]\nThe rams are eight seven and a half point favorite at Seattle this today for twenty five pm eastern time kick off on Fox [noise]\nBook the rams of looked unstoppable so far this season they've been amazing I even apologize on the air a week ago I Apologize I said Jared ... is probably going to be above\nThe I didn't understand the pick I thought it was a PR move\nAnd you can say that he's a system quarterback and this is all ... bay whatever you want to do to make yourself feel better at night if you're still a Jared golfing or ... you go ahead and be my guest a I had to take it out on that one I got that one wrong they've been fantastic Seattle is clearly a shell of what they were clearly\nLast week\nThey win the game but the loser all Thomas he flips off the sidelines or Pete Carroll or whoever who the hell knows maybe flipped off the the Seahawks mascot\nI have no idea he's been fined for it but he's done for the year probably up a broken leg second time the injuries happened that's a major loss for the Seattle defense\nBut the last time the Seahawks we're this big of an underdog at home was the two thousand ten playoff game against the New Orleans saints that was the game that Martian Lynch ran wild and one of the most incredible touchdown runs that you've seen that's the last time they were this much of an underdog at home [noise]\nThe sea hawks are also forty four and ten in their last fifty for gas\nPrime time performance by the rams against him Minnesota team that's banged up and was on a short wreak on the road I like the sea hawks plus seven and a half coming up tomorrow\nGiants fans they're sick today one\nPm eastern time kicked off on Fox later today so the giants and the Panthers look the giants are struggling\nIt's been a rough end of the week for the giants as well to\nHold back them comes out on ESPN and all of that comes to talking about how we can throw the ball twenty yards down the field\nWe don't have enough heart et cetera et cetera et cetera\nPat ... is head coach had to respond and\nHe didn't say that it was about heart what he said it was it was about execution so we've got ourselves some pointing fingers with the New York giants which is brilliant and fantastic and wonderful if you covered the giants are you cover football in New York they feed on stuff like this\nThis is a money maker for the people that covered the football team but the giants find themselves at one in three they're dead last in the NFC ease\nThis is Patty ... second chance of being a head coach in the NFL\nIf you flame out in stop number two in the NFL with little to no success you're not getting a third chance the organization has already made the commitment to oh back to a junior\nAnd pat ... is a smart guy\nHe knows we're approaching a meltdown situation with O. B. J. O. B. J. hasn't gotten into the end zone yet therefore mine knocks lock in this game is old del back them will catch a touchdown pass\nJust the other\nPm eastern time on Fox [noise]\nIf somebody came to you before the season and they made a Super Bowl pick and they said I think it will be the falcons in the Steelers\nAll the wonderful volunteer groups for your time would be most valuable how about a few hours and then you can help a child that will last for their lifetime and yours is the cost of the ... court appointed special advocates for a foster child go to Costa of Arizona dot org ... at least\nFive to four four one three five for Navajos county\nOr Rick up to four or five one one a for a patch accounting\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll know what the last\nOne I think seven dollars a gallon for [noise]\n[noise] [noise] right [noise] end up kind of wild [noise]\nMade America done about around breaking usa [noise]\nAll of your goals are wrapping right here\nOne of the week I don't want them\nTo abide by us one of your TV go to Fox Sports dot com or details pass pass while\nKnocks Fox Sports radio company lived here for the guy go Fox Sports radio studios\nAnd are we the only show in sports radio that still plays Allison Shane\nWe ought to be the other one right now I Know that there's some there's some directors out their movie directors that love Alison change like um who's the guy who did like the forty year old virgin a\nMan I'm blanking out as I don't know\nI Know there's some there's some there's some\nDirectors in their forties out there that I Love out some change\nI but I was thinking sports radio most people play like poppy stuff not on this show and you're going to get them out and change that now like it a s little a I see man oh Judd Apatow you know he's done a ton of movies\nI don't like them all some of them are okay but he loves Dallas change so that makes them cool so that was your excuse to bring up Judd Apatow did you go on to pick what you know I don't I Know he's fine he's a ...\n... um so it is a football Sunday\nOn Fox Sports radio which means we've got guest that garbage coming up less than ten minutes from now you're on a bus or um it is where I go around the country and I\nNFL stuff and it's all relating to things that have happened in the NFL\nOver the last week or so right so if you want to be a part of gas that garbage here on Fox Sports radio if you want to be a part\nOf the greatest NFL trivia game show anywhere on sports radio eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox is the phone number eight seven seven nine nine six six three six nine\nNFL trivia coming up bottom of the hour your chance it's all easy for some reason you guys struggle with is I have no idea why but we have got basic NFL trivia coming up a less than ten minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox so\n[noise] um\nWant to say there was a situation that happened at the T Mobile arena in Las Vegas if you're just tuning in or you have not seen or heard or heard any of the aftermath\nUFC two twenty nine the biggest fight in the history of the U. F. C. he'll be ... made off submitting Conor McGregor in the fourth round where they make a joke right can be undermined made off is the real deal he's twenty seven into\nUm he's a bad dude and it shouldn't be a surprise a lot of the Connor fans\nWere all over betting on Conor McGregor he was the underdog going into this fight for a reason Connor looked like he hadn't fought and a little while inside a cage he looked a little bit rusty\nCan be landed the bigger shot to beat back she looked like he did better striking wise at certain points to the fight which is a surprise so the ending shouldn't have been that much of a surprise what happened afterwards\nTo be jumped over the cage to fight one of Conor McGregor is a quarter million or ... or ... corner men jumped over the cage sucker punch Conor McGregor there were three guys in in in the cage trying to get caught him McGregor from could be beside this is a it just a bad situation all the way around bad situation all the way\nMan this is what they do these guys fight it it is sanctioned violence you cannot expect fighters to act normal\nMoments after they've just been fighting with somebody they can't stand in somebody they hate like I get why after the fact that you're still heated up and you're still bother and you're still hot I get it\nI mean some like look if somebody cut you off um if you bang your knee on the corner of the coffee table\nHow long are you pissed off about that I Need like five ten minutes I Do I got to have five ten minutes to get away we're expecting these guys in the heat of the moment thirty seconds later that's still not being fight mode you're crazy\nI I think it's I think it's a crazy asked I think it's a crazy request these guys are in the mode in the moment it straight up violence against somebody you hate you cannot stand you shouldn't be surprised at all by it\nWhat's funny about it is that Brendan shop who's a former UFC fighter\nAnd he fought in the U. S. C. for years he also played in the NFL I think for a short time but Brendan shop was now he's doing stand up comedy he's also a TV host he was on a recent interview on the Joe Rogan pod cast and Britain in shop said\nWhen he was talking with Joe Rogan producer Joe Rogan producer mentioned that he was going to the fight and Brendan shop said that's a bad idea he's on not going to the fight\nAnd Joe Rogan was confused and saying you like I mean you cover every day you father may why wouldn't you want to go to the fight and Brandon shop said I think it's going to get nasty and the crowd is I think something's gonna happen this is a different level\nThis is different you've got Russia you got Ireland it's been very personal and I think something's gonna happen and he was right\nAnd I almost was expecting something to happen\nWas very personal and sometimes over the line and sometimes you know that stuff happens when promoting a fight and then you get in there and you fight and it's still not over with you still haven't scratch that itch\nHere was could be ... after the fight talking with a media\nCircus of how I Want to ...\nAnd then by the soda to Vegas I Know this is not my best side you know this is not my besides you know I've been and uh like\nI Know understand how people can talk about I jump on the cage you know worry about he talked about my religion you talk about my counter you talk about my father\nHe come to broken and he broke boss you almost have a couple of people what about this what about the white people talk about I jumped over the cage\nWhite people still talking about this like I Know on this then\nThere was no other way that was going to go man it just it wasn't going to go any other way it's ... people were outraged by it or people shocked and disappointed in and done that the result in stunned to see a something take place and and and turn into something like that you just haven't been paying close enough attention then I\nMean you haven't been watching you haven't been listening you haven't been hearing some of the things that were said you haven't I mean come on like this is the way fighting goes it's violent out there\nLike some of the promotion not all of it is just fake hype and build up whatever happened to all those people that we're talking about how the jolly through the bus window was a publicity stunt whatever happened to those people were those people that were they in the crowd is all too I told you get the time this was not a publicity stunt man that was all real\nLate game is that okay so now now you're going to start drinking at noon now by the by the time the game kicks off how hammer you going to be yeah 'cause it's a four twenty five eastern time kickoff that's right so by the time the game kicks off ...\nEverybody has a three or ... in the you know\n... or my ... there were no [noise]\nOur falls right Marvin true or false them once you get to your cat and that pride shortfalls ... has thrown an interception in every game this season\nPat nap in a day of garbage that is correct good for you\nIs that a true is that a true statement Sam does everybody have a three hour free game [laughter] I don't think that everybody doesn't you know I mean that three hours the perfect do\nYour little food beverage like think about that in context of where you're located in Hawaii the games

[noise]\nSo\nWe may have to adjust how we evaluate a quarterback in the NFL all explained it coming up here and just a couple of moments Jonas knocks Fox Sports radio you can check out the show on the IRA radiolab you could\nFind us on Syria sex them channel eighty three\nAnd on all of our Fox Sports radio affiliates wherever you are taking part in the program we always appreciate a few minutes your time as we can be alive here from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios were Fifteen minutes could save you Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance visit Geico dot com for a free rape\nQuote so I'm\nI'm going to get to that a quarterback evaluation and how you view a quarterback but we do want to update you on key players that are ... and their status coming up up for today's games I'm In the NFL I'm Adam ... chapters reporting that the following players are out\nA falcons defensive tackle Grady Jarrett a Giovanni Bernard of the Cincinnati Bengals as well as John Ross wide receiver for the bangles germane Johnson of the jets cornerback is out a Randall Cobb is out for the Packers ... says out Leonard for net is out\nOlivier Vernon so that is the those are the players that are out according to Adam Schiff after\nIan Rapaport is reporting now you just heard chapter talk about um the Packers are going to be without Randall ... that's been sort of a back and forth battle between Mike mccarthy between Aaron Rodgers and I think a lot of that is\nAnd let's just be honest here everybody's guilty of being maybe a little bit jealous or a little bit envious of somebody else who's got something that you don't have\nEven if you've got a lot if somebody asked something you don't have at certain times in your life maybe you get a little bit envy little envious\nAaron Rodgers is looking around\nAnd like ... thrown for six touchdowns Patrick row homes lighting the league up Jared golf is alive and delete out there's quarterbacks\nAround the NFL that are using different schemes different terminology different packages different plays different concepts and they're tearing the league up\nAnd it's like the Packers are still doing the same things and I think a lot of Aaron Rodgers frustration and speaking out is because maybe he feels like they're not they don't have as much to deal with or as much as to work with is that their teams in the NFL do so with Randall copying out coming up later on\nIn rap reporters reporting that device to Adams wide receiver for the Packers he was limited this week with a calf injury but he looked good on Saturday during practice barring a step back he should play so that'll help Green Bay is caused moving forward also in that game\nMarvin Jones wide receiver for the lie and she was on the injury report for an ankle issue he is expected to play as well too so um the Vikings are also a ... not expected to play a Sunday versus the eagles so that is a that is the latest novel sprinkle some more in\nUm uh Sammy Watkins another one he is going to play today there is some optimism that he'll be able to go for that\nIt's obviously throughout the course of the show or any of our other shows here on Fox Sports radio we've got wall to wall coverage here on Sunday all throughout the day\nAll NFL conversation moving forward um I Want to discuss this because I heard something interesting\nThat I think may change the way that we view a certain quarter back in the NFL\nBecause I think that people go in with an expectation to certain things especially in the NFL and you just assume that it's going to be different or you assume that it's even though you have a lot of information and a lot of intel that would tell you something different you can't get it out of your mind\nThat you're going to see and alteration to what you're expecting like I really do truly feel that the reason that people are expecting Patrick more homes and the Kansas City chiefs to fall back a little bit\nIs for a couple of reasons one which is very logical\nBecause you can expect that team to play at that high of a level the entire season there's gonna be pitfalls every quarterback has them so that's one and that's pure logic I mean that's your thinking clearly very logical\nI also think that the reason that people look at Patrick moms and the Kansas City chiefs I think the reason that people think that they may fall back to the pack is because they can't get the image of Andy Reid typical Kansas City off ants out of their mind\nAnd so they're so used to seeing that and because they're so used to seeing it\nThat's what they go back to\nThat like like that that's just how they think about things like I think that applies in sports it's like when you're in high school you could be a like you could graduate high school\nBut people in your high school are still going to remember you for the kid who made arm pits fart noises during class\nUm ah through trash it people\nSnuck booze on the campus a ditch third period\nI'm putting gum on the back of people's locks when they would try to go and open up their locker like if you're a goofball in high school or if you're just one of those kids who is always pulling shenanigans or you're the class clown it doesn't matter how successful you are afterwards there's still people in your high school that are never going to get\nThat image out of their mind they're never going to get that image out of your mind\nIf you see somebody you hadn't seen in high school for years and years and years\nDon't you kind of just ... and maybe it's\nJust muscle memory kind of revert back and feel like he did when you're seeing him when you were sixteen Seventeen years old and high school\nI mean you just it's different like it it\nIt there's just ... it's hard to get that part of your life away from you full time you can do whatever you want but like certain people remember you for what you are I think certain people are always going to think of the chiefs as a limited off ants who does really well\nIn the regular season and then gets to the post season and they hosted in early post season game and then they probably lose and if they don't lose are going to lose the next week a New England I really do I think that that is part of why people have reservations about the Kansas City chiefs that they just can't get the image of Kansas City\nLosing in the playoffs early on with a limited off fence that doesn't translate to the playoffs I they can't get that out of their mind and I think\nThat's why there is sort of a expectation of either going to fall back to the back uh this is fool's gold ... homes isn't the real deal\nThat can make every throwing the book\nHe's got one of the great on offensive mines in the NFL coach\nEverything's speaks to I'm not doing that but we can't get that image out of our mind I think the same thing has happened with the Cleveland Browns we can't get the image of the browns out of our mind\nSo we just assume everything's bad how many times have\nYou seen people send a tweet out over something happening with the Cleveland Browns and somebody will send some tweet out saying Brown's going to brown here you go there's the Cleveland Browns we remember\nIt's just muscle memory so being a goofball in high school like that that's just\nWhat you assume that they are they're always the class clown Twenty years later completely different person completely different lives successful money in the bank family all sorts of fortune now still the kid a who used to bring a Whoopi cushion into class and a and fill it up with cat urine and make people sit on it\n\n\n\nMobile I got one of the seven Myrtle Avenue I Don one of those things like that you know I'm pretty healthy cells\nTo seriously with no regrets superstars don't say I'm Sorry I Know I'm Sorry we're giving you this morning\nAnd that meant that will make you laugh\nWe're doing it all for you it sounds good to me they interview who may have you\nOn TALK radio\nIn LA I'm In a car here ... I was going to have on me I think is the only\n[noise]\n\nYour stocks Fox Sports radio [noise] nobody alive from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios are so there's a team in the NFL that I legitimately feel bad for\nMy ... I feel bad for them I feel bad for their fans um ... who that is coming up your momentarily we do have an update\nAn update Conor McGregor has spoken kind of on Twitter if you're just tuning in a quarter McGregor last\nToo could be nearby made off in the fourth round\nOf a a an okay fight it wasn't that great\nUm but he lost in the fourth round he was submitted by could be a that's not what the story the fight is the story of the fight is can be jumping over the cage to fight Connors corner man and then\nHe'll be a a corner men jumping into the cage to sucker punch Conor McGregor guys were arrested momentarily Conor McGregor refused to press charges or they you know Bruce Buffer had to announce the winner and neater guy was in the cage 'cause they were being ushered out by security because they were afraid for their safety it was craziness\nUm and so Conor McGregor is sent a tweet out that says a good knock\nLooking forward to the rematch\nSo so there's that so Conor McGregor has spoken\n\nSo I I was expecting Conor McGregor to to do something more along the lines of ah I don't know some of the go to some of the classic some of the hits the gardening\nSo right Jonah socks Fox Sports radio\nGet to this year let's go all the way to ah let's go to Kansas City whereas ... listening you're on Fox Sports radio Zach what's happening\nOh a pleasure the Jonah knock\nA C I hate when that happens unbelievable\nDamn phone lines here sorry about that [noise] that's unbelievable can you believe that just the phone line's cutting out like that what was I have no idea how can we ... we have a thousand phone lines here we can get one that works\nJesus that is craziness\nBy the way for free winters daily go to Vegas covers dot com that's Vegas covers dot com or my Carmen are a fantasy football insider an expert will be with us here coming up a less than ten minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio I'm\nSo I'd legitimately feel bad for an NFL team\nI really really do\nBecause they were set up for success man like they had an opportunity to to have a I I Would think a really really good season like they were they were totally set up for success and I think that\nIn the NFL and you've seen this happen in years before where you have an NFL team\nOf gets a lot of breaks one year or a lot of things go their way or there's a lot of bounces and a lot of things happen and it works out fortunately for them if that goes down usually the next year doesn't carry over\nYou saw that happen with the Oakland Raiders a couple of years ago they were Thirteen in three they were rolling through the NFL there were winning all these close games all the shootout\nAnd then you got to the next season and it actually happened uh later on in that season Derek car suffered an injury you don't get the balance is you got the year before and everything starts to fall apart\nAnd so I don't think that that stuff carries over in the NFL I just I I think that in the NFL you've got to cash in when you got an opportunity\nClear um New England consistency is what's most impressive about 'em because they won the big game they've won in multiple times they've gotten to the big dance they're always they're always in the tension in the NFL it's different most teams you get your shot and then you step aside\nAnd you've got to capitalize when you have the opportunity I legitimately legitimately feel bad for the Atlanta Falcons\nI feel bad for their fans I feel bad for the team I feel bad for the organization if you just think about what the last couple of years has been like for the Atlanta Falcons\nYou get back to the super bowl you hadn't been in almost Twenty years you've got the patriots on the ropes that game's over\nThey're closing the coffin there are pouring the dirt they're laying the rose they're saying they're go goodbyes they're giving the eulogy it's over for\nA New England bounce here bad play call here Julian Edelman makes a miraculous\nCatch here next thing you know they go to overtime you're often doesn't even get the ball and doing goes right\nDown the field and they win the game you blow that kind of lead you come back the next season not only do you rebound you get back into the play offs and then you win on the road against the rams in LA and you dominate them\nMost teams you lose the super\nBowl like that you're wearing that for\nHowever long it takes I mean like ... like some teams don't recover from that that is devastating did the Houston Oilers ever recover from that thirty five to three a lead they add that they blew against the Buffalo Bills no in fact not only did they not recover they moved to Nashville\nSo you're going to be back and not only were they back not only did they come back\nBut they go in to LA and they beat the rams at a playoff game then the next week they've got Philly on the ropes it looks like Atlanta is going to beat the Philadelphia Eagles in Philadelphia\nCome up short in the red zone they lose you fast forward to this season\nAnd you're the Atlanta Falcons and I even pick the Atlanta Falcons to win the division I thought man this is I think the falcons you're gonna have a strong here I think the falcons are going to be the real deal I think they're going to rebound from this you open up the season and you're at the eagles again\nAnd you've got five opportunities down the stretch to get into the end zone and Matt Ryan just couldn't figure it out you can blame Steve Stark he's you know you want\nYou can you can try and say that it was play calling Matt Ryan threw the ball out of the end zone five different times so you lose that game and you probably should have one then you lose\nTo the New Orleans saints in a game that went to overtime ... a high scoring forty three thirty seven Drew Brees on her rushing touched down\nYou lose that game a close game at home a game you probably should have one then you lose a week ago on a last second touchdown throw by Andy Dalton to AJ green at home so that's two straight weeks in a row so we're looking at three losses\nAnd the combined point total of those losses is Thirteen\nSo instead of being three and one or even for no you're sitting at one in three and now you go at Pittsburgh in a game where Pittsburgh's got their back up against the wall Ben Roethlisberger is a much better\nAnd by the way all that injury lock that you've had in the past several years in Atlanta\nThere's this injury metrics that they do to where it's um you know a players with the most value that you lose the injury the past three years the falcons have been a second six in second in the league\nHave had great health over the past three years in the NFL comparatively speaking to other teams in the league oh you don't get any of that anymore we're for weeks and you got three starters out and you got more they're going to be missing Sunday's game\nAnd we will recreate Nineteen Seventy five classic jaws another tribe Jonah ... dramatic reading\nUh uh the the us says it the Annapolis Tiananmen one end of the water saw my friend went to show up on the

your\nOverall I think so that was the last I saw yeah um but but ... notes there was a college football game there yesterday and apparently the field got real torn up\nGo figure well I mean they played a you know they played on some pretty crazy yeah ... I mean the NFL or for all the money pumped in their makeshift dubious choices they go back to that Cleveland game last week\nI have your point on a baseball game and you got out I just don't get it

to ... in baseball\nThe most disgusting charade of any sporting event I've ever witnessed it puts the W W E a shame and I'll tell you something else I I don't go here as just the actual fight wasn't big enough the real story is what happened afterwards which all hell broke loose in Las Vegas take a listen benefits mash\nOh no no no no\nNo matter [noise]\n\nAll hell breaks loose last night I tell you what it it's a scam it's a shame it's a fake ... it's you know they do for PR maybe look I make should have ...\nAll the way from Ireland to confront could be doing that media day the Barkley said when he hurled at Dolly from the bus and it was on a pastor on the bus it ... it was ugly it's just you you don't want to see stuff like that in the world of sports\nI I just don't see it the same way I and then I get it from us these point of view the commentators immediately were like this is not professional this is not the image that we want to portray I get all that because they don't want that to be a common theme and other fights going forward but just as a fan\nJust to sit on the couch\nThat was entertaining [laughter] the fight and next thing we know\nKobe is just going airborne over the octagon wall\nDiving after a guy one of his are members of the crew complete cheap shot jumped over the wall in hits Carter McGregor in the back of the head total punk move\nIt but I'll tell you what Andy that you can say it's disgusting and you can say it's the worst ever which I Would disagree with in terms of the ladder statement this the fight game we seem crazy stuff left and right but just pure entertainment value I'd be lying to you if I said I wasn't entertained by it\nWell I I'm going to go one step further you know what I'm going to meet you halfway in that square circle right now we're talking about entertainment I'll give you an example let's let's go back to the Yankee game against the athletics the other night when the Yankees won in some clown was wearing an athletic shirts and hats\nAnd the stadium in New York City and they got drenched would be er yeah I watched on TV I left there was that the tanning causes disgusting yes what I Want to be there no but there are certain things that I could laugh at\nBut it was a clown move it was a stupid move was disgusting move just like the thing last night at the UFC it doesn't do any good for the UFC sport it does not do any good whatsoever\nI disagree also like to think that this does no good whatsoever when we're leading off\nTry out for the convent you know this isn't like that this is the U.S the crazy stuff happen it's just hilarious to me how some people could look at say Conor McGregor throwing water bottles at an opponent in a press conference setting\nAnd look at that and be like oh man that was the odds of it and then turn around and get on their high horse this was ... it was just flat out costing an outrageous that I just since the showerheads are flapping up and down it's like if it's leading offers show it's not all bad for the fighting game of all things\n... shows and and this is very similar to news cast as well anything that's out of the ordinary usually takes priority and this was certainly out of the ordinary yeah we could talk about the college football games and we will we can talk about the NFL and we will but it's certainly just like a newscast that's on local news if you have eight houses\nIn a subdivision and the one house is burning that's the house is going to lead on the news this something that's unusual and this was very very unusual\nYeah right and it's being talked about and it's being focused on and that's not all bad for us to see if you think that last night won't help sell the next fight\nWe get a rematch between all I agree with your crazy so to sit here and say there's no good that can come from that spectacle and that disgusting display and it's not true\nYou know what they will sell tickets they will have a rematch it'll happen again I'm not surprised that happened but you know what it's it's a stain on the sports to me I'm not approved\nYou know I I thought was there I I'd say wow I brag about that I yeah I was there in Paris right saw an ad right that I look at it for sure yeah you would be like I was there at that one that\nCame out they either way rich I hear\nCommentators on the same telecast one goes\nIt will be in the ... the right team\nWas bit if they can't pronounce the last name but when you can't get the first thing that's really\nThat's real bad I tell\nYou what it all over the it's it'll be ... syllables bad as some people it's funny where they looked at it and they're like ... who you I don't know the Russian guy yeah last\nName looks like and I try to really does I'm moving over the college football

why it's changed from the rivalry at all the rhetoric showdown and they get all his the noxious man it really is it really yeah but it's for years yeah and then we had a great rivalry back and forth no doubt\nAnd if he is is always end up being fool's gold but this Texas really back this was inevitably the conclusion of the red river showdown on Saturday take a listen to this\nMorning are you

Scott I'm both he's demand period and the story\nOf that argument was settled for anybody with half a brain a long time ago I had a Tom Brady it's not even close Peyton Manning how many times that he just absolutely wet himself in the playoff moment no doubt ton at times man\nFor interceptions against the patriots in the playoffs the big pick six can you imagine Andy for a second can you imagine if Tom Brady through a hick six to lose a Super Bowl how people wouldn't come close to gloss over it if they do and Peyton Manning because they like him\nBut it's not even close in terms of who's had a better postseason resume and who's the better individual quarterback Tom Brady by a mile\nRight I couldn't agree more ... and we'll leave it at that and the patriots it back in the demise of the patriots is or was too soon although I I tell you I understand that because most people want to see them lose you know that this way life right don't you agree I yeah but that day I Would think yeah\nRight but you've got to still be reasonable there isn't another team right now Andy where people are emotionally emotionally idiotic about\nThat's even close to the same level as the patriots think about that for a scientist sport in any any sport anything that you want to poll the ...\nJoining a Seventy three when team but we're not unreasonable we're not like oh yeah they're going to get tripped up by the grizzly this year as long as connelly's healthy like we're not tell them when it comes to them and the patriots have not seen this before\nThey stumble out of the gate they don't play great in September they play a lot of young guys and try to figure it out and what do you know they always do so it was doom and gloom and they were wanting to and then\nOff at two games in a you know short span of time of a sudden they're healthier at three into and it looks much different with Julian Edelman back in with Josh Gordon contributing\nTo tell you one thing that's not that healthy the Pittsburgh Steelers I don't know what's going on there and I think there's rumors in Pittsburgh that they basically want their head coach my Tom and gone they said he's lost a locked room Steelers are home today one two and wants to record that they'd have stopped us who are not much better than one in three found those last of the bangles that's all I'm going to say about that it's genetics we move on\nSteelers ... five hundred Andy you're allowed to talk of angles you know\nSteel is left at home to Baltimore and right now well you know I forgot to look and see that's how did I get them away and 'cause I'm not aligned guy but you are so we go there but I Will tell you right now fountains are probably win this game I really believe stop at a steak umm today\nMight I mean this is one of the handful of big games featuring teams with horrible records right because\nYou had a Dan Quinn earlier this week falcons head coach say he believes the falcons are better than the record indicates\nAnd I agree with him you go back to the old school bill parcell blind you are what your record that you are\nThey are one in three football team right now but going forward there a higher caliber then that Andy I Would look at it like the dolphins were three you know and they got to ... by the one into patriots at the time\nFalcons defense that the Achilles heel for them so I expect this to be a shoot out I think it's going to be a really high scoring game but for the falcons to drop to one in four or the Steelers to drop to one three in one after losing a home game that's what would happen if they lose to the falcons today\nAnd you're in a hole you can't afford to lose this game of you're either a team\nAnd what is it really has to do just gets ... really really Jones involve more the ... really right now is the first NFL history which just touched down to the team's first four games and ... Jones Seventy three receiving a within the first player\nEver with forty one won a hundred yard games in his first Ninety nine games will get those guys should involve that's your strength that's basically a straight get them involved and that's all they have to do\nThey just got to get defenders involved in defending that their issue as these events that's the problem they've scored in the high thirties the last couple of weeks in the last ... games you know so I mentioned that yeah I I I was gonna say real quickly though if you look at the Steelers\nBig ban has been exposed this year without levy on bell back there they've only averaged two point eight yards per rushed to last three weeks that's what you've seen from the Steelers and last Sunday night\nI like James Garner but he's not levy on bell and win them they aren't able to run the ball against Baltimore big bands missing some wide open receivers just wide open\nAnd you don't have that same balance over there in Pittsburgh and it is really really reflecting on Big Bend so far this year I think it's gonna have a good game against that defense today but\nAndy Reid has been able to do just schemes certain ... where they can take advantage I Want to see just magically what Andy Reid comes up with against the jaguars defense because if you're getting pressure consistently and Patrick ... homes that absolutely it takes a lot away from you as a play called her with Andy Reid\nAnd I want to see just in terms of you know this Jay Lynne Ramsay ... I Love the trash talk back and forth with jailing Ramsey saying he's they returned specialists let's get that straight a return special if there's a big game for ... because if he's quiet and\nOverreaction of type ... he'll doesn't play well today\nYou know here's the question I mean I don't know how you feel about this because I'm shocked that the Kansas City chiefs have gotten up to their start that they have and what touchable homes is done and I often wonder and I haven't seen a lot of reports about this at a good story line would be would they be as successful if Alex Smith was still under center\nWould they be because now we have the parts offensively to do well maybe not as well but still it is it all Patrick my homes I mean it's a lot to know them for sure\nAbsolutely it is they wouldn't you know be averaging seven points a game too had Alex Smith he had the highest past rating in football out yes yeah so they would be successful offensively\nBut when you look weak in week out thirty eight points forty two thirty eight twenty seven when I get an off week on the road Monday Night football in Denver\nI don't think they'd be scoring to this degree I don't think that Alex Smith\nWould be pushing the ball down the field where he would have fourteen touchdown passes zero interceptions so yeah Patrick my home's numbers I think are a bit healthier than what you would have seen from Alex Smith in the same often but you got a lot of weapons over there but I think it is that just magically against\nThe forty niners you had a great throw where Patrick homes bought time uses athleticism he rolled out to his right through a touchdown pass those are some of the plays that he's been able to make that are just special look at the left handed throw against Denver right you know a lotta quarterbacks in the league doing that\nEverybody talks on balance in Austin it's I mean here's a team that has gained something like twelve voted yards through the air offensively and only rush for like four hundred and fifty yards I mean where's the balance there so you know all that stuff is all that stuff out the window because I think that you're a coach and you have to do what you have to do with the personnel you have\nI mean I I watch these announces on TV's while you know uh\nGet it done if you don't get the job that she'll look they're going to get done in Kansas City but there's no balance right\nWell yeah there's not a whole lot I mean it's definitely one sided so right as long as it's coming along it's all good but you're going to come to later in the season maybe it's raining sideways maybe it's the bad weather game you know you got to be able to have more\nTricks in your bag just survive over the long haul and right now you got a great passing game\nYou've got no defense and you've got a decent running game\nThat route enough balance to really be a threat to do some significant damage their day's gonna come this similar to last year they got off the great start five uno\nAnd next thing you know they're losing six or seven that goes to when they did little to catch up yeah he won't be able to catch up they could lose three of four they could have a similar stretch here not too far from now\nNo doubt about that Brian firmly alive for like a Fox Sports radio studios no there's only one region to visit this place for a good

I just don't have time in the morning you know\nI hate to see you in pain like this are really good but this will be okay All right this is somebody I feel\nLike you're Irish okay we they either and it's hard to believe they know I\nAnd I love Ralph wherever and I'm not here to pick I'm not doing that but I I Will mention now the top of the hour he got the headlines in the world of sports and\nHe just totally ignored Notre Dame and I think he did it on purpose because I think there's something going on between you and route that song outrageous an outrage say they didn't raise you but they go to Virginia Tech they gotta Blacksburg forty five twenty three they beat him up pretty good and as we said they Notre Dame got another big win over ... the whole piece this week and and\nThis is what but the Irish up Seventeen tonight take a listen\nThrows out through right now [laughter]\n[laughter] like that idea like that you know Alexander ... who I was doing the show was\nHe from salaam last night during the game and I did that numerous times so I think we're approaching the time where people start freaking out about potential college football playoff scenarios you know where\nIt's like it might seem going to be on the outside looking in and what what does this and if they get hosed and this has gotta be atrocious like\nFederal down man he said he hadn't even had a\nCommittee pool we haven't had the committee poll\nOut yet you know it hasn't even been ... and people are freaking out about potential scenario in real life to have a pop tarts take a breath really right yeah it easy but Notre Dame will be there when all is said and done they will be there and I loved that\nBut when they when I think the Green Bay Packers a good football when they went and I think Notre Dame is good for college football when they when I was that\nYeah I mean a lot of people would agree with that it's definitely a team that people have a strong opinion about either love them or you hate their guts and you'd think their fan base is largely largely pretentious and writers\nThere's a lot of truth to that there's a ... a year and right and I get that but that's good when you have that divisive type team man this sport always wins out and so yeah it'd be great for college football if they're there but you know we'll see how the rest of it shakes out when you look at the top\nOf the standings here when you look at the rankings Andy\nA couple of teams drops LSU loses the Florida\nOklahoma goes down to Texas Auburn got smacked around by Mississippi State so that's number five number seven ... drop yeah so this top ten is going to look a lot different heading into next week\nThere's no doubt about it and that's good that's great because it creates a lot of fight a lot of conversation and you know the games probably mean or they really do he's looking at the top what about the top of the NFC North\nThere's that upside down I've got to turn it upside the Chicago Bears on shop attack us to one in one they traveled to the Detroit Lions I mean marrying a truly what's what's going on with the ... or ... I mean are you kidding me\nI mean come on what what what's happening look he has\nThis one aberration game against they really horrible and bang the\nBuccaneers defense critic Conti was hurt\nRemember the guy who got trapped by advance McDonald remembers what it was this is the Monday Night game when the Steelers and the buccaneers and Vance McDonald the tide in gave that stiff farm from hell to Chris Conti will Chris Conti is on IRR you had a very hard\nSteadily and Mitch ... has a good game at all I've been hearing is oh look at Mr Biscayne well look at the the rules in the deep end the ... it's like he had won an aberration game look at the bears week by week here's what they've scored twenty three twenty four sixteen forty eight\nDo you not see something that stands out among all the other game that spike is not normal\nReally no not at all\nSo Mitch ... performance is being rose Lee blown out of proportion\nBut then I kind of put a kind of throw a little cold water on you for a second if I may may I Do that when he got hit because when you talk like this about you know everything is out of control and you're right you know I'm not going to argue with that it reminds me of like the uh the Phillies Seventy sixer fan boys remember when they said they were going to win at all in the play offs but the Seventy Sixers are but I had\nTo give these fancy I mean that's what they live for that's what they live that's where the law and it's all about really made you an eye out to be the voice of the common sense than\nBy some of these people are out of control I get that but let them live let them have some fun\nNo no I won't tell them no logic I Will not stand for fun like I'm all for fun Andy you just can't be unreasonable\nSo there's a lot of will get into it a little bit later but this Baker Mayfield auditor love that\nYou got the ravens defensive coordinator Don Martin Dale talking about he's going to be a\nLike a breath Barbara John Elway and it's like he's just stand at the the is that for journal is against the raiders and we're talking about Brett Farr or John Elway when I settle it down here so that's the thing you can be a fan you can get ... you can be optimistic\nBut as soon as you get on reasonable that's where it's like being a fan isn't a good enough excuse to beat dumb he says you're not you're talking about a coach\nAnymore he's not the savior for the jets at least this year maybe next year he will be not this year it's over we\nHad this day on opening day and that's the end of every member the back page of the tabloids going crazy it was it about the statue for this guy but you know what the only statue that she'll be billed as for Aaron Rodgers in Green Bay and they're going to win today\nPackage and I don't really that I did not know that at a beat Detroit today come on I ... you want to put some Scooby Snacks on this one yeah yeah I don't think the lions pragmatist when he won last breakfast\nOkay you you name it up next some of these problems out by a breakfast next how are you going to buy me breakfast you sent me the Ohio used a semi to bill sent me the most jails and you check\n[laughter]\nI'm a while I'm tempted

got a tweet as well I Love to hear it\nYes this is from grizzly chief he writes in and said it's been raining all night here in case the and looks like it will probably still be raining at game time might not be an offensive game for the jeep today that plus jak defense make me weary\nOf the chiefs wind today might be a slap best\nInteresting there was some entail needs help from grizzly chief like you ... chief\nYou without paint done you know these guys go to those games with the war paint I mean again you see you get upset with the fans that go crazy that are over the top\nI get crazy when I see watching a game on TV and and the camera pans to a guy understands that swearing like those oral outfit really I mean a a guy that's where I'm not really I feel like the Halloween there'll be unbelievable in this day and I've always wondered when you're driving to a game that they were these costumes in their car driving to the game\nYou have to imagine what's that like ... raider fan that we're going to raise the noxious outfits I Love that stuff you don't like that\nI cannot imagine driving my car to again getting ... going to a stop light turning to my right or to my left and seeing the guy in the car next to me worried about Batman outfit\nI just don't understand I couldn't I couldn't picture that really I just could not\nAll right I Know what I'm saying you know what I haven't dressed up for a game but I don't look down upon it I like it\nThat's other people's deal at school with me I have a much less of a problem with people\nDoing that than I Do like they're crazy opinion in other words like ... and I am a\nInsert team here therefore they're going to win at all and it it's just ridiculous man\nI Know that that's why you and I are so well versed because you know we kinda like rub shoulders and there's some sort of a way you know I might the sand paper to you I'm yummy or San paper I Know I Am in a sense I'm rough around the edges\nYeah oh that's good man that's good not all bad oh I'm going to talk about this team they got to win and they could have had a second\nWhen the one to unwind this the browser lost an overtime game to Oakland\nForty five forty two last week I had to make things even worse I don't know why they do with this the NFL said there was a bad whistle which costs the browser fumble recovery you know and\nWhy why would you like pour salt on an open wound you lost the freaking game the coaches they're probably knew it was a bad call but the least got confirmed it like on Wednesday or Thursday to say oh my goodness what a punch in the gut if you remember the play there's some six minutes and thirty nine seconds left\nOakland does look on the thirty eight yard line Garret recovered began running toward the end zone the referee wall day there's just so the whistle blowing before the ... because cars Ford pass as a stopped the progress I understood role to play a shock and the rate is punted on the foot down those the end of it and the NFL in ... in a review said it was a fumble\nWhy they do that yeah well I think a lot of it is due to gambling now how the rules have been relaxed significantly\nI understand it Andy with you it's like well you can't do anything about it now so what really that really do it's all about hey hey it's we're on the up and up we just missed something no conspiracy going on here we're not doctoring the outcome of games and\nThat's all it is and it's been a ramped up now that gambling is more prevalent so\nYou're going to have more of these situations and I think a lot of people they'll look at them be like the browns got hosts it actually didn't end up hosing the browns because the raiders punted\nThe brown scored a touchdown it actually shoot up a good minute and a half as it turns out that could have helped the raiders out so you have to look at what happened next when there was a bad call it clearly was a ... should have been ruled the fumble\nBut as things turned out the brown scored a touchdown any way on the ensuing drives though it's a complete wash\nIt's just you know that's why they come out and be like oh hey everything's cool but it the more Smith Mr NFL PA earlier this week\nHe was pointing a finger at the NFL which I mean almost never happens Andy and he was like I don't know that they've done enough\nIn terms of all of these gambling situations where you have some owners that have\nA vested interest in whether it be like a fantasy sports and he's like how how is that exactly going to work and we haven't done a great job\nYou can't the only thing that you can do is if there was a brutal hall and people start calling for a conspiracy to say\nNo no we missed that are bad but we're not doctoring games here we're not in the business of going to federal prison [laughter] by saying Baker Mayfield can win is first start or not you know it's crazy yeah\nI I kind of opened my eyes a little bit now I understand why the NFL is doing that is the gambling situation you're right I mean and and for a person like myself was not a gambler per se and I and I'm not saying that you are but you're more averse to it that than I Am the most you someone invite you dabbling in a little bit and I really do much so I ...\nYeah you know that's not that it really isn't about this ravens team I mean\nThere are a surprise team there there are three and one and getting not much respect and I tell you I said in the beginning of the segment that speed kills\nAnd the ravens habits they've got to revamp line if they really do Michael Crabtree and wide receiver John Brown this guy could run that speech just willy ... need this team right now ... is a it's a remake it really is and it's given new life to the quarterback and situation\nAnd Joe Flaco he's having a heck of a year and it's because of those guys\nYeah and you know you look at all the three in one teams in football right now outside of the scenes and jaguars\nSaying almost all of these teams are getting a lot of attention and you don't want to buy in your reluctant because right of recent lack of success dolphins ravens were just talking about in this game bangles bears titans\nYeah all of those teams are getting overlooked and it's not because of this year it's because of what's happened in the past but to your point Andy what the ravens and what they're doing that only ... offensive Leon Joe Flaco has been playing better\nThat defense it's pretty good I like their defense over there and you get Jimmy Smith back healthy\nOr a well off of the the suspension you get him back in that secondary\nSo it's going to be a big test for Baker Mayfield who could not have more rose petals being thrown at his feet right now it's getting kind of thing at this point the guy's twenty seventh and pass or rating\nHe had a huge interception at the end of regulation when they're close to field goal range against the raiders and it's just like that well as if it didn't happen\nWell it's a big three weeks stretch for them because the bangles there at home against the dolphins today they're at home against the Steelers next week and then there at Kansas City so that this should be a win for the bangles then when you've got a Steelers and Casey coming up it needs to be a win today for the bangles\nAnd I hate to say this as as a bagels than I Want to see that do well they could have fat loose to the next three\nWell yeah I mean they could easily drop a game to the Steelers into the chiefs and right it's not outside the realm of possibility that the dolphins beat the bangles today it's not like the bangles or a juggernaut or anything like that\nBut yeah I think that there's probably a man is there a better chance that the bangles go who wouldn't want are wanting to over these next three cars assuming they win today you give him a win against the Steelers are Casey who say they drop both of those\nAnd you know what I hate to say this was I don't want to be on the fence I'm not that kind of a person but I really would rather sit on the ... okay\nI Would say they should go one and two but I'll tell you why I say that I I really would rather see how that Roethlisberger place today\n... is he under down swing or is he just had a couple of bad games that's what I Want to see in Pittsburgh I just you know it's like you say you know people say they they they go on past results well you don't want although the Steelers right now are hurting I still look at them as what they have gone and all the ...\nYou're not going to buy that this deal is there a failure yes yes mhm right yeah is that true well that's the way it is yeah you make a lot of sense I'd love to go again I Do\nI'll go against your bottom barrel betting but there's a better chance that they go one into\n'em but you know it's one of those teams the bangles or one of those teams until they do what you can't quite by in there the reverse patriots you should be late to the party\nOf saying the bangles are going to do something significant you should just wait until they do you do you should be late to the party of saying the patriots the demise is here just right wait for that to happen before you said because you've been proven wrong season after a season after a season and this might be the latest installment\nIn his needing a bagel went to the ... dolphins I just want to hear it yes louder louder and louder as\nAs much you can get Andy that's as much as you're going to get over here you know what but I Will tag it out with this just to kind of Bruce it up a little bit\nYeah\nThere's still pride over your Andy ferment but noted yeah I Would push comes to shove I Would say bangles when this one\nAll right Brian ... from the guy go Fox Sports radio

so ah should have some tape these elections for you before we get outta here\nSounds wonderful later this hour we'll ended up with knows pitch we also have at the bottom of the hour that would be eight thirty eastern time al is more of as the sheet Fox Sports radios NFL insider and of course Brian I'm going to say right now to the world\nYou were the man you are the man you called it early you said no playoffs this year for the Philadelphia Eagles so far you are right on point maybe they have a Super Bowl hang over I don't know but today they're hosting the eagles the eagles are hosting the Vikings and is critical gay for both\nIt really is Vikings wants to and one of the eagles to into in Philly and uh they lost a heartbreaking at Tennessee last week an old T twenty ... twenty three and the Vikings lost to the rams thirty eight thirty one so\nReally I like the eagles are still there because the game is in Philly\nBut uh it's not the same legal scene that we saw last year and the schedule is allowed to do with it\nAbsolutely it does and they haven't even gotten into the tough portion yet they lost at camp or with Ryan Fitzpatrick who was fits magic at that point and they lost that Tennessee last week so you look at it just the first quarter of the season\nFalcons Tampa colds titans that's what the eagles to face and there's two into\nShe just look at the rest of the schedule it's Vikings today shortly Panthers jaguars saying you know then you get into the division play and at the rams is a game in uh in mid December so that it's a tough\nIt's just going to be a well oiled machine and they were just going to pick up where they left off and it's full speed ahead it was a complete overreaction to them getting hot at the right time last postseason\nNo doubt about that and don't forget I think the end of the month October twenty if they paid Jacksonville that games in London that doesn't help either you know when you're down you down and out you're losing your not doing well and they've got to take that journey to England it's it's not pleasant there really isn't no time shot at all\nYou do yeah you look at this if you break it down into quarters of the season so the first quarter is done with the first four games right right so the second quarter how about this Andy you go Vikings at the giants on Thursday Night Football\nThan your host the Panthers and you're in London against the jaguars that's not an easy road so you know I wouldn't be shocked if they're too into at the end of this\nYou know four games stretch coming up so yeah I think it's going to be a non playoff season for the eagles people said I was crazy I was out of my mind and I don't think that's the case at all and this is a big game for them today because if they drop it and go to two and three I'm looking great\nEven when it at home that's really what they should do as a home favorite\nI'm with you right there you know I've always respected you you know that ... been your friend and partner but I have newfound respect because you went on the limb no one said that I had never seen anyone national local print electronic media said that they would not make the playoffs ... you're the only one\nI guarantee you or the other one on Fox Sports radio was said that and I don't think you said it just to be controversial you basically looked at the schedule and figured it out and said hey it ain't going to happen in that division they're not making the playoffs well\nAnd there was a long way to go for it to be right but when you're playing the NFC South top to bottom that's the toughest division and football and when you're playing a first\nThose are the two teams you play thanks to winning the division last year that's not an easy road so you think about the eagles last season they're playing the last place schedule\nSo you don't have any cupcakes like the bears to beat up on last year you know so it's a different ball game and the thing with cars than what\nIt was crazy how people are acting like a yeah torn ACL and December no big deal he'll be back to MVP form no problem and I'm not rooting for that to happen that was just unrealistic and when you have a legitimate\nMVP front runner and he probably would have wanted if not for injury last year to think that he was just going to maintain that pays was completely crazy there was no way he was going to be able to do that the question today is Andy\nCan Carson when you have a lot of success against that Vikings past the fence which has been atrocious you had Mike Zimmer after the Thursday night last against Jared golf and the rams he said probably anywhere he's Ben this is as bad as the past defense\nHe's ever seen have been around a long time he was there with your bangles for a long time well you know who's defensive coordinator for the cowboys for a while\nThat's right so yeah he's been around the game a long time and for him to say man this past defense not as bad as I've ever seen\nAnd that's why the bigger shocker is you know in the national football is a been a lot of shock as I'm sure we'll talk to the Sheikh about that's above the law but you know one of the shock because this year has been a the eagles and the slow start but their schedules to blame for sure but the Vikings\nNot only that they want to and one but honestly is the lack of defense and they look they lost to buffalo you know and they gave up twenty twenty seven points to buffalo earlier this year and a really and truly the coaching staff is like\nPrimed on defense the shippers defensive whiz they say and for them to be playing that kind of defense is very uncharacteristic you know for any\nThe next four games it gets a little bit better for the Minnesota Vikings because next week Arizona at home that should be a win at\nThe jets that should be a when New Orleans will be tough and then Detroit at home that should be a win so they should win three of the next war and they couldn't win all four well\nLet's just take the next three right if you beat the eagles today\nLike you just said you're at home against the cardinals then you're at the jets they could rattle off a nice little three game winning streak\nAnd all of a sudden forward to in one that looks a whole lot better than one two and one right now right always starts against the eagles is a big test for Vikings team because if you drop till one three in one and you played poorly on defense again\nThat is how you make your money it starts with your defense at least how the Vikings are constructed her cousins as capable and they can do a lot of things offensively\nBut the strength of that team starts with the defense in with them underperforming as badly as they did last Thursday you really have to have a better effort today or I don't know if they can get on track the season these teams that have high expectations going into a year\nYou see it all the time and did they get off to a bad start and they start pressing and I started out of the rare to or games at one it just snowballs it gets out of control this is the snowball prevention game for the Vikings did they if they can beat the eagles\nWill for both for both really both teams\nIs I think more so for the Vikings just because of how ugly it's been the last two weeks you lost by three touchdowns at home against the bills I Know I Am shocked Allen making his first start and then you've got shredded by the rams so\n\nThis time around\nIt all around me and I do watch breaking it boiled down you know what happened to your home for the best football coverage on the radio waves right here on Fox Sports radio\n... see I Want to point seven mobile labs visit I talked to one of the coin seven dot com [noise]\nYou'll find that passed one I'm your TV show to Fox Sports dot com or details half past ... [noise]\nLike\nParishes fair will tell you it just about a minute when he passed the our this is Fox football Sunday he's Brian no I made the ... what brought you might discover card we treat you like you treat you by the way they got to ask a quick question\nBecause I was ... will join us in about ten minutes about I'm of the hour eight thirty eastern time\nWhen you look at the schedule for the NFL on any given Sunday are there any particular games that you say I'd rather watch this whether the other one or you just whatever's on TV the easiest one do you look on or is it specifically you go to one one gate to me if it's on I'll watch it I don't really care that make that much of a difference to me\nAndy how long have you known me you know I Know why did I answer me why why why\nYou know 'cause you I'm sure there's like ... and you probably have the games zeroed in on Thursday for Sunday\n[laughter] well I go to the sports bar man I always go to the sports bar for the early games\nAnd I got the Sunday ticket\nSo the lovely Christine in I don't think you know establish roots while we're in the sports bar all day you know so I'll\nBack with a in and get the afternoon games at the place\nA couple of games on local T. V. I'll have the TV set up on one of them I'll set up another TV for the other local game assuming there's two I'll be on line for the other two on the computer I got off for I Can't be without a television on a game and the I don't miss games\nI got to have that up but there are two games is after the four twenty five eastern time\nAnd I'm torn between the Vikings to the eagles which is a pretty good game but then you've got the rams at sea hawks which really will not be that great of a gay but you love to see the rams are undefeated knew that it's all going to leave that\nFor and they need to do it to see lots last week the rams are over the Vikings thirty eight thirty one and the sea hawks did win at Arizona twenty Seventeen as I mentioned the rams are the ...\nThe ... and I went to St Louis rams greatest show on tour of the call on this team the greatest show on surf the twenty Eighteen rams\nFor some facts for you there out pacing the Nineteen Ninety nine to two thousand and one St Louis rams and points thirty five and a yard for sixty eight produce per week it's amazing it really is so uh that's the question I up as both those games are on simultaneously I'll probably end up watching Vikings eagles\nWell ah yeah that's a very good match up a and I don't man Seahawks it's going to be tough to keep this one close right because man that was a beat down remember that game last year when tidy early have long run they crushed rams crush them\nAnd I always say Andy it's one of the main strengths of the rams team is one of the major weaknesses of the sea hawks squad\nWhere the rams defensive line the sea hawks are offensive line man I I don't know how you're supposed to generate off and if you're the sea hawks and you're not going to have a\nA reliable ground game and Russell Wilson is going to be running for his life\nScheming wise last week against the Vikings\nWhen you don't have Earl Thomas out there you don't think he's going to find some match ups to exploit that I look at this and they all say there's real quickly\nI look at Sean McVeigh and Jared ... off as a two headed monster I wouldn't look at McVeigh making Jared ... why don't we look at Jared golfing Sean McVeigh similarly to how we view Andy really shitty Patrick my homes\nOr were they complement each other so I Would look at them together instead of giving one the credit ... the other guy no credit whatsoever it's there are a package deal and when you match the scheming expertise of John McVeigh with the accuracy of Jared ... you've got a ...\nYeah and then throw in Todd girlie who's like almost unstoppable you have a weak defense in Seattle I don't know ... they're they're they're just so bang up how did ... how do you stop to control a guy like Todd girlie you just can't I mean I mean how do you think about how he can't\nYeah and that's the other thing Andy is the rams really under performed defensively last week against the Vikings\nSo I think that they have much more focused today I think that it didn't sit well with them over ten days that they played poorly defensively so I it's going to be even tougher for the Seahawks right to score points let alone match points I just don't see it for them\nBut it's if there's a positive over that rest period at least eight they arrested the healthy\nThey really are I mean that the ten days off that a long way following that learnt game so they weren't they are in great shape there there are tremendous shape right now the only advantage Seattle has is that they don't normally lose many games at home but today will be one of the games that they will\nAnd I think that you know there's reputations where it leads you to not buy in to a theme were just talking about all these three in one squads Andy words like\nI got to see more and it works the opposite way with the Seahawks or your leg I don't I don't want to count them out because of why because of recent history it's not about twenty eight scene he wouldn't look at this team and say oh if you put them in different uniforms if you put this sea hawks squad\nJust roster wives in cowboy uniforms it's a completely different evaluation oh no doubt no doubt but you're just lumping them in with the recent past in all of their success they are not those the hawks anymore\nYou know why I I think I figured it out and that's very strange for me to do something like that I don't say the average fan or maybe the average media guy enjoy seeing the changing of the guard\nThey really don't I mean this show set in their ways with various teams always on top like the New England patriots always on top\nAnd when you see a newcomer come along like last year the rams last year the eagles is very difficult to see\nChange ... even in life we don't accept change that well so especially in in sports and and the national football league you used to Seattle a winning and be winning at home well that's not happening anymore it's over their run is over it said that\nWell I think there's a lot of truth to that Andy but\nI think that the NFL is a lot like the radio industry or make this comparison limited relate to this for sure\nThis will happen in radio like let's say for instance like the um the anthem protests you know for a while we were talking a lot about it and it was like you got to have an opinion it'd strays outside of sports but this into politics but this is what everybody's talking about you got to have an opinion you've got to have that\nAnd then it's done a one eighty and so that people are sick of that just move away from it if you aren't fluent\nWhere it's our guys we're going to do it this way just\nHave this live read at the beginning of the segment the next day they're like have the lead read at the end of the segment it's constantly changing and you have to be adaptable the same thing with the NFL from season to season things change all the time look at the rams and the jaguars last year they both improved by seven wins\nOkay the jags were three and Thirteen the year before they went to the AFC title game and had a double digit lead over the patriots so it's like you forget these lessons that you learn every single year and it can be topsy turvy from first worst\nOr worst to first happens all the time to go into the bans in thinking that twenty Seventeen is going to repeat in twenty eight\nTeam right but there's an addendum to that because when that changed us a car like it's happening at Chicago right now Bush the bears are on top of their division the fans are ready to buy Super Bowl tickets you got to reel it in a little bit too many changes good the change happens but just wait give it time give change some time to to evolve fetch with you gotta do\nYeah yeah yeah and I think believe it or not I think there are\nFans I Know it sounds crazy sounds like an oxymoron right like you know there are some fans that are like good start\nGot to see more it's just that\nOh come on come on we pay anything on the eagles already everyone's been hurt\nThis was it to you know was probably going to start slow and who's going to start to pick up some momentum as the season goes on and that's how I look at it or you know for this team you know because they've been so banged up and again last hurting again today you got a no Derrick Bennett in the in the lineup and that's a big loss\nFor their past Russian brand new grand as a matter of fact this year but I Can't trust a panic button and then first who's really going to step up and this division I mean yeah the season ended today\nOr the Redskins would be a game short right there are two and one the cowboys to in to a really flawed team and the giants going nowhere fast right now with all of their often Seventy cars their problems are one and three so the eagles I I mean look I'm not saying they're going to be as good as they were last year but to write them off or to say they're not going to make the playoffs I I just thinking this division unless the Redskins\nTeam but it is going to be Philadelphia making the playoffs once again\nDo you START I disagree with you Alex but I still love you do you [laughter] what would it be too early I hate this in the week five the loser of the falcons Steelers games I hate to write him off but if you're one in four in the falcons would that defenses banged up as it is in the NFC South\nI don't see it happening and if you look at the Steelers won three in one if they lose in that division you could be looking up at the foreign one ravens at the end of the day would you think about writing off the loser of that ball game\nYou're ... you're getting to that point are true and you know for the falcons you know talking to some folks in that organization this week ... they were telling me look we just got to hold down the Fort until we're able to get beyond Jones back in and they feel really comfortable that this event is going to be able to rebound and and be good\nI mean not just average ... good windy on drones returns because he's just back what a linebacker and ... and has such a huge presence but with ... this week again another huge blow\nBecause falcons defensive line I mean this this team in general the good news within pacman Kim was playing well but you know I don't know if you heard about the construction of Heinz feel proud and like they were adding a third digit on the scoreboard\nTreated as of the points that are going to coordinate [laughter] and I think and I think\nTwo of the falcons you don't have internal issues right like you don't see these things surfacing\nWhereas with the Steelers I mean you just every week or so new drama and some new issue that comes up with these guys and the specter of lady on bail hanging over the team and I think if any team loses I think the Steelers would probably if they lose I think that's where you start to worry about okay does do all these ... up all these early losses start\nTo break this team apart and you just have personal issues of start to come to the forefront and I and that's you know when the tonia brown is talking all this stuff this week rather than taking that just shows where is the focus guys on on trying to win a championship right I mean that's that's what it comes down to me that so much new talk from the Steelers you know from guys\nTemper tantrums on the sideline to leave your situation I mean I can go on and on with this team and it doesn't work like well I'm like I'm On and and the car industry where they can't stop terrible lot of experience courts

gets which the guy go go to guy go back to the minute you get that gift cards\nOff of your hot and cold sores for weeks five dogs we see in a while homes are big bad Rob burgers\nCurious match it but I mean one I think we all want to watch between Kansas City in Jacksonville I just don't know that I Want a lot of stock in the fantasy side of that game that I\nEven if\nWould be more apt as you have one of your hot place to take a Jacksonville\nSecondary receiver like Didi Westbrook then maybe someone like semi Watkins today just because I don't know maybe maybe jailing Ramsey does shut down I recall I don't know how much were even going to see them matched up\nOn each other however the fact is is at least that she's defense you could maybe see Jacksonville making some hey\nI'm not sure it's going to happen to the other way around which actually leads us to what other we asked him why some weeds in the west broker Marvin Jones junior who looks like he's going to play for the lie all\nAgainst the Packers yeah murder judging there's going to be the third of those receivers for me uh in Detroit right you're looking at Golden Gate at a monster game last week a lot of people nervous about is injury status twelve targets\nAnd a big game for him and then you'll get golladay looks to be the guy who's obviously taking more of the wraps and targets from Jones even before any kind of injury concern so I've been alone leave the other way I'm going to go with west broke and take the targets and hope for a slip of the db and a big play\nHouston Texans are home tonight to the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday Night Football twenty eastern down time Tom always making them move pleasing Travis Frederick outings would reserve is not going to be around for a while parents Williams also getting the IRR designation\nYou mentioned Lamar Miller off the top of the show to give you an update on the Texans running back he's a game time decision but not likely to go eat chest injury that\nCould force him to miss tonight's game and it's a big game on a lot of reasons it's not going to be NFC championship rematch big game but this is a big game for the simple fact of these are two coaches though we don't know if they're going to be in the national football league next\nOff of a of a wind last week against Detroit bill O'Brien and the Texans finally get their first when thanks in part to the fourth down play for Frank writing the colds to not settle for the tie and just\nEnd up losing the games the Texans at least are are heavy wind in the wind column but it's not like you're sitting there saying All right the Texans have right of the ship so the loser on this game the pressure in Texas gets even is even higher on one of these two had coaches the cowboys take on the Texans tonight\nMaybe bill O'Brian wants to go back and dominates have college football again I I don't know but certainly last week I liked the Frank right decision not to editorialize too much going to you know last week's\nPlay but you're already depleted with so many injuries and Indianapolis you know you're not playing for the playoffs so why not try to win the guy over and over in the locker room and say I believe in yeah sure if nothing else we get out a tie at best we hit a broken play and we win this thing but\nThen the other side of the coin is this that we're talking about is the Texans without that decision\nOr a women's team right I Will read on may ... yeah so and so the the bill O'Brian situation with with the Texans have and it's going to be on full display tonight and you're going to get a you're going to get a full look at what the what what the Houston Texans are all about and at times it hasn't been great with a roster\nThat has great players we know about ... on defense you know about Watson and Hopkins on our fence to be as bad as the Texans are record wise I I think that I was a really big game for the Houston Texans\nOne over on on this one forty five when you look at Watson probably at the back end of your time and in terms of your fantasy rankings looking at Dallas there the middle of the back in terms of pain as he points allowed to opposing quarterbacks\nThat I'm running up and got a given it out a quick flare out and hoping he can make some yack\nA and make something happen it's curious here you know Jack Prescott I I think based on his valuation might be a nice contrary in play yeah for the daily fantasy worlds that you might get a jail break player too because you know they're bringing the heat right we've talked all along about how much different\nThan Dallas all offensive line is than it was two years ago hell it was depleted last year and it was still better than what we're seeing this year the loss of Frederick being absolutely amends to all of it that you might just bring the house\nAnd water you busted plays makes all the difference in the world on the other side Watson's in your lineup Hopkins is you'll line

people have to understand he came back so I was going to get a new deal it didn't happen he's out there playing and\nThis was his worst nightmare that just came through ... we got this man have is worst nightmare come true and so obviously the frustrations are going to be around and so when you go to the silent and he throws up the bird\nI to me I don't think I don't have a huge problem\nI was going to say you have a problem with I don't have a problem now obviously I don't I Wish you wouldn't do it and I wish they wouldn't catch it on camera but at the same time given the bird is not that big of a deal I live in Los Angeles I get the bird everyday I drive out and\nGiving it to the sideline and\nAnd I think it was to the situation I mean he might as well be making it to himself too 'cause he made that decision to go back out there it was the ... by the way\nYou cut me off that's why I did that to you [laughter] there's never right time and do the wrong thing so I didn't like his action but let's let's this was a mutually beneficial relationship he signed contracts was nine years which is double the average player he was part of a captivating\nBrandon defense with Pete Carroll this was a great honor and a great city look around the NFL the safety has been marginalized there's not a lot of safety and get the money he's going to get another contract listen I understand the frustration of players\nBut we know if this is not the NBA or baseball a guaranteed contracts in a lot of its timing Alex Smith is what the second highest paid quarterback and the league it's a timing league\nWould cause you have an option you don't have to fight looking lady on now if you're worried and you don't want to play and you don't have to play\n... you bring up an interesting point but I

I'm Still doing currently spoke flipping the bird you're in he's in his\nWhat would transpire my my my current status as well as what could have potentially been in my future and that is now in jeopardy so\nI I Would not have done it in ten years what you think he looks at that I think you have and I'm proud of I don't think you I don't think he regrets it I think that he won't be able to explain why he did that and and rightfully so I mean he's the motion obeying we're all human beings we all make\nI I don't think anyone's denying the emotion but to Collins point the teams in very good to him and he's in very good to the team\nIf this is my issue with the the the the loyalty is never to fall it's always one by that when it comes to player organization most players don't get the

two days before training camp Tony Soprano where the most respected offensive line coaches Enron game coordinator passes away\nThey quickly get going they lose their starting guard from last year job or to retirement another one the east and I was an injury there last illegal rushing and their life in rushing attempt only twenty five percent of their place I've been Russia's so this season it's going to be on the arm of her cousin and those two receivers the wrong game is not exist\nYou know what you gotta you gotta look at it this way and we just got to come to terms with this is how the NFL goats I mean that team last year went to the NFC championship game between the two thousand Thirteen we went to and if the championship game\nLaw came back the next year everybody's say these are going to win the Superbowl favorites with us to move on four games that year because people got hurt injuries things happen and we got to just come to terms with it this was not Minnesota team as of last year\nYou know it was hard on Kirk causes in the beginning of the year but this is not on Kurt ... gave a twenty seven points in the last of the games they only gave all twenty seven points into games all the last year as cliches and may sound defence when family it's just the deepest needs to catch up\nThe way let's not forget the eagles aren't great either they lost Frank right the ...

because there's no way beyond\nYou know I think it it falls on all of us are laid off from the best business we stand that but we just have to find ways to what games do you feel is is that old misled even talked to him at all and I know a have a um I don't know misled 'cause it misled to me would be\nYou know upcoming and I don't show up and and and the only thing that was misleading to me is why

not good details there firework show must think more than like a mile long way in this league\nSo I think there is more famous brown what'd you think think about the only difference I Know but\nAnother uh you know another white out I think I think it's pretty obvious speed it's it's really I think led the honesty it's been the key is cut all he would do give it another touchdown they'd win forty eight for six that's all it would do it all up and say anyway\nI just think what saved his way he did to the top of the covers allow a B the get opened underneath and made it easier for being a find a B underneath and I think just taking that go way really took a lot away from the orphan so\nLong we live you know bill with those guys were two key components that kept that office

believe than Aaron Rodgers led off fenced in Green Bay sitting in the middle of a packet Seventeen their their inability to finish drives you\nStart down conversion the red zone they they haven't finished drive than their inability to run the football with any consistency Rogers bleed the running game leads to a big shot down the field he wants the often run more through devout they add they targeted in fourteen times last we caught eight\nI put up big yard last week score twenty two points they said we should have put up six hundred yards and score forty point\nYeah how how do you think he's frustrated right now he's going to be frustrating even more so after this Detroit game because that it would look at your end now don't get me wrong I think he's the most talented quarterback in the league when he's healthy he's not a hundred percent healthy\nHe's receivers are not helping all he's going up against a pretty good past events now they've they've changed coaches Mac Patricia now is the head coach with the company still the same Matthew staffers had success against Green Bay\nAs you say Michael I think going in St Matthew staffers they're going to be ball and today\nWe're

the latest on the football is referring Rogers and let me\nLook Aaron Rodgers has taken off the injury report this week but he's still in an awful lot of pain I Want you to understand how ridiculous it is that he's off the injury report because the injury that he had that cheap phone Bruce and MCI and sprint to type of injury that will put normal people out a good six to eight weeks or another

now there will be a tough challenge but we're looking forward to imagination winning quarterback let's do it at length that sounds good to\nSeattle and wrestle hoping to add another when today but I mentioned that\nMichael in the interview you know to be a baseball player the rams are out for that and is there a reason for Seattle that still be as optimistic as Russell appeared\nOh he can appear the optimist that he was I don't think it really is that optimistic isn't going to be a tough out for them but I mean they won the last two games\nBut this is the game with with the whole secondary

Peters of left tackle hasn't played as good as he normally does I expect that to change today\nYeah I don't even recognize this Minnesota team you know last year they were Super Bowl contenders yeah now they want to throw the ball okay they probably incurred cousins you know pretty much a ton of money they're throwing the ball All right more than anybody in the league they're not running a lick\nAnd that's hurting their didn't fan so deep that you're giving up twice as many points now isn't what they did a year ago this is a completely different football team they got their passing game they don't have anything else\nAll right let's passing quickly over to change the way to tell us who was in and out what you buy Geico J.\nO. guys were talking earlier about the Minnesota Vikings

rams versus the sea hawks all up and down the NFC West but right now as we speak count 'em up one two three four five six\nSeven eight games kicking off around the nation including our game between the Atlanta Falcons and the Pittsburgh Steelers and I'm expecting just about every sentence un I order today to be interrupted by a touchdown in that game\nLook good those are two prolific ... those are two defenses that have played wolf for football so far the seas in\n... and it's odd to say that but the Steelers are scraping the bottom in the league in total defense or they they are often simply as good as advertised but yes in this day and age is the NFL you can be a team that everybody wants to talk about and\nI think that's the point I mean look at this game we're excited about this game people are excited about this game we talked about the featured games of all the games that are coming on right now there was no doubt this has got to be one of the games that gets a big screen here in our room\nAnd what do we have we have a one in three teams playing a one two and one ... I Know but nobody cares about the record because they're like I've got a Antonio\n... holy to Jews have now been written about freely that's\nI mean that's that's what we're doing and and there is excitement\nTo that because I think as we all know as we've seen the flags or out of the occupants of back fields and socks are now legal in the NFL a way we're getting used to this new in this new big twelve look that the NFL has taken off let's go shot guns for why didn't just air raid the soccer\nPittsburgh Steelers in Atlanta as big band takes the field or the first\nTime their lives with the ball first just walk around the ravens habit first in Cleveland where we will check yet on Baker and his does in\nA a little bit later as he takes the field and then let's check in on what I think might be the most fascinating game of the day I won't go I'm a little bit bombed a that it is pouring their Kansas City hosting Jacksonville\nThis was going to be the ultimate off ... and again the ultimate defensive weapon although the jags have the ball first we all want to see what happens on the other side of the ball is Jay Lynn gonna pick off pat and all of that but it's pouring here or an expected to be a steady rain throughout the entire game which is kind of an equalizer\nYeah you know this actually to me uh gives the advantage to Jacksonville in this game there's so much speed on the side of the Kansas City chiefs that defense\nOr is one one of the best that we have seen a aside from this year being the top defense in the week I think that this equalize his home field advantage slightly because this is the type of game\nPound the rock and then defensively you can mark it up in the mud and so I think that this really does bode well for Jacksonville against all these weapons on the fence a that Kansas City has at their disposal\nMeantime in Carolina today this one is really interesting to me the New York giants are kicking off and they've got the ball first right now\nAnd already you're starting to get the low rumble oh del Eli Manning what's the problem or Dell calls at ... Duncan he's questioned the heart and then earlier today he was asked is Eli Manning behind the fence in walls and his answer was I don't know\nThis is an interesting answer\nFrom one of the biggest personalities in the league that a quarterback who has been on and off question for the entire last year\nWell right and they'll come to junior is one of these guys where his behavior has been a concern for giants ownership for a while now and what did they do to handle that well that they they paid him a lot of money so everything oh del says it's expected and quite frankly encouraged at this point so this doesn't shocked me at all\nGoes James Caan or on a little dump off pass from Ben Roethlisberger and then he breaks a couple of tacos and into Atlanta territory so right on cue officers are looking good right out of the gate in that ball game with Pittsburgh hosting the Atlanta Falcons um and then also right now Green Bay in Detroit\nI'm this is going to be a desperate or Detroit Lions team after suffering that loss in Dallas last time out\nAnd a very big Green Bay team and I keep thinking and feeling like everybody\nHas in quite gathered yet the Green Bay is not the Green Bay that were used to seeing even with Aaron Rodgers on the field you look at what they did last time out they shut out a Buffalo Bills team that doesn't offer\nOr that that often is not clicking at least not yet\nThis is an interesting tweet from Adam chefs or a Aaron Rodgers leads the Packers into Detroit which has been good news for Green Bay last Tennessee north divisional games\nRogers seven one in one and he's thrown twenty three touchdowns adult picks so in his own division he does a tremendous job doesn't matter home in a way and that's over the past what nine games that he's played in division so\nThis is a Green Bay a fence especially led by Aaron Rodgers\nWho seems to know when it's time to click in and play hard ball and everybody knows\nMission numeral who know when you start a season when your division at something the Green Bay Packers have done a ton of\nJags opening drives stalls they'll kick it away and the driving rain and so here comes Patrick more homes entire retail and jailing Ramsey and age a Bouvier and miles jak and all these personalities\nAre going to be on the field when the chiefs out the ball and here they come and they're going to take over\nOr just short of their own thirty yard line just start also an interesting game going on in Cincinnati today where the dolphins have the ball and today might be an interesting sort of a introduce yourself right on right on for the Miami Dolphins because they go through you know\nAnd nobody really believes it but some eyebrows raised and then they go into New England and everyone went well that'll be that'll be the end of that and and it very very clearly was\nUm but I still am not a hundred percent sure like I don't think the dolphins were as good as three at all I don't think they were as bad as they were in New England last week a and with the way Cincinnati played at three in one I think today will be a day that we learned some things about the Gulf\nYeah because this is in a a turnover type defend Cincinnati I think I think that they are are going to pose a decent threat this game is in Cincinnati today and so the dolphins have a hill to climb here ten they do it I ... I I always look at\nCash opinions about what they've seen through the first quarter the seeds and anybody who knows football knows this\nUh nobody season is won or lost in the first word games we got to get through this hump this no October and November tumble where we get to see who is perseverance we've seen it many times also you can sneak into the playoffs with a lower record and make a ton of noise in January so a lot to be learned about all these teams\nOkay James Caan or with the first score of the day he's going to pop in from five yards out for the Steelers\nWhat I don't know after review is whether or not it's going to stand it's going to be close as to whether or not the knee was down before you reach across on the goal line also it looked like Detroit just scored a touchdown however I think a flag just called back\n\nMy food when you can run a Patrick moral [noise]\nWhen they headlong guy [noise]\nYeah\nYeah that's definitely that's not going to hold up\nAnd the chief strike first against Jacksonville in Detroit and the lions kicked up all the way the parks\nAccidentally touches a Packer the lions get the ball inside the five like Garrett was turns it into steaks extra point good step and nothing Honolulu book not as bad ball that is bad ball\nI mean you're supposed to be shouting\nWhat everybody get out of the ... the pun it should never happen you just your\nBeer by name wasn't Peter I wouldn't turn around and why I got so popular but every show a heater when the punch landing\nTo make everyone aware that it is not couch or get out of the way\nThreatening Baker may feel just picked off moral ... coming up in his back in March layers joins us live her nose and forty niners later on this afternoon on Fox alongside Dick Stockton and Jennifer hell we look forward to this day marks\nDo you mean gene went down what is your sense in terms of the emotional stability of this team I'm now having to move on for the whole season without their guy\nWell you know I mean I think anytime you have that happened do you try to rally around the\nYou know CJ better than to get better grades probably his best game had a couple of interceptions but one of them off the hands of his receiver so like the other one was a tip ball you know tipped drill so um he really played well last week I think the biggest thing is that so many injuries across the board on both sides of the whole southern Cal fan and he's like\nI said we don't know what we are right now because we wanted to be controlled the middle of the football field team you know they lost the Kennedy and they ... a jerk the Kennan that they've\nThey've had so many injuries they've got some receivers that are out today so um they're just trying to figure it out right now so it's been it's been kind of tough but also it's one of those things they rallied around the you know the\nOne thing about the NFL is um you know my ... tell us all signed me up all night with a crying baby I don't care\nYou know you've got to go out there and you've got to play because nobody's going to feel sorry for you so\nYeah they're kinda licking their wounds on Monday and came back to work and are ready to go so we'll see what happens but George settles playing really well and to get better George could have went to Idaho Iowa together skews me and um and they've been together for seven years so they've got a great chemistry caught won't touch down last week um they put numbers on the board last week so that part is exciting\nYou know mark I I Know you watch a ton of film going into these games they have a rookie starting at center my buddy aid to Shipley goes down with an ACL during the pre season and so there are a lot to do with the rookie under center and a rookie senator how's the offensive line looking in front of Rosen\nOr they you know they made a lot of mistakes in the ... center you know is is like most refuse they're not quite ready to play it and he's done a good job for knowledge um knowledge of what he's supposed to do I'm physically gets pushed around a little\nThat's been part of it um mental breakdown up front and have been a part of it um you know they've tried to be a real gap team double teams the point of attack that haven't been great you know when you get six hundred three hundred you should be able to move those guys and they haven't done that on a consistent basis really hurt their running game\nUm edge presidents hasn't been good enough they're tied into not very good job blocking both on the front side and cutting people off on the bad side so it's really been tough on David Johnson you know on and\nThere are there comes a time even for David Johnson when you have to just embraced the ugly for your ... ugly for your Ron and try to put your ... and people and I'm Steve you can wear 'em down a little bit so it's something that they're going to have to do much better job of 'em but Josh Rosen was Josh Rosen his stats you know you just look at the stats\nUm Fifteen and twenty seven yeah five legitimate drops for over a hundred yards of are probably a hundred and twenty a hundred and thirty yards um that he would have had had those drops not been made so he threw the ball with great or a fish and sea great accuracy heat is depot was\nUm incredible everybody that we talk to going into this game whether it was on the carnival staff or on a nine or staff their eyes lit up when you talked about Joe ... dropped Rosen so he's the guy that they have a lot of uh they have a lot of excitement about especially in Arizona\nAlso I Would imagine Arizona excited because it finally looked like they at least started to get David Johnson going last week one wants to talk about that and and how can they get him even more involved [noise]\nYeah well I think ... as they continue to go on I mean they're going to want to do some to back stuff in and bringing chase Edmunds the rookie\nRunning back as well get David Johnston locked up outside um you know try to find some one on one match ups slipped linebacker so that's part of one of the things they want to do they are they really felt like um the games have dictated they'd love to give him more involved in the past and gave him more um\nA long to get some of that stuff done so they're hoping to get that um they they gave them I think twenty two twenty three carries last week so they're hoping to get him a little bit more involved the passing game but you know they're gonna they're gonna working hard there's no question about that\nA back to the forty niners CJ back through to me he uh he shows a lot of grit when he plays football for the forty niners that was a to point game in LA it's a good defense as far as the charges are concerned\nWhat does she mean to this franchise now that ... down do you think you'll have success after all head coach Shanahan called the great often\nYeah you know it's ... ... talking to Tom about him you know he's got great up as a Supreme toughness and as you mentioned Supreme grit and and it goes usually which so that you say that about a quarter back it means they should be coaching I'm not so with CJ bath or he he actually very skilled guy\nAnd it was interesting to watch the difference between last year when I called the game and and watch the film is Egypt better than watching this year I ask how she ended like what's what's different because he throws the ball with more authority it's out of his hands quicker you really said he was just late with his feet on everything last year thinking too much skeet\nHave caught up to him and his arm and he goes he's just is really\nReally throwing the ball well right now because he's in a rhythm east they're really good off its rhythm um and so he's a skilled guy now he he needs to do a better job of taking care of himself but his tough this comes through his grip comes through and the guys rally around that ... isn't that great they really appreciate like if he's going to take shots like he took his last week and\nA George Kendall was all going to about a game last year in in uh Philadelphia where they hit him so hard for us to talk to them so hard issue flew\nOff like you know so if he's going to stand in there and take that kind of beating\nFor us um the least we can do is reciprocate so they they really actually like CG about that a lot he's earned the respect because of the way he\nAnd thank you thank you guys figure okay cardinals and forty niners it's interesting or going to go check it on the rams and sea hawks coming up in a few minutes as well that NFC West has really been I don't know if this is too strong a word for it but it it's just shaping up to be kind of disappointing\nBecause the whole thought going in was going to be hey the rams the favorite what's the what they can do but the challengers are\nYou know Jimmy ... forty niners\nAll let's see if Arizona led by defense can do what they can do and Seattle was maybe a revitalized running game or can they may be squeezed another year or two out of out of whatever they've been doing for the last decade\nAnd I feel like the answers across the board on the ramp ... a ramp challengers have just been like in ... no no no\nYou know it's funny when when you think about the NFC West there's so many similarities right now to the AFC East of old obviously rams replicating patriots as far as a ... juggernaut and the defense that's playing top notch right now and then you look at those niners\nAnd you think to yourself oh my goodness they finally have their quarterback how many times have we said that about burying teams across the AFC East didn't pan out obviously you're going to see first round quarterbacks like tannahill a it was for for the dolphins and it it just never really caught fire\nAnd to me that's the Josh Rosen story in Arizona I I just see so many striking similarities between these two divisions I feel like the rams are about to go on a roll of dominance in that division for a long time\nYeah I mean look you you look at what they're doing I think the saving grace is from a financial standpoint\nOr can the rams do this for a long period of time it it looks good but they've spent so much money guys like in ... there are going to be pieces that over the next couple of years will go away\nAnd he's a year about Jared golf though his career was going one way and then all of a sudden showing McVeigh comes in revitalize its him could this be a situation where a head coach really had the year of the player to the point where buddy\nIf if you can take less and we can get more we can keep this train a role and\nThink about Tom Brady yup it I mean he was buried on that roster she got into the injury he realized how lucky you are to get the opportunity to play for great team and a half before to this moment to step in and an injury situation never left New England I could see this happening for the rams with\nTouchdown runs already today well right of course oh everybody a new album up of course that's fantastic\nOutlined with any nothing that's set up by about sixty five yard a catch to a Kenny Golladay up so that made up a little bit for the touchdown that he didn't get earlier and we already at least in the early going seemed to have an answer to one of our big questions\nCasey all fence greater than Jacksonville defense Patrick malls and the chiefs off and even in the rain I guess the top defense in football they look exactly the same as they always\nKnew just dealing ... and quite frankly I guess this shooting surprise me used to playing announcements being in Kansas City\nAnd you know Andy Reid is going to prepare them for whatever forecasts is on the docket for a weekend in football uh yeah so the rain has not affected them uh Jacksonville looks uncomfortable as the the chiefs are in the red zone again\nYeah first or second goal the ten year old line already leading

think one of those linebackers will end up with a at least one in this game I I think they're going to try to pressure once and getting to space\nJoe Block where those winds eagles later today on Fox Joe so much expectations for the Vikings coming into the year and they get their week one over the forty niners and then after that\nIt's just been an odd a journey for them that trip to Green Bay that ended up in a tie or the game that none of us can explain with what happened at home against buffalo and then they just run into an absolute bumps on Thursday night a week and a half ago against the rams but that leads to a one two and one record an hour really hard assignment\nToday it is it panic time if they can't get a win today I don't know I mean\nI I look at that division you have to be a real firm believer in Chicago I think that they're going to run away with it you know as as ... go to the giants I don't think any of these teams go into panic mode\nAh but I I think they they become navy desperate desperate to federal worth these guys like to use but I\nYeah I just don't see anybody running away with the north and the same can be said about the NFC East\nI mean you've got to Washington on top of two and one they play on Monday Night at New Orleans a Dallas who knows where they're going to be a\nAfter a after the night game so I I just ah I just don't think there's a team that's going to dominate the division which means that Philly andme Minnesota you know while Phillies two and two in Minnesota's one two and one I just don't think that that this becomes a must win because I think there's still time\nBecause of some of the the mental issues he's dealing with you mentioned the aggressiveness of Mike Zimmer as a defensive player for the Vikings I look at the Vikings past Russia and the only generated one sack against Jared golf is that more attuned to a great sense of one in LA or is that something that the Vikings are struggling with\nFour\nI think yeah I think they're struggling with it I you know Jared ... just pick them apart and you know he exposed the corners trait waned doesn't even playing this game is out with a concussion so they get even better they'll have a rookie and Mike Hughes out it\nLeft corner Xavier roads will ah will trail around after our son Jeffrey for the for the better part of the afternoon\nSo you know to go back to an earlier question you got back hurts Dallas got hurt the tide in Philadelphia a Nelson Aguilar they've worked Jordan bath used back in ... this is still a very good op Ensign Philadelphia and it's not what the ramps have in LA but if you're a soda defensively\nAnd have struggled the way they have you know they let the league last year given up less than sixteen points a game now they're given up twenty seven and a half the game so he he got basically twelve points going on the scoreboard more this year than last and you're on the road under five hundred\nAnd you're trying to you're trying to win this game with a defense it's under ban against an off at that at home it's been pretty unbelievable so I I think the Vikings have their work cut out for them I'm not saying they can't win I think it's going to be a really good game but they better figure something out here fast defensively and I didn't think we'd be saying that this early in the air\nI Want to know real quick about your trip to Philly or the fans there I absolutely love them all but I I Know also does not take them long to\nLet the shine kind of wear off like they can find a pessimist within really quick so even though they're they're still got the super bowl glow to win\nI think they're All right I mean I I think when you look back at at the way last year and it it was story book and while this is a rematch of the champs game that was ... cane I'm against that polls and\nNow we've got her cousins against Carson wins I think they they are willing to give Carson a chance to settle back in the soft Benson opportunity to to get back into a rhythm get back into a slow their defense\nIs still very good the problem is the secondary or defensively and I think if there's one area that fans around they're talking about\nIt to the corner position especially jailing bills who struggled so they've got bodies back there or they lost riding the cloud they're free safety so that they're going to have to mix and match you might see a von ... says five nine hundred and eighty four pounds plant safety\nOr in this game for Philadelphia So the secondaries an issue that means that Jim or it's going to have to get fresh or up front get pressure with glitches whatever it takes\nTo try to take the heat off that secondary I think that's the area that fans around here talk most about right now so it's always great to have you always as you've taken the time All right guys thanks\nOkay Joe Buck getting ready for Vikings and eagles later today on Fox guys this game is just about [laughter]\nAs delicious as they come on and is it a entirely possible I mean not not possible I mean it's possible that if the Vikings win this game both of these teams come out of here with a record that they're not very happy with\nAfter five weeks uh but no matter what and nobody would have predicted this the loser this game after five weeks the NFL season has got a losing record and where were these two teams no one would have seen that common\nWell and if the Vikings do lose do you start to hear the cries that current cousins wasn't the right man for the job and and that's what we all hear so often is quarterback head coach those are the two\n\n\nIf it's the automated [laughter] are giants ... founder quarterback in the future [noise] and they call him all these me [laughter]\nWhy you want a quarterback money why it out\nI mean seriously home annoy you use it probably on the sideline right now but like\nThe Eli that say it's all about else failed fifty seven yards only ... on the giants are ah hanging\nIn there is I think the best way to say it hanging in there and Carolina are they still trailed this one twenty to ten but hey they got in the end zone and it was not courtesy of Eli Manning\nNo no it was in uh the New York football giants amid another controversy started by number Thirteen are now in a ball game because the number Thirteen and we have a missed extra point in Cleveland well by their new kicker Joe support\nI leave is a rookie\nWho they brought in tractor they fired their kicker in New Orleans yes for missing a field goal in two extra point\nLike I don't think they even let them onto the team plane but you know with Joseph can do which is the same thing like a brother and sister do when they fight and mom and dad come into punished both of them and they're like look at him over there you know what Joseph can do\nYou can say hey you guys see we're basing Crosby did today [laughter] so uh this guy Joseph missed an extra point but based in Crosby has missed all three of\nHis field goal tries to do some of them\nFrom short range yet no laws we've got the ...\nYeah you might it might this happens a lot of talented people not just not just pickers golfers when when you're pitchers sometimes you have to step up\nUh we also have a real problem in Kansas City and this is the problem\nUm if the defense is going to play well\nWell then just forget about it is over we got to pick six of ... was trying to throw screen past forgot to throw the ball over the head of the defensive linemen uh he catches it goes the other way for twenty yards piece of cake walks into the end zone touchdown chiefs routers on twenty and enough in two minutes to go to the break\nI think it was deep for that's one of the guys on the defensive one that she is absolutely need to step up they drafted him in the first round and there are has a high expectations and it was all it was all just in Houston for a while or generating the past rush so it's good for Kansas City they're finally seeing returns on that product\nAnd they're playing inspired complimentary football so they kick it off\nAnd go figure they make a great play on the cover teams so they pin\nThey pinned the opponent deep again I just the Kansas City chiefs\nThe Los Angeles rams those are two teams that in all three phases they really complement each other well now I'm not saying that she says ... have looked outstanding defensively they haven't but complementary football means when you have a nurse you're rolling your way the other phases don't screw up the ship\nFree winter's day and they go to Vegas covers dot com that Vegas covers dot com by the way when we mentioned that rounds touchdown and we should mention who got it Baker Mayfield to restart Higgins touchdown round suddenly in front of the ravens six to three\nIn a defensive struggle that's not very surprising it looks a little dreary in Cleveland today when these two division teams match up\nThis is usually what happens like even when the browns have been dreadful for the last few years ago when the ravens come to town it seems like a low scoring defensive struggle and so that's what they've got going on today can also add and here's a little bit of an eyebrow raiser other dolphins have now taken\nI'm trying to get info on aware of the other score took place um but I think it was a a punt return touchdown though yes\nI should grant I think it was yeah it was a\nWhile we are going to get this info it was a grant became grant for Seventy yard was it a punt return though\nI'm that's what I'm looking at a will try to get more information on what happened and what we do know OK Seventy our pond return touchdown dolphins are up fourteen to nothing and or any dogs have been having a really good year\nWe're having a really good year today eleven of sixteen a hundred and forty one yard is find no touchdowns\nHe does have one interception Joe mixing his back not doing a whole lot Nineteen yard with his ten carries\nAnd again this is the head scratching that seems to go a week to week with the Miami Dolphins even quarter to quarter you look at their games remember the raiders were beating them in Miami the whole game and then all of a sudden the fourth quarter there like boom bang bang we win\nAnd even at three you know no one believes in and they go to New England seemed Miami's a frog\nMiami's a fraud on the road in Cincinnati blanket the bangles listen and and here's the funny\nThing about the other side of that same and Andy Dalton is a good quarterback and and that surprises everybody when you say it out loud it doesn't seem to make sense but last year twenty five touchdowns twelve interceptions year before that Eighteen and aid\nAnd he's stone for over three thousand yards and those in those back to back years he's been to ... she's been Harold did for his efforts you sign up and some weapons although they lost sight for which is hurting them today clearly\nIn a a in a in a a a game they're putting\nUp a bagel so far but but this is this is this this thing does football they they when a bunch\nOf games every year and everybody scratches there had at the end of the season going how they make it into the wild card well it's largely a tree\nYeah I tell you why though this was just an incredibly ill advised play by a veteran quarterback and you have to wonder if the locker room shattered didn't lead to it than Ralf us burger on a second ago from this out and bought himself some time rolled outlast\nAnd just out all kinds of time ah but as finally defenders started to converge on him he just sort of tossed it up you know sort of fluid up in the middle of the air attempted four who Antonio Brown and\nSo I'm not surprised that he's going to try to force the Baltimore Antonio Brown after all this chatter what happens to Montana case he picks at all for the Steelers tape points off the board\nWho by the way it's filling in for an injured John O'Neill and and I don't know if everybody's following this kid at the Monterey cage Z but he's he's looking like a ball or that's a ball hawking the secondary the falcons really\nTheir only shot at stopping anybody in the passing game is when this kid gets turnovers form he's been doing a fantastic job earned his way into the starting defense\nGranted with an injury but he's shined on special teams as well so I Am very least one of the forest secondary players or can get some things done for the Atlanta Falcons but the falcons largely have been leaning on Matt Ryan and company offensively to saying games\nSoccer lining up to the game in Cleveland do serve it is blocked it is blocked by the Cleveland Browns\nHalf time is here the browns will hang onto the lead six to three let's go back to Kansas City I Want to check in on something here our Blake portals is nine of Nineteen had to pick six a short time ago every time I start to want to believe in this guy\nHe has a performance like he's having today and I don't mind if the defense just if they're doing something to you both of those is throwing the ball to places where his receivers art is he ... he looks awful to that yes\nBorn born it was just a very borderline\nField who struggles playing against more coverage or basically allowing the defense to spend the wheel they can get in grass when they want to they can they can do what they want there's ... there's no need now to worry because you have a twenty point cushion this is Robert Blake's going to struggle he gets exposed in these games Jacksonville Jaguars much like\nAlmost every team that ties the dominant defense and they pour off and they have to play with the lead otherwise it gets ugly fast\nAll right I also mentioned something just happened and I came that it never happened in the\nIn the NFL this year and and I can't even remember if it's ever happened in history and that thing is a pot homes interception us other jacks picked him off\nAll but deep lake morals pick six came just moments later it's his first pick of the year I don't know if he had any last year in the one game that he played against that run up to look it up\nA but it has just been all touchdowns no fish from all of this year the jags finally get one on him and then they turned it right back over and that's why you're seeing Kansas City have such a comfortable lead right now it's winning announcing and oh by the way Sam Donald has found his favorite hook up is the guy that goes by the name of Robby Anderson\nVeered daily fantasy player this might be the guy this week three catches one hundred twenty three yards to touch downs the jets are leading the Broncos Twenty one to chat\nRobbie sitting on my bed she my found good eggs so that that that hurts but um\nYeah back to my home is actually a second career picked because they're not Denver game he played out while you're out on All right yeah one thing but it hasn't happened this year has not been this year and truthfully when you look at this defense she's going up against and this is the top defense in the NFL currently and mind you\nHere's an idea let's that save hundreds

I was at a wedding we're talking about big or make\nHe does he I mean he likes the browns I don't know how different they are I simply know they are way more exciting than they used to be\nWell they look different and and I think that's a fair assessment to make they definitely look different I I I think belief is a hell of a thing and football if you don't have it you don't have much\nAnd I think that Baker Mayfield has of Brown's team that is largely the same in complex in as far as the personnel they have around this team from last year but what they have now is belief I think they truly believe they have their quarterback in the future and guys are playing harder because of it\nAll right and so far today for Baker Mayfield Thirteen of Nineteen for a hundred and fifty to one

you are having more success out fence away because you're given more opportunities in this special teams just blocked upon and the falcons will turn over on down\nHang out with a partner got the ball and he's running around like crazy does not have enough or first out a while or the punter broke like three tackles ... so is your fish show even if they're okay to David ... is that well because the parts are groceries Achenbach sure\nThe punter for Atlanta has now more force miss tackles hunter and then I fell however generated\nA sum total of negative to yards on his uh his attempt there now yeah this was great edge pressure by the Steelers a punt return team uh they they sucked up a bunch of blockers and then the interior rush got the ... year\nThey're able to tackle and so they get fortuitous\nField advantage here going in or early in the second half\nYeah they're going to have the ball I think somewhere in the neighborhood of about the twenty yard line are already in the red zone already up ten here come the Steelers are the chiefs on the move again they're already appointed to nothing at a big catch from Travis\nNow I'm going to try to ah keep the pressure on the Green Bay Packers who are threatening to make this one a game second intent for the lions just shy of midfield All right what do you what do you see going on up here in Cleveland right\nNow well in Cleveland ... this is getting to be what we're what we ... what we've seen out of Baltimore over the past couple of weeks they're pretty balanced team great defense really solid often says well\nSo they're going to go down swing that's for sure are they only trailed by six there but I I'll say there's about ... homes\nAnd then we're going to get to a fourth down play in this Detroit Packers game ... homes or with all the window dressing that this often does there are occasions where your broken plates on these play action so that long past to Travis Kelsey was in ... he works the pockets as good as any young quarterback I've seen in this week in a long time\nAll right ah first and goal for the Steelers from the former yard line James Carter will get the care he'll go nowhere so second goal from the forthcoming up except it's not going to be first and goal from the two did you see what just happened here in Pittsburgh take a look at as James Caan or get stopped\nAt the for your light on first then go on the line backer are pushing back and at the end of the player watch them thoroughly James Carter to the ground after the whistles had already been blown flag\nCome out [laughter] a foul you a lot of they throw their arms up in the air like what what are you in any event mean to\nHim violently on the ground as well those were blown yeah a couple of bone had play is happening in two games going on that one in Atlanta and this one in Detroit sustain the drive for Detroit because of a personal fouls on the Packers on Fort down so Stafford in the offing back on the field and they're charging down the field\nRight now it's second innate\nFor the lion's often send again twenty four eight over the Packers at Ford\nQuarter Aaron Rodgers and the second half at Ford Field feels like something I've seen before right up but they are now as you said in talkers territory after thirty nine here Stafford on second innate looking to throw at it is going to be incomplete or a ball that was dropped by his tight and had it momentarily also let's\nNot forget about the New York giants game they were not supposed to win a game it didn't look like they were going to win but all of a sudden they are really hanging close they've added a field goal here in the third quarter Panthers twenty giants sixteen and you know\nYou almost feel like a a golfer who's struggling all\nDay and then finally just stripe went off the tea sometimes it just takes something to rattle you as a team and get your attention and maybe that trick play in the first south with oh Dale back in the hitting sick one Barclay for a touchdown\nGot the energy going for the New York giants they're all fence wasn't doing much again but now they're having a little bit more sustained success Beckham is just two yards shy of a hundred yards receiving on the game they're only down by for with a quarter and I have to go\nNot a hundred percent sold on the patriots being back even with Edelman coming back even with that off and starting to show a lot more flashes I only just even very good to the patriots so big time swing games the next two weeks for the patriots we'll find out whether that ate and ate prediction that I talked out has any possibility of becoming the truth\nOut kicked in coverage with clay trap and they say yeah I mean there are three I'm putting it back on Fox Sports radio\n\nAnd the double a college football\nWhen it goes down in your town you all talking about football for for you is that uh we're the ones\nThat you have to ... states Fox Sports radio sports with that I Am a white\nMan\nTo find out by someone on your TV go to ... dot com\nTroy Green Bay in the red zone now down twenty four to eight but it's the second and dying is alive Thirteen [noise] better forced them five for just outside the nerdy moments ago Aaron Rodgers ran for it now he throws\nAnd that is complete down to the five down to the zoo is here for a touchdown he is this is going to get reviewed six ways to solve the man once again it's our buddy Marquez Valdez who's got a third last name as well scant lame\nBut he caught the ball with that tell me what you see your catches the ball to pour it serves [noise]\nWe've got me and I don't know [noise]\nAn elbow they're both up up up out of all comes out\nAnd then he recovers in himself\nIn the end zone I say he's out at the one what do you say I think\nYou're right I think it's like a down by contact elbow touches before the ball slips through the world\nNow yeah and so I think you'll be down by contact that the half yard line um\nBut if the ruling on the field is a touchdown unless there's\nYou know completely complete confidence\nIn that caused still touchdown right so we'll see what they make of that but yeah I agree with you I think he's down by contact that they have\nA yeah I think that elbows down before the ball squirts out and then he recovers it in the end zone so we've either got a Packer touchdown or first and goal or inside the one either way things are look it up for the pack\nRogers ... just moments ago on this Dr fourth down situation you've got to go for your kicker has been ice cold even though you're inside of Detroit ... Detroit territory a decides to run it himself and he gets it all on his own man he just saw a wide open in the middle of the defense and scrambled era\nMan he's ... injured and he's playing inspired football he's largely the reason why the Packers have anything resembling a season right now\nI'm also of interest in Cincinnati picks sick bangles tie game Seventeen all dolphins let this one Seventeen to nothing but here comes Cincinnati they've even things up just under twelve minutes left to go\nGiants only down by four in Carolina and driving right it around midfield and in fact\nCall it now into Carolina territory as Eli Manning hits thoroughly shepherd they're just shy of the thirty yard line so the giants suddenly on the move and out doing some good things the Steelers have rolled away from the falcons a little bit that one is now twenty seven to ten\nIn favor of Pittsburgh and we are waiting of course uh the answer on the review in Detroit a with regard to whether or not Green Bay has another touchdown and they'll go for two or is it first and goal the one and if it's first and goal at the one uh may I suggest Aaron John just outside it's just a thought\nUm oh by the way just as we were saying nice things about the New York giants Carolina has intercepted has intercepted Eli Manning and I want to know who that was was that Eric Reed\nWho just intercepted the ball for the Carolina Panthers\nNo that was not Eric read okay but somebody just picked off\nManning the minute I said ... Chris Jones part of the reason why the chiefs are ranked so high in fantasy football right now with their ah their former a term for a touchdown is the fact or I should say inner ... intercept you return for a touchdown as Chris Jones big number Ninety five on the defensive line rumbled in for a score now\nHe's in the locker room he's taking a shower early so we just saw an example of al river on the new authority or jak players from New York He's in the command center and\nA punch thrown and sent the message to the Kansas City officials get them out of the game wow wow so his days over\nOkay I'm All right so more on that coming up indeed was Mike Adam's on the pick the Packers do get called down after one so it is first and goal at the one uh and instead Aaron Rodgers will fall into the end zone that is a touchdown ah who got that one\nUh Kendrick glance Ken Driggs okay Kendrick the second tight and for the Packers so one way or another they're in and now we're going to get another two point conversion try for Green Bay mean time\nUh the Atlanta Falcons Smith running one in across the goal line right now don't go away there yet still very early in the fourth quarter it's now twenty seven to sixteen with an extra point dry on the way All right here comes Green Bay is to point Dr is to get within eight\nMy gosh it's not even the end of the third quarter yet the Packers lost dead\nOr if they get it right here they're only down by a score Rogers are All right now is going to look back to his left\nNow is getting a throwback to the right it is incomplete bad play just didn't work\nOut the whole time that one that one was a little while\nI Will say this is a great play call by Mike mccarthy you have your plane maker in space with protection doing what he does best improvising there were two routes running to his side\nAnd the solo route all the way back to the left side occupying the corner and so what you have\nIs a situation where Aaron Rodgers can either run it himself is there's room improvising the passing game no team or the streets to scramble drill better than the Packers so well unsuccessful on the two point conversion you don't want to put in your place kicker he struggled so mightily this game and you got a lot of making up to do already\nRavens were inside the five yard line when we last left you there\nIn Baltimore sex and you just watch Brown's games we've done this now fifth week in a row we get to the fourth quarter ... it's either close feels like they usually got a small lead and you just start thinking to yourself what are they going to do now\nWell see this is the thing about an Aaron Rodgers facing an uphill climb like twenty four points in the second half or Seventeen when he came back and won it in Chicago week one and you say to yourself\nOh yeah they they got a chance I mean it's a great chance but they got a chance because they got Aaron Rodgers I mean you feel the same way every time\nThe patriots are trailing there are certain quarterbacks certain often certain teams that you know when it comes to the nitty gritty they're going to get it done or at least make it interesting interesting with with Baker may feel\nWe haven't seen it yet so you can't necessarily say oh games on the line Baker is going to showcase were Baker does deter the browns are going to find their way out of this we don't have that reference point yet and until they start winning these type games this this unfortunate unlucky moniker is going to tend to follow\nThe browns Kareem heart right up the medal for yards out touchdown Kansas City that one's a rap fourteen fifty seven to go since late twenty nine seven over the ... with an extra point on the way this is out with a statement by the chiefs I I mentioned\nEarlier uh the chiefs are about to go to five and no but it's not just that\nI keep in mind what the chiefs have already done in order to get to five and I'll keep in mind the schedule it started on the road against the chargers and then it went on the road to Pittsburgh and it's been on the road to Denver\nForty niners came in had Jimmy ... for three and a half quarters of that football game it was competitive and now are the top defense in football comes in here and the ...\nThe chiefs are five and a well look I I mean yes they are fantastic there's no question about it but the Steelers have a bottom rank defense in this league\nA Denver right now is sorely missing weighed Philips or his second you're in Los Angeles he's doing tremendous work with that defense and Vance Joseph and not defense which has talent are still truck struggling to\nFind themselves they're they're they're in the middle of the field and the forty niners look they're still looking to put all the pieces together so yeah it's\nJust absolutely you got to make sure you converted your ... has been pretty good for him today and look at this uh they had men coverage they punched up three receivers the right side comfortable place first stop for it to go to and they ran around very similar to what you see as the seats in the low rent\nAnd there was confusion on who was supposed to cover who golladay breaks free and he's been really really good for the lines this season so far and it's only been a couple of games for games warm but ah golladay quickly complimenting tape in that receiving corps up\nAnd that extra point is good so Aaron Rodgers is facing a three score deficit now in the fourth quarter Detroit thirty one Green Bay fourteen will continue got some close games what is Ryan tannahill how to say about all this Josh Alan ... he'd get the bills in the field goal range\nFor a buzzer beat her there we'll check in or all of that live Geico Fox Sports radio studios easy to say

line and the giants my goodness gracious db\nHow new day hold on the flag on the field although there is a celebration they seem to think they may have this one ah but I'm Still waiting for a call on this flag\nOh they'll back from where the giants touchdown there's been a huge day for him and know the even Eli Manning seems convinced that this penalty is on Carolina this is from thirty three yards out manning hits O'Dowd back them beautiful post route in between two defenders nice thrown nice catch\nAnd oh db as yet and the giants would go for two and all of a sudden they looked at in the water and now they're one flew away from cutting is the three with eight minutes to go in the game\nSpeaking of which the violent they Adams low red zone for the Packers Aaron Rodgers adds another

this one was simply an extra point now they're still technically down by a touchdown in a field goal because I think it's rather obvious at this moment they're going for to the rest of the way no

to get a review\nI think that's an incomplete pass I think\nIt touched the field that he was babbling it on his way down and I think potentially the nose or the ball touch the turf before he uh he gained control is sort of rolling out of the dive there Baker a first and ten and his own thirty eight\nYard line there are lines that good field position in theory only needs about twenty five yards to try a field goal but the browns well Ben mess and we can go to overtime again yeah that's the plan their um\nEither way back to Detroit even if they bought the Adams catch is incomplete the Packers still very much alive in this game\nAnd and it's hard not to ask the question of where would they be facing Crosby had even I don't know ... to his for kicks he's missed an extra point three feel goals a lot of them from point blank range he's just he's just off today and uh and the Packers are only down by eleven it's got to be really hard for them to look at this\nAd and realize how close they could be if he if he was making the case like normally does\nYeah yeah injury on the plane the Detroit secondary on this uh this Bible catch or know catch by divine the Adams so the plot thickens in Detroit\nBecause this is going to be an arrow salt until the very last sound of the whistle is blown a you have there it out if your Aaron Rodgers and the Packers if you're going to have a chance you need score fast and so any injury to the second there is going to affect them very much\nSetting up that fourth in one talk in Carolina they did go for it they got it and now the Panthers are down in scoring range however James still not over two thirty to go giants have to time outs plus the two minute warning if they can even hold the Panthers to a field goal there are only down by six he like many will have a shot\nBig third into for Baker may feel right now from his own forty six yard line\nThird into Thai gained thirty seven takes on the clock health route to the flag\nOut of the backfield into the ... and now Cleveland has got the ball into Baltimore territory thick thick thick they've got one time out there don't want to use it here he got down to the thirty seven yard line Baker will spike that one second and then coming out sixteen seconds\nOr you could drive field goal from this distance but they're not going to feel comfortable with it they need they need another five ten yards at least\nThe shame on Jarvis Landry a veteran receiver a guy who they're all lying on to lead this group I mean great conversion when they needed to have it but what are you thinking turning back\nUp audio hill job that I mean there was the clock you just wasted ten seconds a valuable time and the game situation that's a bone had moved\nYeah and there was absolutely nothing in his way to walking out of bounds and gained nothing off or put his head down and barreling into the defenders so here comes the second intense way for Baker out of the shot ... he'll throw left in complete\nIncome plate that is off the hands of his tight and David and joker so third intend coming up it's about a I Would say from where they are right now about fifty four fifty five yard field goal try\nAlso they need they need something on this play I'll tell\nYou I think you're in Port on territory you really yeah well because\nThere's twelve seconds left so I don't even I mean if you don't get anything here and there is five seconds left on the clock I'm kicking the field goal why why not\nI I guess I suppose but at the same time I would just as students then routes to the end zone and take my chances of winning the game that way you have an inexperienced kicker\nIn a game winning situation you haven't been able to rely on your kicking and they will in fact go to fourth down as a pass was batted away by the Baltimore defense so it's forcing ten okay\nFourth and then from the thirty seven so you're looking at either as you suggest throw to the end zone there's ten seconds last or I Would suggest Joseph from about fifty\nGranted him I hate it when does your accent that I see at the same way well hey we got it all doing very well but here we go\nAh Joseph for the lead ten seconds to go fifty five yard field goal try for the browns did his on his way boy editors laughed at is the I think he\nHad the lake but his left that leaves five seconds on the clock to see I mean Baltimore's not going to try to do anything with this I'm pretty sure they'll just Neal audit or maybe they'll throwing up a book five seconds left to go and the browns walk to be headed to overtime for the fourth time in five weeks\nIt's a shame yeah playing in Boston because that goes over the green monster there every time that Paul had her out of the right hand the batter's box yeah show Joseph misses the field goal it's nine nine in Cleveland and it looks [laughter] you will in fact ... again\nAll right back to Detroit where we're three forty to go air Rogers was just moments ago about to try to throw this one into the ends on his arm gotta hit right as he was released he gets so now\nThe Packers outlawing whilst are really up against it I mean they've had everything go wrong in this game they really have no business still being in this game but because of Aaron Rodgers they are but now they're facing a fourth and fifth dean\nFrom outside feel go range and feel go range at this point doesn't matter anyway or does it get their eyes they're bringing Mason Crosby odd instead of going forward on fourth and Fifteen they'll try from fifty six yards what do you want to bet he makes it\nYeah no we missed that one too oh my so it is a cool off for five probation Crosby you can't really jump all over 'em all now that was from fifty six yard\nIt's almost cruel and unusual point if you're Mike mccarthy I assume you're cutting him tomorrow and that's the reason why you put them out there in the situation because quite frankly when a kicker\n\n\n\n\nOklahoma and Cleveland [noise] and [noise] it's children [noise] thing that we wouldn't be in the middle of thing [noise] is it working quarterbacks\nHis second start and he's saying stuff like that we just get

Panthers thirty one to thirty\nTwenty seconds to go bird and want to run up and middle it's close [noise]\nWhat are they going to say did they give them the first down no it's for for the one hang on and they just like the ball\nYeah it's like the fourth one I I think I think what I think what they were done with our centering the football you know it's well known I I Know wait for the other team gets the oh no\nJim Mike the hall okay by the way by the way I look at the white on the\nHighway breaking news so yeah uh the Carolina Panthers center of the bomb so they can they can make a field goal in the middle of the field I assume\nWell know there are still throwing down field there there's ten seconds to go there not until go rage and it's almost a sixty Arthur\nGrand pianos got plenty of leg for that I'll tell you who also apparently as leg all of a sudden this\nMay seem Crosby found the struggle for granted that you're back maybe\nWell watch this after all that watch them they will be on side\nCheck is there any time or is it over\nSeventy John left to second thought outside check the same chair Rogers hail\nMary in Detroit tell me that doesn't happen once a year All right here we go so we'll keep an eye on that one\nUm the ravens and browns remaining overtime and here comes the clock issue we talk about every week browns have the ball back again now uh bought only four minutes to go and they're deep and their own territory will stay\nWith good no from sixty yards sixty three\nAway and then is good and the Panthers that they've seen in the New York giants what\nDid I tell you we split the around you don't leave that kind of time on the clock wow if you're going to score and you're going to have a marginal lead and we're talking one or two points you do not okay for the outcast hold out of out you get\nDown on the ground you are suggesting this is what you're suggesting that I Want to talk this hour you okay oh is it back down you went to Penn State's out for ... okay I'm back because\nThis is what you're proposing steak one Barclay when most athletic people in the entire world grabs the ball on a path out in the flat that's right and he is running\n... he should not go for it when you're trailing with less than a minute to go so\nThe ... is that what you're suggesting by percentages the odds of you scoring a touchdown from the five yard line extremely high\nSo you step out of bounds maybe you can even get closure if you lower to shoulder maybe he goes down at the true yard line on the sideline and then you up for downs and time outs remaining\nTo close out this game with a touchdown with no time limit for Carolina do any no time outs left by the way okay no doubt about even still ... so you're telling me you line manning\nHas three or four opportunities to throw the ball to the ... gives me for opportunity throw the ball in luck the low red and you're not ... I'm I'm putting my full faith that you leave Carolina with the wind and zero time left on the clock\nAs opposed to handle the ball back over the Carolina with a minute and change and they go down and they win the game\nThere's obviously\nA risk either way here or there like you and I do not see the same way for ... for two reasons hey I Believe when the touchdown and there you got to take the touchdown because the touchdown is not guaranteed no matter where you're on the field a but be to even ask\nUs acorn Barclay at full speed um when you're taught smell the end zone died forget the end zone and your trailing ... even have him things in that moment you should veer right and go out of bounds I it's so anti instinctual I I feel\nThat if you're a well which football team out of the things that you do remember but he hit a sixty three orders don't listen to act like ... like what the Panthers just it was a likely scenario I'm not saying the sixty three yard or with like ... but if that's what they needed to preach\nIran's not Superman range you you're you're not talking about all that difficult of a task of the way our fence is being played in the NFL nowadays you can throw the ball all our defense much do in my opinion handing the ball back over one point lead with anything nearing two minutes left on the clock he's insanity but\nThat's not what was he wasn't to Minnesota and one thirty ... no no it was one twenty when sterling shepherd caught the ball to go down to the fifteenth so we're talking about a minute and all they did was get to midfield they just happen to have a kicker and there was sixty three order here talking odds to me\nI Will take my chances with the lead and a kicker lining up from sixty three maybe\n... maybe ... player and me but I don't want to give the ball back to an up and going against my defence when I have an opportunity late in the game to lay one down at the goal line or step out of bounds and give me for opportunities to go in and scores my our fence and when the ball game\nLook I hear you they're both they're they're both interesting quite frankly you're in good shape either way\nI think that your your your good shape Europe better fifty fifty chance to win the game no matter what you do I just think would say go sake lumbar from his running down the sideline and spell the end zone man you you can't tell that guy to hit the brakes yeah if I coach I'm up to do it though is that hair but I just don't think you're sure\nBetter situational football teams understand if anything the time left on the clock how many time out each team has they put their team in the best situation and when\nAh like at the\nGap pressure and whoever whoever got close their job in that I think his fingertips grazed the ball to pass\nBy or the poor kid Curtis Jones of the look on his face was is why\nOne way or do they go in and these are women did\nWe win [laughter] I'm In a few cannot I'm unemployed to this guy got two

these guys\nWell yeah for a while he was a free agent who was very successful kicker in Dallas they got rid of him he remained a free agent until he finally got signed\nA and there you go early entry

year last year I've gotten most of the run was shot penny their first round or has not and I believe we have a big stop we do in in LA yeah we\nHave a third down stop so to be a raiders field goal dry

you want yeah I understand that record two to one one what'd you monument is for them that is true but\nThey are much the TV they give you everything you want in a sporting event the high the law or the year the year I couldn't take my eyes off watching that game and it was\nSeven seven the rams are moving though and Jerry Gulf almost got laid out a plan to go\nAnd uh we have uh Darryl Johnston is going to help us breakdown another AFC team as he is joining us now or was that the falcons and the Steelers and finally the Steelers getting going there Oh thank you for joining us and uh it looks like\nAntonio Brown and been Ross's burger they finally get right at the ship or whatever have been going on between those two\nYeah but it it was really the the big play down the field that was missing 'em\nAnd those were the you know he was just like any other hobbies but didn't want the production of the\nSheep dystopian sink underneath an intermediate but it was that big throw down the field they finally got one of those this afternoon so I'm sure that uh the Steeler fan base was was very excited to see that\nMoved to talk about James Connery and what he means to the team no living on bail\nHe said he may show up around week seven at this point it's clear and obvious that he is the missing piece in the money game in also in the passing game coming up with the ... how much does he mean to this team with the hold out oblivion bill and the uncertainty of what's going to happen there\nYeah I I think it's critical and and they just got to be able to get off the better starch um you know the two games where they weren't able to use\nJames was the Kansas City game where they went down Twenty one nothing in the first quarter in Baltimore when they went down fourteen nothing um and you have a tendency to become one dimensional\nAt that time so against Cleveland and then again today against Atlanta or they were able to stay a little bit more balanced and and it's kind of funny we went back into the look at it and I think you know you think of ...\nIs a home run hitter in the game and his longest on last year was twenty seven yards and James Garner had a twenty nine year old or today so I'm [laughter] saying you know you're talking about the same guy but\nBut I Do agree with what you're saying that you know as as you're moving forward um you know maintain that balance\nWith him because he gets to the route gets that point quicker gets turned around that you know sometimes I felt like he was holding the ball or waiting for ... he said he kinda runs his pass routes like he runs with the football that very patient waiting for things that kind of open up so uh it sounds like they develop some good chemistry you know already this season in the past game as well\nDo what we did lead to them trading Libby on bill this year do you think\nWell I just think if they can't get to a point where the numbers work I think that that's the biggest thing always in the situation and ah you know I understand the frustration on both sides and um you know maybe on bell is you know franchise for the second time in a row that's that's frustrating um he wants he wants more guaranteed money\nUm you know it we had this would you make ram a couple of years ago he wanted wide receiver money's tight right within less than it was a wide receiver\nOr he's used as a wide receiver buddies and all ... inlet beyond you know one stat that respect that he's had because he's a he's a very dynamic player in the past and gay but that's not going to happen so uh it's up to the Steelers to get to a point with guaranteed money that he feels comfortable with a you know where the injury to a little comments or you know there there's an example that he's going to pull out\nThere's a quick way you could they money with the guy go go to guy could I comment in Fifteen minutes you could say Fifteen Percent or more car insurance salon\nJob and Washington with you about football Sunday [noise] ah we got a lot to get through because I have a question for you we saw something the rams day was very on Iran of them get to that is just a moment update on this charges games sim three right now they're on the one they're probably gonna Melvin\nGordon it it looked like he was going to score on about forty five yards screenplay and he got ... the the Lyman trip them for\nThat on his own Lehman did not trip him he was the ... was in front don't blame us for everything I'm overly for each ripped over the blocking Lyman foot there was a different guest what all caps semantics okay Samantha no he tripped over noted that not submit it because\nWhen you did and all kinds of lemon tripped him you place blame on the off into Lyman\nIs there blame on Gordon or is it just it happened it just how it happened but when someone trips someone being they are at fault I felt like we were in a practice like Fifteen Years ago\nAnd like watching the game of you and an announcer on that game you will on the TV copy you would have been let our or Melvin going was on his way to the end zone at Lyman trip to him right that that would be your call on that one of the car even saying that are\nUp you know what\nThey would they absolutely would say well you would say a lineman stripped him that he would just add a lime and trim slaves but then you're not going to be in here talking about ... I won't\nBe I won't be distracting you can't vote I won't be doing that they're speaking of Melvin Gordon he got in the touchdown regardless of tripping up over his lime and then on the on the screen as he gets into All right All right we've got to talk about the celebration\nIs now the now everybody keeps doing we we just saw the Patrick Peterson get interception for the cardinals which by the way David Johnson scores for the car does now fourteenth six there up on the forty niners\nAnd they all he rushed all his defensive players they are tired because you know you've got the former recovery and they all go in the end zone and do the pulse of the picture\nAnd it melts the going gets in the here on a couple of yard touchdown run and then they all posted a picture like that it's almost like they're so excited they are allowed to do things now that they can't think of anything else Korea but I Do get effects from it from getting a factor but I I like it though man I'm Glad I'm Glad we're doing this because you get to see some cold every now and again\nAnd that's a touchdown rent or the the the house yeah Lockett lock it looks like it was about a forty fifty are bomb from Russell Wilson\nThirteen that's three obviously you waiting on and so in guy extra point which could make it fourteen but the way kick a voice of ten the rents that are saying but the way we see an extra points\nToday it is not a given oh he just blew by who is that that Peter's yeah man\nHe just blew by ... ... ... what is he was reading the underneath route caught him on his feet planet\nYeah big big play there and now it looks like we have a touchdown Vikings huge play defensive touchdown Vikings hobo\nBall big Limbaugh active role in rural will enroll in\nTouchdown Vikings right down the stand is nine to three over the eagles\nLot a lot of action had it right now and all over the years that'll be a lot a lot of touchdowns are speaking to touch sounds better as a whole lot of touchdowns or we expect\nFrom the cheese and they did score even got a a pick six is well thanks to your boy Blake borders having a very strange game four hundred plus yards but also for interceptions and so it was the defense that got it that for the chiefs earlier\nWhen you normally you know the with the office aside the ball and again the offensive had a had a solid day wasn't\nShe fast but the defensive side of the ball get it done\nSo you know how I feel about the border I'm On record saying that you know he's in\nThe ... you know I just Ali's would have you ever just coming around last week I was but when you ask someone who is the town that I don't want to take talent from but when you ask someone with his talent level to throw the ball sixty one times\nThinking about that you have Blake borders throw the ball sixty one times and only handed off Thirteen times\nYou're going to get interceptions numeral in the ... just multiple interceptions you can't have he doesn't he's not that guy no he's not been robbers burger ... Seventy times very narrow it Drew Brees those guys can throw the ball that amount of time\nBlake bottles isn't that guy keep him at thirty two at the most hey let everything else workers work itself out you know my favorite\nThing about you with the ... that since we're baseball postseason or use a I'll use a metaphor them you are the pitch counter\n[laughter] you know are really in the past\nSo who went over fifty or sixty past is and how you are displeased with that and that's exactly right because I Know what that means\nI definitely know what that means disaster\nYes it's a disaster right now for the raiders men as they say one in three and really could be over for again you know last week we had that we were we had to browse game and we were talking about how they could have one that won a but right now they don't get a victory right now man and then down Seventeen the three to the charges and again another team to charges\nThat I've always said we're better than what their record was they had to go up against the chiefs\nAnd then the rams too tough games go up again so we'll keep you updated all the games happening right now but right now we are joined by Chris building was on the Packers in lions game\nThat I may or may not have had some feelings about writer for instance I are born and raised in Michigan we got to watch you play all those years with alliance was honored to be talking to right now but I I it almost four decades of lying fandom I may or may not have renounced my fandom a couple of weeks ago\nUh I just couldn't take it anymore 'cause that's why you heard me say has the most is watching them beat the Packers finally\nI'm Talking about that do they got a victory against the guy who they struggle with during the call you guys were talking about how Aaron Rodgers and they had thirty six touchdowns the foreigners stepson and he's like Thirteen three against the lines how'd they get it done\nWell they scored points in the red zone I mean that's today's day and I felt you look at it and then they can move the ball from the twenty twenty\nAnd when you're able to convert those ... as opposed to feel like a Pakistan has or thing for for inside the red though that's down a that was the biggest key to me and they were they were excellent read though it may be a threat to play when they had to make\nA when when you look at this Packers team or this came as a shock you know I I didn't see them losing to Detroit Lions is and you watch Aaron Rodgers a lot of pressure was on him and got hit a bunch what is it offensively did they\nAnd you're playing what rookie wide receivers ... throughout the Arab you can tell there was some mistakes they made some good plays but they're also in the mistakes and guys you know this is well anybody never in the history of mankind has there been a pass route he signed or two\nGuys are within five yards at U. Penn right and that that happened three times today where the Packers\nYeah they're definitely not on the same page and you can see the frustration\nA N Aaron Rodgers you know after those places you can just be him he's noticed in a you know upset\nAnd uh you know in in my opinion them not having the ability to run the ... really puts a lot of pressure on air and rising to of course he's the one of the top quarterbacks if ever but having him running game it makes it a lot easier for for any quarterback\nWell they're not bad\nWriting the ... I mean Aaron Jones is back he's certainly capable of the problem is you can't get down twenty four to nothing ... start running the ball and then that's when he got started playing around the yard and he certainly did today I Know\nClose to forty five or forty six maybe more that you have to do and yeah and so you you look at that and you look around a league I mean Kurt cousins with Minnesota Vikings for example at great numbers but their last in Russia is\nNot going to happen I Believe you got to throw the ball to win\nBut I also believe you got to throw the ball to run in order to open up that running game you can't go out twenty four nothing then automatically that puts it effects in especially the defense of wine and pass rush vote because I Know you've got to hurry up and catch up\nYou know ah Chris building joining us right now Fox News Sunday he from salon Kelvin Washington and of course because the Packers are the biggest name in an air and Rogers is obviously the biggest name when it comes to build the seas we'll talk about them but I Do want to get back to the winning team alliance about do you what do you know what I have no relation with them anymore okay none um\nOnes that we have to leave with getting out of the day is found himself to be the steaming on the edge of a super star receiver here goes for almost a hundred yards today and a touchdown and Matthew staffer seems to be very comfortable with him\nOn the other the trust that develop twin quarterback papers and why they're so effective is I mean we can go through all that and we can have an argument of the vet trio wide receivers in the league and I think you can put Marvin Jones going hey\nIn Kenya golladay up with anybody but can you make stuff catches he really work hard at his job I mean for extra time man and he's probably one of the most improve players from year one year to that I've covered so far this year\nAt the end of the game we can get another yard he could have got they live with every five or E. R. let's just go forward right let's just go for it and this is how you become part of the team right you won't\nGuy you won't find them guys to talk to you in the locker room this is how this is how you become now now I have an image of them walked around what's that what's that going to what's going on at like ... ... from a big bang on Monday and it's\nLike excuse me I can I help you where you you can't get sixty three or if you go you got married his hearing told me is he in a club the night he in the club\nShirt all start our own account standing on the couch shirt off guy that got planting them ... you know I don't even ... gold or whatever they're wearing these days\nYeah plotting to fight and it was when you were still play I were to go back to go yeah we're back to yellow gold because I think even roads go to the kind of we're all yellow will no I wasn't a jury guy anyway had a little bit more class than that uh Bush told a Rolex is not classy now\n[laughter] but yeah Rolex in class but just a plain Jane yeah well now you're right that's the case they're not doing that right oh hey a Vikings down to the eagles looks like about two or three are lining up to twenty seven seconds left in the second quarter or they're gonna try to put some points up on the board here will stick around for another minute or so before we break but\nThe guys there's somebody you remember that just went hard in the club or they don't like the guy that just you were just they were known were tearing up a club standing or couches buying up all the bottles\nYeah I mean I [noise] my whole career as a guy like that this guy but then every locker room yeah and then five locker room do I want I Want some\nStories on that because it's so back in the end zone ooh Adam feeling touchdown avid now there is a flag it looks like it may be way up as late as a defense of pass interference okay you're trying to do that oh okay what do you give that they're out of ten that dance reformers\nRight there the fact that he had the nerve to do it it gets in eight okay just for doing it and it looked like he was going to beat I'm not sure what beat was playing [laughter]\nWe don't have sounds so is it was definitely on be great catch from him great throw by Kurt cousins and don't forget about their trio receive an amateur e oh but they're not on your defeat in your point that we've come up with like five trio and I said the best was rare okay well I mean you can have them\nWith the ... the enemy right All right well the rams deepest and trying to stop the Seahawks now we'll give you an update on all of these games and some of the games will be a ... that happened earlier come back and hit them next Fox Sports radio\nThey leave in ... no [laughter] no hammering clay\nHenry [noise]\nScreen [laughter] heart pounding action\nIt your than on them and we talk about it right here\nFox Sports radio\n... when did it become OK for men to be lazier softer fatter we need to bring the men of this country back to greatness and it's easier than ever with age list male Macs a patent pending formula with an agreement that helps boost your total testosterone\nPromoting greater increases and muscle size and twice the reduction of body fat percentage that uh\nAnd in the bedroom take your manhood to the max by trying your first dirty diaper bottle free shipping and handling not ten days not Fifteen days for the full thirty days supply free when you text the word\nMan to Seventy nine Seventy nine Seventy not\nFinally a formula that boost total testosterone if you'll results with age ... too intense please decrease use for your free bottle text\nMad to Seventy nine Seventy nine Seventy nine text M.

M. B. C. dot com\n\n\n[noise]\nMaybe we're still getting they weren't WB the there are Panthers radio network and he mentioned get no sixty three are game winning ... sixty three ...\nStabbing me at least sixty another six five maybe sixty eight Yahoo is no good no like you are you going to goodness gray is a so they get a big big a big kick in a big win for their for the Panthers\n... that's what I go on and on about kick you do actually write rising early I rant and rave because I've been I've been on both sides Ive been\nElated you know a kicked it gets to the super bowl and I've been disappointed that ... that\nThey they just made a left turn like I'm like where are you going the ball is merging onto the freeway instead of going through the up right so I've been on both sides of it but the fact of the matter is\nThe relationship between the players and the kicker is are completely separate everybody else is in the foxhole\nHe's sunbathing owned or out of the top of the foxhole would pastries in in drinks\nOkay or get Polanski so none of the matter is we don't care if he's got this Sunday then or whatever if he does his job right because in our minds that's where he needs to do\n... game winning field goal but if he doesn't do it that you need to get your butt down here in the foxhole with us because your trip it\nSo that's how I feel about ... today Joseph the no\nThat's what that's that's what I'm Talking about what you want me to add one more I can ride on the bus which you yeah and that would be the bills getting a big kick is well forty six year game wouldn't feel go\nI'm from I only want to try to how ... how ... mhm forty six Charlotte for the win in a that was a that was a very ugly game\nEighty two yards from Josh Allen total passing\nMarquez Mario was not much better who won twenty nine an interception both of them through an interception are both teams at rush for over a hundred yards but that was just an ugly game two teams and that seems to be the the way of the Tennessee Titans even though they of course they end up losing this one but even in their victories they've been ugly victories\nYou're there by and by the way that the robot just told you the eagles were marching they got all the way down to about the ten yard line of the Vikings they just bubble\n\nCycle is Jay Jay uh-huh yup form of gray hit by Ken Driggs ball pops out fumble recovered by the Vikings and now the Vikings have the ball this is the seventeenth three Vikings up towards into third quarter in that game my only for in the in\nThe little during his recovery from my friends [laughter] they saw [noise] making\nOver our view to best man I'm I'm an\nHour from the board ... and I saw you come in with something was that it was that uh that didn't last weekend that actually is it ah my buddy's ... they may be again a muffin than a pumpkins are in season so the pumpkin ... are you on driving will know are making sure ah [noise]\nAnd then they'll edible up in there if you know what I mean nothing else maybe arms making sure market for it or they're not here when I hear the music you play right now\nSo even my you told me if I was a kicker we wouldn't be the school\n[noise] not if you didn't do your job or\nIf you did your job you rolling in the front\nDuring that we're not going that nope nope nope nope you\nOr did it three charges up all the raiders man let's talk about the charges and I I've been saying that they're better than their record I mean look they had to come\nOut and play a against the the rams that they can't play against the cheese in it and we know over the last couple of seasons if they don't play the cheese they probably pretty much well against everyone else in and fill it rivers has done great against everyone else except the chiefs of you take again that outside of that team in and obviously the best team in all the football and the rams\nThey've not been bad now they're in it and you can never count the chargers out of it are in it that is just a story of the judges\nWhat are they just among get like what else they're just they're not out there that they're they're just\nThey're the chargers we there they fall into the weight in the category 'cause even last year when they started\nOn foreign oil and five and we're just like oh and\nThen they got the one way and against the giants and they lost and and just kept going back and forth and then I said look there are still mc ...\nOne of our other board operators is a diehard\nHe is charger fan where's the Jersey and then like\nAfter a you know the first third of the season\nHe came in here it was like a silver I Want him to lose every game and I said hey hey hey take it easy but\nThey can run the table and then when you know one nine and the role I think there's something like that so you can never count him out and you can never count I mean it gets down to the last game they don't do what they're supposed to do so they back out after they got back in so you just have to wait\nAnd see there's been about a decade of that you're right they're like nine and seven and if they witness but at the other team wins or the other team ties and the other one loses they definitely have that\nThose types of seasons where they don't just take the bull by the horn and just dominate and get in there that obviously a few of those when it was LT Antonio Gates and Philip ... great pass wow\nMm great pass out of their own end zone for Kurt cousins that I don't think he\nYou're talking about a quarterback who's leading the NFL in passing he's distributing the football\nTo others he's helping to soften for Russian Antonio feeling like he's not getting his well he got his today perfect opponent to play the Atlanta Falcons are an absolute train wreck now on the side of the football in their secondary and you know it it was interesting I was asked this morning you know by Brian and Andy about whether this was a\nMust win game for which team would I say it's a must win game for ... and I said it was really more of a must win game for for Pittsburgh because they were coming apart at the seams if you know what I'm saying you know a lot of outside talk again all this controversy they needed to get a win to get this you know to get things going in the right direction their defense do isn't perfect but the audience was clicking Antonio Brown big day\nAtlanta listen they're falling through the center of related is not chemistry Stiller's big win by them today maybe it'll carry on but I'll tell you what to say this AFC North getting awfully interesting with the browns make it a little bit of a move knocking the ravens a game back in Cincinnati coming down from Seventeen oh to take first place in the division of Miami\nWas since you brought it up let's talk about those grounds watching them I said earlier last hour the browns no matter what you feel about them or ... the TV when they're playing they're always in the game they're fighting there ...\nThey could be five in old right now they definitely should be a three one in one or because the game was stolen from them last week so what what do you what do you see\nA and how do you feel about the state of the Cleveland Browns right\nNow is the best part about the brown is this if you're watching the red zone right or you can just watch another game to worry about the Brownsville overtime you don't even on the fourth quarter don't worry about it three overtime games this year and I you know and honestly those overtime games they held fast track to development a Baker maybe right now right you know I I mean\nHe's getting extra snaps and endgame conditions which is absolutely fantastic for him in the future of this team and you know look around still tried to find a way to lose right I mean that game winning feel go at the ...\nPlayers the defense you know Denzel award I mean you've got to think this guy has a real legit front runner for NFL defensive rookie of the year I mean just another interception he plays beyond as yours\nI mean and the nice part two is that you really it's it's a Brown's team that as they learn how to win games like this\nAnd you know it appears a lesson was learned I guess from the raiders game but you know you you want a game an eclipse situation which was huge and I think they're going to be able to build off that I mean you know look for the browns for where they are now I mean you know again compared to a couple of weeks ago when there was still some doubt\nI I feel better about this Brown's team I'm not saying they're playoff team by any means but they're a dangerous team as the ravens found out today\nHey just real quick when update something in the rams in sea hawks game\nThe scored a touchdown Russell Wilson a more but it is under review or because it looks like right now they're saying that there was a possibility that he ran out of the back in the end zone and came back in ... so that plays on a review\nSoon as they come back and let us know if it stands for overturn we'll let you know on the phone right now with our guy Alex ... them\nNFL radio and Alex I Want to get to another team that is a this having some success and and we're not really talking about the much\nUm that is the Carolina Panthers and then of course it was a crazy game sixty three yard field goal to win this well but the Panthers what do you what do you like when you watch them right now and how does this kind of ... from a phrase earlier that kind of this quietly moving along\n... I mean what's been amazing for me is that there are offensive line considering all the injuries that they've had they came in today having allowed only six X. all season and they were paving the way for the NFL's number one rushing off ... uh you know entering this game so to me there was a really positive signs for the Panthers considering the state of that on line\nAnd you know today putting up again getting into the thirties when it comes to point so what's your name the team MVP north Turner so far this season right and that guy comes in he's changed up this off and she looked at him and his completion percentage it's much better than it has been in the past so he's helped can make some strides there also\nThe option and using you know some different breeds owns a concepts like that are that have helped his team and the best part for the Panthers is is\nThey're not even a hundred percent healthy they're getting Greg Olson back reportedly as early as next week which is a huge addition to this off and so I like the Carolina Panthers at what they're doing right now the one thing I worry about them though\nAre they going to be susceptible to injury as a year goes on because of an aged roster that's something we none of us can really predict but right now so far so good and by the way Curtis Samuel I think you're seeing just to start a good things to come from him that that great touchdown run on the catch today trust me I think there's a lot more of that coming from him\nWell what about on the opposite side of the ball the giants they just can't seem to get anything going of course ... doing his thing he's getting his cancer in April one thirty one and a touchdown a day but they only have Fifteen Gary them and they were down early in the game but what do they need to do really good entree would do on a\nHere let's let's hope for the first that sake one didn't suffer major knee injury and then I you know what what some of the speculation is that that obviously limited limited as carries it and I know you know that but\nI mean you know look when and it was a tremendous play I mean when he just took flight getting air to get into the end zone but then landing awkwardly on his knee and again knock on wood that this is nothing that's going to be season ending for him but you know for the giants right now I mean look I think the hotel stuff and it's interesting how Patrick were handled it after the game you know first whoever is advising oh back um junior\nYou gotta you gotta be smarter than this right than doing that type of sit down interview that he did\nWith Josephine Anderson what good\nDid that to outback um junior except put him in a negative spot again you know negative spotlight for giants fans who are tired of the antics negative among the team that trusted that he'd be making smarter decisions\nAfter giving him this big money contract that he had you know throws it throws a you know Eli Manning under the bus you know throws others under the bus with his comments about the way things are being paid are you happy in New York not giving a definitive answer why would you set yourself up with answers like this can you know and it just\nAnd other teammates to impress upon auto back um junior that when you speak like this and you say things like this\nYou get all of us involved and you make all of us talk about you and your comments knock it off it it doesn't help anybody and hopefully someone will get to them because I think that was the biggest stories I mean this is obviously becoming a reconstruction season for the giants but I think you know as big a story is oh do back um junior\nAgain great player great player but of course great teammate that's something else that's in question again\nAlex I don't know if you I think you may have come to the pressure during an interview with little lane I mean you know we ... we the I don't know if you can deny little way you would have done it\nAnd and that doing that as well I mean I I get it you know I understand guys want a brand and maybe they thought it would be a phone interview but man you gotta know going in if if you're if you're putting yourself in this position even if you ask tough questions you really gotta be smarter with the way you're answering them or don't answer 'em at all you know what I mean if you don't want to sugarcoat so it'd\nJust be smart because again it's not just look for oh down his brand whatever but it's the others that this trickles down upon and it makes the giants management you know second guess what are we doing and what's going to make this guy happy and it doesn't do any ... any favors either he's already taking up eating from the public for some really shaky performances of season\nHey Alex and want to go to a real quick actually could touch down to is twenty six to three that charges scored a touchdown twenty six three of the raiders or Philip Rivers to Virgil Green Thirteen yard touchdown pass there's twenty six three um want to go to the jaguars I Know you're in Florida guy so let's talk about the jags to lose to the chief thirty to fourteen\nPatrick go home back down to earth maybe a welcome to the NFL is not going to always be that easy what'd you say\nNo no it wasn't back down to earth the guy's amazing and and you know the the thing that's amazing too is for a second year player the how much in the playbook they have with Andy Reid look at all the different things that they run\nI mean it is very hard for it yeah you know what I mean it's so hard for it\nRight in one way but wrong with my intent I said coming out of the game the quarterback that we're going to be talking about\nIs like ... um I told Bryan and ended up this morning no no no no no we are talking about him but not in the way that I thought because I thought the jags were actually going to win this game\nAnd that's our borders would have a good performance and instead\nWent back to a little bit of the old like ... but they're having a major issue right now it left tackle they're down to the third string of tackle I don't think it's as good an offense without Leonard for that but it was just you know I think that the big let down today it wasn't you know my home soaring one intercepts and I think it was\nThe jaguars defense they talk so much trash or what they're going to do and instead they can't stop this team from rolling up on the scoreboard either and and just posting there they are clearly right now the class of the AFC and it makes it all it makes everyone all the more anxious looking ahead to weeks six chiefs\nPatriots coming up cannot wait\nFor that one game we either in talking about ... we were talking earlier and I was like when you ever you put them in a situation when he had to throw the ball sixty one time you know nothing just going to go ahead and that's\nNot what he does is not what he does you know look if you're able to control the clock run the football effectively and he can I mean I think he's a little more than a gay manager because I think he can make plays in the clouds but yeah you're right if he's throwing the football that many times you got problems and some of it was quite honestly to they fell behind but\n... is an issue and now this hamstring that you know they thought it was going to be okay but when he re aggravated that injury this guy may be out for a couple more weeks\nGood thing for the jags at the AFC South is is pretty darn decrepit and they really really is and you know I don't think anyone's going to be running away with this division over the next few weeks\nAlex Man we appreciate it go ahead and I enjoy the rest of these games thank you and\nAnd I said well you guys are talented right now so I have to go Russell Wilson is because he's the magic man he's still can make things happen and here he is right now keeping it seem it gets the best team in the league in one of the best defenses in league right now twenty four tight\nYeah he he definitely has a lot on his plate I mean they're the six more him or Aaron Rodgers and rain and wind Roger and Roger's because Aaron Rodgers has had more for longer\nRunning game in a great defense so he was able to learn and he was able to have success Aaron Rodgers ... and he's like hey they're like you're so good you just make it happen\nI he's the he's the football versus liberal on with the person that I heard about half of the Cavaliers to me where it was like hey LeBron can you win a championship or booby Gibson yeah they\nAll right Alex you might have ... you might it became to go with that [laughter] I Do it again last day out of my head like how did you know just say something like that you ... you might see then you ruined it by gave me like of being an word okay let me get a word it just it just I felt vegan or write\nOr my weekend Monday through friday I use big words okay not I'm a weekend beacon is

cash\n\n\n\nLet's see the light of sci fi there was one of those it's called the ... with the rats or if it was actually a good call but I Want to this year Russell Wilson I mean I'll take that if you've only completed twelve packs just three of them were touched\nI'll take that that looked a little\nI missed the call humid yeah you you make a day or whatever that's five yard well see I don't get the new life for instance on the thirty five yard line\nAnd no they don't score but it's only first and goal from a guinea about the one yard line so I was looking like they're going to score and again Cardoza fourteenth sticks in that game\nFourteenth six cardinals average scores since the was it the first quarter when we were talking about just Rosen and being able to do some things early no they scored a second quarter to so they haven't scored in quite some time that's just an ugly game one way in between the two teams\nYou're you're starting quarterbacks or both of them route overdrawn both gone is is this is not the game you'd want to see right now no it's not they I Wonder if they offered I buy like a free hotdog a free beer if you come to the game\nDid these were two teams there ... expected [laughter] expected\nYou know to do some things we had David Jonathan coming back for the Arizona Cardinals you got to you know high draft pick and Josh ... who's now plane and then you had a Jimmy G and all of the pieces you added for San Francisco and\nYou know injuries and things just not working out as as planned puts us in a situation where\nYou know you lose your first round a draft pick and you're running back yeah him he goes out and\nNow you're just trying to piece it together man trying not to have the first big in the draft again\nWhat what they're trying to do is also get an end zone and it looks like they did he dropped it oh well way you can drop that now is the way back to it right at the tide and I mean literally between the eight and nine so much so that everybody kind of stop like oh you must have you know such tiny somehow he dropped that\nLook at this look at the sea from no way I mean put it right on the numbers you can drop\nThat no you can't draw up that that's not what I said well I'm going to drop in you can drop it and then you can go still insurance\nOr you can go still he's\nThe game they like to go forward fourth in one fourth\nAnd go from the one I should\nSay CJ ... caught it touched down\nWhich should have been a touchdown or earlier and I'd have to go for two they do have to go for two\nTo tie this game up against the cardinals still plenty of time for the Cardozo six minutes fifty one seconds\nWe'll wait for the two point conversion to see what happens there again other games going on right now you at sea hawks do with the ball oh Russell Wilson ... that a dominant Demick is again ... said that earlier\nWe saw that last game or with the Vikings where endemic ensuing air and Donald they came to play right at the right time yep\nGetting a couple of sex late in putting that games are just you know to to bed so it looks like a dynamic in suicide and they put him on the outside and the words that lady that went viral ain't nobody got time for that and the triumph of the time for and Dominic ensue coming out of odd side and they're not allowed to be\nSwitching them up on me yeah that's not what you want in life\nTo point conversion no good Chandler Jones bats down in the past he's had himself a game I saw him you get a a sack earlier bats are two point conversion there so\nThe game is still fourteen turtles fourteen the forty niners twelve with a little over six minutes left in that game the other guy is still within one score is Vikings up six over the eagles twenty fourteen right now and the Vikings do have the ball\nWith seven minutes in about twenty seconds left [noise]\nYeah I I expected eagles to come up with on a better show you know so a credit to the Vikings defend getting after ... showing other good yeah yeah and ah you know like I said\nDoing great in fantasy football today but I my ... an awful terrible goodness gracious does a great\nI I don't know how he got a couple of times Caruthers\nTrue well then you're saying as if he has a team right now or know what I'm saying is this kid is the fighter I'll give it a nice way if you go and pay somebody pay a fighter\nHe's been getting hit but he's been making some big time clerk gyros as a huge play right to come on out of him and how to\nDo and have a nice collection going today they really do are looking at the stats right now for Kirk Cousins the eighty four million dollar man two hundred and Seventy five yard touchdown but as you mentioned some of the plays may not show up in the highlights but there have been key plays a key drives going um and he and he's made some big place doing\nSo and then in the fact that they don't have delving cook I mean that killing them you know it that is that supposed to be that bill call we saw what he meant to the team last year before he got hurt and not to have him this year [noise] just a whole missing piece to that off and blood Kirk Cousins is due grind in and pushing\nAnd are trying to get this team to five hundred at least\nIn in that division I mean the bears are thinkers sitting that what three in one but we're still the bears you know and it still young quarterback and Mr basically so if you're ... or they'd be the lions at two in three or the Vikings if you're able to pull this out and go to two two and one I mean you still feel as though you have a chance in this debate always\nAnd you can see right now people get excited about some games that would be happening in just a little bit your Sunday night game you've got to Dallas and Houston will get you ready for that at the bottom of the hour here um and then going over to this uh the eagles and the Vikings the eagles right now are marching\nUm they have the ball they're marching down there's twenty three to fourteen trying to make something happen\nBreaking news Cooper cup joined a brand new cooks and concussion protocol hoped to of their trio of receivers is out now it's all on woods I'm I have a\nNew cooks as my leverage the rumor fantasy football and\nYeah that's a that's a that's not good for you but I actually well I guess I did that all wrong a would be Brennan cooks in real life okay it relied on rather bumpy your fantasy right now you from however uh if you're the rams I mean and and what did I mention you earlier off the air demand the rams do not utilized tied in\nYour ... and you said rightfully so they have so many options of weapons\nThey don't get too old but I'm Wondering now if the rams are gonna have to find a way to use some of these have been some other reason\nBut they did at a field goal or so it's thirty three thirty one was about six minutes left in that game ramps up over the sea hawks it to a back and forth ... you know a fair this is the first time someone has scored in the last probably with six positions but\n... vouched down right to score right open the points are twenty three to fourteen again Vikings over the eagles eagles with a ball midfield they've got a they're under the two minute warning now so they grabbed the score quickly here and then hope to get it on psychic or as you've got about a twenty yards completion\nTo hurts from Carson went so the clock is ticking under about a minute forty for them again down now I got the score quickly score a couple of times here but you're right the Seahawks reds game and this ... this is a fun and exciting game this is what you'd want\nA ... it's over a hundred plays between both of them they have over eight hundred yards of total off in a in the currently fifty four points recruited to ... go this is this shootout um who team's not known for shootouts but hell I'm enjoying it\nFor sure and you know what this reminds me of this is why people keep asking me are you I'm sure asking you like how do you beat the rams or what what's the what's the way to beat the rams look they're the best the most complete team and all the football\nBut one way is to put the game in the hands of jak golf at the game so if you're also will sit here and whether it be a field goal whether it be obviously you will prefer a touchdown\nWe haven't really seen jerk golf has to do this under pressure you know two three minutes left in the game he's down to score and so the the sea hawks are definitely in the place now they can even just put the if Phil go up on this board to where we have to see Jerry golf\nWay the game and as you mentioned without two of his top receivers and see\nIs is really the consistency of the running game today thirty one or cares between all parties a hundred and eighty a yard so that takes so much pressure on Russell Wilson he's only at Eighteen basket or attempt\nYou saw for Eighteen hundred and forty or fifty four yards with three touchdowns so you can see the direct correlation with success scoring\nAnd them being able to move the chains have third and manageable by running football\nInterception by the way five turnovers for the forty niners they just do an interception or that is five turnovers none they're trying to make sure you get back in this thing and see if they can find a way to pull it off but that's not going to happen and they just through another interception that was just a bad bad bad past\nFive turnovers man cardinals up and it looks like they're going to go ahead and win this one to get his Twenty one to twelve\nOr three forty eight left they're going to probably run the ball out not to mention there on a they're almost in the red no ooh Russell Wilson and lock it or on the same\nPage today Carson Winston Carson way back in the end zone touchdown is it hurts I couldn't see what was yet yeah but it serves touched down for the eagles I'm assuming they're going to\nTake the extra point right down twenty three Twenty one and they go for the auto they only got one time out its admitted nine left\nBeautiful passed\nIn the past that's the same pass we saw Kirk Cousins do before I think was before halftime to win back in the end zone to ah to dealing\nA man when you got it you got it well they got it they did get it we'll see if they get the extra point here and what they'll do of course the un psychic there and see if they can get this Super Bowl chairs man I mean they had a couple of games mix falls you know\nWhat backups there's going to be either going to be guys were some days will have a good day we were fitzpatrick right yeah fits magic for the first couple of two or three weeks then all of a sudden bad last week or so\nThree Twenty one one oh nine left\nI'm assuming they're going to kick the costs are going to take this on psychic will or will tell you what happens there going back to this rap Seahawks gang\nRent a sea hawks are on the move is currently a second and third team there in their own territory\nOr they're in the rams territory the only thirty five yard line or going in and off\nThat's a nice run as your in your invention\nThey're not just making it'd be about Russell Wilson no they're not and it's helping my Davis there with a five yard run but ah I don't know what the caller holding on the often so that that doesn't help which means it probably going to go to Russell Wilson now for sure\nAnd I pretty much back from back out of field goal range um right now so now it's second and twenty two\n\nAh yeah sly hold on endemic literally it took a little bit it's a little bit but he would have definitely made a tackle being held him so he had a little bit I mean it's just the dynamic ensues arm yeah that's pretty Big Love your leg they'd do it really does look like my leg looks like ... ... ... it was on looks\nAnd ... on them and I didn't tell them a leg although I I'm I'm with you\nBecause they may but you know but I'll take that that will be the only way to look at it got down again and then I mean all his arm came fit in skinny jeans I'm it gets to arm is is it's much more cut up there my leg goes I'll take that I mean I don't know it's kinda weird I don't know what you're I don't know what the cuts looked like but I'm just saying first of all have you know these are skinny\nAs they would do they fit got him into but then I get boys deported respect me like that the okay\nJust because you just made fun of me a moment ago because\nYou can put your back to the wall and your lace can touch the desk here and I can't do that first of all you don't need to be\nShort shaming people that's the problem you're short shame if people\nAround these short shaming scheduled offended by that state and yeah it's making me feel bad that I'm only ...\nI did on I Would not have chose to be five foot eight no not at all okay let's go outside kick this guy looks like the I think the Viking carry Adam feeling a hit them\nA kind of bounced off but he was able to ah to recapture the ball there and there'll be able to and that's your favorite formation I'll I'll get your Lyman ballgame victory formation ballgame blouses blouse\nGame plan it makes sense too because it's Minnesota as you said that yeah now that we're talking about for instance you know the rams need to do is go I mean the Ramsey a\nUm\nWho they just said I'm the eagles the eagles me to do is go purify themselves in the waters of lake Minnetonka that I'm so you might know ... you're listening to evaluate I'll tell\nYou this print stories for training and of course we'll keep you updated on his thirty three thirty one rams over the Seahawks game with a few minutes left um\nSo I go to this journalist conference every year and this is maybe two years ago three years ago it happened to be in Minneapolis and so we're there and we're you know how the good times great convention and then all of a sudden they say hey they kind of keep it a secret they say\nWe're going to Paisley Park\nFor instance compound were like oh okay but they didn't tell us what we're doing is at a concert is it is it a meet and greet is it just we're going to just party like what is going on\nIt's all the rest of the day we go out to local restaurants downtown Minneapolis and the and the waitresses would say oh you guys are going up there oh yeah we've been up there apparently prince we'll just get felt frisky\nAnd we'll just tell people go spread the word and took a party and they were literally just go and just people say hey color for instance compound to just be like ... like a secret colored tabs on the shoulder\nAnd so we get up there and they would not let us even bring our phones on all the buses we had to leave our phones at your in your room\nNo phones no there's no that we get there is this massive compound and we get in and all of a sudden you\nIn other words we're starting to wears prince what's going on we're going to see and what are we gonna do this and all of a sudden a purple cloud came from the top of the building or purple or purple crowd at least that's what I saw okay I could have been mistaken but a purple cloud two beautiful women come down and then there's France\n[laughter] they're all going crazy and it comes down and got his little Cain and the beautiful women and he comes out we're going crazy I'm not gonna lie where you ... I was screaming okay I Will be honest with you ... you\nKnow is it like a a man screaming like a a ... screen like it was like oh\nIf they made that to point conversion would have been a ... it would have been a walk on yeah one one thing I Can't exactly um but it looks like they're going to fall and this came out to get back to you being a hero here was\nOr wasn't about that are doing brown who was the starting left to add yeah for the uh Houston Texans he and his wife ... radio personality out there yet they're brown were loading up trucks from Austin\nAnd driving to Houston so I came out and I drove I loaded up the drugs and drove it and then we deliver to the places it needed to be\nA delivered and it was I mean in that the same time to do wide and his his people were doing the same thing it was just so much need happening out there was devastating who was devastated on what was happening out there and just to be in that environment and see people\nUh who lost every thing these people who live paycheck to paycheck they lost everything all the kids at every close to ... anything they had it was gone and just to try to bring a mile or have some type of help in that situation\nYou know it so I say that the page age what Jay Jay y idea was huge so anybody was talking about oh I don't like this cookie cutter Captain America thing then you need to look at yourself in the mirror\nI I I don't have a problem with it um he ended up again and he did have a little of looking at me I don't want to tell you about me but look at me\nThat Prescott does sound watching you get it for another decade who you want\nA ... I think he has more of a a than that but I think you have more tools and more ... than that ... got to follow the quarterback and you'll be good with them for ten years but everything has to be right for that to happen is in and that's what we're seeing now\nThe shah and watch it on with you he reminds me more of the Russell Wilson as I can make it happen versus that it seems like we all need to make it at\nThe John watching seems like a guy who had that magic he can once again for you both of these seeds desperately needed when at the cowboys in Texas that's just Sunday Night Football match up so enjoyed that coming back it is your MVPs and ask next box football Sunday smokes mores radio [noise]\nAnd that will be the thing goes\nOff of it coming from the city and\nYou know home made the right here on sports radio\nIf you suffer from E.
