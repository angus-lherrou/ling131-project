and forty five and low sixties on Tuesday will be two there was a storm system arrived a meteorologist Dan holiday on I talk one oh six point seven\nRight to be pets and the more I'm watching how this whole thing is develop\nMine's me of LeBron last year in Cleveland tore you realize that's pretty much all day got\nThat's it it's it's it's a one man show it's Rogers and you just hope we can do enough to get you enough when to try and get you in the dance because if they get into dance one great player does make a difference in the NFL playoffs and Rogers is an all time great\nSo you can get there you got a shot but the problem is will you get there\nAnd we've seen it over and over and over again that he gets let down either by the organization or the coaches or the teammates and listen you hear the stories Rogers is a pain in the ass to play with\nPeople hear those stories they hear the is not the greatest he made in the world and its conflicted by some other teammates who have spoken out and defend it in but regardless\nHe's a fantastic player this was a need to have a game that Green Bay should have one on the road in LA\nIt was the healthiest he had been all season coming off a by week they were dealing he's developing chemistry they\nRan the ball a little bit the defense played really well but of course something went wrong systematically there's something broken almost every game with Green Bay and Rogers can only do so much to dig you out of enough holes you saw the first week of the season\nRainy and I were on the air first week of the season Rogers led the Packers on that fourth quarter comeback that had little to do with Mike mccarthy and all to do with Aaron Rodgers just making plays on one leg and he was fantastic\nGuys were getting open there was a couple of blown coverages but Aaron Rodgers made enough plays and he was brilliant like you'd expect him to be and then you saw him against the forty niners on Monday Night football Green Bay probably should have lost that game to CJ bath or to back up and the ...\nOut Doug I'm Out of a hole and they got that when the problem is that's the forty niners\nAnd today was the rams\nSo you can't just expect him to do everything against teams like this it was like LeBron in eastern conference LeBron and east he could be the only one to do anything and you could go really really far\nBut once he actually faced a real team who's got layers to their talent then you get exposed\nLeBron got to the finals and what ended up happening a teammate let him down JR Smith didn't know the time he didn't know the ... he didn't know where that what the hell was happening in the middle of a playoff game and of course he got let down\nAnd the cats were blown out so the more I'm watching this the more it's so obvious to me that he's all day got\nAnd unless they play perfect around him they've got no shot\nAnd you saw that be exposed on Sunday against the rams in a game Green Bay should have won they out played the rams he was better than Jared golf and they come away with a loss the other thing I noticed about rams Packers\nWhat are the most important things that you need in the playoffs it as far as home field goes if you've got home field what are the biggest advantages you've got obviously we know talent that's that that's number one we get all that but there's other circumstances that play into this\nOne of them is your crowd how loud are they how boisterous are they like that's a big advantage that's what makes home field home field the support you're going to get the other is the elements\nThere's a reason for a long time when Tampa Bay would go on the road in the playoffs Tampa Bay which struggle because they'd end up playing it Green Bay\nDrew Brees his first trip to not have the title game got blown out by the bears I was at that game temperatures were in the teens it was snowing the saints looked like a shell of themselves because they were outdoors like so the elements play into it it's also the crowd\nYou see a sea hawks game one of the biggest upsets in playoff history\nWas the Seahawks beating the saints in Seattle the crowd had a lot to do that you go to Fox for all you've got a home field advantage you go to Heinz Field you've got a home field advantage you got a ... you got a home field advantage you know you don't have a home field advantage\nThe dumpy coliseum in LA\nIf you watched that game it felt like a pack or home game like there were Packer fans there than there were rams fans\nIt was the same thing on a Thursday night game middle of the week when you would assume middle of the week kind of a tough game for fans to travel to write you know like if you're an NFL fan and you've got weekends off you're probably not taken off work so you can go watch a Thursday night game somewhere\nAnd they were outnumbered by Vikings fans I Know somebody who is at the game who said before the game the split was Ninety ten percentage wise Vikings to rams\nSo you watch on Sunday and you're staring at that game earlier and you're listening to the noise and you would have assumed that it was at a bigger limbo field with with a crappy are paying job because somebody forgot the uh or remove the USC logo from the night before and so if I'm a visiting team\nOr I'm another team in the NFC they're talented the rams are probably going to end up with a home field advantage throughout they are definitely up to this point the best team in the NFC but I'm not scared at all\nTwice during the world series I reached out to a certain cast member on the show and didn't get nothing\nBack that's all right not saying the name that but I'm not new Jonas no definitely not me no end will respond absolutely so what I Do you

crazy day in LA for sports all of that that will have for us throughout the course of the show I'm All right so there are certain times where you cannot know a single thing about somebody\nYou can not know a single thing about what their life is like what they've been through what their issues are what their problems are and you can sit and you can watch them having never met them before and you can just\nTell you can just tell what's going on\nYou ever seen a couple that your nose in the middle of a fight at a restaurant you can just tell they're not happy with each other never seen him before\nNever seen him never met him never had a drink with them never smoked weed with them or never shared a cigarette never shared an Hoover nothing never seen these people before in your life and if you guys are in the same restaurant you can look across the room or look across the bar and you can tell [noise] ooh something's going on over\nThere that's that doesn't seem like they're on good terms you that's happening right now in the NFL\nAll seeing it we're all witnessing it and and watching it it's happening in the NFL and it's happening in Tampa Bay\nWhere the Bengals beat the buccaneers\nOn Sunday thirty seven thirty four now Tampa Bay made a great comeback in Cincinnati it was brilliant the comeback was was fantastic in and actually looked like Tampa Bay had a real shot at stealing one on the road in Cincinnati against the against a decent AFC team the reason they had to make it\nIt all by throwing for interceptions and getting benched\nSo he gets benched who's got to come in Ryan Fitzpatrick you remember him sits magic he was the talk of the NFL world the first couple of weeks lighting up the league and then he had a bad game\nAgainst a good defense in Chicago and Seamus Winston after his suspension was called into duty and stepped in to take over the starting quarterback role\nAnd since then I Believe this status correct I Believe that James when since drone nine interceptions since then\nSo Ryan's with Brian Fitzpatrick steps in those eleven to Fifteen throws two touchdowns zero pigs any ties the game late and then converts on a to point conversion\n... sometimes you don't really need to know the playbook you don't really need to know the schemes you don't really need to know anything just like that couple that you don't really need to know to know that there's something going on and there's an issue there you don't need to know anything about the Tampa Bay buccaneers you don't need another edition of hard knocks you need zilch\nNo more intel\nAll you need to do is open your eyes watch and we're all seeing the same\nThing\nThey would rather be on the field with Ryan Fitzpatrick than James Winston\nIt's obvious you can see it\nThe mood of the huddle or the vibe everybody excited you remember one dish on Watson made a dish on a Jackson made the comment\nAfter Ryan Fitzpatrick was role in those first couple of games\nTo Sean Jackson could have been a really good teammate to Seamus Winston but he decided to be a really good teammate dry and fitzpatrick made the comment there is no way you can bench Ryan Fitzpatrick right now and James went to this supposed to be the franchise quarterback in Tampa Bay\nObvious you don't have to know anything about Tampa Bay\nYou just watch and they look happier with him out there the often looks better with him out there since dirt cutter is taking over the often says never looked better than when Ryan Fitzpatrick was quarterback it's clear\nI'm not saying Ryan Fitzpatrick is a better quarterback but for that team right now it is a no brainer\nHere was James Winston after the game\nMumbling but it was not about me is my fault that we were in their position you had to make a decision and his came in and fathers till ... respond to a great way and we came back and talk to a game of and gave us it was a ...\nI just know that I have to fix this problem and I will on oil will it don't come with being being scared of it comes with looking in a mirror of taking a a loan or the look at myself and bouncing back from this person\nSo after the game was over I reached out to somebody that is pretty close to the organization somebody who would know that wouldn't be asked me and I reached out to them and I send them a tax and I said call me crazy\nBut they look better and they look happier with Ryan Fitzpatrick on the field and it's just somebody closely affiliated with the organization they wrote back to me you're a hundred percent spot\nOn it is Knight and day difference not even close and\nI I tried poking around a little bit more okay so what's the planet quarterback because they're cut her was getting grilled who's going to be the starter and he believes and again this is somebody who is close to the organization he believes\nThat Ryan Fitzpatrick is going to get the gig moving\nYear at least until he struggles down the road and they go back to James Winston I asked long term what about the future what's the planet\nBlow things but this is where this whole situation gets tricky and it goes back to what they did several years ago Tampa Bay made them move a couple of years but now it's three four years back where they decided to part ways with ... Smith\nBecause they wanted to keep ... they wanted to keep their cutter there was some thought the dirt cutter might be a head coach and Kennedy elsewhere and Jamieson Winston was so valuable to the organization\nThat they decided to keep your cutter is head coach promote him so that he can continue to build this continuity in in the relationship and could continue to blossom with James Wednesday and it was all about the development of James Winston\nBut the problem is they've got to make a decision on both they're not a playoff team especially in that division so now we're talking about a head coach who's been there a few years now\nWho's got no playoff appearances and it's going to end up with a losing record at the end of the day and you also got a quarterback who's going to cost you quite a lot to keep around\nAnd it just depends on which way this organization go so that's why I asked the guy and the source that I Know from Tampa Bay I said listen what what's the plan is it cutter is Winston did they part ways with both\nAnd he said I just think it's too close it's it's too soon to tell I I ... I Can't it's too soon\nBut he said you're you're a hundred percent spot on your watch the team they rally around pitch Patrick it's a different vibe the huddle the energy the excitement the way they mob him after he throws a touchdown\nIt's not like that with James Winston I actually would argue Mike Evans and Jackson and some of those big receivers those threats down field or better with fitzpatrick and and you could make the case that James ... got a top five to top eight armed that in the league arm town believe you can make an argument James ...\nDamn thing about them you need to know nothing about that organization to know that when you're watching this team when he gets on the field it's just different men it's different it's like they they enjoy him more they enjoy his company more they they enjoy playing with him more\nAnd so when I reach out on I got a confirmed then you start to look ahead to the future because you've got to make decisions and Tampa Bay\nYou do do you believe they're cutters the guy okay no you don't believe he's the guy okay so you're going with Seamus Winston then then you've got to go ahead and scrap it all over again because you need to worry about developing James Winston I almost wonder if Tampa Bay looks at it like this we roll it sits Patrick\nWe try and find somebody in the draft and we part ways with Seamus Winston issues off the field\nWay too much money we're gonna have to give the guy let's go on a different direction and figure it out with that also then you've got to check your ego we took him with a high draft pick our we conceding that we blew that one up or are we conceding that that we mess that pick up look at Jacksonville Jacksonville is doing the same thing with ...\nSo that's an interesting one to watch

I think we all sort of got them confused I'm ... and we Brady and I've talked about this\nEarlier this year when it came to the Cleveland Browns I think that um that people confused good with better when it came to the browns because it was almost like after the browns won two games people thought they were good team\nThey weren't there not a good football team there just better than they were\nSo when you're watching this team go on the road and get manhandled by Pittsburgh and you're watching Baker Mayfield take a beating and be noticeably limping after a game and then you've got to coaches who can't seem to coexist and are are not seeing eye to eye\nIn just a moment from now here on Fox Sports radio [noise]\nA guy sent a tweet in or this according to pro football reference Jamieson Winston leads the NFL in multiply interception games sixteen since two thousand Fifteen ... second [laughter]\nOh my God you could throw a ball with your feet and your back turned and have better stats and that that is disgusting but\nUm he's probably going to get a long term deal there in Tampa Bay that's other stuff works I'd uh so I did promise you that we're going to take you lived in the world series uh this is a man who ... reached out two\nHours ago and it took him hours to respond as we were getting big time by the one and only or you just say here Steve is\nNot true I I just turned on my phone after for fish\nOkay so let me ask you this I I just saw Judy Martinez ... lose a baseball in the outfield what happened was it the lights\nNo it it goes to the age trying to play the Steve I'm not kidding\nYou know they can't hide forever there were a couple of nights ago there were two times or the manager came out while the Boston or out in the field\nSwitch places a couple of times they did that just to get them out of harm's way but as I say they can't hide in forever and so he just\nLost a ball in right field held up his arms couldn't see it and then ran to the warning dragged out in time but of course the Dodgers left the mad at third during the fourth inning it's too on Boston and lead chance the clams and uh\nI was expecting more Boston fans here tonight quite honestly it's not that there are especially on down the right field line there are a fair amount and they were very vocal and the first thing but with the way things late last night for the Dodger and and they're both that I was expecting a little more\nUh Steve just say you're with us here on Fox Sports radio see by national updating your normally I'd on during the show but he is at the world series at Dodger Stadium he is are embedded reporter there our correspondent here\nFrom Wall to wall World Series coverage we can only do this I'm speaking of hiding we can only do this and Brady is not here because I don't want to school I'm On my baseball knowledge you know what I mean\nJust like your school band butter on your Gulf no they don't look at it it's just the way it's gotta be sometimes up they'll\nLet me ask you is because you were there you actually joined me on my highly rated weekend overnight show after the seven an hour in twenty minute extravaganza a couple of nights ago slammed mornings ago um then you were there\n... in last night's game and now you're hearing this not tonight's game describe the difference between friday's Friday nights game the reaction afterwards and Saturday nights\nGame [noise] well the closest we've gotten to anger and the crowd was the night that last night it was not quite the type of anger as when you garbage was on the ground in game seven a year ago but it was starting\nTo get that and to find a way speaking of the Eighteen any game yet I'm seated next\nBen mallard for the first few weddings I had to come down to the threat by a quieter place but Jeff I can can earn the band was in the ballpark during the betting friday night or a bowl of it than mellor prepping for his show denied by the way\nTo me because I said he had some people here at the stadium so apparently he was with them and they don't want to be marches good\nNow okay well here here for people that are just tuning in this is what happens Steve joined us after the seven hour extravaganza because that was one of the craziest not I'm not and see if I'm not exaggerating when I say this one of the craziest or most bizarre sporting events I've ever seen not baseball not postseason\nNot ... I I don't know that I've seen anything like that that went as long as it did and ended the way did any of all the performance all of that\nAnd so you joined us and I asked you I say a ... tell me a big name media types who are pissed off at the game went on as long as it did\nAnd you floated the idea that Ben left the\nPress box after a certain point in the game will somebody tweeted at Ben and Ben does this show or does the overnight Monday through friday or on Fox Sports radio and somebody tweeted it banned and said wow Steve just said you're confirming a mile or less I gave them early and Ben made it a point to tweet back and said if you are spreading fake\nNews so that way and so the fact that he ... the pick you out\nAnd said make sure you clear my name when you go on the air tells me that maybe there's more to the story Steve\nNo it just Fox on Fox Crime ... the way\nIt was a bad person living here but it started bad for the Dodgers even before the first thing that I you know those button Clydesdale horse they're yeah they're here tonight and they were\nWriting around the field all the way around the field on that warning track and what shouldn't say that there were people writing behind the button\nSales for obvious reasons and I clean up what needed directly in front of the LA Dodger Dog out creek\nThat that's an exact spot yeah you know it's a bad night when a there are six other sporting events in town and you've got a horse taking a dumping the warning track that that's that's good or bad\nThe ... by the way manager David Roberts\nWas not out there it was the bench coach that was out there to represent LA what the umpires before the game which I found very interesting why don't we had\nTo ceremonial first pitch is the one by the sponsor whites are the backstop and then the one by or this or was dropped and went through the capturing legs and then the game starts and her eyes or gives up its run home run in the first five\nUh it's really a hot now is it a nervous crowd or there was like what what's the or how much can you get a ride match in Jersey for in a in a merchandising job I mean it's the final game everything's on sale\nThat's right yeah fire sale that was the bullpen last night you know there will I assume rhyme as you could be retiring shortly so I don't know if they actually bothered to make up right and that the Jersey although I haven't seen any other time Jim told me Dodger Jersey's\nActually being worn in the crowd and other seasons in the Dodger for like three weeks\nSo I'm In my book I forgot told me was a Dodger all by myself\nBut also underwear that by the way I as I Am standing next to the door and the cafeteria at the ... this is the place with the unlimited Dodger dogs and the nachos and the frozen food for hours on the popcorn and on and on and on so\nIf you've never seen a probably a stand sports writer and I can tell you firsthand this is what\nA great man look at the ... next to the food he's got details on the horses in the outfield this is the greatest an interview this show is never done a\nI can add one thing on food is in the post season and it was this way at Dodger Stadium last year since this is a Nineteen sixty two stadiums they use the cafeteria space as workspace to all the visiting media\nNobody can eat actually sit down and eat in there so every media member that covers Dodger postseason last year and this year they get a Fifteen dollar certificate when they enter the stadium for any concession stand anywhere\nWent over ... dollars and all all I Would Rob thanks for the way the confession than I did but uh [laughter]\nOh that's great yeah and plus I mean it's got to be a pretty a pact booze and they're like wherever you go to watch\nIs with members of the media because all the Dodgers media they've got to find places to put their pom pom to go along with their foods I don't know if there's a lot of room in their Steve\nHuh yeah well there are people getting off the bandwagon perhaps after last night I\nI Wish I knew when was the last time in the world series history where gene you six relievers and literally all fixed failed in a row struck them all aspects that product\nBut at the same Robert small it's all day Robert small as\nIt is just as if he's not doing things this is the exact same that the doctor management wanted to put together the fact that they're going to fall short last year and maybe this year\nIt's on them these are the exact types of players and philosophy of baseball but they want and this is what they're getting and so you had against that I see a laid off single and he stands at first base there at the end 'cause they don't like the way they do but they don't feel they don't move 'em over there just playing from the hills\nSyria's latest round of applause received ... if you want to get Steve on Twitter are live studio audience here he's getting ready to give you a roundabout sauce I mean I've you would like to get Steve on Twitter you can\nFind him Tommy ... is where you can find even bigger and he went Dodger question\nIf I may one last item because I actually\nWas you know last pet

night for he and his friends and family to use one of the sweet\nHe knows Tommy ... on back here so they invited me up and here he comes drive and one of those a carte blanche you see the old people and the grocery stores\nEven before the end of the game and it literally only me and Tommy at a concert left over food here in this way and of course anything that's free and involved that's for economy and so then\nWhat do I got here and I'm trying to identify the sandwiches I put one on a flight on board that you got to throw it away\nThat's graves Steve to say here he is either kind man he

happened to happen and you go ... with a home run off ... ...\nClapping after ... home run so I'm assuming that somebody had the over under of two and a half runs in the game [laughter] and bet their paycheck got it because I have no idea what's happening at Dodger Stadium\nMan it was so weird like they read panning audience they were showing off to the red Sox fans in the audience and all of a sudden you see this guy and right next to him as a ... with a Dodgers had just shirt and just clapping we\nThat's great yeah they're like okay you transformer that\nThat is that is a great look or so as we as we have it right now it is the bottom of the sixth inning there's an out\nOr the red Sox are up three to one that they can close out the world series here tonight if they can finish this off David prices pitching really really well\nOff or a guy who came into the postseason are being talked about is somebody who chokes and his record in the postseason was never very good and he had really really bad performances David Price has been phenomenal this postseason he's worked out of the bullpen\nUh he he's coming on short rest and he is dealing tonight out pitching Clayton cursed shot and in an elimination game and if you remember\nIt was David Price who got the red Sox into the world series because he pitched in the elimination game against the Astros so Boston\nIs rolling right now and it's looking good for Boston to celebrate another world series title this time ah at Dodger Stadium so we'll keep you posted on on how that plays out now something that did play out\nIn this game actually took place before the game\nAnd this is what I think is so bizarre that that we do as as members of media and as sports fans the people that we blame sometimes and the people that we put fault in sometimes it just it sometimes it doesn't make any sense to me\nAnd I've said this before they just because you had bad traffic on your commute into work doesn't mean you're date works also got to suck\nFirst and believe it or not you do have a choice and things\nAnd so the idea that Dave Roberts is getting all the blame\nAnd Dave Roberts is the guy that's getting cracked for why the Dodgers bullpen is what it is just doesn't make any sense to me I thought it was bad I thought what I was seeing on social media was bad as far as the criticism of day Roberts Steve just savior\nOur national update anger haired Fox Sports radio he actually joined us live from Dodger Stadium earlier in the show and he portrayed even a worse situation any worse response for the Dodgers manager and\nThe ... by the way manager day Robert ... that that first and his three years and so then later when I had the pregame meeting with the umpires at home plate it Robert was not out there it was the bench coach that was out there to represent LA what the umpires before the game which I found very I\nThink about that this guy is brought you to back to back World Series he can manage it's clear he can manage\nHe he's good at it he's gotten outta back to back World Series but because it's easier to blame one guy than a bunch of guys everybody's pointing fingers uh Dave robbers\n... I I don't understand like why is Dave Roberts responsible for the crummy performance in his bullpen\nIt it goes back to my point just because one thing happens it doesn't mean that other bad things also have to happen\nJust because you get hammered doesn't mean you also have to drive you have choices you got choices it in one thing doesn't lead to another so because Dave Roberts puts can lead Jansen and a six day about uh six out save position that means currently Jansen has to give up a home run in back to back games\nSo because David Roberts trust Ryan Madsen and and puts Ryan mats in in a position to to to get some out Ryan\nDave Roberts fault that cancer my ada gives up a a a base clearing double late in the game that puts the game out of reaching in game for like how is it the Roberts fault at some point blamed the players\nHe's putting professionals in a position to succeed and they're not doing it if Clayton cursed Shaw ends up losing this game in another big time performance guess whose fault it isn't gave Robert's not his fault Clinton curve shows not getting it done in the clutch\nIt's not his fault or the hitters aren't driving in a in runners that are on base that took the Roberts fault it's their fault\nBut like ... everyone looks like it's his attached things Dave Roberts gets he gets boot before the game and then when they go to\nBring the score cards out he's got a sudden somebody else 'cause he doesn't want to get boot again what's happening here and then they paid over after a home run by a Red Sox player and it's somebody in Dodgers gear clapping by God LA has lost their damn minds mad they have lost their minds\nRight [noise]\nAnd by the way to figure out the traffic situation and figure it out on Sunday nights I'm sick of it I'm

obviously\nI think I was in college or remember that one or the summer or so\nI was in a Slayer mosh pit one time everybody talks to them in slavery mosh pits are the real deal oh my God it was like killing each other [laughter] and I I lift some guy up blindsided him because he knocked me over and I needed to get him only to feel better about myself and I'm almost positive I separated my shoulder and I have knock on effects\nBecause he was a lot larger than me but um are we on there\nAre so ah coming up in less than ten minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio normally we do a over under its here on the show we're not going to do over under cars Brady Quinn is not here\nAnd plus we already know how over under his work we do um every single week I usually get Brady a beating he complains he bitches any bones about the results and it's just it's ridiculous so we're not going to do over on ... but\nWe will be doing the scraps in its place it's a fun way to mixing some stories from around the NFL and around sports we have not had a chance to get to um if you are looking for an update on on Sunday Night Football we do have one four year as the New Orleans saints are pulling away from the Minnesota Vikings\nA pick six of Kurt cousins and the saints have a twenty seven Thirteen lead\nOver the Minnesota Vikings under six minutes to go in the third quarter and then in the world series game five they're going to the bottom of the seven the red Sox are the three one series lead looking to close it out and Boston is up for one over the Dodgers\nClayton cursed Shaw has now given up three home runs in this game so you want to talk about two guys playing side by side and having the same reputation how 'bout Kirk Cousins in Clayton ...\nLike on display side by side with the same reputation\nCan't trust them on a big spot can't trust them on a big stage that's been the knock on her cousins\n'cause her cousins has not played well in this game and that's surprising considering Kurt cousins has been really really good the rest of the season he's been great if you just look at current cousins numbers before this game kicked off\nHer cousins has lived up to the contract he's played really well and when you think about just some of the other games that maybe they didn't win ... cousins was in a shootout with Aaron Rodgers in Green Bay and he held his own\nAnd it ended up being a tie and you assume that Kurt cousins had gotten over the hump he even played really really well on Thursday Night Football in a shootout against the rams\nBut here he is throwing a pick six and they are in a bad spot now down to scores under six minutes to go on the third at home\nAnd I said this man I think he's a better quarterback in case keen him no doubt about it but at Minnesota fall short this year her cousins is going to get the blame because he's what's different\nAs opposed to a year ago there are other factors in play injuries a lack of running back death all of that but it's Kirk Cousins who got the big contract and it becomes up small again in a big spot he's going to be the guy to blame same with Clinton courage shah\n... hasn't pitched awful in this game\nHe hasn't pitch bad\nHe's given up three home runs but you know the the most was a two run shot but these held the red Sox aid dynamite off and stuff for runs through seven innings\nThey can't score it's been the issue all year long with the Dodgers they\nCan't drive in runs if it's not a home run it's nothing that is not Clinton Kurdish us fault he's not getting a lot of support but when you go into it with a narrative and you go into it behind the eight ball and you go into it already playing from behind because everybody is\nHas been at other parts in the season they're only going to look at the big spots and so here we are side by side it's the same dude curse shot and cousins the same guy and they're having the same results so far uh Jonah socks Fox Sports radio you can get me on Twitter at the Jonah stocks\nI think that uh I think the PGA Williams pick six I think he went into the end zone at the exact same time JD Martinez tank the center filled went over the walls kinda they must be connected man yeah I ... I think that's a very close yeah them like they're the he crossed the end zone as he hit\nIt's almost like stranger things like it's I think it's the upside down it's like the the same world but upside down a for all you people out there that have never seen the stranger things just forget I said that will go ahead and we'll disregard all that\nI go back to comment on a art so I'm so we do have the scraps are coming up here and a few minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio we'll get to that here but I didn't want to mention is still the Seattle Seahawks who took care of business they beat the lions earlier today a earlier on Sunday\nSeattle after starting Owen too has now won four or five\nAnd you can argue that they're better than the record that they have right now currently which is foreign three they last week one in Denver almost everybody does Denver historically especially the last several years has been dominant weeks one and a week to in Denver\nAgainst opponents I Believe they're sixteen into or Fifteen in one in their last sixteen dominant and that's because of the altitude players aren't in the best shape you go to Denver it you're going to have problems early on in Seattle lost that game and it was close\nThen Seattle last the next game Monday Night at Chicago injuries were a factor but Seattle wasn't out of that game the bears didn't dominate the sea hawks in that game day I'd opportunities there but injuries um ... they were really thin in certain spots in the ... defense was overwhelming in that spot on Monday Night football\nAt home in Seattle and you can argue that Seattle should have won that game they had stopped the rams it was a fourth in one the rams were set to punch and they sent out Jared golf to go forward on Fort down ... they wanted to pump the ball who knows how that game when it turned out\nSo Seattle's been in all of these games and what's funny about this is that the organization made a decision the last couple of years that they were going to ride with Russell Wilson\nAnd they were going to let some of the big personalities go in essence the organization was saying in Seattle we want our team back\nOkay we don't we don't want all the issues all the talk all the off field stuff all the drama all we don't want anymore it's done it's run its course you know you see what's happening in Jacksonville you know the difference between Jacksonville in Seattle Seattle's got a Super Bowl\nJacksonville was a one year wonder and their melting down you've got players running out on bar tab you ... I mean it's just it's a disaster\nSo Seattle and the organization inside a little while back they're going to go with ... Russell Wilson and they were crushed port\nTeammates didn't like Russell Wilson yes what they made the right call marsh on when she was gone he's in Oakland a shell of his former so it's not even playing right now\nRichard Sherman is in San Francisco who cares nobody sort a damn thing from Richard Sherman all year long Michael Bennet in Philly\nSo the bronze not even in Cleveland anymore and you had people running to the defense of Toronto blue after he was fired [laughter]\nOwn six [laughter] I'm Sorry did did he do a great job either ... or send a great job you did and I'm not running for anybody to lose their job but it's not like it's outside the realm of possibility that a team of thinks they've got a couple of decent players and it's played and looked awful this season would want to make a change\nBlack when he got fired I didn't I didn't hear all that because everybody wants to kiss LeBron James he's not even in Cleveland anymore and people still want to\nPoke holes in the Cavaliers organization see because you guys that's where I live Ron left they'll the prime left because he wanted to make fifty five documentaries and TV specials in the first six minutes he arrived to LA you don't want to be there anymore what happens\nLast long but it's just one on a high note have you ever skipped out on top\nOf that list and that's a loaded question um have I accidentally\nAll accident or was it for drinks or dinner or lunch it ... it was for a lot of drinks accidentally\nI skipped out on a tab what city oh which one had to say no no uh or now yeah um\nI haven't done a while uh but but I have done it before okay\nAudience I the reason why I ask is because a few Jacksonville Jaguars players were getting we're getting mad at over ... over the pond and fat they went through a nightclub and they tried skipping out on the sixty four thousand dollar tab\nAnd they were arrested by cops at four AM keep in mind they're there for business when they're taking on the Philadelphia Eagles and you had four players that were there amongst the secondary player safety buried shirt she was the one that kind of accepted the blame for all those Ronnie Harrison journal Wilson and also quarterback DJ hate him\nWhere the four players that were detained failing to pay for a bar tab at the London ranged show club early Saturday morning\nYeah I was gonna say um you know maybe there is a language barrier with the waitress but I realized the game wasn't in Tokyo or a T wanna and that's probably impossible since everybody speaks English um they say it's a misunderstanding sure\nUh I'm trying to figure out how that is a misunderstanding\nWell they're drinking alcohol with a bottle starting at five hundred and Seventy seven dollars at least for champagne and August so man running it but\nWho's I'm going to be the best man at his wedding I was supposed to be the best I think his mom's listening by the way a she probably won't like this but they do bad a lot of everybody's going to get it on the show sorry I'm ...

for me to give them the night off but I did the other guy I Am\nYou know it's it's crazy because a lot of times you get people that haven't really paid attention or follow baseball\nBut I I'll just say this much I don't know if all if all calm\nThe angry mom I don't know if I can can can calm him down just a bit Ernie but I don't think you're going to see a Dodger team that will necessarily knee jerk\nAfter this season I don't think you're going to say it again this is just me speculating here and I guess hypothetically you can say that they still have to get three outs if you want to be glass half full kind of guy but I don't think they Roberts is getting fired\nI don't think I don't think ... gonna I think that\nYou have a better future than the red Sox I mean their starting pitching is going to be deeper than the red Sox I don't even though the red Sox going to resign sale who's going to demand a lot of money I Know Craig kimbrell is not going to probably come back with the red Sox because\nThe red Sox kids sign him and then worry about people like ... beds and Andrew been attendee and and you know what's good avenue of all he was going to be a free agent after this season so and and by the way more heat is could opt out in two more years because he wasn't given the five year deal too many other things to worry about that is why the Dodgers are probably in better shape\nYeah and again I Know that to our buddy Jason Smith has been playing the whole uh ... I was going to opt out and they need to get rid of them because they want that money off the books\nI I think the Dodger organization is going to make sure that crucial retires as a Dodger I'd I'd just I think he's Dodger blue I think that's kind of been a tradition and his organization when you think about names like Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale and\nI I mean just to Fernando the greats retire Dodgers so ... well actually Fernando ... with the cardinals but we don't talk about that around here oh wow where three outs away from the red Sox won in the world series so I have to\nAsk already have you prepared yourself being in the northeast have you ... I mean our our cars going to get ... Dover are we going to have celebrations I mean are you worried about\nI don't know T.

when he was like hey I don't care about that just keep it baseball I'm like you know really just shut up or you discuss the hell out to be but you know a month or two ago it's like a patriots this patriots that\nOh now it's red socks this red socks that and ... and then it's going to be Celtics the Celtics that and Bruins is an Bruins that it it's not really it's it's like the twilight zone you want to you want to poke your eyeballs out with a with adult pencils what you wanted to do\n[laughter] I like this though that just came in from Paul is a at bills mafia thirty to thirty three who says and then army decided to move to buffalo because of all the winning that we do here [laughter]\nGood point Paul what I was ... ... will have a time for the world series as we mentioned we had our operatives Steve the savior out there to cover things for us and we'll check in with him when everything's wrapped up in Boston can crunch this World Series title we assume we assume but we'll keep an eye opener\nEntertaining I gotta tell ya and plus you know when you overcome foreign leads yeah lead changes in great pitching in great editing and um you know I I I thoroughly enjoyed it I Wish I could have been a little bit closer in games but uh that's a score the games have been closer than you say as as you said it has been closer than the final score indicates\nWell and that's that's the hard thing because we do have so many people that will\nMaybe watch a couple of innings and just see a box score and they'll see things like ooh eight to four in game one well that was a that was it three to actually it was a three three game and the bottom of the fifth inning before Boston open it up I mean that was incredibly compelling I could do with this game by game I'll spare you a big fan and did you stay up 'til three thirty in the morning oh yeah\nAbsolutely all year or two thirty your time the good news was is obviously I cover Oklahoma sooner football it's my life and we usually

actually\nEnding it with the shot that he did but that was a ... you know it's it's kinda crazy you don't see nights like that typically in professional sports and now we've had tonight similar to that\nIn back to back seasons what was that game five game six last year between the Astros into ... we were on the air\nFor that that was a crazy came last year and now and fortunately we're going to be on the air for the red Sox winning the world series so we'll we'll get to coming up here I'm depressed by it I'm depressed by it because I Wish if this game could at least are the series could at

five even though there was a little drama in that series or regarding the fan interference which I think we have to revisit now no reason to stay in this celebration for the red Sox in\n... or any kind of funny yeah we'll take your calls Red Sox angry Dodger fan would love to hear from you as well too because I guess you're all stuck in traffic is that what I'm understanding where everyone stuck in traffic is that right on him\nLike well how are you going to get out there you'd be faster walking home then you try to get a you know I I'd a Dodger Stadium\nEight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox will open it up at the bottom of the hour and we haven't even touched on ... which will get you coming up here and just a bit but um\nAnd that was their first title fits nine teen Eighteen and for the longest time you know it's it's crazy to think about uh two with the the patriots in the eighties how they almost ... they were going to be the what the St Louis ... or some of that nature so to franchise is that for those of us who were child children of the eighties\nThat growing up or just disasters and now all of a sudden they're the standard in what the patriots have done we'll talk about that later but only for the for the red Sox now their third world series title\nIn ... pardon me pardon me there for the world series title she you know last Fifteen Years uh oh four o seven two

know and it's it's pretty funny oh by the way Paul points out the Calvin ... bill ... were on and on that last play I Do not have a report on rich get 'em in yeah um but this is what it sounded like with jokes dig Leone in the Boston Red Sox radio network has yet again for the night time\nIn franchise history the red Sox or World Series champions\nOn the top on down and it sounds a one to [noise]\nOr did I\nWow look better you are of course I mean what do you want me to you know what I jumped out here in ... when they come out of the dugout and shake hands with the with the red Sox I I Will do they just go back to baseball they just go back to you know down to their dugout that's it you don't ever the ship\nKind of odd isn't it and you get it in the NBA a lot to horse yeah but uh you know ... ... line them up eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox a brand and brings up a good point right off the top with the ... on Twitter and he says you know the the Red Sox pin was a lot better than all the analysts gave him credit for\nFair enough but ... this is a real simple thing to figure out David Price pitch like David Price will host to in his last three outings not like the David Price that had had what an old for it or not [laughter] over nine and his previous low you know what is the\nWay we asked locally is all forgive another David prices were before they wanted the David Price picked up as women are underway and a close to winning the world series and I'm like what if you don't forgive and that's why he's making two hundred million dollars plus a two hundred and Seventeen million dollars or whatever it is what I mean all for a given this job is supposed to be like\n... you're supposed to go out and take care of business and then on the flipside of that\nI always hate and I'm very guilty of this because again I'm a Dodger fan last year was incredible because the Dodgers hadn't been to the world series since Nineteen eighty eight so getting there was great an incredible series with the Astros had went seven this year the Dodgers won a very good baseball team early in the year\nThey were writing a duty Matt camp that rightfully so one of the comeback player of the year and wants to Justin Turner got healthy and\nThings started to click with or even more Walker bill or whatever he got hurt and he got a healthy as well too I mean\nThat was huge for this team so Arnie before we get to the phones which we'll be right after as David gas gone gets updated the bottom of the hour yeah how are you supposed to feel as a Dodger fan are you supposed to be mad\nAre you supposed to be angry are you happy after missing out for so long you're pointing fingers Dave robbers you pointed fingers Clinton ... or ... and can you believe that they use this dude they picked up at the trade deadline whenever he said I struggled getting warm and then the next night you put them in with the bases loaded and he walks around\nA raider Ryan is just screaming at me like oh you got him in what could possibly go wrong as I said that sarcastically and then they give up the home run on a first of all you can't blame Roberts he took it back to back World Series so what are you ... um I said this is the same thing about John Farrell also was fired from the red Sox\nBefore they hired Corey he didn't take it back to back elites titles\nSo it wasn't like the guy was a bus records the one\nThat took them over the edge you got to that World Series title so I'm not blaming Roberts yeah you know it looks bad but he made one move here would move there\nThat turned out to be wrong especially they move bringing them up if you think that he's the sole reason why the Dodgers lost\nFour games to wonder what team that was better from the very beginning that I mean they they gave up nine runs you gotta ... close it down no matter who you bring on and so no and if you're a Dodger fan I gets frustrated um is what I Would feel like after back to back World Series appearances\nUm I'm a little mad or aggravated but it's certainly not ready to make it a wholesale changes or anything like that and like I said anybody blaming Roberts I think is is a little Ottawa\nYeah and in ...

didn't you still left him and after that\nLike him oh man that's that's that's you code ... manager your manager has to understand when it's time to pull your picture it was way past time no the damn picture it\nBecause everybody was saying pull a a Walker viewer when he gave up the what what the four runs in the first remember that when they said with a man I stayed with him and look how that turned out now if he walks the guy and it's two runs in the ...\nUp and nobody making us think about that now right now isn't that funny\nWell hindsight's twenty twenty ... cord but I but I Will say this when you have a reliever I'm with both on this that allowed all nine nine I think writing old nine or ... uh or at least all nine runners he was responsible for ...\nI think you can cut that off the past relatively early flush your east is throwing Nike is I mean I Know he's young but you put them out there last year and a ... or two years ago to collect situation he was throwing while I

and ... and they suddenly started just going for yards in a cloud of dust right and it it you really over analyze things though in all honesty Arnie\nEven regular season baseball you you do manage differently because obviously you have to win four games before the other team but even during the regular season you hit it on the head ... baseball now if you get a a quality start I hate I sound

they spend a lot of money on this roster but they've also there's pieces like the MVP Steve Pearce that aren't necessarily household names and I don't know if we'll be talking a lot about our score

it is you're the star of this show as as well of course getting on what it all\nBaseball's done I mean come on now what are your what it is it's almost in November of course\nYou had an hour oh darling Dodgers fans nose in it so I'm definitely close to\n... yep I'm ready for it as we do we get out in LA that Dodger fans are going to be going ballistic over this\nI don't think we will tonight I think that's going to say hey I I'm pretty sure when when you wrap up a season like this don't you don't you kind of used as much airtime as you possibly can I mean\nGosh do see I'm not going to fall back into baseball because I'll get apologetic for the Dodgers and I'll start making all these excuses about you know they probably really shouldn't have been here you lose Seeger you're pitching staff isn't necessarily what you thought it was gonna be the blob it was I'm not going to excuse in eight or nine thousand is Arnie Buckley who play ball to wind up I'm just kind of curious on

jump the shark on conversations about\nBut it also says you one question off the subject here sure Lulu the coach and waiting for the Lakers I'm just asking you\nHe is not the coach and all that we don't know that come on now Lou quotes to coach the Lakers [laughter]\nStorylines on it we got college football the talk about up to the bottom of the hour yeah but I kind of a a ho hum day if you will in the national football league not a lot of ... games\nThe the Packers rams game was interesting and there's obviously some drama what time of gum or his decision\nAnd mistake that he made but really just kind of a ... you had the drama last night with the jaguar players that were allegedly detained and spent more money than I make in a year at a bar so I I mean you're just talking about a couple of crazy storylines\nBut for me it seemed as if this week was more about what's going to happen coming up this week\nAs opposed to what happened today if I got a we had a team that stayed on to feed it with a big win so it was kind of crazy to see the storylines and the narrative that played out\nSaddam I think the biggest story line is going to be a trickle down effect\nUm I think the fact that the bangles winning thirty seven thirty four after they had a what was it like a Nineteen point lead or even bigger than that uh they bring in fits magic who rallies them they fall off shored\nNo doubt in my mind now James Winston um can't receive that big time extension and he's going to end up going where uh somewhere else where that's\nThat's the question God's could you see them with the dolphins up to the dump it to give her the N E L they're going to be in desperate need of a quarterback but I can see James Winston just because of what happened today or could be gone I maybe I'm thinking too much over the ...\nDon't think you are a and I don't think he'll he'll get traded at the trade deadline no no no no I Would want to bring 'em in right but it's crazy because now we're I mean my goodness last week I\nThis is a new to me and football on and we see this a lot in major league baseball and we're used to and we see it in hockey we see it in the NBA trains are made at the trade deadline sometimes they work sometimes it's a rental sometimes they don't I mean for lander worked for the Astros last year Machado worked for the Dodgers we see these deals at work and we see these that don't\nThis is something new so I don't know if this is just a short term trend because you have so many teams that have decided to become salaries this year with the giants and what the raiders and obviously now with maybe the Broncos in a couple of others or do you do you see this as a trend that will continue over the next couple of years with the NFL much like we see in the NBA major league baseball\nI think it was column that these young general managers or want to go ahead and start trading now they do things differently than back in the old days so uh and there's a lot of big names that are actually out there on the trading bloc\nUm now I hear that the patriots not talking about trading for someone like a Patrick Peterson a forty niners are getting interested in wide receiver ... or so and so there's a lotta stuff being thrown out there are some names that can help teams that want to make a run at the at the super bowl\n[noise] [noise] well I Will add this I Will add this to it\nIt does make Tuesday much more interesting you know it does make Tuesday one of those days where suddenly maybe maybe more so than just reacting to in responding to Monday Night football or any were kind of a little bit juiced up about what might or might not happen and you know we get back to the phones ... seven Ninety nine and I I really find a way it's a very strict\nA sub started to feel like the berries Thomas's could end up with the patriots I really believed that one's going to happen\nWhen I just think you're going to see a myriad of moves and maybe some of

her son back to back by young award winners never happened before that's pretty impressive [noise]\nMean for a guy that had been over for nine in the post season and honestly what was it the Astros ALCOA game that he pitched well but didn't get the when he didn't get to win but the red Sox actually won the game so it was the first game he pitched in\nThat they had actually won but he didn't get credit for it and I was just nails in his last two outings and I'll tell you what it's kind of funny because I've been so\nDiscombobulated this time thinking about this series because the friday game was so ... in Raleigh\nAnd in Saturday's game you had college football all day long so you kinda\nFocused on college football and then boom you get this crazy start for the Dodgers they're up for is if you think it's over\nAnd in a blink of an eye the series is over\nAnd it's all Boston which uh again an incredible season but what does it mean for TV ratings Arnie asked I deliver according to sports media watch which is a great resource if you're like me and you kind of dig\nFollowing the trends of how TV ratings are going the game for earned a number that was down ... percent\nFrom the Astros Dodger series and down seven percent\nFrom the Indians cubs series wow a little bit unfair on you because I mean come on the cubs in the world series and two thousand sixteen Cleveland being there as well to that it was insane but get this the nine point eight rating that the game pooled is the lowest for a game four of the world series since the royals\nYep yep yeah that's what my Saturday Night then right\nYeah exactly despite that though it was the third highest overnight fray Saturday World Series since two thousand [laughter]\n... there there's all this when we're talking numbers we can bore you to death to be honest with you just find yourself the numbers guy or gal and they'll find a way to make any thing look good but here's what here's what stood out to me\nInsane and think numbers are percentages so in other words when you see wow and it pulled a ten point six that means ten percent of the country is watching it in Boston game for earn a sorority point five rating wide ranging point five owning\nThat's down twelve percent from two thousand and Thirteen when they were in the world series before\nAnd it's the second lowest for a Red Sox game in Boston\nThis century so even Boston fans were getting bored it's like oh well we got this thing so were good but just kind of crazy when you think about it from a numbers perspective TV wise you think oh LA Boston home run people are going to be going crazy for maybe ... maybe not so much\nGame three was on a friday night Friday nights usually down a little bit because people go out to bars and that doesn't register for you know as many people would be at home like on a Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday\nAlways been told that to a Tuesday night look what you got me saying here friday night and Saturday Night or death\nFlyer sporting event exact just you're you're not going to pull big numbers even the the college football games now have you noticed what they've started doing with some of the bigger college football match ups they're putting them early in the morning you know you have these stupid eleven AM games that have been out non stop\nSo I I mean it's just it's kind of crazy to see how you see now don't get me wrong you're still going to get the best or at least a legit best primetime games in college football or like this week and what else you know they're not moving into the morning I promise of that but I I Will add it's\nThey're trying to get a little bit more action but yeah not necessarily a huge TV ratings winner which makes ... what we get to night yeah even more intriguing as far as numbers are concerned now the other melt down are you a Sunday ticket guy Arnie or do you just get yourself the old red zone channel and go from\nThere we do the red zone and and go from there are less apt to watch the patriots also I'll put that on my other TV and watch out one at the same time\nThe Sunday ticket today had a little bit of a meltdown and according to pro football talk uh basically they lost just the actual access\nTo it direct TV had a technical glitch today\nIn which thousands of subscribers were getting error messages instead of the actual game oh I'm sure that doesn't cause any problems hours after the problem surface direct TV did even put out as much of a statement acknowledging that there was a technical issue and that they were working on the situation now\nI'm here to the fifth direct TV because I Am a proud direct TV subscriber and you'll just see the pipe down I mean come on it takes some time to work through some things but obviously that can be a little bit challenging this is like the Heidi football game I about that [laughter]\nIt's an incredible serviceman so I uh I think of it I think what it it it's one of those situations to where if it works\nThe time it's it's the greatest one little glitch elm I knew my gosh what's going on in the states that weren't all that money back\nCould you imagine just being a customer service on the Sunday Morning you're like oh this is going to be an easy shift everybody's watching football just got a kickback capital breakfast the phone started ringing\nHello hello I what I I'm a\nWell get somebody on an immediately bad by our sir I don't know what are you going to say it's just like Missouri's are up\n[laughter] I Know right now it back and you're like oh hold on\nIf you're a direct TV headquarters you might have the Sunday ticket right there you know ... ... do you have it on the right channels are you sure have you tried on plugging in plugging [laughter] uh I used\nTo love the direct TV channel that will tell you how to use your remote they don't have that anymore bring it back y'all but as a proud subscriber people who complain listen it's the greatest service available on the planet calm down Gombe okay\nIt's all good now this comes from a proud Sunday ticket and directv subscribers telling you to chill out but I Would I just\nI Want to read just one real quick ah from Casey sly or however you read it baseball season too long it's November to a few days I'm tired of watching baseball by this time\n[noise] how can you get hired of watching baseball I mean if you don't just don't watch I I Will never understand friday night oh gosh I'm going\nTo I didn't watch any of the Minnesota saints game because that was all into the world series I I look back and forth a little bit but it was more like Ninety percent ten percent for the baseball\nBut but here's the thing why are people acting as if you have someone that has taking you are outside of those who work in newsrooms and you're waiting for the game to be over to do your newscast nobody is in your living room forcing you to watch the game when you see people that say they\nAre [laughter] I mean I I don't know where where you live already maybe you need to think about moving but if they're going to sit there and complain about oh my gosh I turn the channel what's your problem oh this games just too long I got stay up for good or bad oh\nLike it was Ramsey from Jacksonville what a couple of weeks ago where they didn't want to say it if they are now that it was bogus you know what I'm saying that was bogus\nThis you give maybe time of gum or a little bit of a pass because he's not a guy out there being boisterous and talking all that gas is what you're saying\nYou say the Montgomery up thinking is that related to Elizabeth Montgomery from B. which I had no idea what can you do ... have been like this starting Packer I Know I come on now you're given ... is he like a big type quarterback or a big time you know they might of course not or a coach or anything like that that speaks\nPeople that had to face the media were big time quarterbacks and coaches I didn't realize what the ... every to kick hers went out and face the media after they screwed up\nAnd I could care less I'm like okay you missed that kick well just cuts next week big deal come on you're going to cut Justin Tucker night after it said that like I say when we\nCome back to the guy go Fox Sports radio studios David gas gone we'll get caught up on a few things that we missed or if they're sick are blown off Eric are we going to get to talk to from Chavez Ravine as he to doubt we'll try to hook up with a stupid savior and\nI have tons of stories or you know last week or last week we thought we might have breaking news out of Cleveland yeah apparently not only didn't happen but the breaking news might involve a coordinator plus the Cincinnati Bengals are on a historic path\nAnd maybe we might actually see a little bit of a dent in the chief's office of machine that might be wishful thinking but we'll talk about it next to the audience blank on Fox Sports

I was back in New York went to church with my parents so yeah just blew me away this whole thing that you want\nTo you know what I watched a while we were on a break recently I've watched the movie a spotlight\nA that was the movie on the Boston Globe you know they had their their spotlight division for many years and they did the basically the expos they there are in in Boston and the the process of kind of following that you know through the years\nAnd that's a time that the movie came out there was a lot that wasn't no and then you saw the uh the authorities come out about a Pennsylvania Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania\nAnd then the latest about you know from buffalo and everything else um but that movie was kind of startling it was when I re watched it it was even more startling\nYou know it was it but they set in the movie basically what we said one of the characters in the movie I'm just said you know can you believe it can I go back to church essentially could I ever go back to

actually passed the peak season for many locations around the country\nThe upper Great Lakes including northern Wisconsin in northern Minnesota most of Pennsylvania and New York in the New England states are past week this week we're seeing the ... conditions throughout the Appalachians right through central Ohio and Indiana and to northern Illinois\nAnd portions of central Iowa and we'll have some rain to contend with and that Midwest region I mentioned throughout Indiana Ohio portions of the lower Tennessee Valley today we'll see showers move through moving off to the east\nDr today you

thanks so much John eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\n[noise] are you still trying to figure out from all the wonderful volunteer groups where your time would be most valuable\nThat are potentially deadly well there are a number of laws we could pass to keep because uh you uh you know this guy was on a apparently a a social media site I'd never heard of a that was ... was a social media site for white supremacists\nAnd\nOkay so your we could say that participation in such a site\nOr is against the law we could say that I'm speaking out with hatred in your heart real hatred for groups of people are based on their ethnicity or or or culture that's against the law we could pass a number of laws send it I mean how do you change for\nFreedom of speech eggs and part of the reasons that freedom of speech speech exist is so people do proclaim what they think so you know who they are you know exactly what they all you do by taking away their free speech rights as what you send them underground\nThat's what you do and and when there's pressure from you know society because the reason maybe I'm guessing the reason and I think it's a solid theory here that the neighbor wasn't aware of of this kind of you know hatred in this\nHeart is because in our society we don't\nMorally we don't tolerate that because the overwhelming majority of people don't have this kind of hatred evil than there are no\nAnd you cannot ... and and that's what it comes down to there's there's no way of knowing for what ever reason whatever motivation a person might have\nI mean think of all of the reasons that might be stated a in terms of the motivation of of any mass killer in our history\nWell the list is very long [noise]\nKnow I I was just I was going through the headlines are just yesterday just in real clear politics and and it was a it was just really interesting a Donald Trump is a shameless liar\nThat's a headline of an article written by former president for rock Obama got his by what has a no one family Detroit News be honest we hate each other\nBut the one I liked the most was Justin Fox Bloomberg's headline if you ignore the news America actually seems pretty nice\nIf you ignore the new view ignore the news to seems pretty nice well I I just I thought it was you know I didn't even read the article I just I saw it but I but it's it's something that you and I talked about before where\nWe've we've said a for and and I mentioned for example everything going on in the news and you walk into the voting booth everybody greet you how you doing what's going on\nYou know you're voting location what's going on good to see a oh the weather's bad Oh thanks for voting pick up your thing thanks you take care of every now and everybody goes then it's very orderly very nice I don't think I've ever had a non pleasant time ever voting in my life right well that's actually the reality of it you know of of what goes on\nFor the vast majority tens of millions of people out there one thing we talk about you know the the news media\nAnd you and I have talked about this a lot that they're all\nThat's one of the first things I learned in journalism class is news as the unusual right that's why that's why murders\nAre news mhm because for the most part they don't happen to the vast majority of people not to discount that murder isn't bad but the fact is the majority of people the majority of the time\nNever encounter a a a murder right many some families do but the majority of families in this country do not when you look at the three hundred and roughly thirty million people in this country still mass shootings mass murders are quite\nLow but when you look at the uh\nPsychopaths that exist out there uh when I was just watching and how many uh documentaries every watched a on it but it was another one on on Ted Bundy yesterday ...\nAnd talk you know the going through the transcripts of his girlfriend at the time I'm telling you just haunting yeah she was trying to figure out\nIs he\nIs he not and going through that progression of her there's no it can't be and then sent you know ... his brother Ted 'cause that Ted 'cause the exact same thing shut the\nDoor on the FBI and you know how dare you this isn't this isn't my brother and then finally you know started thinking about it and said well okay I guess I have to deal with reality\nAnd it's not that it gives any you know um there was no owners or or or responsibility on the part of his\nBrother necessarily because it was as if you know he was warning it ... he really was learning about you know what his brother might be capable of doing or was capable it turned out of doing a A N and that's the case with any of them you know the neighbor here\nI'm sure in in his mind is wondering wow is there something maybe that I should have paid attention to you know culture is there something that I could have done we all do this and by the way this is how we get to this point I was staying there must be a solution because in our hearts\nThere should be one this in our hearts it doesn't make sense but we're trying to make sense of something that will ... the overwhelming majority of people will never be able to connect with\nIn our minds we don't think this way we don't have this kind of evil in our hearts we don't have this kind of hatred for people it's quite the opposite we have love and respect for people and we can talk about disagreements but I always put it like this it's like a family\nYou could sit around and and if you go spend you know enough time [laughter] with your family you can sit around and you can have debate you can have concerns and arguments and very passionate arguments on very important things\nBut the moments somebody else walks in that door and starts threatening any of you and starts going after any of you that's when you stand up together and say wait a minute hold on here because when you put this all in perspective\nWe're always going to have very passionate discussions about American politics that's going to be the case that we should be the case\nWhen you\nTalk about the the tactics right now being used\nDo away with the process\nDo away with the constitution\nDo away with the electoral college all of these things that are ultimately about giving individual's rights and and instead we're looking at more and more taking away those the people's rights the individual rights of Americans\nMine's something you respond to with anything else but a vote or debate it's that simple and that's who we are\nEveryone green most good people grieve when when there's a loss of life that's who we are as humans that's who we are as a society the the people the very few\nThat have these deranged mines that are that have evil in their hearts we'd like to be able to come up with a solution to try and predict it\nAnd try and stop it ahead of time and I I Wish there were way but as as it stands right now it's just impossible as you mentioned Gary sometimes in a society it is going to happen\nWe can learn from it but it doesn't mean that will be able to predict the next one or stop or prevent the next one\nWe look to learn from it because we all want to stop the loss of life in a situation like this we'll\nTalk more coming up if you'd like to get in lines open eight six six Ninety right I

want the best for your family you want you wouldn't want the best for your friends you would you would want the best for yourself you want the best life\nIt seems to me that\nLanguage in okay but what

right now that people are dying in my opinion I'm Sorry okay are you people are dying but the result\nOf hatred and partisanship coming from both sides and I will tell you that the left as justice guilty\nAirline here we're not saints here's the point that I Want to get too because you this is very important 'cause one of the things that that really\nGets to conservatives because conservatives have compassion and I believe and I believe that and I believe that that the the yanks when we're we've got some interference or I I Believe the Trump is compassionate I Believe Trump's rhetoric at times goes over the top\n... example [laughter] you know the example I'm going to give [laughter] keeping the conspiracy going the cruise Ted Cruz's father was part of the Kennedy assassination so to me that was the high level anything since then has actually taken\nOver the top but don't you care about the substance\nIs it only the hyperbole then is that what you're claiming Democrats are Democrats only care\nAbout how you say it's not what you say\nAnd you also have to understand when it comes to the theory that exist in America by a lot of people including Trump when you see the Democrats wish to protect illegal immigrant criminals this is not\nUltra part is than to get people angry it is the reality of what exists today dating reality is not hate talk\nBut when you have the Democrats who prefer their preference is the safety and security of illegal immigrants criminals over American citizens yeah you're going to get people angry including the president mhm\nYep what's gonna happen um look and by the way the whole thing with the remember the president said the rapist thing and you know it's it's you know you and I for example we've said you could take quotes that we have said and\nAnd you know in the context of not knowing other things you could take it out of context as soon as that was said he goes no I mean the the bad people not the good ones and he said we know there are good people tried to come across a the the border we can't do it\nSo we clarified that a long long time ago in fact the clarify that right after it happened yes but again it was or what they did was they took it and they ran with it you know that all are rapists ... no\nYou said all he said rape is well and he didn't say they were all rape is William across it and and ... changed making the point the very simple point that we have to that every single person that comes in this country that was the point he was making yes\nBecause those are the most hardened criminals are the ones you don't want to hear\nVery simple\nBecause you have to understand where liberalism ... you know again and you can tell at least you can see that he was conceding some points a by the way I did see over the weekend we need a third political party everything here proves that that would stand for what\nYeah what are you going to do that are going to let him out for about a third political parties stand for a while where does this center where's the center yeah who's really a moderate right now\nI don't know what a moderate is right now\nYou know we've been you know over the past few years especially over the past twenty four months we've been trying to define what a conservative as\nA I think we all know what the liberalism there are varying degrees of liberalism\nBut it starts pretty much on the far left and then goes to the extreme far left well tell me what a moderate is forget about conservative or liberal tell me what a moderate is what do they stand for what are they promote and how they vote\nAnd I've talked about how I uh talked to a a relative by marriage who was a college professor and knew he was a liberal I mean I really never got into the conversation and did this year at our family reunion and even though he's a liberal he rejects what's coming from the Democrats completely and he said about Trump he said\nJust look my dad loved Trump as Trump look his rhetoric is over the top but\nNot a racist he's done ... come on\nIs in New York City deals with everybody and this guy's a liberal professor who was just I Can't stand being on the liberal campus

of uh of Georgia and then\nThey're trying to make a big deal he's from voters depression voter suppression they're talking about the fact that uh there's you know there's a law in Georgia\nThat you have to purge the rules and they got it wrong it said after every two elections it's not it after seven years and by the way a lot of people left have got that wrong it's after seven years you have to approach it and they're like and\nVoter suppression voter suppression voter suppression voter suppression\nThe law was passed by Democrats in Nineteen Ninety seven that you had to purge the rose after seven years\nIf you didn't vote ... if you didn't vote so so Democrats passed the law it's like yeah but he wants to do it [laughter]\nPassed that we didn't really mean it he means that they were Democrats we passed the law to purge the voter rolls if you don't vote every seven yeah but he's acts\nIf you want the most bizarre issue out there it's the claim of voter suppression by the Democrats\n\nThat is when you think about it how ... ... that is\nYeah um it's huh it's just like the money in politics we hate it if the other side's raising more money [laughter] we love it at that

number of people we voted for Greg Abbott voted for better or\nThis is a part of it or if this would be in in the you know part of the answer that uh that you would get if you were to learn that\nUh but we we talk about two years ago Ted Cruz being the demon oh uh yeah I agree with you know and and you know I mean back when banner was was speaker of the house and and you know a ... there were people in the Republican Party we know that in the Senate and in the house\nThat hated cruise but I mean if you had any question you look at what happened at the are in see at the convention in the summer twenty sixteen yeah but without date but now he's beautiful dead\nYes right well because now he's useful but if you decided to challenge the president way to manage it in twenty twenty but isn't that politics though yeah of course that's strange bedfellows that isn't actually Neal to me yeah that and and it's nothing new but\nIt it is\nThe same thing is is that okay well but in that setting it was about his lack of endorsement and now it's I think you could probably point to a number of people that say that still stuck with me even though the president is with him in Houston I'm not\nI mean I I think you would probably again which some I Can't even measure that but I Know there are people that support the president right now support governor Abbott\nAnd are not going to support Ted Cruz for one reason or the other and it's\nLikely because I'm I'm guessing\nA handful of them at least are saying it's because he did not get on board and twenty sixteen I Would love to see those votes how many votes for avid but don't vote for Cruz at ... or ... just don't vote for Senate mhm yeah no there or you know if you if you look at that there there could be a number of them that aren't voting in the Senate or how many of them\nYou know are looking at the governor's race and and you know going well yeah\nAs sheriff that's left is considered that in fact have been more vocal about uh of course in the in the past few months that they're concerned with her actions as an and policy of the basically the Dallas County sheriff department\nUnder her leadership so you look at that and that and and those that probably has some to do with it again you know you could put some of those answers in that category but we'll see what it where it comes together I guess on

think if I'm being told that I must think this way because of the color of my skin and then my mind is still in the plantation\nAnd that that's what I Try to some of your your your poured into finger at a a Republican plantation what I'm saying what what ... are you uh\nThe right folks about the homosexual affair and\nThe marriage thing or whatever they're your talk of the mission by issue as they lined up with more of a conservative mindset but because of their best hope right brainwashed and ... of racism racism racism racism you know it clouds their their their their judgment\nYou know I I Wonder because you know we talked about the identity politics with a with the ... with the Democrats and the identity politics that have really\nI think come to the forefront because they're so radical is you know number one the transgender movement where if you're a a man you can be a woman and the the country in law's much ah recognize you that way and then what we've got into now is transracial that if you're black you can be white and if you're white you can be black\nLegally and I started thinking about that and wonder how many 'cause we said that we said with the transgender it seemed that there was more acceptance and when they jumped to the trans racial\nI said I think you're going to get a lot of blowback from a lot of black leaders out there stating wait a minute so you can be whatever race you want whenever you want to be it and I thought that was really interesting I Wonder if people thought that that was ... just a ...\nA lot of minorities might have seen that and said okay maybe this is time for me to get on a different mindset as to where the Democrats are going\nBecause it's an excess challenges so what does this fight band for a way yeah was it all in vain yeah right\nNo that's I I think that's the question that that many of us have been asking for a long time I mean when you think of the mindset from the the the the left right now that you can be whatever you wish to be now that includes gender\nOr race so there because there's\nSecond because if you look at a you know the the the civil rights are\nProtected groups created under the civil rights act if there if you can belong if anyone can belong to any protected group then there are just by saying so then there are no protected groups\nThen the civil rights and their own is done it's over I I mean the the the civil rights act but everything that the civil rights era that happened there all that entire battle it's we're not\nAnd not only that you know the ... the civil war was for nothing and wouldn't you fight\nAgainst other oppressive a governmental systems\nYou know why did we fight you know just to say oh it's not that we should have done that uh we're we're on a different path now so I'm like no we are America this is America when I say that we're as individuals better than ... or any other country\nWere saying our ideas are better than everybody else yes or any other countries\nAnd I and and and and the goal would be to everybody to adapt the actual ideas\nIn in in the constitution where they they don't always do so and the other thing is too I mean there's also this thing that the left throws at the conservatives in at the right that you don't you won't acknowledge racism come on and we all know what are how horrendous racism in slavery and Jim Crow was\nAnd I don't know any conservative that which is to go back to that and my belief is the Democrats and I think about my grandfather my grandfather was the ... the Democratic chairman of the town that we grew up in and he was because he emigrated from Canada and he came to town and they were all Republican\nLeft the Democrats that well I I Believe my father never had the official conversation with somebody and he died before I got to ask him\nBut I said ... be a Democrat today and he said no abortion abortion changed him a lot of the liberal politics\nOr changed him but when you think of what they what the Republican but the Democrats used to claim in the seventies and eighties they cared about\nAnd then the identity politics where everything is about race everything is about gender and the whole cabinet thing where you saw that you must believe the woman well that's ridiculous if you must believe the woman will it used to be a must believe the white man over the black\nYou know over over the black person in a criminal justice in the black person you don't believe in the white person you believe you know you go by evidence\nAnd what I find him credit is what I find incredible the bigotry and intolerance and the actual racism and sexism seems not to be coming from the Democrats\n'cause when I talk to black man about or that situation um they fully understand that the uh\n'cause I don't know to remember it was all white lady that was several years ago she ran away and uh she blamed it on to black males as so every\nBlack and we know that within the facility and okay look under scrutiny and that came out that she just wanted to run away or you know so\nSo I'm like no you have to understand that that\nIf you go to that system be fully aware of that what you're trying to fight against come true for which ...\nJames uh thank you so much uh Sammy some reshaped writes thoughts and uh yeah I mean you're not the first person who was called the show and said look I'm black

I suppose\nI'm an old school guy yeah just a shoe yes you I I I don't know what that means I don't know it was night and it was meant to be snarky but I don't know what it means what what does that mean you are an old school kind of guy oh okay I I like local banks\nYes okay I like when I Walk in and the president of the bank says how you doing rod\nWhat can I Do for you how about that for a concept people don't have time for that anymore that's my prosthetist\nMen do business men do they know they're a banker's on a first name basis and they created a long relationship isn't\nThat relationship more important than the relationship of a a person you don't know that just sees a group of numbers on the bottom of the check well they check your scores that's all good okay now now let me ask you this right\nPeople that are going to be doing this that are already doing correct yes\nOkay I'm who monitors them\nWell and I've been given a minute I would've I hold you this ... this could be good but on the other hand\nThere are people uh FICA or fight go and or some other credit reporting agencies will also not only how can they pull up the score regarding your lungs and your payment record a surprise that goes\nBut I'm not so sure I Want them looking that closely not that I have anything to hide but that's going in extra step into your or you know your banking business yes the once again\nI'm surprised they haven't done something to keep people up with all the ... people have with banks now a days right mhm why haven't they done anything to keep them out of our business\n\nYeah there's been too many occasions where banks haven't protected you at all and we were subjected to that that long time ago see that's where my question\nWhy why why are we allowed some protection from these people one would think you you're in a position that your hand and we pay you to handle our money [noise] that why don't you protest just to [noise]\nI think that some so we will continue with this because it's very important but we got some reading do either [noise]\nNFL and a whole lot more on the brain us okay\nBut everything is done online we've were subjected to hacks over at least ten years ah\n[noise] yeah I I don't want to say and different a federal government agencies John McCain was on one not ways and means it was another powerful committee has been saying we have to have to bump up and be very\nOur grid I don't really want to start Monday off like this but it's a factor\nAnd I'm just I thought it was kind of cool but yet not so fast on the fact that you could actually if in fact you need credit you're a young person maybe you\nUh you're in a position that you can now afford to buy a new car so you go ah you go through the car agency or to you to your bank that you have banking with but you don't have a lot of credit\nThen you're able to through this expanded psycho\nScore system you would actually be able to get the loan based on the way you've paid your bills which is you should get credit for that you've been a good cry rent pay or you've been a good a utility customer or those kinds of things\nBut then um but then again there are a little bit closer into your business\nWell let me take it back to this idea of a hometown bank okay because it because it keeps coming back in my mind re how many people do you think you know that you call friends\nBecause the hundred and [noise]\nI mean rent land family fringe infant like probably under twenty okay would you alone all of the money\nI probably would if I could\nWould you be more light Leah ... five dollars to one person\nAnd a hundred and we're saying obviously that you have the amount obviously ... and if I had it if they did yeah I I my ... my I have a very close circle of my book my point is that one person you may have a lot more faith and trust and sure to pay you back\nAnd another person you may have may have no faith and trust it\nRight Mm okay I'll I'll play along meal on the home town level\nAnd that you gave me but no one can predict the future and sometimes things happen in no fault of your of your own but nonetheless you end up not being able to pay it back well but I think if you asked\nA hundred people is it okay\nTo take advantage let's say that your car insurance company makes up three hundred dollar error in your favor they give you a three hundred dollars to much mhm\nIs it okay to take advantage of them because they take care and take advantage of everybody else as opposed\nTo or if you've dealt with Mr Brown your local bank or if he gave you three hundred and forty five dollars too much of the tell her window you'd probably say by the way you gave me too much money\n\nOkay and your question is\n... it's not a question as a statement my statement is by knowing the person personally I have a tendency to the dealer with him more honestly unfairly\nJust like those fifty people you wouldn't lend them all let's say you at a hundred thousand dollars and there were a hundred and people you wouldn't be willing to loan each of them have thousand dollars because some you know would never pay you\nBack right well I don't know it would it that is so a\nSpecific to certain situations\nWell I Know there's a lot of people that if if I had fifty thousand dollars in the refrigerator that I could leave them here and say get whatever you want out of the refrigerator and they know enough not take any of the fifty thousand dollars\nBut there's I don't think I Can't think of anyone we would have in our home that will we couldn't do that

Omar who is called\nIsrael evil and where is Chuck Schumer and ... who are Jewish and CNN and MSNBC all\nCovering that up that's a disgrace and they're they have the nerve to accuse the Republicans of being anti Semite when they put a candidate like that who calls Israel evil or were you were tweet Israel has hypnotized the world and they are ... a week and the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel could you imagine if a Republican can we do a better\nAh how about this can you imagine is a former Republican president was on stage with Farrakhan minister anti Semite anti termite he hate you'd be literally he lives in breeds hate Jewish people and there's\nAnd the thing is inside Washington they may think they're pulling the wool over people's eyes but the rest of the country is laughing at the prospect that the president's to blame at all\nJust like you wouldn't blame President Obama for what happened during his eight years where there are multiple shootings but they were very effective in blaming the Republicans and gun laws [noise]\nTrust which [noise] I talk to those points on TNT I find that each station [noise]\nAh you know if if the Trump Organization through through Eric and John junior continues to do business um that has had ties and may have current ties\nAnd we're not entirely certain um but all those monuments cases you know the people are bringing the president and ... those have them all listed you can go to cruise website you know but that's a that's a concern that they never separated from interests with aren't connected to foreign governments\nAnd that foreign governments obviously Brian would be interested in trying to buy influence\nFrom the Trump family I mean that that's goal number one\nRight yeah ... there's also was a big worry about anybody that ever does business who wants to run for the White House when you think\nWell you know what they'd better it you know what cut ties before you take that job that's I'm Sorry those are the two separate those are two\nSeparate ... going to be named why did cut ties with the Trump Organization still exists\nPresident Trump has not severed his ... his uh his connection to the Trump Organization it continues to profit from that business he continues to be connected to that he never officially separated from it\nWho's really running that in a blind trust\nAnd you know what I can tell you that it is serious question for skeptics of what's going on with this coziness with Saudi Arabia that the Trump family whether it's papa or sons\nTime someone wants to run for president after President Trump if they'd been in business they better go bend over backwards\nTo divest and disconnect and disengage so that we can rebuild the trust of the American people who for decades before President Trump took office have always believed in you know prime they come up to you on the street and tell you this and me\nThat it's all about money that no matter which which person which parties running the government somehow there on the cake and we have to build back this trust and we can't be doing business foreign governments while we're conducting national security\nAlso see I don't know what they are but the house Democrats who said issue fifty two subpoenas that were blocked by the Republicans deserved theme to the subpoenas or they just all over the place\n[noise] [noise] oh no they're all they're all or they have everything to do with an air it's everything it's like health care and and all these different policy issues along with the sort of the ethical um the the you know the group of ethical questions that range as we have to you and I have discussed\nBefore throughout the cabinet it's not just President Trump but what people are allowed to do at the cabinet level as well so\nUm as I think you and I talked to in our last conversation they're going to jump on Ryan's again Wilbur Ross ah an interior and commerce shore and um but but the the fifty two subpoenas are on oh my God environment you know on a million policy questions along with ethical conduct right\nUm so you have the uh Ryan Zinke he said there's eleven different investigations into him Wilbur Ross a we'll have explained to do that if Democrats are in the majority not only about as potential insider trading and conflicts of interest but testimony to Congress they may not have been truthful about those discussions\nRight there is an ongoing um there's a debate about whether or not when he testified to Congress and was asked about this uh censorship sorry the I'm a citizen question on the census whether or not he was forthcoming and he later said that he then recall the ... Congress\nNot um that he basically his spokesman is explaining\nThat he didn't really understand what he was being asked when he was being asked that but that will I just I'm telling you that will be a hearing right immediately because that's a you know the census is ... is a huge political issue um along with citizenship and you know the the whole fight over immigration sort of writ large\nAnd now now they go going after Kavanaugh would not be was more than likely right\nI just think it's I think it's really hard to prove a there were these misconduct complaints that were forwarded from a from a a judge on the on the district a court of appeals ... the story broke an hour before the Senate votes maybe two thirty on that Saturday and the vote was at four o'clock sharp\nOn that he had sent these complaints to ah the um chief justice John Roberts the Supreme Court that having nothing to do with Dr\nFord but concerns that a he can to his conduct in his compartment in those hearings were not worthy of a justice of the Supreme Court same complaint that retired Justice John Paul Stevens made about cabinet that he's too partisan\nAnd that he uh you know he he was um you know not measured not judicious not impartial um in in his in his testimony that day but also this other complaint was that he may have perjured himself before the committee on his first set of hearings when will be for Dr Ford ... about his service in the Bush administration\nPerjury is very hard to prove and if they want to poke around and they really think a good standing for for for that\nUm you know maybe there needs to be a new process when we go through confirmation hearings for the next ... Supreme Court no matter which party is controlling the Senate but I Do believe that trying to take a ... a justice off of the Supreme Court um who obviously is qualified may have done the wrong thing\nAnd destructive and I think it's it's it's not the right\nThing to do list and I think it's really handy to live for both sides for Democrats or Republicans to read your column\nBecause given idea of if if the Democrats have it for at least two years what they should be in ... with the more than likely will be investigating they're able to investigate with this type of the ledger will be there any positive worked it could be done\nWell see I Do think it's positive if there's some needed oversight on on um on conduct because I think the president is running a swamp it and we discuss this before I think it's been\nJust unbelievable what's gone on the blurring of the lines the trampling I'm of the rules and I think the oversight of that is very important I I I I make the point in the column that I think that ... going into an impeachment drive 'em before a special counsel tells us\nThat he actually obstruction of justice or you know we did anything\nUm that would merit impeachment I think is just is is it an enormous overstep that will cost them the presidency and twenty twenty and just you know further degrade our discourse and and our political situation I Do think that turning up\nI mean it is the job of the legislative branch no matter which party is running it to hold the executive branch accountable it is a separate and co equal branch because we're not a third world dictatorship and\nPresident we run this country and you would be a die without overstepping is really helpful\nBut do you think that if they want to get the Senate and get the President's Day they got to show they can not only investigate the legislature and what about infrastructure what about immigration reform whereabouts have a combined deficit program we're in Twenty years were were knocking it down instead of building it up and a buddy handling\nHigher always obviously hopeful about the ways that the party's been worked together and they're not always you know sharing our priorities but I Do believe that the air\nAnd if a structure and I really hope that they you know they don't have huge budget fights that\nLead to government shutdowns I don't see any kind of agreement on immigration calming because the to the Democrats aren't going to get the Senate they're going to get the house by four seats if they get it um I think if the Republicans hold on it'll be by you know for seven seats to I think it's going to be incredibly I'm slim a week old\nSon and already we called for either party and not can create opportunities for consensus or it can just be a disaster but I think I Hope immigration and some prescription drug work as possible immigration is just a fight that both part of the Democrats are leaning far too heavily on immigrant rights\nPresident Trump is fleeting far too heavily on the fight he was his his bill in the Senate Brian got fewer votes from Republicans and Democrats combined than any of the proposals he took for positions on the good luck bill in the house he made it clear to ... he didn't want the DACA deal he doesn't want to daily wants to fight for twenty twenty I see no hope on that issue in the next two\nYears yeah I'm going to be I'm going to just give you a scenario you ready yeah he won two years didn't do anything because he feels as though I had the house I have the Senate if given a look weak whatever he did whatever calculus he thought he didn't go for it but if you lose the house\nAnd he gets an offer that deal again from democratic leadership of hey I'll give you the wall or you get ten year a ten year a path on DACA maybe takes it and he goes guys this is what I got you know this is the best I got I don't have the house I'm going to do a deal here\nBecause I think you know that I Will give him credit if he does that right no I Know absolutely will do the people\nTo break down and and and solve some of our problems I Know when they're not going to do ... you know they're not going to tackle everything but I I Would I Would be so happy for even a half a loaf on immigration just something\nUh I think in the ground I give him credit if he does that absolutely yes\nCook as well what if he doesn't have the house\nSo maybe he says I Can't you know his instincts we saw his instincts we brought the cameras into that room and we saw him trying to workout guns and we saw I'm trying to work at immigration but when the doors closed he didn't have the the base behind him I get to go forward or you didn't think it was going to work for him to do that\nTrying to I'm

conflict with each other\nAdam ship is really done a great job rallying the nation around them\nWhen you congressman who if a tradition holds in history has something to learn from a will be chairman of oversight or will say oh let's go out to\nScott listening in Florida he's got\nHey Brian Scott\nI'm I'm I'm the guy that called friday on the ... that yeah that was a storm\nThe problem I have there's three things I have problems with first is politically correctness yup it's a ... and his allies the politically correctness that's in this nation of laws that prevent people from telling the truth we all know\nBlock Obama is why we all know that it will go walk Obama that set the nation against President Trump\nThat Democrats have everything that President Trump is doing because he's a politician as a regular guy and he showed a nation that you can do this job if you're not being paid for by where\nI absolutely and the thing is with Web rubber they beside her last hour they're going to investigate all his ties with Saudi Arabia all ties with Russia does ties with Scott and go ahead do it it's called being an international business that's what he did to become president\nHe shouldn't break all those relationships you should enhanced them there's no they're they're he's allowed to have relationships by the way Bush was tight with Saudi Arabia to\n[noise] [noise] I talked to was from seven to ... find to I'm going to be the gas station [noise]\nYears so Newt Gingrich had a different take not necessarily against us but he was ... live in a last night on life liberty and lived in cuts forty seven\nAnd so from\nBecause he was running as a Republican\nAnd because he he he has no hostility to conservatism is just to think about a much\nAnd he has enormous hostility to political correctness and liberalism\nBecause it just doesn't fit how he thinks the world works\nThe most disruptive presidents we've ever had because because he's not afraid to take on the establishment every single morning\nHey I don't disagree with that and the dimension of Andrew Jackson resonates with you obviously a and it resonates so I think with a lot of Americans who recognize that Jackson was he was kind of our our first real populist president who understood the relationship between American power\nAnd where America needed to be as a society where as directions and he gets a lot of bad press because of trail of tears in San and I've written about the fact that Jackson is not the person should take the blame for\nWhat happened with all that but the point is is that if you if you compare Theodore Roosevelt view of America's role in the world and Donald Trump's\nOr they are I Would say if not identical certainly parallel in ways that I think Americans right now I began to realize we actually gained a great deal by this new approach to America's role in the world\nAnd the way he was viewed that Teddy Roosevelt to in the beginning they saw this guy was to robots almost comical and the way he handled himself he was vice president thrown out in the last minute to unify ticket I guess get New York's a threat or a police chiefs I run riders fryer guy so and he was self promoting in many ways\nSo and they've only help it and you know what ... and ... that that that that tweet Twitter is Trump's bully pulpit and it's a way in which he's been able to change the political dialogue in this country in extraordinary ways that we haven't really seen the end of\nThe people don't accept them they didn't accept a Roosevelt in and he took on business by the way but they didn't accept them really in Washington they never accepted Donald Trump he took his case to the people Teddy Roosevelt took his case of the people and they seem oblivious to criticism\n[noise] totally and he is also a dumb mistake that Roosevelt made was in Nineteen twelve you split the Republican ticket and let Woodrow Wilson into the White House by running\nAnd that hurt him both as of figure within the Republican Party but it also opened the door to someone like Woodrow Wilson and a progressive agenda both internationally and nationally that we are still trying to sort out and still trying to clear out today\nIs that Roosevelt gets his you know we'll McKinley gets killed yep right so he becomes president he finishes McKinley term than wins reelection and then says he's done and then says he's finished in ... become handed over to ... in this country which was that in in anything\nIf anything it was in many ways a reversing some of Roosevelt overreach and the progress by especially in domestic politics but Roosevelt also keep in mind too he was our first real colorblind president you know he invited Booker T washing to come to the White House he was a firm believer also in the idea of what we call the melting pot\nRight not the end of hyphenated Americans he would look at the situation with illegal immigration and sort of saying well we need immigrants who become Americans we don't need America as a haven where people come in order to preserve and to maintain a political or cultural identity which is antithetical to what America represents where America needs\nGo so you know the presidents are shortcomings you know his successors he's anything but traditional and he's he gets up every day he's a unorthodox to say the least but us somebody is in the story and and like David or um or David Hanson\nVictor Davis Hanson and others are open and you know look at General Keane just say okay I Know how things the only one but I'm open to see if this is going to work\nSo I'm just stunned to see the anti Semitism or the anti Semitic and gunmen walk into a synagogue kill a loving people in cold blood and people are drawn back to Donald Trump listen to Jonathan Weissman he's in New York Times jeopardy editor listen to this guy cut nine\nNot over what is it\nAnd the president has shown a reluctant time and time again to Charlotte supporters and hit the orange and yellow that I'm not calling you a writer I think you're right that's right that's the case where am I Believe that he had on their side and he pushed back\nHard enough that they are with\nThis guy is hates Trump so don't yet he hated Trump ... Israel Trump does Trump of eighty he's gets criticized because he's too tight with Israel\nIt's a it's a guilt by association but it's so typical of the media's response to Trump's you know what\nThey're ... they live on Trump Trump has made them possible to maintain ratings to keep themselves in the public eye and the only way which they can deal with this is and they're declining ... relevance and declining influence\nThat Trump presidency represents is to get more and more extreme and become more and more unqualified and their attacks on him and in some ways you know I watch this with people that I Know who are never Trump hers and I've watched\nSort of ... if I'm going to use this expression\nWashed their character deform as a result of this is a is there anger feeds on itself towards Trump\nAnd this has happened in our mainstream media look what's happened to the New York times and the Washington Post\nAh the decline of intellectual credibility which was never very high to begin with right on his\nUh end with the with the mainstream media and it's infuriating Brian to watch and I'm no I Know that you you see this happening to those who call themselves your peers but it's also tragedy has nothing to do with\nDonald Trump it has to do with their own growing impotence to shape the national dialogue\nAnd that drives me crazy also they were wrong [laughter] I don't think there is also kind of Donald Trump will never nomination down\nOffice in sort of say do you think do you really think Donald Trump is going on and said yes I Do I think that the media is wrong I think the polls are off the mark here and I said also I said not only is he going to win I think could be a very good president he's actually exceeded my expectations from the point of view of what he's been able to accomplish and what he's been able to do\nHere and he okay he's a bowling a China shop\nBut the American people said you know what it's time to break some ... and we need someone who's willing to do that and they sent down Trump them\nSo you are Michael Gerson speech writer for George Bush hates them rights everyday Abadi is you have George Will despise them doesn't want to be a Republican anymore you a Bill Kristol a someone whose dad really was one of the founders of conservatism and I know very well yeah and now Bill Kristol hates everything he does he can't do anything right by him\nGuys like Frank Luntz who were wrong said listen I was wrong\nYou know guys like Erick Erickson so you know I become I was in trouble but now I'm seeing what's going on and seeing how unfairly has been treated\n'em back in yeah so I give people credit you can be wrong but why you keep doubling and tripling down he's not going to get impeach he's got to finish for years he's already got a plan in place it's going to be easier to get another four there was his first for\nIt I think it will be and and also to there's going to be a deep bench of young conservatives including people like ah like John James the Kennedy Michigan who I think it's terrific and we used a voice in prison Trump ally I dunno I think it'd be great go up there with ...\nYou know go go up to Detroit and do an event therefore for James but you got a deep bench of very able people men and women are who are going to be able to step into and who will\nFunction it that the level that Trump

I Am absolutely for helping people with preexisting conditions we should there's two pieces of Obamacare that we're okay\nOne was that miners can stay on their parents' plan that we don't want any six and two was that we have to take care of folks from pre existing conditions and the Democrats are essentially trying to scare seniors by telling them otherwise there and ah all Americans by telling them otherwise\nTo things on the twenty six year old because I'm seeing now my son's twenty two got a job and they offered him insurance\nAnd a guy that's rare and one of the reasons is when you're a

you do is if you take the pressure off the company and say that you know that person could stay in their parents' insurance\nThat might for young business be aware score a tail and had box we can

his van and sending out these are these pipe bombs too high profile Democrats they're blaming President Trump for that\nAnd it's not just it's not just the Democrats it's their cronies and the mainstream media those people at CNN or a disgrace what those people over at CNN had been doing over the past few days is disgraceful [laughter] no I think we can all agree here\nThat this is America

punished they ought to be sent away\nBut I Want you to hear something and and and I know that there's been a lot of people there have been a lot of people even conservative commentators that bought in to the mainstream media narrative and you say well Todd what is that narrative here's the narrative that you're going to hear even from conservatives this is the narrative [noise]\nWell we need to tone down their rhetoric on both sides that's the narrative that somehow the Republicans are just as guilty as the Democrats that ladies and gentlemen is not true that ladies and gentlemen is

it I mean this is that they are completely unhinged and they've lost their minds here but they're literally trying to blame Donald Trump for everything now back to this invasion story because again this is a major story\nNow we are I mean we're talking as as many as fourteen thousand people are headed towards our southern border that is an army we also have received word there is another Caribbean coming up from El Salvador\nSo here's the breaking news at this hour of Fox News can confirm that President Trump has um it it's going to send as many as five thousand troops to the

illegal\nImmigrants a year end to this country but coming to over run our borders\nAnd to ah to circumvent our laws is not the right way to come and uh I support General Mattis and the and the

I'm In a way of treating teen came\nHouse up there in San Diego so [noise] you know I don't want everything in the stock market us that don't want everything in one house ... going to live their short time and I wanted to know your life [noise]\n[noise] um I don't have a\nProblem with you not wanting everything in the stock market I Would not long distance landlord in order to accomplish my goals though so you're talking about keeping the homeless by foreign Pensacola when you moved to San Diego is that what you're telling me\nNo sir uh we have it on the market I I I don't like cash out of this now listen how can I help while they sell for a a ... ... about three fifty\nOkay and uh you're not going to be able to buy anything in San Diego for three fifty\nWell not unless I catch up on retirement investments are you know at two twenty five K now I can afford something up there\nWith how much do you have in non retirement is that all you've got a two point five K. non retirement talking about a half million dollar house then yes or what's your household income or about one eighty okay\nThe reason we tell folks to not buy in the military in most cases is because you're not in the home long enough for it to appreciate enough\nTo sell it and make a profit and also sometimes some military markets have an oversupply of homes on the market they're hard to resale\nSo you've got stuck in it and you lose money on it in some markets in Pensacola would not be one of those markets usually\nAnd certainly San Diego would not be one of those market you're going to see incredible appreciation and incredible market activity in both of those markets you should say so you should be able to get out of this and make a profit on the one you bought there and that's what it sounds like you're doing\nAnd you should be able to do the same in San Diego and I do agree ...\nIf I were in your shoes what would I Do if I woke up in your shoes or I Would either a rent or be I Would pay cash for whatever I bought in San Diego\nAnd that would mean one of two things that neither one of which are going to be comfortable one is I'm not going to I'm not going to spend as much as you're talking about spending instead of spending five hundred maybe four hundred and leave a hundred and non retirement [noise]\nUm or I'm I'm just going to get comfortable in order to have a house like that with having no non retirement investing until I re sell this house now\nIf you re sell this house let's say you bought it for five Seventy five or five fifty use up all your cash or non retirement cash and money from this other home\nAnd it goes up to seven hundred and when you sell it you're probably next move moving to a cheaper market\nThere's not any more expensive markets for you to move to in the military than San Diego that's about to tell us I mean why oh why you may be okay but\nUh there's a couple of other I mean there's one or two but most of the markets would be well most markets in general not just naval markets but markets in general would be cheaper than San Diego I think we all agree to that\nSo if you make some money and you're there are three years\nAnd you sell out you're going to put money back in on retirement investing and buy a less expensive home maybe a larger home but less expensive home the next by and the next station does that make sense yes or the so it's not really a permanent decision even if you use all your non\nRetirement cash although I'm with you I don't think I'd want to use it all I'd probably try to buy something\nIn the for hundreds instead of in the five hundreds leaving me with some cash in non non retirement investing a but the point at your point you're making is from my portfolio standpoint I don't like it all being in one house and I don't like it all and I don't like so much\nIt's not for that long you're not going to be there ten years\nAnd if you are that that makes us going to change during that ten years\nI Am but if you're not then you're going to reset your mix when you buy a different type of real is different expense of real estate in the next next location that your station I thank you for serving your country sounds like you're doing a good analysis on it I'm just kind of joining you in the discussion Jason is with us from Tucson, Arizona Hi Jason how are you\nYeah how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nUh I I own my own business and I'm a try to figure out how not to be climbing on their horses when I'm ... years old what we're retired and they should I go or well\nOkay well you need to start or retirement I guess I\nDo you well the first thing we teach folks to do is to get out of debt and have an emergency fund before you start retirement and the reason is because if you don't have any payments you have more money\nFor up to put into retirement and then we want you to put five Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement Jason what do you make a year\nA boundary around a lot I average probably right about a thousand elite okay so somewhere around fifty grand a year okay yes rate and how old are you I'm thirty four and okay good do you have any debt no good for you are you single\nNo fair okay does your wife work outside the home yeah you're right and there's what did she make a right about that and get all kinds of All right so you got about a hundred and twenty thousand dollar household income and no doubt\nThirty four years old well done well we want to have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses that's grandma's rainy day fund and then we would tell you to put Fifteen Percent of your house\nCase going into retirement and now you're asking how to fund that if if she as a nurse has her for three or four one K. available at our hospital or a doctor's office\nYou would put some money there especially if there's a match and then you both need to do a Roth IRA you can do five thousand five hundred each that's eleven thousand dollars of the Eighteen that we need to be putting in right there\nAnd put that in good growth stock mutual funds and Jason to help you set that up and teach you how it works just because you need to learn how it works you don't do it because I said do it or someone else said do you do it because you understand it and you don't buy something you don't understand when it comes to investing\nThat I recommend good growth stocks mutual funds for your long term investing in your for one case in your Roth IRAs\nAnd if you want some help with that go to Dave Ramsey dot com and

piece of paper\nOr to undergraduate degrees and master's degree it's just like is this worth it and um so I think when we paid off our first student loan\nUm that was just such a victory feeling for us and I'm so it was really hard at the beginning to go from letting our money kind of flow out wherever to really nail down a budget and during the envelope system and\nThat was hard for me to the I think for me it's\nDo you spend money and buying mood nice things and I'm just constantly you know talking ourselves that will be later and you know when we went through the class and although it's kind of what you always say but it really\nIt's been embedded in me is just you know live like no one else so that you can live like no one else in a really close to that because there were times where we wanted to give up or they would have been easy to just you know do by what we wanted but\nTo be here now to be able to talk to you and all these people and just say that we did it it's just

I had the the money to put down on the house but I didn't I wasn't able to show income so the house was actually purchased at my father's name ... once I had\nYes sir it's a it's been a state I graduated here and my parents knew because the job opportunity\nOkay so the scholarship is partial\nYes sir how much of a scholarship that you get\nAt twenty thousand ever for years there wasn't a large one\nTwenty over four years and it's a four year program I take it\nYet they're trying and what does it costs\nIt costs ... yearly\nOkay of which you have five it's actually need eight Yes sir plus you need to eat yeah there's that detail right where are you living with friends family what\nI'm living with friends we are split a house out in the country because it's cheaper you\nAnd some plans or room much effect okay and so you have rent and electricity your ... and you have food and you need to go and you need eight thousand dollars a year and yet they're okay so when we add all about up what does your rent and other stuff cost you a month\nCost me about nine hundred thousand depending on like that and ah I work minimum wage and\nSo let's let's kind of had that up then I get about twelve thousand dollars a year for that and I need a thousand dollars a year for ... for tuition and some other you probably some books and some stuff too but we're pretty close their show twenty thousand dollars a year as what you need to earn\nTheir and minimum wage doesn't do that sounds like you need a new job [noise] and I have an opportunity to get a whole ailing family name brand clothing and and now I don't have the money right now\nNo need to get into that you never stop you need a job you need to [noise] so you can make more you can make 'em Fifteen twenty dollars an hour babysitting and ... you can make\nGood money cleaning houses Fifteen dollars an hour or ten dollars an hour cleaning houses I'm walking dogs or other stuff\nSo I I think we need to get your doing something along those lines and the other benefit of those are not only do you make a lot more than minimum wage\nAnd by the way you make enough to work your way through with the numbers that you and I are discussing here\nI'm In um you are gonna be working all the time though and if you but if you can get a situation like that the semis self employed where you're cleaning some houses you're doing some nanny and you're doing some whatever [noise] um and you\nUh you can control your time and you can make more money you can control when you work\nAnd how much you work now you are going to struggle\nBecause you're going to work and study and go to class\nBut you can make it if you do that the other thing I Would do is I Would apply for a bunch of\nParticularly in your immediate area talk to the nursing school and see if there are any of them that if you agree to work for them for a couple of years after school how much of the nursing they would pick up for you\nOkay kind of an indentured servant type program if you've ever heard of those\nAnd I married a hospital that actually planning our cat and they will forget all my life to get out like that in fact\nWell let's see if we can get a job over there now and let them just pay for it now okay rather than have to pay you back for student loans because I'm trying to keep you out of student loans with the mouth were you in are doing here\nSo I Want you to apply for a hundred more scholarships you'll get turned down for most of them but if you get another five thousand it really helps the situation a lot I Want you to think about doing different things for work that make you a lot more money and you can control the time\nAnd I want you to investigate with this hospital or what they will do and talk to the nursing school about ... anything they can do to help you as well that you're working your way through but\nYou you sound like you are to me just talking to you you're you're very very mature for Seventeen years old and it sounds to me like you're a rock star thinking and so I don't think you need to play beer pong his real\nHigh [laughter]\nThink you don't mind working and and grinding and hustling grind to get your way through this and not come out of this with you know forty fifty ten thousand twenty thousand dollars a student loan that you don't need to\nBut you're going to have to make some very distinct and very careful choices to do this and the good news is you're living expenses are very reasonable Andrew tuition is very reasonable and the third piece of good news is you've chosen a fabulous career\nIn terms of employment you will be able to get employed\nVery very well but I Would go talk to that talked about a hospital administrator at the local hospital just set up an appointment with them and just walk in there like you own the place is a kind of a you can do that\nAnd uh just tell them that they need to pay for your school and then you'll promise to work there how's that work\nAnd how can you help me get through school because I don't want a bunch of student loan debt I'm trying to not be a statistic and you know get get him impressed with you and and let him help you be a hero in your story and a him or her that hospital administrator\nWho by the white needs nurses so they're going to be very intentioned\nA very very inclined towards helping someone in your position especially someone who walks in and ask for help and walks in and says what can I Do to earn some help and so on and um you know get get some people on your side helping\nYou accomplish this um this task in front of you but you're on your way you're doing really good congratulations very proud to talk to you call me back if you need help is you're fighting through this Greg is with us in Milwaukee Hi Greg how are you\n[noise] Dave thank you for taking my call how are you today better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] well I just have a question for you I'm On a way out our portfolio and get your opinion on a couple of things here [noise] um my wife and I don't have any debt out with the exception all of our house [noise] um we do a lease our cars\nAnd [noise] um [noise] we do that um I have a customer and that and a good client of mine that\nI reciprocate or the money that they spend with me back with them so it's kind of a win win situation\nUm for both of us here [noise] the main question that I have is we have\nUm [noise] some investments 'em over a hundred thousand dollars with um\nOkay I have a four one K. actually is a pension I'm as well and right now we are\nPaying above and beyond our mortgage um bought a house by about ten to twenty percent and and putting that toward the house with the amount of investments that we have diversified compared to what we're putting into our houses is that the right formula\nWe tell folks but Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement once you're dead freaks up the house and have your emergency fund and above Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement and your debt free except your emergency fund then I Will put everything above that towards the house till the house is paid off\nSo take your income sounds point one five\nMake sure the total of all the ... and four\nOne K. contribution you're doing is essentially that I'm not ready to them that much greater than that back some of the contributions down a little bit\nAnd try to balance it out or if it's not up to that as you get it up to that\nThen we suggest you put an equal phones or categories gross resident gum aggressive growth and international [laughter]\nI get asked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nLife insurance is not part of the baby steps because it's needed when your family has debt and not enough savings to provide for their financial aid that's when they're at the highest risk and no matter where you are in your baby steps it's a necessity not a choice this includes working husbands\nI only recommend ... life insurance since\nIt's the most affordable way to get the right amount of coverage and not break your budget go to ... dot com or called eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two these\nAre the guys I personally use ... life insurance is inexpensive and your family needs this no matter where you are in your baby steps that ... dot com or call eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two Zander dot com\n[noise] um I have a question for you so we've been following your baby steps for a little less than a year now and I feel like we are on a bit of head on retirement but we're\nBehind on college savings for two kids show how old are your kids you on they are twelve and ten\nOkay and how old are you guys we are forty six okay and how much is in retirement I'm a little over a million ... your head congratulations ... so what's your household income\nThat isn't always feel that way but yeah we we are I mean when you have one without even dollars you're millionaire yes okay yes you're Iraq [laughter] so ... what is your household into a little over two hundred\nOkay so why can you not say Fifteen Percent of two hundred and still catch up and have plenty of money for college when you've got to years before college\nWell we're paying for private school right now as well what are you paying for brown to how much cash how much are twenty thousand a year per kid or total turtle okay you make fifty when looking at you like to join you make two hundred I mean one eighty okay\nAnd by the way if you can cash flow twenty dollars a year for private school that's that cash flow can be turned towards cash flow in college to choose a college it's reasonably expenses\nYes okay okay that's a good point and yes All right so\nI I you know Fifteen Percent of your household income going into retirement you don't need it you're in good\nActually do a written budget on a two hundred thousand dollar your income twenty thousand out for kids' school today we're going to offset some of that was cash flow in some college but some college we want to invest and set aside and put Fifteen Percent of ... side so we're talking about thirty thousand are such fifty thousand bucks going into these two things\nCollege in ... I mean I'm Sorry a private school in retirement and then we got to say something college you say ten grand a year per kid another twenty grand you can do that\nA front for from now until I go to school they'll have plenty of money\nI mean you just Jack up to five twenty nine and pick out good mutual funds that you control and saw that five twenty nine get or the one of the smart vest her prose and they'll help you do that click smart ... de Ramsey dot com for a list of them in your area the people we recommend them sit down when you help me with a five twenty nine together\nAnd popped in Grand a piece in those two I don't think you have to cut retirement back but if you're putting more than Fifteen Percent into retirement than you are not working our plan at this stage\nBecause you put Fifteen Percent into retirement until college and is done and houses paid off only when those two things are done and then you're a baby steps seven to increase retirement beyond Fifteen Percent\nAnd Fifteen Percent or two hundred thousand thirty grand\nSo that that's how I'm doing the math here I think you can do it I think you just gotta sit down and not have this vague worry about it\nAnd instead of having an actual game plan we lay out and go this is important this is more important than other things that we're doing that we need to stop doing so that we can do this and that's ten grand a year per kid for college\nTo kids that's twenty grand if that's what I mean you've got is where you are so good questions thanks for joining U.S Open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Donald's on Twitter at Dave Ramsey\nAt Dave Ramsey I guess what you're saying that we're just buying a home fallen the baby steps after baby step three your debt free\n\nNot move into a home broken in Sallie Mae will need her own bedroom you do not need to buy Sallie Mae her bedroom they're not buying a home when you're broken and down the hall and will be a curse I Want the home to be a blessing\nAnd when you do things right it's a blessing when you do things on the order and you get\nIn a hurry because everybody needs to house price cap I have a house ... ...\nThis is what broke people say\nAnd then they buy a house on the world and you know what a house as when you're broke it makes your broker and broker and broke her while they call a mortgage sweltering your blouse and\nThis or that Iran's you show\nThe seas seas\nFolks let's talk about finding a ride home for your family the amount of new homes built continues to trim upward year after year\nWhile those can be a great option it's not that simple you're just not picking up paint colors on open floor plan there are many potential pitfalls you could run into is the process was approached with expertise to caution\nThe builder has an agent representing their best interest not necessarily yours\nThis is why it's crucial grab a real estate professional guiding you through the process was on your team our endorsed local providers are on the top ten percent of agents in their area no\nBang for your buck they have the heart of a teacher so you never feel lost in the process don't take a risk on your biggest investment get an agent who looks out for you visit they Ramsey dot com slash E.

economic\nProblem\nReally interesting article this week in the federalist federalist dot com the federalist dot com if you want to look up the article the article says the research proves the number one social justice imperative is marriage\n\nI don't have time to go through the whole article but this is just really intriguing research says just Seventy years ago social mobility and protection from poverty\nEducation marked the Gulf separating the haves and the have nots\nFor the last Twenty years or more they'll marital status has increasingly become the central factor in whether our neighbors and their children rise above remain or descend into poverty the research is astounding\nIn Nineteen sixty the poorly and moderately educated we're only ten percent less likely to be married than the college educated with both numbers quite high eighty four Ninety four percent respectively that parity largely held until the late Nineteen seventies\nOr either the sexual revolution by the way professor Bill Galston president of Clinton's a President Clinton's domestic policy adviser and now he's senior fellow at Brookings explained that in the early Nineteen nineties that an American need only to do three things to avoid living in poverty\nGraduate from high school [noise] Mary beef for having a child\nAnd have that child after age twenty\nOnly eight percent of the people who do show he reported will be pour\nSeventy nine percent who do who fail to do those all three well before if you fail to that wait until after twenty to have kids wait to have kids until after you're married and graduated from high school you're Seventy nine percent more likely to be in poverty only eight percent who follow the sequence\nAre in poverty you want to do away with poverty get it in the right order that's what the data shows\nFrom high school get married have a kid after you're married after twenty those are the only thing she got to do and then you have a Ninety two percent likelihood you won't be in poverty you have a Seventy nine\nSo you're preparing for separation how long have you been married\nOh about twenty two years oh my gosh\nOn a page anymore um and uh what other things a little money as well and that shift a shift or something I if I don't want to go on let\nMhm have you guys missing a marriage counselor\nThat I think he's not going to\nHave you gone yeah OK please do that for you even if he won't go okay I think it will give you good I'm emotional information twenty two years is a long time and you need to\nHave somebody walk with you who's not in the fog if you go through this and or give you some in maybe maybe give you some information to give him a little bit of a wake up call as well but back to your original question\nI have a friend of mine that teaches divorce recovery recovery after a divorce and um I remember many years ago hearing her say divorced turns a marriage into a business transaction\nAnd so it it comes it's a real quickly the emotions are carved dolphins set over to one side and the actual technical legal financial details are on the other side and it becomes very transactional kind of thing at that point does that make sense\nYes and so on here here's a couple of things to look at your student loans or your student loans are going to go with you unless you know you may or may not get alimony child support or something else but your student loans are going to go with you um and you're gonna have to pay them so what is your personal income\nOr if they took out\nOkay All right and so what you start doing is if this is a a direction that you you know after seeing a counselor and\nFor living on your own for fifty thousand bucks a year and you you look at your student loan how much their mom dad if you got\nYou got to Kim I'm Sorry the al ... oh my lord okay\nWell how would let them know that this was going on hardship the fertile until you get past ah what else whatever else is going on here okay now do you own a home\nYeah what's it worth to hydrate out what's out on it\nOr a high tech savvy Abby\nOkay so no equity there to amount to anything I mean he's your car paid for yeah is he has corporate for yeah OK is your name on that loan yeah good okay are there any credit cards that have both of your names on them\nAnd they're worried that out here she met him ... I'm Sorry\nYou were let him yet oh better than that close that account today\nJust completely closed the credit card\nIf he has the number he can use it\nIf he's one of the users on the car [laughter] here yet and if things go sideways emotionally inside your house\nI have run into situations in Thirty years of doing this where somebody takes Mexico drip and puts it on the guard and you don't want to pay for five thousand dollar cruise for somebody else you know and it'll end out on this card so close the account today just completely shut it down to zero balance\nYes good close okay the ... does your checking account have both names on it\nYeah okay sure your money separated by march is there any other debt or dead instrument that's open that as both of your names on it\nHere's what happens you can't afford to keep the south ... you can't stay there yeah um so the house that needs to either be refinanced to get your name off of the mortgage or sold you cannot stay on the mortgage and give him the house that would be dumb\nAnd people often do that in a divorce\nThey often do that but just you know the negotiation is the cars in his name he keeps his car your cars and your name you keep your car you're checking accounts are already separated there's no other debt you get your student loan debt I'm ... does he have any big savings or investments or to you and for one case\n[noise] I'm not big now how much am I have I have a ten thousand mhm four one K. and I'm not sure what he had um but I'm thinking about five or six thousand not much at all okay not far more to it as well as his income\nUh it's around Ninety thousand okay\nIn most states your attorney would have to advise you but in most states you would be do some alimony after twenty two years\nAnd that will going with your fifty thousand is how you will reset your life and stay out of debt and start working your way through these student loans that are outrageous and we're going to take some time to work through\n'em but you're going to be working extra job you're going to be doing everything else taking any any money you can squeeze out of your budget and you are not going to Mexico you gotta mess on your hands [laughter]\nOkay no I'm not here\nSo I'm unless it's to escape no just kidding [laughter] ah but the ... so you know you're going to be on beans and rice rice and beans you're going to get the cheapest department you can get you going to stay debt free an address these student loans as soon as you can get stabilize ...\nAfter the separation which will lead to a divorce unless it leads to you all getting back together okay\nA position of strength to negotiate\nIn the divorce financially um and that's something that you'll have to do and your attorney and you get representation and you'd be ready to pay them pile up money for deposits and for paying them don't pay extra on the student loans until you get the other side of this and I'll just put 'em on ... and pay nothing right now\nBut let's get the other side has but my hope is is that you guys you can see a counselor who can give you some words to say some tools\nTo get by by wake up call maybe the two of you shut down with a coach a counselor and walk you through turning the corner on all of this before you get so far around the corner we can't get you back and may be you can save this thing I I that would be best for everybody involved I'm\nAssuming the issues that you have that are causing you such concern or a draft\nAnd I'm sure that I'm sounded like a pretty long list but um ... see a counselor for your sake call your pastor say who can sit down with that can walk me through\n'em\nIn the right questions to ask myself the right questions to ask him um 'cause he may think you're kidding oh he may think you're bluffing and when you actually move out it may it may wake him up and he may be willing to work on that list at that point I don't know\nBut those kinds of things are best guided by a really good marriage counselor\nThat's really experienced in wise and\nA godly council a will help you in that situation and I sure hope you guys can turn that around that would be my hope for you it'd be better for all of you are financially as well as everything else\nSo good question thank you for joining U.S Open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five you jump and we'll talk

as recently as about three years ago um started doing if you think we are we ended up selling your house to get out of debt I'm\nFrom New York teaching a my father died about five years ago on a motorcycle accident and um there were a bunch of life insurance policies that went through our personal financial adviser has been advising my mother ever since then um and the question that I have is he put her in in the ... about um\nFive years ago whenever my dad died a three hundred thousand dollars into the annuity um and then the other investment Egypt and back then and they've been growing a little bit here and there um but the question is the annuity rift recently we hit the five year mark and ah he's\nAdvising her to pull the money out and start investing in which I think is a good idea however the question is is that she should have should have had that\nThe money invested initially at the beginning of the ah term\nYou know and put up putting putting in ... she brings home about thirty five hundred dollars a month in retirement and Social Security but she doesn't meet the draw and unity at all you know and he knew this at the beginning of the time\nWell yeah you're right that makes me question and other things that are going on that I don't know what they are um you um but I I I and I am I personally would have put all of it and do good investments at the time um you know it is\nAnd how much is in investments total this three hundred plus\nYeah we're looking at probably about four hundred and twenty four hundred and fifty thousand a total with all the investment to how another ... to ... you know how I'm honored their\nHow old is she uh she thinks she just turned sixty okay All right cool and\nThen she didn't write out or you're not like an old ... year old ... on our way out right out\nGood I'm feeling better at fifty seven to hear you say that so I'm a I'm not on my way out today either a\nAnyway or at least at the mouth to my knowledge anyway so yeah I I'm probably going to question all of that I mean it's um\nIt's not it's not like you put her in whole life policy which will be like a deal breaker or something silly like that I mean it just the annuity is is you know got a lot more fees to it a lot more commission to it and if it was a variable annuity in the money was in good mutual funds are probably performed okay\nThere okay um but it's not my favorite thing to do but it's not to the point that I like question his entire competency I just really want to know\nIf it wasn't right for her then if it's not right for her now why wasn't right for her then that's a good question in your mind Mr advisor\nAnd um I think you've got the right to ask that question and talk it through with them and if you can't get a comfort level or if he goes up on you and starts having an attitude and that's when you know it's time to move to anyway\nSo you do that with any financial people or people that are advise you on technical matters\nWhen they start

Diego for three safety\nLoan not unless I catch up on retirement investments should ah you know at two twenty five K now I can afford something out there\nI watched the rabbit on retirement is that all you've got a two point five K. not retirement\n[noise] uh about one eighty [noise] okay\nThe reason we tell folks to not buy in the military in most cases is because you're not in the home long enough for it to appreciate enough\nTo sell it and make a profit and also sometimes some military markets have an oversupply of homes on the market they're hard to resell\nSo you get stuck in it and you lose money on it in some markets in Pensacola would not be one of those markets usually and certainly San Diego would not be one of those market you're going to see incredible appreciation and incredible market activity in both of those markets you should so\nSo you should be able to get out of this and make a profit on the one you bought there and that's what it sounds like you're doing\nAnd you should be able to do the same in San Diego and I do agree real estate prices are up substantially um I'm not sure that you have to use all of that I Would probably if I were in your shoes what would I Do if I woke up in your shoes\nOr I Would either a rent or be I Would pay cash for whatever I bought in San Diego\nAnd that would mean one of two things that neither one of which are going to be comfortable one is I'm not gonna I'm not going to spend as much as you're talking about spending instead of been spending five hundred maybe four hundred and leave a hundred and non retirement um or\nI'm I'm just going to get comfortable in order to have a house like that of with having no non retirement investing until I re sell this house now if you re sell this house let's say you bought it for five Seventy five or five fifty use up all your cash\nA non retirement cash and money from this other home\nAnd it goes up to seven hundred when your salad you're probably next move moving to a cheaper market\nI mean Hawaii Hawaii maybe okay but uh there there's a couple of other main there's one or two but most of the markets would be well most markets in general not just naval markets but markets in general would be cheaper than San Diego I think we all agree to that so if you make some money and you're there are three years\nAnd you sell out you're going to put money back in on retirement investing and buy a less expensive home maybe a larger home but less expensive home the next by and the next station\nDoes that make sense yes or the\nSo it's not really a permanent decision even if you use all your non retirement cash although I'm with you I don't think I'd want to use it all I'd probably try to buy something\nIn the for hundreds instead of in the five hundreds leaving me with some cash\nIn non non retirement investing a but the point at your point you're making is from my portfolio standpoint I don't like it all in one house and I don't like it all and I don't like so much of it being um I don't like using up all my non retirement investing from a portfolio standpoint my answer to that is is not for that long\nYou're not going to be there ten years and if you are that that makes us going to change during that ten years\nUm but if you're not then you're going to reset your mix when you buy a different type of real is different expense of real estate in the next next location that your station I thank you for serving your country sounds like you're doing a good analysis on it I'm just kind of joining you in the discussion Jason is with us from Tucson, Arizona Hi Jason how are you\nHow you doing better than I deserve what's up\nUh I I own my own business and I'm a try to figure out how not to be a crime and under orange is when I'm ... years old but what retirement should I go or oh\nOkay well you know how how do I start or retirement and I guess I Do you ... well the first thing\nThe reason is because if you don't have any payment you are more money freed up to put into retirement and then we want you to put five Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement Jason what do you make a year\nOr ... about her around a lot I average probably right about a thousand elite [noise] okay\nSo somewhere around fifty grand a year okay the affair and out are you I'm thirty four and okay good do you have any debt you know good for you or your single affair okay does your wife work outside the home\nThe idea that nurse what did she make a right about family\nOkay All right so you've got about a hundred and twenty thousand dollar household income and no doubt it\nThirty four years old well done what we want to have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses that grandma's rainy day fund\nAnd then we would tell you to put Fifteen Percent of your household income into retirement\nAnd that's going to be about Eighteen thousand dollars a year in your case going into retirement and now you're asking how to fund that if if she as a nurse has her four oh three or four one K. available at our hospital or a doctor's office\nYou would put some money there especially if there's a match\nAnd then you both need to do a Roth IRA you can do five thousand five hundred each that's eleven thousand dollars of the Eighteen that we need to be putting in right there\nAnd put that in good growth stock mutual funds and Jason to help you set that up and teach you how it works just because you need to learn how it works you don't do it because I said do it or someone else or do you do it because you understand it and you don't buy something you don't understand when it comes to investing\nBut I recommend good growth stocks mutual funds for your long term investing in your ... in your Roth IRAs and if you want some\nLearn

our money kinda flow out wherever and to really nail down a budget and in the envelope system and that was hard for me to\nThink for me it's just the the sacrifice um you know the world we live in just the spirit of comparison and just seeing everyone around you spending money and buying new nice things and I'm just constantly you know telling ourselves that will be later and you know when we went through the class and I know it's kind of what you always say but it really\nIt's been embedded in me is just you know live like no one else so that you can live like no one else and I really close to that because there were times where we wanted to give up or they would have been easy to just you know go by what we wanted but\nI'm to be here now to be able to talk to you and all these

take their shoes along the way from social media and that's scary but I think that's becoming more and more true\nAbsolutely I mean the analytic just let's just say for the look let's just break things down\nSports which is right it's it's it's it is if there's anything that is a meritocracy in this world is sports\nOver the last Twenty years analytics it's gotten into sports where the Dodgers albeit lost the world series their team\nThey kept their for best hitters on the bench\nFor several of these playoff games and throughout the year because of analytics told him to\nThey got to the world series the red Sox when they started this great run in two thousand seven and and you know reversed the personal nine yards all analytics baseball football's becoming analytics basketball's becoming analytics everything is becoming analytics why shouldn't and politics has been heading there\nBut imagine building candidates specifically based on analytics\nAnd I think we're going to get more and more of that\nUh and I think the human side of politics is gonna is gonna be taken out and that's something that that people are going to I'm I'm telling you guys we're gonna have\nTo start understanding of the way this was going and how big these companies are and when they're echo chambers of really only one belief an ideology that to me can be very scary speaking of a myth\nThank you

let's get to work and get the call\nYeah that all sounds great but you know the reality is is\nThere's money and have their money and discord a politics the beauty of politics they never want to give up what they have which is\nPower which is absolute power why would you but when you got something now that\nMany ways I mean normally big business goes to court power where do they go they go to Washington DC they bring their money with them and they say hey we want to court power you guys are the ... in the Dutch uses the royals of our time\nAnd for us to court favorite with you we must then give you stuff we must we must give you tribute and that's what they do get some of that power given to them as well but now you're going to have something that is more powerful than even them which is the way to control information\nWhich will help them so rather than going to them they could say hey we're you know we're able to control the flow of information and that control in itself is more powerful than what you guys do 'cause we can disseminate information the way that we see fit we have thousands upon thousands hundreds of thousands of engineers that are ...\nThis is so while we human beings maybe going we want this want that we look at social media and the way that things go anywhere you see what it takes in social media it doesn't take millions it takes a few to do to create such a skirt\nAs to force changes in companies in all kinds of things that's scary\nI did it last week Mitt I continue that I've talked to several politicians who've said that they fear not their entire constituent base but a few who have power and influence inside of social media that can be held for them\nAnd many of those people that may be helping them have very little to do if anything with their constituents and the basis where they are but that fear factor is real and I think this is going to be a bigger play and then when you've got things like\nShadow banning and you've got things like you know you post something on the Internet that seems to be completely you know to knock it\nBut they deem it to be bad and they pull you off of there and freedoms and speech oh it's going to be

super\nWe have a Democrat and the oval office in January of twenty Twenty one there's going to be so much work to be done I mean we have confused everybody in\nThe world including ourselves we confuse our friends and our enemies like they have no idea what the United States stands for what we are likely to do what we think is important and so the work with the work that I feel very well prepared for\nI Am going to be doing that let's say oh I have no idea I'm not going to even think about going to get through this on November ... election\nYeah yeah she is a well she's perfect for the the whole thought process of of of analytic she's kind of a robot somebody said shed so you just think they're going to be actors I think there'll be what they're going to be is there no longer going to have their own thought\nAs far as they'll have their ideas do other views there still be human\nBut their views will be more based on what's taking place on social media and how the information is being shaped at how people feel about it\nThan the actual views they have they may believe in something and they find out that social media is telling the analytics don't jibe with what you believe in care so as we all know both sides of the aisle will pivot as they see necessary because it's more important to hang on to power than it is another thing else so the analytics will drive their viewpoints\nMore than their actual viewpoints themselves some of their viewpoints they match up\nAnd be popular\nIn the social sphere but some of them may not three two three five three twenty four
