a last month\nYeah they were booms and ... or if you go on line and you look stuff up and you look at the data there are a nuisance and a lot of places\nIt's still tough but if that fuzzy thing right if it's a weird fuzzy thing because if he would've\nCaught a tiger shark and he would have posed with it people have been like if he would've killed an alligator they show on television when gator hunters right\nFor teeth jethro with his hat sideways and they're outside\nKilling gators and nobody seems to care but this is one of those things where people get\nHere he is with the with a giraffe this picture with a leopard saying I shut a leopard super cool super lucky but it is this photo of him smiling holding up the bodies of a family of ... including a baby right there in the front that's raising them most higher writing I shot a whole family of bad loans\nAnd now he's resigned today a and a lot of people who are out there\nWho are who who are are game honors you know even James Woods who's a conservative came out last night said this stuff is ridiculous or look for some of these things and this includes like when you go out and you see a lot of these people who hunt draft and things of that nature but a lot of times they allow you to do it because\nThis draft serves no longer a ...\nSigns and continue to reproduce so in doing so you're sending the herd and it looks awful horrible but this was you know you've gotta you've gotta be socially you just have to be aware you have to have some idea and hunters are not thrilled by this because it makes them look bad\nEvolved or from pro hunting group Idaho for wildlife says fishers actions send the wrong state knows\nHe should have been fired immediately the governor of candy and she was doing a lot of damage\nFor hunting and he said he came out and said look I haven't done anything immoral I haven't done anything wrong I didn't break the law\nAnd we had this knee jerk reaction all the time to go after people and things is it a good look no had what his life be different if he didn't send those pictures elsewhere absolutely his life would have been different if he to kill the hundred gators or a hundred sharks nobody would have\nBut when it comes to fuzzy things you got to watch\nThe pictures parking comparisons to the so the lion who was a popular attraction for visitors and as we actually can feel he was killed by an American hunter and twenty Fifteen\nOh God the other and has no like super popular with people are flying over to ... like\nMemory call system or they look who's the seats on the line and you do you have no idea that was right but then it's got all those death threats and all that stuff you know people need to do with al ... idea a but this guy again has as as resigned yesterday\nUh but [noise]\nYou have to understand the social implications of stuff like this and know who you're showing things do\nAs for Fisher who he tells in Idaho newspaper he was surprised at the reaction to his traps apologizing for sending the photos but not for hunting sane I didn't do anything illegal I didn't do anything unethical I didn't do anything and moral\nThere that may be true but now you got no job and you are you today\nPeople were like well it's it's it's wrong that hunters pay money to go out and to take down these big game it's wrong to do stuff like this well what are you going to do with these animals that's the question because is it is it better if you take the animal and you do want with it\nI'm curious because you're not going to put it in a zoo because live this life in the wild and that would be cruel are you gonna separated and keep it by itself somewhere because you want to feel good about something\nOr you're going to take somebody's fifty grand and some of these instances are a hundred grand allow them to hunted because if you keep more they are and a lot of ways they're not going to reproduce the way they should\n\nYou go to Australia kangaroos are a pain in

Caspian\nSea pacing is a region well worth exploring I welcome my colleague John Candy to comment on the news in these last days you might have noticed\nThat the Federal Reserve has been raising rates for some time now which is consistent with it what it believes it his mission to worry about inflation and employment at the same time also you might have noticed\nThe Italian watch it and how this may or may not be acceptable to the European Union\nIn response to this in the American market there was a dramatic sell off in these last week of of the most popular stocks especially apple and everything else including small cap in Europe they've been selling off for some time and everybody is in tears over breakfast or no Brexit John\nI welcome you tonight because over many years now you and I have discussed central bankers the Federal Reserve\nAnd how they relate to the news cycle and what I've learned from you is that they don't relate to the news cycle it's just our understanding that when the Federal Reserve speaks in some fashion we must react I'm going to guess that I can extend that to the central banker of Europe Mario Draghi\nExplain again John how it is that the central bankers have so much power who is who who warships them where is this cold and how to how do we get out of the good evening to John\nWell John I think economists worship\nCentral banks be a central banks employ a lot of them and economists are the source of information for reporters who are trying to create a narrative about what's happening in the markets and the economy\nPlus remember just as an example economists almost to a man and woman thing that all the maiming killing and wealth destruction that was World War two had an upside called economic growth and so it's based on bad information but we're supposed to believe that the Fed's\nInterest rate hiking its its attempts to hike the short rate of credit which is really all this as a target\nHas somehow out of nowhere spook markets will such a view isn't serious not only is the fed and not a race setter the fed is a rape follower the fed follows markets and moves up its rate based on what the markets are doing\nSo the idea that investors would just now be reacting to what's been known for quite some time isn't serious the markets story is not a fed story but that's the story that the media liked to promote is that is what economists telling his story\nThe Federal Reserve sets a target rage uh for the best lenders we're told John that the best lenders that would be the banks too big to fail even bigger\nAre having a very good quarter and they've had a very good year and all the other indices and indicate that corporations are making a lot of money the profits are very strong that the U.S economy is very strong\nAnd the world and ... the U.S economy does the world also envy our Federal Reserve and its power in other words if the ... is is the Federal Reserve in Washington is that the Federal Reserve

use to\nUm at at least try to convince the Saudis to reveal what they know and uh participate in the investigation and the way that she has laid on his disappearance now going on over two weeks and of course when President Trump was asked about this immediately said no no no we can't\nDo that you know his excuse is reasons where that it would affect us jobs and that Saudi Arabia might\nTurn to us rivals like Russia and China are but it's also important to note that President Trump\nLikes these arms sales because he tells them as a major achievement\nIn the U.S Saudi Arabia relationship that he introduced himself a mostly because when he went to Riyadh on his first ever trip abroad last year\nThe this is what the big announcement was this was the big deliverable this is what he says you can see now if you look at it that a hundred and ten billion dollars is grossly exaggerated some of it it feels that have been in the pipeline through the Obama administration\nSome invade our aspirational deals that may or may not ever materialize and then there's a small subset of that where those deals are actually moving but those deals that are actually moving are now in limbo because they have to go through a congressional process to and there's no way that in this current environment without some sort\nThe Washington Post very simple as that you know whether or not you believe that our arms sales to Saudi Arabia represents leverage that we could use to pressure them what President Trump is done by taking it off the table by saying that actually\nKnow this is something that we need from the study is he's completely reverse that dynamic you turned it into the outer delivered drawn us\nFor no particular reason that I can see you and you know what that's done is sort of now police ... states in a position where any country who is selling us arms has it easy\nOut of jail free card whenever they run afoul of something that we believe violates our norms are rights or you know the rights of our citizens and residents and weak as it is a but it could have far reaching effects and uh it definitely doesn't help six or Mike Pompeo is in\nRiyadh trying to get the Saudis to play ball and back here in Washington President Trump is just taking quiver arrows out of his quiver\nDisappears a genuine geostrategic paradox Josh\nI mentioned that staying with Riad we also have to deal with Iran\nWe also have to deal with Ankara and then there was the Gulf Cooperation council so there are crossed purposes in all directions as we go forward I cheat on the hundred and ten billion dollars of arms sales because that is a way of supporting what is our all ally in the contest with the wrong\nAnd I'm puzzled about Congress and that contest putting pressure on Saudi Arabia doesn't that boost Tehran isn't that also a factor here in addition to the money\nWell you're right there's no doubt that a U.S Saudi diplomatic flare up undermines this trip in ministry ages main diplomatic initiative right now which is to coalesce coalition supports push back again\nWhat the Europeans on that really you know the Gulf fees are the ones that are going to have to team up with us if\nIs Iran strategy that Trump is already announced it already done is is ... it has any chance of\nBeing an success so yes it's a pickle you know there is no clear\nWay out of this for the Trump Administration their tactic right now seems to be uh to to try to avoid you coming to this point where they have to make a decision whether or not to punish the Saudis if and when we actually discovered that they did this\nThing to me that they have this thing\nUm it undermines Trump's administration's plans to roll out of a Middle East peace plan because that Middle East peace plan is\nBased according to the White House on getting Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf countries to throw in and also undermines the effort that Jared Kushner always talks about to build the middle east\nSecurity alliance an Arab NATO out the critics they made us ration will say that all of these policies were destined to fail your anyway the Palestinians are not going to come to the table while the Trump Administration has punishing them there's very little chance Iran is going to come back to the table negotiated deal and Saudi Arabia itself blew up the idea\nSo to speak bad choice of words you of having a Middle East NATO when they started embargo against Qatar so you know if you believe that there was a reasonable chance ... ministers employing off this Patrick I'm really complicated difficult policies of the middle east\nYou have to see that this crisis hurts their ability to do all sorts of things that you can understand why the White House is resisting dealing with his head on\nIt's possible we been on this road for some time and the reports from Yemen about the indiscriminate bombing and the aggression by the the by the surrogate for Saudi Arabia for Riyadh\nHave been have had trouble with Congress for a long time and it looks like that tall now galvanized with the\nRight and you know the there is no doubt that there are some a lot of people who already had issues with us Saudi relationship we are now taking the opportunity of this crisis to push forward an agenda they already had the worst namely to break up the U.S Saudi alliance in ... that but when you add that to the people who are genuinely\nConcerned about the disappearance of Jamal which are a lot of people that begins to create a momentum that could actually have the effect of changing me when I started really we don't know\nHow it's all going to turn out or you know it's sort of Americans generally gives the government a pass to do things or national security that have collateral damage and you know that doesn't really affect the American\nSoldiers right so if the Saudis are killing a lot of\nInnocent people in Yemen you know there there's not a big likelihood that your your average American therefore average congressman is going to raise a big stink outta that but when something like this happening right it can sometimes have the effect of wrong the public's attention to our ally Saudi Arabia and the ... just practice is on a range of friends\nIn a unique way crystallized it for people okay and this is kind of when the relationships change and when you know a a a small movement in Congress to stop the set us aid to Saudi Arabia and the Yemen War can really gained momentum and I think that's what you're\nSaying happening right now ... for the Washington Post time

for global warming\nOf the contrast between fires on private lands which are very low and on public managed plans are very very great if you look at the aggregate I went back and check some of these numbers forest fires down globally about Seventy or eighty percent from what they were around Nineteen hundred\nIt's a striking decline that is going on and so is every you don't want to look at a dramatic incident that day when you have to do is to get aggregate data in\nThe aggregate data doesn't support the claim that the fire system is going out of control and to the extent that there are changes\nThe thought that somehow or they would want to change the entire economy instead of figuring out how to manage forests in a more sensible fashion is wildly over broad you're looking at the wrong thing there are now solutions that would work better\nEven way you build houses the kind of clear as you do and so forth there are many many things that could be done to deal with fires without having to have the kinds of transformation that the PCC is talking\nAbout hurricanes so our side clones the allegation is made that they will deepen and increased in severity and striking the land you provide a chart in your defining ideas sees\nThat suggests we're not looking at increased since we're looking at cycles and this goes back to Nineteen Seventy I'm going to get that if we go back even farther anecdotally will see the same cycle\nYes generally speaking the data gets a little bit spot here's who go earlier but it's the same thing and\nThey were huge hurricanes in Nineteen forty five I still remember living through hurricane hazel in Nineteen fifty\nHurricane of Nineteen thirty\nOf Nineteen hundred oh there are pictures of Houston being flooded in twenty six Tina twenty Seventeen they're also pictures of Houston being flooded in Nineteen thirty five and they're essentially the same kind of picture\nThe cyclical phenomena are pretty much uniform with respect to everything that we look at and and the basic problem the global warming theorists is\nIf in fact you have all these things going up and down up and down\nYou can't explain the ups and downs by a movement in carbon dioxide levels which has been consistently but gradually up with over very long period of time so you've got to get other forces to explain what's going on when Richard Lyndon\nGave his lecture in England but he said it's you know a bunch of other forces like water papers for example that can be doing it and there are other things\nThat are local which do this so if you're trying to figure out the way in which the system works\nIt's a terrible mistake to assume that the only independent very ... you have any source or significance\nAs carbon dioxide the deep pendant variable is temperature or what happens is there is a law known as the rainiest this law which says that given certain sensitivity assumptions as carbon dioxide changes you take the log with them to the base to the base the um it means that you're going to get a\nSlower than linear increase in the amount of carbon dioxide but that's everything else being equal but the moment you realized that water vapor is probably the more powerful greenhouse gas\nAnything you do to change what's happening to carbon dioxide may be able to fix a fifth of the problem but it's not going to touch the other eighty percent of that particular problem so the return from investments are going to be lower\nAnd you don't see anything whatsoever in the ... the\nStudies that I've looked at which kind of try to do an intelligent cost

think that's an accurate analysis because during the time she was there\nAnd we've discussed some examples on your broadcast she has said\nThings about Russia and also by the way about North Korea\nCompletely conflicting what's what Trump himself has said this is very unusual because they're United or you are you in a bachelor normally very faithfully reflects the will of the president you would agree with that yes and yet why Trump is saying that it would be great to cooperate with\nRussia She has literally sat at the un repeatedly that Russia can never be trusted that's a very

Love she dressed all in black and this is Al Gore day after the surging he's had to act very sober and respect\nAnd the CIA named ... that killed he was that ill in February of sixty four eighty four when she met him\nMore than that he was literally living in a hospital during his business as the new general secretary and I think he lasted Thirteen months I mean we're we we divert from the story but it's worth reminding ourselves that at that moment I studied this very carefully then\nIn the early eighties after the death of brushing them in Nineteen eighty two right the Soviet leadership did not want a strong leader\nThey were becoming geriatric they didn't want a vigorous leader who would replace them so they kept choosing literally dying that and Gorbachev at fifty three and robot asked\nOne of them said it was clear that they couldn't stop core bunch all he is criminally young criminal you're young they were already approaching eighty\nWe divert from the story of that but it raises the it also points to another moment when intelligence agencies can have exceedingly important political influence of the top\nAnd that is when there's opposition to the leader and the leader is weak weak physically or I Would submit to you\nWe politically as Trump is today because this cloud of suspicion hangs over him and also because he hasn't quite gotten the hang of how to exercise power in Washington but there are\nLarge openings for quote rogue\nOperations by intelligence today and I think we're seeing\n... leave out when I wanted to do some dates here because I Want to

A. R. K. I. S. L. E. R.\nL. O. A. O. L. dot com\nSo tonight there there are a lot of news stories I Want to talk to you about but one of the things which ties in to the other night is that the Democrats are made it very clear\nThat they are poised to draft articles of impeachment with the Washington Post ABC reporting that nearly fifty percent of Americans support immediate impeachment hearings of course we got to take these polls lightly we know her all the polls were last time I think there are only two that protected President Trump would win and become president\nSo they're trying to keep the somewhat under the radar because they know many moderate and conservative voters would vote against their candidates if they knew what they were up to if they knew as I pointed out the next two years of going to be cast\nThey win the house of representatives subpoena power a hearings impeachment hearings they'll start on on after Trump you know of course they're going to go for taxes they'll go to get Kevin on it's gonna be a disaster if they win\nAnd my you may remember this minority leader Schumer during a parade he denied that this is what he thought he was asked talking about a peach men when he said the sooner the better later on in all I thought they were asked me when we'd get rid of a Trump\nAnd minority leader Pelosi said it's not a priority now unless something else comes forward but of course Maxine Waters has no such restraints calling continuously for the impeachment uh forty five she thinks that the genius line 'cause that's about all you know Maxine Waters I Know of her and I met\nThere's going to be like the next two years if they win the house and a lot of people were very optimistic last night they said that they think there's not going to be a blue wave that the Republicans are going to do pretty well\nBut let me know what you're thinking eight six six Ninety red eye\nBut other political news that I never got to yesterday and I wanted to but it's still in the news tonight that Senator Elizabeth Warren who may have heard this she she might have a huge mistake she had DNA evidence to show she truly was related\nTo Pocahontas actually she didn't say that I said that actually Trump said that I got it from him actually what it showed she has some Native American ancestry in the range of six to ten generations ago\nWhich means she could be anywhere from one sixty

Bernie Sanders of it in the same 'cause that that's what I suggested to a caller\nI think I could sit down with Bernie I have a coke or something like that with him and there's nothing we would agree on seems like a nice guy but the colder than it was a dog news I don't know I'd I'd never could sit down with him\nUm so that's the second question is there anybody in the other side no matter what side you're I could you sit down with Donald Trump I actually heard he's a nice guy that he's got a different persona I don't get mad at me I'm not saying it's not a nice guy that I don't support his views but he comes across pretty bombastic and right\nSo there's lots of things that maybe some of us wish you wouldn't say but they say he's very soft spoken in in in a private he's really nice I Know people have met him and he sounds different so no matter which side you're on could you sit down and be friendly the way I mentioned last night that Ronald Reagan did with the former speaker of the house Tip O'Neill\nThey would have drinks on a friday night or whatever and Reagan was surprised that they would you Tip O'Neill would be so ... of viciously against them during the daytime and he said well that's the time but it's gotten so bad now that we can acknowledge that maybe someone on the other side is okay I made if if um [laughter]\nThey appear to be Cory Booker I mean what a phony what he's so full and so even made it you remember he made that up about he's going to divulge some information even though he's gonna get prosecuting knew he was he just had gotten a memo or something from a McConnell or the other leaders saying he can go ahead and talk about it\nAnd Kamala Harris line of stuff about her why what a phony what another self so so I understand that some of them\nIt'd be hard to sit down with it and I don't know much about mayor or city but I'm not impressed by him but maybe some of them you could sit so I'd like to hear that too\nWho would you be friendly with and number one question was who would you like to see run against President Trump to matter what side you're on so let's go now to a show in Scranton, Pennsylvania Iran with mark\nI Joe

in the rules and\nMark leaving the oh\nI Want to first of all say something under ... refer some English said while ago about if a\nTrump or out in ... game vice president that the speaker of the

not hurting me I corrected that in the last hour just didn't want to interrupt them at the time I live near\n... and which also would would would scare me a little bit if Nancy Pelosi was speaker of the house that would\nReally be a scary thing of that happened but uh anyway I'll talk about the Democratic nominee you know a Joe Biden did um [noise] copied the speech of ... a British\nThat oh yeah I'm actually plagiarize neat yeah I Believe in Iran and\nAlmost word for word there I'll tell you who I who I Would and I'm I'm a conservative but I Do I Would think would would be a good person to

who is that\nThe Jim Webb\nWhen I was a former trainer and he's a former a\nSecretary of the navy and uh\nI just I I don't think he would have a chance or didn't have much chance last time that the Democratic party has so\nMove away\nCandidate even though I'm I'm I'm not a Democrat ... but he he wouldn't even be acceptable to the Democratic party but I Am someone I Would like ... ... he's he's a good man as\nHas good instincts and is able to work across the aisle sincerely and to do things he worked for a Republican president as sex during the night\nOf the people who announced could you pick one of them to sit down and have a cup of coffee with\nOh yeah I I'd love to have a ... who Bernie Sanders\nI think it would be a great how would enjoy that I went into a he would if he would let me talk and if he was listening in here and then and not you know not just a demagogue everything I I like him\nHis personality I don't want you to me that he believes in but uh it would be more I don't have ...\nDo you know what Lindsey Graham said about you know what Lindsey Graham said about Bernie Sanders a little I always have these stores a Bernie Sanders got married in a Soviet Union and some people think he never came back\n[laughter] that's funny than his\nMother and I thought just you know I was like hey Philip thanks for your call appreciate it\nMake your mark ... program\nThank you so much by by oh and here's someone's going to lie I think is going to answer me right away de in Las Vegas Iran with mark\n... yeah I think the one I Would want to have coffee with is a dean at Titus now she ran for governor here in Las ... only two hundred vote to show [noise] and she was a schoolteacher in the sense of a woman and I I really do think that\nIn a Titus could approve of all the dirty tricks and terrible things that Democrats are doing there's just no way\n'cause I'm sure she should uphold there's a lot of those cars that it's just not acceptable and she was raised better than that I Know [noise] so yeah so I was going to have coffee was selling Dina 'cause there's just no way in the world she can approve of any of this okay\n... well except for one thing the I appreciate your call you didn't follow the rules the game was you had to pick someone running for president not that I Know her and I didn't know some of the other candidates running I certainly didn't know them well\nBut the the game was you had to pick someone who's running for president\nAnd say who you would sit down and have coffee with an eye on the other gentleman agreed me Bernie Sanders I that's I think he's a hen right now so we got to hear your votes let us know what you think an eight six six Ninety red eye or right now you have your national forecast or video

wanted to speak to the question of of prosecuting Hillary Clinton [noise] um ... you don't win much real world or if you lose an election you out one or two choices you to leave the country or you go to jail or worse\nRight I mean one of the reasons we're a stable democracy is because there are certain political norms that we don't\nViolate all remember on the set aside the ... the possibilities Democrats going through ten years of Donald Trump's tax returns after he leaves office or think back to the Bush administration a lot of people thought that the enhanced interrogation was unlawful\nRight so so we don't I don't think we want to get into a pattern where the incoming administration prosecutes the leader of the leaders of the ... the former administration leaders of the other party because our our politics have become too hostile\nAs it is we need to take a step back and understand that there are certain traditions\nThat are critical all through our are having a stable democracy that we have and rule of law is only one of the\n... well that's an interesting point because it you know a lot of people and the other side I think he shouldn't be above the law\nBut as you point out that she has a unique position of also having been the opposing candidate which of course doesn't explain what the what what what they what wait a second what the FBI and the Justice Department did with a soft to trying to get rid of the incoming president\nSo this is a very complicated situation and she may I mean that's I think is ...\nRight the Confederate Sam committed treason could obviously committed treason year we did not try to walk them up because it was more important than the rule of law that we come back to get\nGood a good point can I you know I said you may not have heard me I said whoever talks in the last I didn't quite say that but that's what I was thinking on this issue with Hillary a you made a good point that's a great point with the civil war I ... oh you could you have coffee with on the other side or\nI Would probably I Would probably lead toward a Ben Sasse\nUh-huh yeah he's a bright guy\nYeah he's he's things things that are good you did you pass the test you did very well thanks so much\nHere I Am I Can't stay with Tucker cross that have you ever watch than Fox News got these people answering questions in the news that's kinda dumb but this is interesting because\nWho'd you get along with people the way it used to be with Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan you get along people of the opposing party and and get away from the politics for a little while because you would least respected them speaking of respecting them let's go to live in Pittsburgh Lynn you're on with mark\nWell you know I had a rude awakening this morning I uh I woke up and my radio was still on and I heard righteous Joe\nHas a dissertation on how\nI'm basically he can shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and and why you should be able to get away with it [noise] um\nBut as Hillary is concerned um I kinda signed on to the previous caller just right before me [noise] um if she really had broken the law and been found guilty then certainly should be\nA polluted twisted demonic rant and it when I hear people like him talking\nMakes me wish that the Native Americans in this country have bars on the shores of this country to keep his nasty lazy hateful ancestors out of this country\nHow I Would like to have coffee ... on on the other side I'm\nEven though I disagree with most of her politics um as a progressive myself that would be a Lisa Murkowski\nBecause that woman she's a she's a strong woman she's she's an example to to to women on my side ah\nNow that's a woman with some integrity and character and strength ... and she's a bad ass\nWould you have said that if she voted for Kavanaugh's nomination\nNo I'm thinking about some of her actions over a period of time I remember when when uh there was a little scrape with Trump and I'm a she says she wasn't going to live in fear of a tweet\nWow that really knocked me back I was really impressed with that so uh she showed that she's a she's a woman up strength\nAnd character and she's not going to be bullied by anybody on on either side so\nBefore I let you go who's your choice who's your choice of the Democratic nomination\nWell I haven't decided yet I Would like for some of the old you know the old timers to just step aside a here in my uh\nAnd I really like for you know you know with like for more people like him to rise and I don't want to see Joe Biden Lonegan um I think that he's had a history of saying some stupid things and and uh it\nI I Would not like to see him run again a he's a good guy but um you know some of these people just need to step out of the way\nAnd a lot of new crop of progress it's a pump through\nYeah great point Lynn I appreciate your call a especially on the other side [laughter] by the way saying talking about stepping aside so you got Nancy Pelosi in her seventies\nCliburn I think his third in line sending a whole year's in his seventies their own there's nothing wrong with that except for ah she was saying a lot of people would like there was an article about ... times where it was about people stepping aside for the younger generation problem is in the house if you serve in the house\nAnd you don't share a committee you're just ... it is not a very\nUh what can I say a interesting life to lead you know I made it that I'd love to be a congressman viewpoint to me tomorrow that's not what I'm saying but compared to the other positions there\nBut the Democrats have that problem to let me know what you think's or asking to questions who is your choice to run against President Trump and who could just sit down and have a cup of coffee with you guys are surprised me it just evolved that question but you're surprised me 'cause you're picking people on the other side\nThat you admired least could sit down and talk

lot and it's not that I'm trying to um argue with you or disagree with you but I think we're looking at it in a different sense that I think it's not really that I don't think that's the case I think it's more of it's the media so ... and they're out there they don't care now\nThat I've been trying to hide\nWhat tests that they believe in and they don't care\n[laughter] and so because of that they they get so many we find that people that just buy into that garbage and that's why they have this perception of this is the times we live and and but it's not really that I think it's just the media is so abusive but when I get your take on that\nYet you wow you you may have points I should have brought up thank you Daniel the the influence of the media right first of all they don't hide how they feel I don't know why I think of an entertainer when I used to watch Johnny Carson\nOh uh I never knew his political point of view I suspect he was a Democrat or a liberal but he never had it out there now again he was a comedian\nBut but the media is such a powerful role because so many people that's all they hear right the major news channels not so much right now that we have more the blogs and the Internet and all that stuff talk radio\nBut the place to be role and they have an agenda who's the guy from CNN uh the the character that it's always trying to get something on Trump I Can't even think of his name they they\nI don't want to [laughter] I don't have that you may not and I and my producer\nSaying Don Lemon you know I mean right and he wants to publicity and they don't you're right there is any more they don't hide wise they act like advocates and they're not journalists\nOver the problem I have with it is is that\nThis is supposed to be a country that has room for all people are all political parties and as they are\n[noise] it it means that you can also the other people and that's not what America's about\nI I got to answer your but I've got aunts my producer who just told me he said uh Anderson Cooper no 'cause I thought of it Jim Acosta and you didn't want me to give them publicity but the guy and he loves it it's about and so I'm playing right into you know the name I Know you didn't but I'm showing my producer he doesn't have it\nTold me to [laughter] but there's so many of these actors right right they they want to take on the role of being a powerful to and making them then I suppose\nIf we like it so you are complement you win the prize oh like the right of the time who who your choice for president real quick\nUh I like Trump\nOkay I Know but I

three thirty nine and we go to John in Seattle John you're on with mark\nHey mark how are you there I'm here\nAre okay uh my thought is that John K sick I Believe he ran for president as a Democrat and\nI Know you find it a public and yeah\nHe did oh boy [laughter] well you balance the budget\nAnd you know whoever can balance a budget that's who I think should run against Trump or you know ever since two thousand eight we've had quantitative easing we've had just government spending that's gone on and on and on with no end in sight\nAnd somehow you know the somebody's got to pay the piper on that sooner or later\nAnd I think if somebody could make a case to show that they really know how to balance a budget\nThat would be who probably would stand a chance against Trump although I probably wouldn't vote for him on pretty much of traditional values\nConserve you know it's to me a word that is consistent with conservative and you know if it works but it ain't broke don't fix it you know something that works it's a good thing\nOr not I have coffee with is Nikki Haley I Believe she has\nAn intellect that has a global perspective and I have a degree in anthropology and I would really like to sit down and talk to her about where she thinks we stand in the family of nations on this smaller and smaller planet that we have to learn to get along with each other\nIs it is amazing because the lady is surprised me I I thought she was okay as governor of South Carolina but she's been a phenomenal\nOr ambassador to the United nations really letting them have it in a very courageous not being afraid to save like it is she's a very impressive lady I think you're going to run for president maybe you know obviously not this time but in the future\nYeah yeah\nYeah I I mean you don't have someone with a very large perspective on who we are a nation and where we\nWe can be a good a good companion a good name for a good partner in a global perspective I think that's very important\nSo thanks for those ideas ... hold on\nOne second 'cause I'm going to ask you your ... your answer off the question but\nI don't like John ... there's something about the guy\nUh they didn't come across well he did run as a Republican last time against Trump and the others there's something about him that irritates me something I mean I I don't agree with him on everything is a little too liberal for me and that that's fine that's neither here nor there but something personally about him\nI I think he's arrogant I think he comes across that we have heard some things about him I had a former a producer my TV show who said something about women or something like that that was years ago so that's not fair that is a rumor or something about that guy and rubs me the wrong way but you don't feel that way you'd like\nTo bail us budget I mean we we can go on with the kind of spending I mean I Love this country and we have a lot of good programs like head agriculture and you know we need to defend ourselves and\nYou know we we just can't keep going on every time somebody as another lobbyist that it was something that they just get it because they have enough money for the next campaign\nI mean when you get to the point where the debt\nAs the gross national product you know theoretically that's bankruptcy and where we got to find a way you know we've got to find a way to to to have a better reasonable expectation about what kind of ... we can have in this country\nOne of the things I always say is people do not understand that the government\nHas no money of its own you'd be surprised maybe how many people think oh you remember that woman or during the Obama campaign the first ones that\nAre Obama's going to pay for a mortgage and pay for gas and they said where are you going to we're going to get out of his stash stash you know same out of a stash right she he was going to personally paid so people don't know that based on something that the

that\n[noise]\n\n\n\nYou're the Capitol hearing will pale in comparison to what they'll do trying to impeach Kevin I'm trying to impeach Trump\nWith hearings with subpoena powers a with calling for their impeachment it's not going to be fun you\nKnow it's I think it's going to get ugly I personally but that that happens I think that uh nothing good will come out of that problem is\nThat it wouldn't be crazy I mean I I honestly didn't believe anything for that\nTo me I didn't really do any of that it didn't sound credible to me um [noise] I I did a lot of background I have it all and he just seemed like the most honest I used one of the water the what what are the best judges that are on there as of right now in my opinion\nI mean he got older we let her go ahead\nNo I was going to say it seems like a decent guy and you as you started to say over three hundred opinions or whatever but the fact is you know in her case I just think that we're using her as long as we're talking about\nWho should run for president a Democrat side uh Spartacus Booker in I call them that because of his own Kamala Harris they they were just using that woman maybe maybe she mentioned that if someone did do that assault on her\nAll those things are possible but they used their for their own purposes it was disgusting to watch a\nWas difficult it was horrible it was\nI'm not going to put up with this stuff you guys are doing this for power you ... you know now I Want to be ashamed of yourself what you're willing to do I have but that's where they are they ought to be [noise] yeah well thank you so much for the [noise]\nAbsolutely I'll I'll definitely go back again\nThanks so much to him and uh yeah Joe Manchin would be a good pick he seems like a decent guy ah like I said I don't it's not fair for me to take away some of his courage uh when he seems so nice and and reasonable and I think he is going to win but someone who is less than decent I said I mentioned this\nIs Hillary I'd love to see Hillary run again a for selfish reasons I think she is going to run again because these guys\nMeaning Hillary and bill they can't keep away from power\nThat's what the what is an aphrodisiac people say so and the Democrats even have figured that out they don't even want her to enter the fray she's viewed as the kiss of death for democratic candidates in the upcoming midterm election\nForcing the former presidential candidate to stay low and campaign only behind closed doors by the way that makes sense because I sit on the air for many months now you know she's still looking to see a why she lost\nLike she's going to come out I suggested she'll come out with a book a hundred and one reasons why I lost in none of them will be her I have nothing to do with her\nAnd I said she could join OJ Simpson as he looks for the killer to figure out who killed his wife\nBut few Democrats are willing to embrace Clinton on the campaign trail despite the party's near\nUniversal support for just two years ago\nWith many concerns that a high profile Clinton presidents would only dampened apart his prospects of retaking control of Washington from Republicans yeah they're worried about her throughout the mid term elections Clinton is rarely rally together with other candidates appearing mostly at low key fundraisers and loyalty 'cause she can't get many people to show up\nLet's don't wander the campaign for them because everywhere she goes she carries the stench of death when it's worse than I thought and it's the only political figure in America that has less popular than Donald Trump the strategies that and that's a real testament to her\nDemocrats were relieved that the bill and Hillary Clinton announced that there international Thirteen city speaking to her wouldn't begin until after November now that\nThat was a clever move I think they're measuring how they can have the best positive impact and have kind of decided to wait until after the election that's with Dick Durbin of\nIllinois said a house Democrats segment of that saying when I think uh people who've been part of our pushed to retake the house I just don't think of them at all I think it's a very good thing that they're not being visible it wouldn't help our candidates\nBoy one minute you're the nominee for the Democratic party and the next minute they don't want to see anymore maybe that's part of the problem these guys don't know when to get off the stage\nActually but I liked that Hillary can in twenty twenty I liked the sound of it and I like our possibility that she could run up you know like are scams she could run forever right but don't we have forever stamps forever bill and Hillary who'd run you never get rid of them actually\nI can take them a lot better than Brock Obama right most presidents when they leave office they they're quiet and give that credit to George W. Bush\nBut not for Iraq Obama he's in there he can't sit still he can't keep quiet\nSo maybe Hillary and bill they do have some redeeming value for those of us on our side because if they run again like if she runs again\nI think she's going to lose I think we got to get something going on our side Hillary for president in twenty twenty tell me what you think eight six six Ninety red eye eight six six nine o seven same number thirty three thirty nine\nBeen running on traditional mineral oil for the last one hundred years but today's technology brings us other options to consider it a better quality\nUnlike mineral oils synthetic oils have a consistent molecular restructure giving it the ability to support pressures from higher horse power engines especially at lower rpm it also allows oil to reduce friction in an engine controlling temperatures and improving fuel economy\nThere cleaner synthetic pick up fewer contaminants as they do their job of lubrication they also have better oxidation stability\nResulting in an overall cleaner engine synthetic and some I think that ... may be a bigger investment up front but the benefits of its high quality composition will pay off in the long run this report is the surface of shell wrote ...\nBooks with what radio toll free at eight six six he wrote a [noise]\nDish H.

game because the transmission and everything was very difficult so there was a teletype\nHad the guy would type in what happened to the game and then you had some guy\nDuring a re creation and he would have a baseball bat in there and something to hit it against and a a glove in there and somebody to\nPop the glove and everything like that and he would try to make it like a\nReal radio station

would make charts of the races and then we would recreate 'em like they were really happening\nThen and you'd have ... and fun and it had to be fairly accurate\nYes so you had to ... go horse was moving up on the outside or the inside it was very sophisticated so I had a show in which we did that for the Southern California race track mhm\nAnd it ran then or and it was a station what they

S. S. and it never happened before and it's a pretty rough ride and these guys are as we saw friday night when we saw first man these guys are made a pretty stern stuff for yeah you know\nTheir early ... adventurers ... they really really believe\nThat they are doing something good for mankind and that they are helping the future of our world by yes by many levels that they are entirely focused and now it's become very specific in space now certain people\nThey call them a flight assistance oh ... ... in the sense that they have a specific domain\nLike some of them are doctors and they just do medical experiments in space and things like that I give as we've that well we found that there are certain drugs that art and once again we talk meant much about the space program on the show and it's because it has unintended consequences too\nSure that people don't even realize that ... that uh inflatable cast\nThat juicy used in a baseball game or a football game if somebody breaks their leg or hockey game ... and everything like that was developed in space yeah I Know that a lot of products that their competitors many of them had been found and\nConditions yeah and they've also taking like certain medications\nLet's say and I and I'm not medically oriented I don't take any things so I don't know a lot about this but certain drugs for people like maybe their bipolar\nAnd maybe they also suffer from a heart condition ... but they would like to just have them take one pill but instead they have to take two pills\nSo because of the medicines react differently when you turn on the list they can't\nFind a way to put them together and get them both to work oh and so would they have done this a lot of research by sending chemists drug guess people like that in this race and in a weightless condition\nTaken those drugs in bend able to fuse them together in a way that can be replicated when they come back to earth interesting so there's a lot of ah\nOnce again unintended consequences that we're seeing that we get from the space program and I believe that's why it's so important to carry on our work our mission\nWith the international space station with the shuttles were going to the moon with going to Mars with all these kinds of things because I think we gain knowledge that we will never see\nWhile we are under the constraints of living\nOn this planet\nIn a gravitational atmosphere that presents a lot of things from not happening\nAnd I from what I Know even the oxygen intake is very different ah compared to earth as in like the space station because it's a more controlled oxygen\nBut so but it seems like that ultimately do affect you looked at him like that affect the world long term they are definitely the explores they are the Magellan Zen the cooks and the ... and the Columbus says and everything of five hundred years ago\nThey are our explores yes\nWhen I Know it's a tried saying from a star trek going where no man's gone before mhm but here's this astronaut who came down for the first time when he wasn't supposed to and lived to tell about it I saw\nPeripherally headline about it I don't know the story you know more about this story\nWhy and I I Know at the very simplicity of the story from what I saw from watching basically every space launch\nBeen the man involved and that is\nWhy was the what was the reason for his decision to board the mission when\nThey didn't have any decision the ... the mission that would've been controlled by computers from what I understand these errors three stage rockets okay\nYou lift off with the first stage which is a very heavy\nBig horse power engine on the space shuttle for example it was six million pounds of thrust to get that thing off the launch pad through the ionosphere through the area we live in and then\nThe second stage fires and that takes you to a new level and then the third stage puts you in earth orbit\nSo that so and I drove saying well you know this on this ship the soy use that they use yes it's a three stage rocket the second stage did not fire\nAnd then it could not take any higher because they must have ... in order sure of that just makes you go to the next stage it's kind of like happening if you have over drive on your car\nYou know you get on the highway and when you get to sixty five pointed at over driving that kind of shut the engines now same thing they're both in the second stage so there was no they were really come down how they came down it was pretty amazing we're ride and re this\nShow will basically be all election all the time it will give you a lot of numbers you better get your calculators all bones up them and have extra batteries\nI think it I think it's going to be a close close races across the board a and I also think there will be probably more a requested recounts than we've ever seen before\nThe ... most of them recounts now or automatic if it's less than one percent it's an automatic recount basically and I don't know why because of one percent error factor is very very high\nI don't think we'll ever if in fact they use that one percent as the gauge mhm okay maybe if it's you know a lot less but let's say that as one percent\nIf if the within one percent of each other I Can't see any election changing sides with the recount because that's just too many votes to change over there would have to be some fraud involved like\nThe stories of the Kennedy election where there was one voting machine that had Kennedy giving thirty nine thousand votes\nAnd his opponent getting zero\nI doubt that there's ... around yeah exactly and we will find some of that that's ...\nAnd I would say that that's a pretty foolproof operation I actually got to ride with one of our sheriffs and humble county Nevada\nIn the reelection of of of Brock Obama mhm and I rode with him to our closest precinct we had to go to Lovelock\nSure which was a ... a part of the county and get the tape that had all the voting information on it right I don't know what you call that a hard drive or whatever it might have been mhm and literally it was under lock and key\nAnd duplicated\nAnd then we would the officer I was with angel ... or was it in one car and the share of\nWars in the second car and one box was in one car and one was in the other in case we crashed mild which is always a good feeling you know in case you look at least will know who the governor actually as a nuts right so\nThen we brought them back sirens blaring and the whole idea are really yeah and then they came in and then they were taken by a registrar voting cameras sparrow or race Barrow mhm and\nCounted and then a whole different group of people came in and did the identical same tape\nIn these that came out of the other car\nSewed to separate people voted on him so for that to change more than one or two votes where somebody highly unlikely fill out the box entirely\nLike the hanging Chad Jose nominations please can we never go through that again back in and I don't think we will I think we improve beyond that point\nGo is that across the nation\nWe don't have consistent a voting protocol they're not federal machines that are ... machines yes and and ... where some people I don't know if anybody still has paper ballot I'm sure there's some place that does and it's really it's what a municipality can afford\nBecause that ah that comes out of local or you know state or local Crawford out of state money yeah so it just depends on a probably a bidding process um but you know it's not it's not uniform it's not all the same from state to state\nOne of the things that Neil Armstrong said about the space program he said the toughest part about climbing up to the top of that missile is knowing

point one earthquake oh on the Richter scale which ironically enough was invented\nIn San Francisco to San Francisco bay area the quake caused\nSixty seven deaths over ... hours and injuries and seven billion dollars in damages but once again of the sixty seven deaths I Believe twenty seven of them happened down the stretch of the interstates where it was double decker and the top\nFloor fell onto the lower floor ooh\nAnd on the night at Twenty one years ago already or I'm Sorry Nineteen years ago oh no I'm Sorry ... climbers right\nOh I was gonna say Nineteen eighty nine ... nine eighty nine Nineteen eighty nine money\nParlance a billion dollars was still a lot of money\nYou are still talking in the million\nYeah I mean the stadium that the baseball game was going on with was built for about thirty five or forty million dollars\nI mean when you think about it I watched the game last night once again from Dodger Stadium which many people who are baseball fanatics still think it was one of the great ballparks in the United states all\nWell it opened in Nineteen sixty three okay\nThat says a lot about the uh forward thinking of the builders then\nIt was well it was properly placed and most people don't know it but the reason Dodgers moved from Brooklyn to Los Angeles many think it was to make the game\nA game that encompass the whole country because prior to that there wasn't any team west of them as the Mississippi River mhm\nThat's true Dodger Stadium is very nice thinking back on it\nChavez Ravine ... was thrown in as part of the deal\nTo the Dodgers if they made the moon they were a lot in the Seventy six eighty acres that are known as Chavez Ravine I didn't know that was part of ...\nYeah they were given that land by the\nLos Angeles and what the city of Los Angeles that that shouldn't have done was they didn't only give the land deeds they ...\nOn those acres a lesion fields that was originally called Chavez Ravine Seventy six working um oh oil wells do you know what that's worth in today's parlance all\nYes yes Iraq his ... yeah they're all still pumping oil yeah they didn't change that at all and by the way if you watch the old shows the rookies\nNot the new one the LA police academy is still stationed in Chavez Ravine at the very beginning as you drive into the park area there so when you see Dodger Stadium it is a beautiful ballpark\nThat really ... yeah it is and I felt I always felt very lucky to be there\nHave ah the engineer took me around and there was literally no one in the ballpark there was the director of marketing but yeah yeah I mean you guys were in having a meeting right but I got to see it was not another soul in the place and you got to see you sit in the ... seat I'm Mr Vince Kelly yes\nIt is yeah there so that's pretty important yes um we didn't do a lot with the story because we're a\n... you can get just burned out on these kinds of stories couldn't they happen every day but you can avoid the elephant in the room so we have to talk about it\nMichael ... reacted to the ... the president oh here we go in the six year old division yeah 'cause that's what they're acting like yeah he tells us\nWhat Stormy Daniels reaction was to the president's tweet about her\nI think it's been personal for a while for both of my clients and myself but more importantly more of I mean this is a disgrace Donald Trump is the president of the United states never in my lifetime that I think that I witnessed behavior like this from the president of the United states\nTell your kids to look up to the president of the United states when he behaved in this manner it's an absolute joke and it's a disgrace and it's about time that we stop shaking her head and we stopped for a start punch in back\nI mean this guy can no longer be permitted to get away with this she was incredulous she couldn't believe it she she thought that that counted been hacked or that it was some joke as I did initially when I saw\nI mean for the president of the United states to engage in this behavior it's an absolute disgrace the rest of the world looks at us they laugh at us and many of us within the United states are disgusted I don't care what your politics are this has no place it's a complete disrespect to the office of the president I'm Sorry I\nHave to agree on dry in a way of Mr Ava not easy but uh yeah how do you not disagree I and we're not\nTrying to bolster the confidence of his clients\nAnd she's you know angels I'm each outcome she squeaky clean she heard you know I was in field is is a school in Monterey around librarian she should not\nBe getting all the publicity that she's getting what she's getting the publicity because it's being given to her by another power and the here we are on that slippery slope yeah let's let's all go play in the ... because that's what politics just turned into [noise]\nThat's a sad state and no money benefits from a movie Roger a um\nTough question but is there a way to do that just by what their knowledge level is\n\nI don't know about that but it but the what we what we know in school is\nThat your future in terms of of of the choices that I spoke about before are all all all going to depend upon exam and um the reason that these are the reason that these kids are did poorly on exams is because they had negative thoughts about them that they were repeating over\nLet's say I get a sixty eight or a Seventy or something like that and uh I've studied hard I've done all the right things and uh and I and I do poorly\nThe next time I take an exam I fail again to continue will failing trigger something called ... negative self\nOff you wind up saying to yourself why can't I for example concentrate better when I study why can't remember what I study why why why why can't why don't I trust my answers on exams\nThat is those statements are programming that same ... that same result over and over again\nNegative self talk we know that the way that we talk to ourselves about ourselves and the way we talk to other people that are still literally creates the outcomes in our lives so these kids were programming themselves without realizing they were doing it\nYeah the simple method created how the simple method I created to counteract act that\nWas to take the um the six or seven most prevalent negative statements that that a number of students told me that they were they were saying to themselves and I simply turned them into positive statement\nA as if they had already happened and all I had to do was read them a few times a day and believe it or not sometimes within a week of taking a test or get them I always saw dramatic unproven president and their exam results\nOh that's wonderful and how long did it take you to formulate this this exercise that eventually you know who was doing this a few minutes a day would be able to actually have that much of a change in the way they take their tests well\nI wanted to I had a ... I had a situation where one student who who uh who I had a\nA student at my place you can usually you can use a pick them up\nAnd then my credit or mid term she got a sixty seven I just it was something about it that I had to know so I started with her and I sat with her when she was the ones who started telling me that she had problems concentrating once you've studied trouble focusing she had trouble remembering what she studied she got nervous when she took ... she had a whole list of things\nAnd um so I started with her and I made notes on them and then I follow up and I did some work with some other students and I found the six or seven most common denominator is\nWhat the students the negative statements were and I simply turn them around it's a statement that they would read a few minutes a day less than five minutes a day really and they would have if we read it's already happened\nWhy do I feel so relaxed uncomfortable when I study why do I focus so easily why do I remember most of what I study why am I relax and comfortable and ... exam that's all they have to do and it looks like magic oh it's amazing\nCongratulations the year and I do I'm sure changed a lot of students lives and I know for a long time there was\nTalk about changing grades and making it a pass fail situation but I never understood how we were going to decide like what kids were going to go to certain universities and other universities if we were just going to use that pass fail method\nRight right well it's it's been a very satisfying experience for me because if you think of it in terms of the long term\nUm\nEvery student and by the way the biggest outcome of this at every single student that took the that that that did this and reporting back to ... the first thing they said the very first thing is that they feel so much more confident about themselves a self esteem was better needless to say\nYou get the parents are often the case and uh and and the teachers\nStage of their life and send them out or you know in a few years to the rest of the world but the self confidence that self esteem absolutely pollen can you stay with us for another segment we got to take a

most of the cases [noise] the kids just do poorly on exam but there are some cases and you and you and you picked on the right one or I've had students who are literally a students but we're more than that\nAnd um [laughter] I had one student and she's one of the testimonials on the on the book on Amazon or where uh I actually wrote some these the special statements for her and um she chose she didn't use them to next semester I failed math again\nThen she started using them and she got straight A's and math and and a testimonial Amazon says and now I even like math but that yeah it it it happened I actually was I was pretty good students but I had um in high school I was horrible and math\nAnd um and I and I figured out the reason why I won't go into it there was a family history knew

Europeans would love people no one's going there but you're right I Want to get to the premise of your column you believe the best thing to happen to the Democratic party would be for them to lose because of how they're trying to win\nOr lose lose big and this is what's so important we've seen over the last few weeks with the Kavanaugh a crisis in so much else the way the Democrats are in the left of behave themselves you know screaming or sending like a ban she's screaming from the gallery\nOf the U.S Senate during the final vote on Kavanaugh a screaming at a Ted Cruz and other people chasing them out of restaurants or you've seen vandalism against a GOP offices from Wyoming to Nebraska even here on the Upper East side\nOf Manhattan officers torch vandalism this kind of thing\nAnd I think if the if the Democrats win if they win either or God Forbid both houses of Congress we're going to get impeachment Medicare for all the Democrats socialist agenda or that will continue if they are barely lose if if the Republicans hang on just by a thread\nOr the Democrats are going to blame it on Russia they're going to blame it on white nationalism a what racism whatever you want\nI think only if the Democrats or Republicans deliver a crushing blow against the Democrats only then will they sit down\nFocus realize you know it's not Trump is not rush it's not ... it's a it's a bad message it's the resistance is the violence the mob rule and then I think they may engage in some self reflection and try to think about okay what positive agenda what positive message can we present to improve the lives the American\nThe over the next two years to the president wants to put a stake through the heart of only white people vote for him who want to go back to old America pre civil war you spend your time focusing on Hispanics and blacks\nAnd you just say Yuri helping them these opportunities zones are happening things you're taking place they don't trumpet them at all but I Want the president to go back in and do the McCain style town halls and take a step back ... ...\nI understand what you're saying that I consider that when Kanye West in Israel and said I Am not first stop and frisk it doesn't mean he's a bad person he disagrees with the president he was we'll talk about that that's the beginning of getting somewhere and marginalizing your enemies\nI think that's absolutely right and I think that um look to the President Trump in the GOP have an excellent message to bring into black communities so they can talk about the fact that the black unemployment rate is at the lowest\nIn us history or when the economy grows at a about four percent versus about two percent under Obama double what we were told a couple of years ago was the new normal and the ceiling and growth that such as good for white people that's good for black people it's good for Hispanics it's for everybody in this country\nAnd he ought to go into black neighborhoods and and and preach this and it's very hard to accused him of being a racist weights black people who's actually meeting with black people\nRight or at once it might it might it might not say things like Herschel Walker Jim Brown they're friends of his go with people that need to be converted to do it in a civil way of begin to change the tone absolutely right who's the most ... what is the most effective way that a Democrat can counter the present\nThe most effective message for the Democrats are all trying to play this game Elizabeth Warren's trying to play this game ... trying to play this game Cory Booker is trying to play the game they're not going to win that way well the thing the funny thing is that their rights do they they they grabbed his bait Everytime he offers it you know if Elizabeth Warren

doing it she's playing this game she is settled in the right point is she in all of their head incredible and she ... she could have stuck to her message\nTalked about getting more people in it involved the economy or talk about corporate a justice quote unquote\nAncestry dot com and all this and that that's a pretty weak vested for them to deliver a through the trees with you it Jim Messina

be the face of Saudi right we have to say what a push away I think that we have to move away from this either or thing we have to be embraced Saudi Arabia more because you know Iran is so bad you know we we don't need to associate with any type of heinous abhor behavior like we have seen just recently out of Saudi Arabia well\nWe don't eh you know the big ... the flip side to this China and Russia move and then they don't mind making the sale\n[noise] well that's true but the other thing that we need to do that's why the economic sanctions and our economic growth is so important\nAnd we are gathering up the allies on our side to put more pressure on China and Russia without without a doubt we see China that is you know closing up in Pakistan we see Russia and what they're trying to do and the middle east especially with Syria but there there's a clear cut a path with the United states of America and if\nWe accept this type of behavior we don't\nYou know come down on Saudi Arabia not only are you going to get more that behavior but\nIt's going to lessen our stance and and the world as well\nYeah I mean they evidently does a ... that's good and he was exiled and he was interrogated and this ... pretended to be good is the one is actually in charge they turns out the Turkish ship it concluded that they painted the whole place they also broadening the cleaning crew to clean up the whole place\nAnd uh the one of the people that was involved with the fits in with the twelve man team that landed and went into the consulate is known to be very tight\nThis is the worst most ill thought out brutal assassination with massive ramifications that I've ever seen it's so stupid and horrific you wonder if we're missing something\nWell it was definitely premeditated but the other thing is that it shows an incredible a level of belligerence and the up to ... matter of the Saudis and that will do something like this and we dare anyone to challenges we dare anyone to\nYou know ... bring any consequences against us so this is an important stats or the United states of America just the same as we were tough or North Korea we brought them to the table we got to be tough all Saudi Arabia say look there's always this crowd princes you're Arab parents this guy has this control this hour we're not going to do business with you\nAnd if that means that you're going to be catching you know rockets and missiles from the who the rebels out of Yemen so be it\nA real quick on immigration I Want to get a question to your book uh the maybe the future speak with the house Nancy Pelosi talked about why the president needs to build a wall it's his own insecurity the audio is not grade uh by the way either her comments but there were sharing cut Seventeen\n\nForming a wall and [noise]\nI\n[laughter]\nReally I mean the last\nWell those type of delusional comment so the reason why she won't be the speaker of the house but I think that Nancy Pelosi should ask you know Pope Francis if they're concerned about you know their manhood because the Vatican has a wall or she should call up a is\nThe Israelis and asked them about their manhood because they've built to walk to stem the flow of terrorism\nThe gossip so we've got to do something because we are sovereign nation and a sovereign nation has to be able to control is borders we do not have control over our borders\nI can argue on ... on hold Texas hold a nation what is going on in Texas and made you say I got to tell the country\n[noise] the thing that is happening in Texas is happening all across the the the entire country is that you know successful businesses and corporations are moving into a successful\nRed states that have the right economic policies regulatory policies but as these businesses and corporations are moving in there not explained it to their employees while they're moving there\nAnd so you are seeing an incredible ideological shift in Georgia and Tennessee in Texas in North Carolina and that is going to be very threatening for the future of these states because for whatever reason\nIs a locust effect as I call it where people are coming out of California Illinois and New York New Jersey and they're still bringing their failed policies with them to successful states\nAnd you're witnessing any taxes you think Texas is changing\nWithout a doubt when he's like I always tell people you look at your major urban centers in Texas and you look at the colleges and universities as a matter of fact I wrote about today Texas women's university has a restricted people to a five free speech zones now that's the University of Texas a public university of Texas is saying you only have five free speech\nDesignated zones on his campus\nThat's that shows that something is happening in Texas this is not Massachusetts it's not Vermont is about California\nUh I got to bring it to a ... all this on on taxes in particular do you believe that uh in Florida in Texas in these other places in in Georgia do you do you think the Republican Party is is being caught napping\nI think that the Republican Party lacks a strategic vision a but\nJunior and they've been able to flip a Virginia Colorado I used to be a red state ... blue and his base on Denver and Boulder\nUh the major at those major population centers where you have these major colleges and universities so I think that the Republican Party nice to have more strategic vision and it needs to go into these major urban centers where you see the greatest amount of failure of progress a socialist policies and they need to make the argument\nRight and by the way just on the latest poll and the real clear average cruised by seven it was a one or two point race but he seems to be pulling in a way so if Texas is gonna flip ... go blue I quit the LBJ days or not there yet or not close snow melt in your blood over\nOkay you get the book you could order on Amazon an old Texas hold that extra picked her up there and I want to say brought me to watch the gap where his incredible it ... it is a good friend I appreciate you\nAbsolutely in my next book has got to be Sam Houston inventing the Alamo and it's all about Travis and that was the line he used before he would eventually sadly get death or I Will go to the end victory or death so um I definitely understand a little bit more about taxes as you do now that you move there from Florida colonel thanks so much\nCause the Pulitzer Prize you take care\nWe come back it's your turn one eight six six four oh eight seven

flake decision theirs and and that's his conclusion is part of the reason why is that race is numbers were terrible and he thinks it's because I Believe that he liked to reach across the aisle and maybe take on the president\nThe author of at the ... year where did you get this number is named his book and he's an outstanding poster with CBS what do you think about what you just said\nYou know it's interesting and I and I talk about this in the book uh myself in this this animosity between the right in the left wing Democrats and Republicans um look ... ... is there among among a group of people who are really odd\nPoll and they see them as a threat they see them as different from they are besides politics um but that's what everybody you know that's not everybody there there is a middle in that regard there are people who were just you know tired of the back and forth want sensible solutions you to Prague\nAmerican citizens or politicians do you think these politicians should have more courage of their head in the past be willing to lose their seat in order to do what they think\nRight well you know like I I don't know what the politicians are thinking but I Do know this\nCampaign seemed to make a choice between whether they think an election is a base election which means you've got to go out and get those most fervent partisans get them out there\nFor you or persuasion election\nAnd they look at the numbers and they see that people are getting harder and harder to persuade\nSo you understand why these campaigns go after you know the other side's the bat you know the bad folks and we've just got to mobilize our own\nAnd that may contribute to it I I Will tell you this real quick Bryant you know we just did in ... as part of this poll asked a question or the party's arguing about\nThe kinds of policies they like or dislike were the kind of people that they like or dislike and most of the partisan saw the other side is arguing about people that they like and dislike as opposed to policy\nBoy that that's hard to ... yeah that's that's that's hard to negotiate when you're when you become very very personal and I think there are a lot of Americans who have a reaction against that top three issues that matter most of your polling for these midterms um health care keeps popping up yeah health care no matter how many times we ask get healthcare keeps popping up\nThe direction of the country generally and I will tell you this you know the president a either a pro or con is shaping up to be the biggest factor for a president that we have seen in mid term typically it's a majority a little more than a majority who say they go to the midterm vote with the president on their mind\nAgainst the most intriguing race or some of look to New Jersey that sentiment end as who we had a hung jury that kept him out of jail a and it was censored by the Senate\n... we wish we did pull that race and we had Menendez up but you know here's a case again where you've got partisanship New Jersey's a blue state so people break along partisan lines and a lot of that seems to have put aside there were people who who weren't thrilled with with what a senator Menendez it done on but we are voting for him anyway in that regard but\nThat it helps the Democrats in places like that it hurts in places like say Missouri\nLeslie Florida's Senate race Nelson versus got yeah it was the hurricane done for Scott do you think you couldn't have pulled it yet because you in the middle of trying to help yet\nThey haven't pulled it yet the suspicion is the questions that we'll ask is you know does that give Scott a chance to look like he's doing something to act\nLike an executive oftentimes Nino natural disasters do give somebody in power a chance to to do that so that'll be one of the key things will last guy knows would you look at it as a dead heat virtually a probably is I think the governor's race there probably helps boost turnout that puts a bit of a wild card and it was just a given yeah the mayor of Tallahassee that's\nOne that is one we are all going to be watching for a lot of reasons that the the I don't want to apply there for

website John James for Senate dot com will also be streaming live on Facebook and Twitter at John James I'm a\n... I Want you here with congressmen and maybe future speaker Nancy Pelosi said about the president's push to build a border wall especially in light of the caravan of over a thousand people were heading to our border cut Seventeen\nAnd\nAll that\nAnd\nI\nFeel that\nYou think it's a man who'd issue\nUm I I think that ah that's ridiculous I the the president's job\nIs to enforce our laws in his Nancy Pelosi's job to make the laws if she doesn't like the laws of the book is her job to fix them in ... in in in in to legislate\nAnd she is basically campaigning on issues that she's created\nUm we need to secure our borders I Believe that legal legal immigration is a moral and economic imperative for this country like illegal immigration must be stopped Nancy Pelosi is part and parcel to the problem\nAnd she's refusing to solve it because ah for her own political gain we need to send people to Washington who are more intent on keeping us all safe\nWho are intent on upholding our values as Americans\nAnd not continuing to to divide us ah like Nancy Pelosi and and the establishment politicians are doing\nHave you dealt a John with a race issues in your life\nUm I I have I have my mom and\nI've always uh endeavor to ah to do my best or put God first uh end to serve my country and that's what I'm doing now I'm like I said before I just have a future good friends are folks who uh who just don't know me yet\nA and I'm going to show through my actions that is not about black or white about red white and blue and I'm looking forward representing us all very well\nDo you think we're getting better as as as a society as a country or judging people equally not on the color of their skin\nOr I think that um if if we are backsliding it's the um the political prejudice and beginning to see\n'em you have this political prejudice people are beginning to assume they know exactly who you are because we are or the the by your name when I went to Iraq I didn't fight for Democrats or Republicans I fall for Americans and so people are\nAre assuming that uh that uh\nUh that they know who I Am and what I'm all about just because of the party and running and I'm an independent thinker too many people have died for me to have the right to vote to think for myself and we outsourced\nOur our thought process and in in our ability to to vote in the lead for ourselves to a political establishment a cares more about getting re elected than representing the people a part of the American dream is not only being able to elect our leadership but also the dream of being leadership\nWe have in the system right now in this country where the only way you can be a U.S senator is it your super wealthy or if you're a super connected if you're a political politician group politician that's wrong and I think that people are are are are getting Americans against each other\nOr and and then blame the other side when things get done our country is in the throes of a generational change and the Dems and liberal media wants to keep talking about um about things that continue to inflame a and I'm looking forward to bring us together because I've seen what what a partisan sectarian\nIn this country of family fighting and when we cannot go back that way and so yes we still have a racial tensions racial divides we still have gender issues and gender divides but despite our issues we're still the best country in the face of the planet and can't forget all America's\nNot perfect but trying to be and fighting along the way and lastly I think the ... the United states to do a lot of race issues Kanye West came over Jim Brown came over to the White House did some stuff in front of the camera\nAnd then people are saying they'd Kanye West is is are being used by the president as a sample that he shows he's a racially tolerant but he's not what is your reaction to what what what on last week as it came to came to gang issues and race relations in America with this with this White House\nWell uh I I think that anyone who who speaks out it just goes to show that are Democrats aren't interested in diversity of thought they're interested in getting people in line are telling the party line because\nUh uh ... it's\nRidiculous um we in this country I remember being raised to believe that uh everyone was entitled to their own opinions but not their own facts but now the Democrats are you saying that everyone is entitled to their own fast\nBut not their own and uh I'm looking\nAt breaking down or the shackles that that the chain of dependency and victimhood and I believe that um by reaching out to the communities people selectively forget that the that the president um\nHas a has forgiven millions of dollars of debt to I struck with black colleges and universities they tend to forget that the president has met with the other presidents of those universities um\nAnd reach down to them where I'm not even sure that the uh the previous president did\nUh we need to make sure that we take a look at the the underlying issues of income inequality and get to the root cause which is opportunity inequality and having those honest conversations because in in these areas are these are the places that are that that uh\nNow I can guarantee one thing I'm for the state of Michigan or if Debbie Stabenow stays in office nothing will change we need to make sure that we end her reign of hyper partisanship we in her reign of ineffectiveness and we end her reign of\nBroken promises I'm looking forward to represent in Michigan ah and ah I I Believe that\nAmong African Americans specifically we need a seat at the table when Ninety eight percent of us do one party than either party feels like they have to work for your vote we have been silence we had been ignored and now we need to see to build tables because righteous indignation is not going to change things right just influence will we have the marching from Selma to Detroit\nWe've been writing from lots to Baltimore and nothing's changed in forty fifty years\nWe need to make sure that both parties were for a vote and we have a seat that both tables so that we can continue to push changed now\nI remember I hosted a show with Jim Brown out next year I all sports radio\nAnd I was we were talking to get all of these calls about black coaches by general managers he said forget that we need black owners and then then you'll have somebody in power and then there's the blackout has got to pick the people that got to get the most wins and that's what you should be looking for it not for any you know go out and you know go out and get it\n[noise] yeah and that's the thing and I love that jump around that we need more black owners the thing is African Americans have been have been rolled into the sense that not only\nShould we accept mediocrity but we should expect that\nUh you take a look at not just an NFL with the coaches and the and the and whatever but we need to look at owners and you see that right now with what they're saying and Fifteen dollars an hour why are you telling us that we only should expect Fifteen dollars an hour winds are teaching my babies how to make Fifteen hundred dollars an hour why aren't you\nAre doing the things that it would take to poll entire communities out of poverty by by actually uh um\nIncentivizing people to get married and keep families together rather than saying that hey if\nThings and we need to have these conversations because we need to bring everybody not just black or white but everybody because these are issues

Joe and you're a home where you can afford to wipe out I\n\nLove Fox News radio studios in New York City for me you want truth you demand\nIt's Bryan kill made [noise]\nRight Joe Millionaire it's gonna be a big our coming your way [noise] ah we have a with a cherry well so the bottom of the hour to talk about this new ranking that just came out to reach that we are the are the fastest growing greatest opportunity the number one economy in the world\nFor the first time since two thousand eight and that is stunning news and the job number seven million on filled jobs in this country if you're able to work\nAnd you're part of a ... year not part of the sixty five percent of the workforce that choosing the work if you're retired obviously or injured or or any type impaired or disabled no problem talking about\nWe'll talk about that with Jerry Walls were also I'm a got a ... or got to tell you to the ... the United states is just talk to our own Stewart Barney would have tried to bring in some clips of that he did talk about Saudi Arabia so let's get to this\nNow with a bigger things do you need to know who the power of three Brian's big number three\nSaturday operation and turkey could ruin all of a perfect place plans to essentially destroy your undermine the Iranian economy they need this outage desperately to engage in this plant Saudi Arabia oil flowing if Iran's oil gets cut off\nAnd they do that is Jeffrey Goldberg foreign policy a specialty the Atlantic magazine pages bill's talking about the death of ... he killed at least killed and we know it\nWho did it and why do they think they can get away with it so far it looks just incredibly obvious that it was Saudi Arabia did it and it was a thirty three year old print to greenlight today if that is indeed the case how could the president and continue relations with that Middle East nation even despite would Goldberg's at\nThe numbers when it comes to the curb and I as I said last night the president needs to work on Mexico Mexico needs to stop them on their southern border not in not insure them transit means us and turn around right now in the southern border and they don't get to the United states\nOr they go and that of course it's Thomas Homan on Laura last night the caravan succumbing thousands of people from Central America demanded to be let in but first they got to get through Mexico and a few other countries what the president saying to those other nations to stop them in their tracks number one I mean\nI keep hearing about the enthusiasm the blue wave but I think we have tremendous enthusiasm we've been energized anyway but we're more energized since justice capital\nAnd I don't think anyone doubts that but it will be enough that will sustain twenty days and counting and we will ...\nIn twenty twenty I'll let you know what's already been done a first things first I Would like to inform you that one of the big stories right\nNow is on Fox News dot com and most websites and that is that the ... probe will will announce the bulk of its findings right after the midterm elections\nAnd that will be fascinating because we do not know where it's going to go we don't also don't know if the president's going to be speaking to Robert Mueller we do know this and I'm thankful for it a mother has kept a low profile and dare I say stop work until the midterms they unlike James Comey did not want to play a role in the midterms so\nUh we will find out where that goes but lower finally come to a head\nAnd there's a couple of reasons why and it makes sense Democrats keeps saying hey that more indictments tell us what's wrong or let's move on and Republicans are saying can we please just move on\nYou've heard a lot about prop one twenty seven but it's really a very simple equation prop one twenty seven make you pay more problem one twenty seven imposes California's down mandates quote irrespective of cost to consumers that means higher electric bills for every one\nOf the typical Arizona family will pay one thousand dollars more per year\nElectric bills for small businesses could double\nAnd seniors living on a fixed income will be hidden actually hard to California to try this and today electric rates in California are increasingly three times the national average we don't want California taxes in Arizona or California's high cost of living why would we want California\nI rocketing electric bill is it do no problem one twenty seven dot com and\nNo on prop one twenty seven\nPaid for by Arizona's for affordable electricity not

blast man\nAlive I just try and show me you'll see Joe home for news talking sports in the White Mountains I jog one oh six seven\nShe's walking\nBack everybody one eight six six eight seven six six nine I Want to bring in the Republican candidate for governor of Connecticut Bob stepping off ski and Bob I had a chance to meet Larry Kudlow those big birthday party and Bob you're doing something you try to pull up the possible be a Republican and run the state of Connecticut\nYou within a year in single digits you down to a point difference how do you go to the rest of the way\nYeah actually there\n... eight years of a democratic governor that has raised taxes increased regulation a grown big government and people are ready for change here that's why in a traditional democratic state uh we've got a great shot at winning this\nWay you're going to get into a Ned Lamont famously he won the nomination over a Joe Lieberman Lieberman independent one independent and beat him in the general do you even got to you not only going to get a Democrat you against a liberal Democrat\n[laughter] yeah I'm actually happy about that because uh he's come out and said it's going to put up calls on the highways\nHere which is just another tax um he's going to raise taxes across the board is going to Institute of statewide auto tax and people are tired of it for and they they want change 'em they look at me as the agent of change um I've or cook laughter and Kudlow on an economic\nPlan for Connecticut to get rid of the state income tax lower the corporate tax and get this economy moving again\nYeah you have a five step plan to rebuild a to rebuild Connecticut so you just gave us a couple of those ideas and you think it's going to take how many years to get it done and what else are they ... what else is a new plant\nOne of those couple of things we can do immediately we've got we're the only spoke with a gift tax and an estate tax and it generates plus I'm a one percent of the revenue for Connecticut and we've lost six billion dollars a taxable income just to the state of Florida so we're losing more money on that tax in order brings and we can get rid of that day one um\nWe have a plan to gradually phase out the state income tax over a year it'll be tied to revenue triggers that will be tied to cost cuts um but you know my why our current governor my wife's done the opposite despite the two largest tax increases in the history of the state or tax for evidence that down so it's only\nCommon sense for and that we have to do to reverse it to get this economy moving my challenger Ned Lamont wants to continue more the same at work\nGet rid of tolls [noise]\nAh well well we don't have calls right now so that revenue or not there um I Am step it into a four billion dollar budget deficit we got to look at the cost of wind hard um I was a chief financial officer UPS investment bank suited zero based budget zeroed out everybody's budget\nAnd we only added back in what they have to have a ... billion a cost out I'm On a forty billion dollar brand your budget state of Connecticut I got to be able to find five to ten percent use some of that money to fund a tax cut some of that money to invest in education and get some family back into the economic policy at a state\n... with us about what kind of uh what kind of help have you had you mentioned you got to art Laffer and that's a big help and Larry Kudlow is a friend of yours what kind of help if you had from the White House any\nA Trump came out a ... of me that after the after the primary\nUm I've never spoken to him I've ever met him but uh the the endorsement of the president is good thing or the Republican Governors Association says one of the top targets states to go Republican uh they've bought a bunch of ad time\nThey've been supportive ... getting a lot of national attention or just one of the few democratic states that we have a real shot to a Republican both at the governor\nCEO\nBob dropping out there but Bob listen to his background you form a CEO of GE corporate finance prior to that he was the apple would you be asked you heard him mentioned that and most recently he left the job a CEO of D. F. C. global so he's all about making money earning money and he also he's also about a business\nBobby with us [noise] All right uh he's gone so if a businessman can be successful in the White House can you be successful in balancing the budget\nReally unhappy with what's going on there and nobody blamed Republicans because I've had absolutely no power when did McMahon a window McMahon who was extremely successful as an executive in Connecticut or she couldn't breakthrough but got close\nBob I was just talking about the fact that you were the c._e._o. of D. F. C. global last UPS you mentioned before that and more C O G O G A G corporate finance why would you want to put all that knowledge into trying to balancing er into getting into politics\n[laughter] it's a great ... I'm a Connecticut God group and then I went to the public schools uh\nWent to a local college Fairfield University students been great to me\nAnd I've been watching it being ruined by horrible economic policy I've got three daughters\nFor Nineteen and sixteen I don't want to have to get on a plane to see my grandkids and Florida Sunday um is all about the economy here\nI've been restructuring businesses for Thirty years stood up to them I think is a forty billion dollar\nBudget that needs to be structured so it's great and my little house and I just felt that was time to make a change um fortunately for me to a recording of good with a ... or ... or go\nNow it's down to ... to ... people are ready for it so I don't want a politician eighty five percent of the people we called and not want to politicians um you look at what Charlie Baker aspire to do up in Massachusetts it's a great profound to be running for governor as\nWell I mean you've got one resent Iran Johnson's one of the most effective centers are from business in of course the part of the United states are much of this year in many politicians is we're trying to run the government like a busy business where he's actually making a lot of decisions himself a Bob Bob Bob stepping us Keith thanks so much for joining us\nThank you for having me on a cruise I'd love to come around again but\nGot it as he faces off against ... and tries to pull up the upset for the Republicans in Connecticut when we come back Jerry Lewis joined us the market is down put your money doesn't have to be one eight six six\nPeople are still a little nervous about what seems to be a a deepening fight with China when it comes to trade although she and Trump will meet shortly this is the bride Julie showed them with [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] I talk to those points on TNT I find I'm going to be the ... district [noise]\nSo you're saying no Medicare for all is that what you're telling me I mean that's one thing I mean I think that or we don't do it you know how can you or just saying even the defense department says we have enough missiles we have enough written tank so\nOkay so it's not really about defense it's really about the entitlement programs that's the thing that really drives us over the edge to the question is how do you manage that right or is that about having people as they approach their elderly year's\nFall out of these programs at early I mean you don't you get into them later in life because our lifespan is so much longer I think that's a closer answer but this idea of Medicare for all\nDoes not work and why doesn't work because of the money the dollars and cents we can't afford that and why why why would you tell corporate America to stop\nGetting your employees healthcare insurance this is a program that has worked since World War two hundred and fifty three million Americans get their coverage through their employer for the love of God don't put a knife in the back of that\nWell we love it a news Corp we got great health care and I love it and if you will to business and say I got news for you don't have to spend on health care they'll high five you and say thank you very much\nI guess what the quality will go down nobody reinforces in Medicare they all need supplemental I Know that for a fact that's right and so that's for some people that was never meant to cover the whole country but there is a legitimate and no\nI think this idea that there is an easy answer like government funds everything is stupid\nAnd I think every market will have a different solution and for us I think it's a lot of different pieces of the pie coming together it can't be one thing it can't be just a big old governor fat government program that covers it that's like oh that's such a great idea no it's not I\nDon't know how that works I Can't make that work in my head we've got to get these companies to compete against each other for your health care dollars we have to and sent private citizens to know what they're paying and to complain when they are paying too much we've already got a program out\nHealth and Human Services secretary this week saying look we're going to get these prices on drugs down and part of the way we're going to do it is when you advertise your drug on the television you have to say how much it costs\nAs you're sitting there going to have exposure on just about everything starting the new year I heard the president's insisting and for the big form is resisting\nThat's right they don't want to do it they got their own plan it will be fine go to this website click five buttons go some will eventually will get you the answer to your question I don't think that's the way to do it\nI think informing people you know information is the key to this and getting these companies to compete with each other they're having you know success at the margin with small things that ultimately will make a big difference there are more generic drugs coming to market their getting faster approval for drugs this is all going to help\nYeah I Want you to hear what President Trump and tell me if you're comfortable with that said ...\nWhat ... is the fed because the fed is raising rates too fast and it's independent so I don't speak to him but I'm not happy with what he's doing because it's going too fast because you looked at the last inflation numbers are very low\nBeing put on there I mean I'm not going to end it yelling or was she in ... owner blaming anybody I put him there and maybe a thread maybe it's wrong but I wanted to get it wrong I put it so ...\nBelieve me we can't do anything about it now fire out but he has a point and how are you really enjoy the time evidently used to scream about the fed where we're all going to be okay but it does it bother you at all that the fed by looking at it as a become more of a political Oregon that everything that they do raise rates are not have\nTo become a political Oregon all they do is ignore him down and that's all they have to do and that's probably what they will do but I think he's got a point\nI think that we may be at you know look\nInflation not an issue right now right\nAnd the presidents looking at camping down the growth of we have why would we want to do that at this point I think the fed overreached when it said we're going to look at two things not only are we going to look\nAt and ... not only are we going to look at inflation but we're also going to look at interest rates would look at these jobs are going with the jobs the fed has no business looking at jobs in my view and that was a decision they made like two presidents ago\nSo here's the part of the United states moments ago speaking with Stuart Varney on trade with China cut fifty one stop talking with China again we're all very ready for you\nI don't think so and I told them they want to make a deal and I said you guys aren't ready if you're just not ready because they've been taking five hundred billion dollars a year out of our country it's time that we stopped okay we rebuilt China you know that better than anybody you talk about it more than I Do I say\nAnd it stopped and you see what's happening with China it's a whole different ballgame so now they're paying a twenty five percent tariffs on two hundred and fifty billion dollars hasn't affected our economy housing costs have gone up inflation still low\nVery low hasn't had any impact that we see except for one billions of dollars are pouring into the treasury\nSo um do you dispute that fact to terrorists who bringing billions of dollars into a a treasury 'cause I've heard that that's just beautiful\nWell would I dispute is that it has no effect on prices we've already got companies warning that they're going to have to raise prices because of tariffs that's already there I'm Sorry\nAnd when you get a chance have cans and when you get into the language of the terrorists it's going to be food stuff is a lot of stuff you pick up at the grocery store okay those prices are going to be going up you know the reality is a lot of stuff you would buy to put under the Christmas tree which those prices were probably locked in in the summer\nBut stuff that you might pick up Tuesday night at the grocery store may go up Sam right or\nThe jury you know how is using it it's pretty obvious he's using it as a wedge to get you to the table I'm going to punish you with this and get you there I'm going to take your car away and then ask you how much you're going to pay to get it back then I like you're giving it\nI think that's true I think what's interesting about that is this is going to be hard\nWeighing in the president's favor the Chinese economy not doing well the stock market terrible you're on how to mark yeah you're unhappy with an eight hundred point and sell off on the Dow will go to China it's much much worse right\nUm so he's got a lot of things we're working in his favor has to be able to rely on Europe he has to be ... able to rely on Canada or Mexico other Asian nations he's got to pull the world together against China super difficult it's a high hurdle but you know this is something that needed attention\nIt did and Chuck Schumer agrees Europe agrees really on they said Mr President why are you fighting with everyone wants Korea Brazil or breaking up NAFTA European Union and little by little they've come into line\nThe framework for the use air but I'm not sure what's happened since evidently Japan is on the is ready to be is ready to be executed in a good way of that deal\nBut now if you can organize the world against China most of all this stuff to intellectual property that's the key isn't it and it's also up to our businessmen not to be money hungry to the point where they sacrificed technology for their families but it's American security overall\nAnd it's well it's American security it's also America's future right I mean basically what China has done and and uh\nAnd that hurts us and we need to stop that\nRight I Want to hear what the ... with the president just told steward warning about cutting spending and regulation cut forty nine\nOr we've cut regulations more than any president ever and you can go for years and years or does it matter\nThis tremendous regulations that we can be cutting still and we're doing it you know it used to take Twenty one years to get a highway bill\nYou know bad case but it would take Twenty one years we're trying to bring that down to two and maybe even one and went away if it's not right we're not going to approve a slower not gonna take Twenty one years to find out whether or not we can do it\nBut uh that's pretty much what he thought gee you've you've gotten reports too that he has legitimately cut the red tape and regular\nYeah I mean there's no doubt about it I mean all you can like there are studies that show the number of regulations that existed pre and a number of regulations that existed after and there are fewer and I really think that's why you see a these companies being so much more aggressive\nAh and and going out hiring ... you know spending money because they know that this big weight on their shoulders of regulation has been lifted and that they can do more things you know when you know that the White House is on your side it makes life a lot easier you're not always on the defensive you're not always back on your heels trying to figure out how to fight back\nAh Lesley there's another businessman looks like he's going to get in the race Mike Bloomberg regrets aren't getting in the last time a what kind of uh what kind of not politically but what kind of resume does he bring to the table that could give Donald Trump trouble\nHe's a hugely successful businessman\nI mean massively successful without any nobody can argue with his track record with Bloomberg the Bloomberg Terminal I shouldn't be talking like this because we compete right against him but\nHe has been incredibly successful businessman no doubt about it he had a vision he executed it he hired so many people are here in New York and elsewhere that's tough\nHe said that piece of cake he won't get through the Democrats he won't be able to get to the Democrats you don't even get\nTo me but the problem with him the Republicans have problems with the fact that he ran as a Republican and then ditched the party then one independent and then went to the to become a Democrat again so they feel duped\n[noise]\nMaybe the news [noise]\nI'm Scott

state my opinion on a couple of things are I think Democrats are now delusional and the fact that you know Republicans are leading in in most things\nAnd the fact is is they're trying to attack Republicans and conservatives because they're not winning and it's really disgusting that they called for violence yet they called for quote unquote peace but then you have the I'm calling from violence against Republicans I just think it's nasty\nWell well it is Alan and and they make no look they make no apologies about don't\nThey don't at all the big big literally call for violence is so

doesn't make sense to me they attack businesses and what what\nAn Alan ... you know all the antifa story or just a couple of days ago they are the ...\nBut the the Republicans and I look I don't get into the Proud Boys and all that kind of stuff and not a big fan of that okay but you know what when you got antifa people out there beating you over the head with a baseball bat by golly you got a right to defend yourself\nWhere those men and when those people tried to defend themselves looking out the mainstream media and looking out the Democrats portrayed it\nWell the mainstream media is a is a joke isn't really to me it's a joke and on top of that I think antifa is a bigger joke itself\nIf they are criminals in the ... their ...\nTheir ... beyond criminals Allen I Believe that they are domestic terrorists I mean when you've got people when you've got people blocking public streets and harassing citizens and burning buildings and beating up police officers on a regular basis that to me is\nIs domestic terrorism and and honestly I Believe that is the that's the enforcement arm of the Democrat Party I Will go ahead\nOh and to be honest with you I think they're just gonna grow because I feel like the Democratic party a support system in a way they don't like to announce it officially by I think they are\nWell it's a great it's look it's a terrific point you bring up Alan appreciate the telephone call but you folks you got to be careful out there it is dangerous absolutely dangerous the idea that a a a lady running for a a a state house seat in Minnesota\nIs charged ... protester at a gas station come on\nAll right let's get back to the phones here Jimmy Long Island New York welcome to the program Jimmy\nHi how are you trying to think you saw it and I had to come back to a old now so you had mentioned that these professors now are are and and we know what to do their case to wear\nSure ah I think if the schools are funded with federal taxpayer dollars that thing on the phone and asking a representative to pull funding from the University of ... money talks the only way to get these people to listen\nNow that's an interesting thought so you you believe that if you got professors on on faculty that are advocating violence we're targeting conservatives we ought to just yank the federal funding\nTo why are we paying tax out a taxpayer dollars to fund a violent rhetoric at her and and teaching our kids are impressionable minds violence we're not sending our kids to school to become violent\nOr active if we were there were sending them to school to become educated and and to have their own to teach them how to use their own mind without\nAny uh other interest groups or injecting their opinions\nJudy I think I think this is a great idea I'm going back to what is it a couple of years ago remember what happened to Berkeley when they had a mild Milo ... and he was supposed to give a speech at Berkeley and they nearly burned down the the the protesters nearly burned down parts of the of the school\nAnd uh the university cancelled the speech and I was I was out there saying if you got to if you're a public university in\nAnd you don't believe in free speech that you don't deserve any any taxpayer money\nI I agree and and I remember this anything it seems to be come progressively worse and I think it it it would be a good step or I don't have the tough when mine are you doing sir I think you're doing a great job I think we if we could push\nSomething like this and make it happen I think things will change down the line and and uh I I mean that's just my opinion but\nUh I I think that in you know you have the platform to do so we can make this happen I think people that are listening over in Mississippi should be getting on the phone and contacting their lawmakers and say listen I'm not sitting in my kid to this school too\nA tactic taxpayer funds and I'm sure there would be a different to\nJimmy I think that is a terrific idea and I know the good people of Mississippi or just disgusted with the University of ... with with all this\nUh in general are because they're they're fine university has been overrun by by the leftist and it's really sad what's happened there\nAnd they had been really at the center of this what I call a culture of jihad where they've been tearing down all the vestiges of the civil war renaming streets in renaming buildings it's a mess over there\nAnd I got to be so so this is again this is a continuation\nSo now they're what they're telling people is you know what if if it's okay if you happen to be a professor\nAnd you want to go after conservatives that's okay we're going to give you a pass I mean the fact they didn't even have the guts to go after\nAnd name this professor in the press release that's pretty sick and I have to imagine a lot of our Mississippi listeners like Jimmy said are\nFired up about ... Jimmy appreciate the call that music means we've got us good out of here for a news break triple light seven eight nine nine one zero is our telephone number that's AAA seven eight nine nine one zero the website is Todd storage dot com stick around boats hang on if you're on the phone lines were going to get right to [noise]\n[noise]\nUm [noise]\nThey want chaos [noise] they don't believe in the rule of law they want anarchy they want these people they they they want these an artist to go after and beat up and bully and harassed Republicans they want to silence your voice right and that's what they want to do\nI'm southern and I'll tell you what you're absolutely right we we got ourselves porch or anybody\nWhether they better be real careful ... yes and maybe a but riding all truth though I'm not sure to many books back to Mississippi salad [laughter] Ryan appreciate the telephone\nIn that area so I can see that All right triple eight seven eight nine nine with zero our number that's triple eight seven eight nine nine what zero Charlotte North Carolina Leo you are on the show\nHey Todd how you doing today a love your show hey first off I I agree totally with Ryan with what he just said and uh uh I don't take enough can be done to that in ... ah well I'm calling about the day is I think that the far left in ... for folks\nAnd the issues with the tax on Republicans and independents that people need people because everybody's got cell phones needs to take pictures of all these actions that they're performing\nAnd uh basically what crimes have committed and they need a posted on a Web Web page somewhere maybe call it the young people hall of shame\nAnd curling with that to an all these mobs that they've got up there where you got ... demonstrators are doing they're things that are the professional demonstrated for source and other organizations\nThat people should take pictures of those folks to the same time and maybe get those up there because of my opinion where where you have people think this is going to happen just for twenty two more days in my opinion this is the new norm for these guys and ah it it needs to be a people need to know about it and they need to be charged for crimes they commit\nLeo I want you to listen to some audio I'm going to play here I Want to get your reaction to it we we had to bleep out a lot of the words here but there was there was another anti protest in Portland, Oregon\nAnd these folks actually targeted a woman we've got the video over at times during the dot com we had to bleep out a lot of the language this woman wearing an NYPD hat\nAnd you are going to hear her say that she lost her husband in nine eleven again this is a woman and and folks I and I believe I'm going to get you I Want you to respond to this when you hear hear this audio but folks this is going to in theory eight you\nI feel like you're not going to wait\nFor him [noise]\nGood like much of a mind\nThing immigrants and their bully\nRight and the great\nLeader can you imagine a grown man saying that kind of stuff to a woman\nI I Am I'm totally repulsed by by what you just played in other words is just total lack of disrespect\nFor for ... what what I Would call the true Americans you know here you got a person who who a lady who who in ... wearing a ... T shirt that you know about New York and because of nine nine eleven she lost her ... her husband and yet then then she says she's just wearing this casually walking the streets and you got slugs\nPeople that are coming up I wouldn't call them thugs I mean they're they're they're they're scum guys up and people are coming up and and and getting into people's face wanting to fight basically a ... you know it's like it's like you know we're a third world country when you when you get people like that involved it's incredible people people\nMirrors US cities that have\nThat don't have people that the top please stand up to these ... folks they should they should impeach him you know get them out don't even whites to vote about the the other people should rise up pizza guy and get rid of them\nAnd and basically uh you know we need we need police presence otherwise what you're going to seize anarchy in the streets were just like a rod said the people in the south they carry guns you know you go to Florida they got stand a stand your ground laws uh it it'll it'll get nasty down the road it really well\nAnd ultimately that's what they're I think that's what they're counting on ... so I think conservatives have to be very very careful\nTime when you've got people out there like the situation in Minnesota where you've got the anti guy going up and punching a woman that that that's you know you've got to defend yourself\nAnd I agree I tell you what you know there's a large portion of people that that are are are vocal about you know being Republicans\nThere's an an an independence I'm On an independent and with all this stuff going on\nOver the last several years I I I fully as of now voting Republican I Want everybody to to go to the polls to vote and ... and we need to get rid of the uh the the people that are or are you know not representing America as as fully ...\nAnd ... what concerns me Leo this is not this is not a Republican or a Democrat issue that this is an issue about right and wrong\nAnd and I'm afraid the Democrats have at least Democrat leadership they have commandeer the antifa and some of these other leftist groups to do their bidding in an attempt to to maintain power or regain power\nAnd I can I mean I have to imagine there are there are a few more Democrats like Joe Manchin\nWho would be limited and outraged that this kind of stuff is happening in the Democratic party I Hope there are but I'm not too sure there are\nWell that's why I think the hall the antifa or demonstrate Apollo fame all shame basically them having their pictures out there\nAnd people know the crimes are committed to it and luckily maybe their their their employers would see that and say hey look you know we don't need your type people working for us you know a a or living in this area something of that nature you know maybe that would shake 'em up\nLeo A terrific terrific call and I want you to give us a holler back some time we appreciate you listening to our program very much you have a good that\nArgue too now good guide Leo from Charlotte North Carolina but you've got to be careful out there\nIn her car and she she got the heck out of there that's exactly what um our good friend of the state by state lawmaker from a tendency to may beepers we had her on the telephone and tell them the radio program and she was recounting what happened to her when she was accosted at a traffic light\nBut for us to ignore this I Know a lot of conservative radio the radio host or or are really not talking about these issues I think we have to talk about these issues you guys need to understand what's out there you need to understand the attacks that are coming your way what your kids may pace on college campuses it's unacceptable\nArt triple eight seven eight nine nine one zero ah let's go to Matt ... ah Charlotte North Carolina Welcome to the program\nTodd how you doing I'm well thank you\nLove your show and I'm Glad to see a brother on the on the air it's awesome will think before before I get to the mid term or a opinion I just wanted to let\nBring some of your tent and do you ever notice how when Democrats\nDo something really really wrong and watch them on TV\nThey always say well we both need to calm down the rhetoric we both need to stop doing certainly it's all of them it is not the right that's doing any of this stuff it really isn't\nThat one I talked about stomping on somebody with the spikes any better or a baseball my that was out of line and he took that back and he was denounced by the right but as far as the midterms are concerned I'm telling you I'm telling you they will not\nThey will not take the house we're going to gain about six seats in the Senate and they will not take the house you mark my words their country is not going to tolerate what's been going on you might be in the little bubble in New York or Washington or LA you think that everyone thinks like you for the rest of the country sees what's going on and it is not happening\nThey will not take the house or the Senate\nSo ... you really believe that the Republicans are going to\nRight for us but as far as the Senate is concerned we I I I'm telling you will have fifty six fifty seven a seat in uh\nIn in the Senate and we will retain the house no doubt in my mind market down write it down right now and say Matt from show a North Carolina said I'm telling it's happening I'm not even worried\nAbout Matt here's what we're going to do we're going to write this down and then you've got a call us

I Believe that it was the ... the ... went broke several years ago because there was this emu fad and a bunch of people bought him use and then there was there's supposed to be there's a huge demand for the meat and it will call you a bunch of crap there was no demand for him your mate\nI Know I'm not an expert on alpacas I'm not even an expert on branches um but from a business perspective I think you're entering a pretty narrow market\nAgree yes\nAnd you better to really know your stuff and you better really do this you can't do it just cause you read in some article about alpacas were making people rich goes or not I mean any more than any more than cows are making people rich cows make people pretty poor all the time and some of them they make people rich\nBut it is as do other running a business um called cattle you know and then as a business and when it ceases to be a business and starts to be a sad um or never becomes a business because all of this was a fad than there you go so what is the deal what are you ... what do you get out of alpacas what's the product\nThe product the fleece or you can uh [noise] excuse me you can turn into sweaters and socks and so forth I'm very similar to Kashmir and the ... of the police you know\nUm [noise] and ah there you can also breed and uh\nSo or sell them um and show them and all that [laughter] um but ... it's almost completely about the fleece a and a big part of it is it's a ... and stuff so [noise] ah with everybody that have allergies my my children for example have allergies um\nAnd are you a better than you have you been in agriculture and renting before no this'll be my first venture into it um so why would a first venture into wrenching into it with a very narrow product line\nWell that is actually the second half of it I'm a first start I'll be starting with goats and I have a uh my I don't have all of the expertise myself it's a good friend of mine who does and we're gonna be working together [noise]\nOn the growth until you cash it in\nAnd so I've started to a group of ... five hundred fund an index fund\nAnd use that to grow for the next five ten years or so until you buy a house as long as you leave it alone as long as you plan to leave it alone at least five years you can survive the gyrations of the stock market and you should be fine\nIn that and that that's exactly what I Would do I do a similar thing Scott and sometimes I've got some extra money and I'm just saving up for my next real estate purchase as an investment\nAnd um even if I don't have five years in that case I'll ride the market with it and ah 'cause I can afford for it to go down if I mess up a little bit but yeah that that's the direction I Would go good question Robby is with us in Pittsburgh hey Robbie welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHey Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOh thank you so much for taking my call yeah I had a quick question uh so I Am a nurse or by profession and my wife is a a nurse and that that I Am wondering if I should go back to school again next year\nOr so my question is if they work for me to go to school now I'm thirty two years old my wife is\nUh twenty nine we make a combined income right now of a two hundred and a two hundred and twenty thousand\nA year and um so if I go to school it's going to cost me ... years of not working\nOn that tuition of around Ninety thousand dollars mhm uh but uh our gross income after I go to school and be successful together would be close to a three hundred thousand mhm\nSo uh but it's a ... a year now are right now around Seventy thousand\nOkay so you're saying this is going to cost you three hundred grand three years\nLive on her income or you're doing this\nI can live on her income for sure that's how we did it when she was in school [noise] um but I don't think I can cash anything right now because I\nAnd I also don't have a house or at the moment so I was you know planning on buying a house or or putting at least that putting a down payment for a house next year before I started school so that\nThen you need to wait until you can pay for school\nOr whatever but you never in Thirty years of doing the show recommended somebody borrow money to go to school okay you've got the cash flow to do it it's just a matter of when you do it and what you put first what you put second you might plenty of money to come up with not agreeing\nYeah plenty of money and you don't have to have the whole money up front you just got to see in your budget how you can cash flow would um I can see it pretty easily ... to go through the clash again or go\nTo guy ... it's a three year program\nSo thirty grand a year\nOr thirty grand a year yeah\nAnd and she makes what\nShe makes a hundred and fifty thousand\nYou can't catch ... already granted I'm a hundred and fifty\nA law not when I'm not in coal\nNo if you're in school she makes a hundred and fifty thousand dollars and ... thirty thousand over a hundred and fifty to go to school year for three years\nI I I'm Sorry fifty thousand it's it's a it's going to be around a sixty thousand a year\nI thought you said it was Ninety thousand [noise] ah sorry I got that wrong it's it's the sixty thousand a year\nSeems high\nYet it fit into it it is an expensive program\nKnow go to a less expensive program okay but cash flow it whenever you're going to pay for it figure out a way to pay for it if I usually go you don't actually have an old style stacked up ahead of time but you've got to see where it's going to come from I Would not recommend you go get student loans because there's\nAnd then you've got what's known as a freaking mess and so I'm not suggesting you're dumber you can't pass the test or something like that

right now and he's all over the country talking to churches and to a school and college students in high school students pretty amazing young guy\nAnd uh we best selling author of the book the graduate survival guide five states you can't afford to make in college I was a huge shower\nPeople giving then obviously too soon to be college students and um\nThe book co authored with other rooms your personality Rachel cruise show jumping triple eight eight to five five two to five Megan is with us in Cleveland, Ohio I'm Megan welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve how can I Hope\nI Am calling because my husband and I are on cutting out of a bankruptcy about about a year and a half ago and we took piano and add them kind of creating I got snowball and going through everything [noise]\nOne of our student loans is no longer and lay it on our credit report and so we have no contact information\nI have no idea how to get a hold of these people um my husband student loan and so we're kind of I'm sure what to do do we just\nLeave it alone I'm afraid of case knocking on our doors Sunday\nOh you're going to they're going to let them after you've had one student loans are not bankrupt the ball and they're going to come find you it's just sitting are piling up we need to find it but you don't have a single piece of information on this lump\nSo my husband's not very organized I'm I'm I'm much more organized when it comes to our financial and um\nHa I'm Still so you know it was it not you have the trace account number [noise] probably somewhere in general I guess that's the first place you would start called chase him without account number and say\nI Know this will show can you tell me who sold to I can tell you than you think it was sold again you call those people when you go I Know this was sold can you tell me how it was sold to until they finally say well no we own it and so forth now is this the Sallie Mae loan or a private loan\nPie that mountain it's not a Sallie Mae is not government to ensure\nNow you're sure\nYeah then why didn't they get bankrupted with the bankruptcy\nThat's what I'm thinking may have happened but it's\nNot only did Alan has a ... it's not a matter of it's not up to the lender as to what they go bankrupt as up to you and your attorney\nHeather is in the lobby of Ramsey solutions\nFrom Spokane, Washington where the question\nI Heather ... better than I deserve what's up and I just finished baby step three and now I'm working on baby steps three ... saving for a house got your emergency fund good for ... yeah and I wanted to know how long is too long in baby step three being the flashing lives on today's ...\nThere's not a magic answer the concept or the or the critical thinking skills for the answer is simply this\nIf you stay there so long that you don't save for retirement you screwed up your retirement right yeah or if you don't stay there long enough then you don't have a good solid down payment and you'll end up with other problems on the mortgage so it's the it's the pull between those two things\nAnd most people that means you know three years four years something like that [noise] um but if you're if you're fifty nine it might not be that long or you're not fifty nine now how old are you\nAnd twenty eight on friday\nCool and so I mean if you stayed out for four years and never started any retirement until thirty two but you had a really juicy down payment on a house and got ... ... you know how to plan to pay it off in a few years because of that you're not you're you're still going to retire multi millionaire you know\nBut from a critical thinking skills standpoint so how long were you thinking of\nWell I just started in June and I'm hoping to have it done in two years\nOkay and so the thirty years' old your your game own on retirement taking on a Fifteen year mortgage by forty five the mortgage is paid for us not sooner and are you will have saved thirty five years at Fifteen Percent of your income which unless you just don't work\nIs going to make you a millionaire multimillionaire usually I'm doing this so you're in a safe zone there but that's how you make the decision more importantly than they Ramsey says never go more than three years that's not how it works it's just you're pulling those two things are pulling at each other or because you're not saving for retirement the longer you go yeah that's all it is high thanks for stopping by think stands\nOpen phones at triple eight eight to five five to to find but Julian is in New York City how Julian how are you know\nI ... it can you hear me okay I can how can I help\nThank you very much for taking my call so I'm into a bit of a unique position I'm I'm twenty four next year I'm going to medical school and uh I was I'm very very lucky and very appreciative uh I'm not going to have any debt to after graduating medical school and residency residency included I decide to specialize\nUm and uh what did you get a felony or what um uh yeah I'm not certain this to what I Want to do yet I no no no I'm I'm asking how you did that\nOh oh um yeah so so if they get from my father\nAnd my grandparents um wow I'm very very very appreciative yeah\nGood now yeah you should be that's amazing wonderful so how can I Do\nUm yeah so when when I was Twenty one uh I was given a essentially control this funny 'cause it's under my name I'm but I'm Sorry I Apologize I'm so I'm a yeah I was I was\nBut um because it's under my name and he he's actually act in the rain stopped me or I Would like it a second opinion as to what to do with this money I can give it a little bit of a money for a living expenses um and I said that about five thousand dollars from\nSome small side jobs at hospitals but I Want to know how to capitalize on this and how that myself up as best as I can for after medical school\nWell the the thing I Would be most concerned about is that the money is available and enough to get you through medical school\nUm it it definitely is um about one third of it is invested very securely and two thirds of it I have in savings I'm In the two thirds we were discussing putting into at AT T bill on a three month renewal faith that until I needed to take them out to pay my tuition and then I Would just reinvent the rest\nUm well I probably would not do that and the only reason is is that the bills basically or bonds\nAnd a bond interest rates are yields are go the bond values rather go down as interest rates go up and we are in an increasing and the interest rate environment so if you put a hundred thousand dollars in the bills that could turn into Ninety pretty quick\nAs interest rates increase so that's not a very safe investment an environment that we're in right now um but if you wanted to have some portion of the money invested I probably would go to something like gross income type funds but I'm okay if there's enough there to do simple division and it doesn't have to really earn anything\nIf you want to keep it all very very safe because that would be okay with me because the most important thing is for you to be able to graduate with zero debt\nAnd if you screw around with his money in some way and it loses value and you're not able to do that then the whole you know is like a ... we were conscious\n... is the most important part of this month equation not what this money is paying\nA it'd be nice to be a little bit sophisticated about it but if you get caught up in some kind of a sophisticated process and you end up losing money trying to trying to just get a little bit more on this lump sum uh you you defeated ... Detroit yourself in the foot so to speak so um\nThat's the process you're looking at I'm going to keep it pretty safe or if you want to go toward something that's fun but I wouldn't use bonds for anything right now is washable play Kimberly is in Pensacola Hi Kimberley how real\nFunny thing is I'm doing great thank you so much for taking my call sure\nI I just wanted to thank you for all you do um this December Wal Mart has it's been seven years since my husband and I have paid off our debt I'm following your plans to go for that\nUm but my question today is um my sister in our little concerned about our parents and we're hoping you could give us some advice on how they could got them um my parents live in North Carolina and they live in a flooded area of flood prone area\nAnd I'm so every time there hurricane come through um they they experienced some flooding it on their on their property at their home as well as my dad's business\nAnd we were just wander and what you can and as far as shit they sell it and then um they have noticed that they do have um some savings and my mom has a I think for one\n\nAnd often does this property blood\nAnd not on a um it flooded and it was it got like forty inches in the house and I think about\nSo and it almost at like about six inches from getting in the house again and I'm so ... there's only been two major flood but um but they're in their sixties and it it's very emotional for them in any town a farm and it's just\nIt's throughout this past down we actually packed up or I didn't care whether they want to help them with adequate but they packed up all their belongings and let them put them away and you know because they were afraid that\nThey're so what am I was living there has become more painful than not living there\nBut those are the fear of rising water even yeah even the fear is not founded we once on Twenty years is not that bad but bottom line is is that he's developed a phobia for them\nAnd they're not have been living there they're not as fun living there and why wouldn't they move\nI don't I mean the actual threat a flood statistically with what you've given me I wouldn't be that concerned about but if they're absolutely panicking Everytime the weather person comes on says it's raining\nAnd it's just my phone to live there\nSo you know it's more of an emotional decision wrong with that is my liver more move\n[laughter]\nHeard me talk about our detail for years and how it's only a matter of time before you become a victim but I run across some numbers that even surprised me and shows the real nightmare that people go through when they become a victim of the sixteen million victims of identity theft last year yes sixteen million\nTwenty six percent of them have to borrow money from

they get a success level earlier anything where your spotlight then you get a success level\nAnd your skill this world class in that thing does not mean you have everything else together yeah yeah and that's true with the you know teenagers in general is one of the things we do this entrepreneur tool box\nIs they can start to develop some of those skills you know running a business yeah\nThey and

Seventy five\nHundred and twenty five thousand dollars correct\nOkay and why she taking distribution says they're just taking it\nUm ... you want her financial grant or told her that she had to do it in a disturbing to I'm a mix it cover her at a over the fear that hit hard over at the most part because the way the quick money out of town\nYeah it's a bunch of crap um the uh\nOkay because anytime you start making decisions based on taxes instead of based on economics you make bad decisions so I don't know what this money's invested in but I Want to get control of this money and get it invested\n... what would I Do I catch the whole thing out pay some taxes and get a different financial advisor and uh I Would pay off all the debt and I would invest the rest of it\nOr in something that I can see control and know what it is in good mutual funds or in some paid for real estate or something like that\nI honestly don't think that's what you all are going to do\nBut that's what I Would do um because I think there's a lot of cooks in this kitchen there's a lot of opinions flying around here and\nYou guys have got to get inside this and as a couple of decide what you're going to do and how you're going to handle money and then you start telling financial advisors what to do and show them telling you what to do and it's a different different situations so I think she inherited

possible deal\n'cause she comes from Laurie in Iowa I was interested in opening a five twenty nine plan for my daughter she has autism so I may open an ... account instead would depending on the severity of autism my biggest concern\nFor education or it will be if you don't transfer it to a sibling um it'll be heavily taxed and ... it'll be taxed and heavily penalize so um\nYou know the five twenty nine is not a good plan a for a child that you're not sure what's going to happen as far as their education\nIs going to be and we've got a special needs situation like this I Would usually able to count 'em and or I Would just use mutual fund\nJust blurted mutual fund and let it grow\nAnd then you can just take care of the child with that money you're just you're marking it for them for their future or they may do a trade school they may do or they may be able to do a full for your academic run 'em they may do a lot of things I don't know how the severity of this I don't know exactly what you're facing\nBut are you simply going to save money it's as simple invest money in your name and you're controlling it and then you can decide to help your child however you want to the only advantage of the table or the five twenty nine is just the tax advantage\nStill just an investment in a good mutual funds\nMy question is is at our as it grows is going to be taxed\nThat's the only thing so it's a it's an advantage if you have a real high probability of them doing our education\nBut again where you've got a a a special needs situation most of the time I'm going to say just save it in a regular count saving the mutual fund if you want to use the cable that's fine that's what it's designed for do all kinds of stuff with that but it's a good plan but\nI probably would just keep it were and get my hands on it and I'm I'm not a big deal either way the the thing the reason we push of ... those two things are ... in a traditional such a situation\nIt teaches you to brainwash your kid to go to college which is not a bad thing at all and the other thing is it allows that money to grow\nNo it's just in a more traditional situation it's the best way the most um you know the least taxes on the thing which is generally what we want to do\nI'm relating to grow but in this situation I I'm not the tax benefit is not worth the pension you in the corner and actually hitting you harder later I'm making you wish you just pay the taxes\nAnd and that's the way to work out open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five ... on Twitter David I'm thinking about studying

I Believe that he\nWas yellow Jersey went broke several years ago 'cause there was this emu fad and a bunch of people ... and then there was just supposed to be there's a huge demand for the meat\nAnd it was basically a bunch of crap there was no demand for him you meet and I'm pretty soon people just said daddy amuse everywhere but I'm a you know alpacas I mean I I Know I'm not an expert on alpacas I'm not even an expert on ranches a but from a business perspective I think you're entering a pretty narrow market\nAgree yes and you better to really know your stuff and you better really do this you can't do it just 'cause you read in some article about alpacas were making people rich\nGoes or not I mean any more than any more than cows are making people rich cows make people pretty poor all the time and some of them they make people rich\nBut as I as do other running a business um called cattle you know and in a business and when it ceases to be a business and starts to be a fad um or never becomes a business because all of this was a fad than there you go so what is the deal what are you ... what do you get out of ... ... what's the product\n[noise] end product is the fleece or you can uh [noise] excuse me you can turn into sweaters and socks\nAnd uh there you can also breed and or\nOr sell them um and show them and all that [noise] um [noise] but ... it's almost completely about the fleece a and a big part of it is it's a ... and stuff so [noise] ah with everybody that have allergies my my children for example have allergies um\nAnd are you a better than to have you have you been in agriculture and renting before no this'll be my first venture into it um for a while we ... our first venture into ... into it with a very narrow product line\nWell that is actually the second half of it I'm a first start I'll be starting with his goats and I have a uh my I don't have all of the expertise myself it's a a good friend of mine who does and we're gonna be working together [noise]\nOr a series of them for something like that I probably would just using ... P index fund because it will grow virtually without paying taxes on it until you pull it out I as a what's called a low turnover ratio which means the taxes aren't charge much on the growth until you cash it in\nAnd so I've started to a group of ... five hundred fund an index fund\nAnd use that to grow for the next five ten years or so until you buy a house as long as you leave it alone as long as you plan to leave it alone at least five years you can survive the gyrations of the stock market and you should be fine\nIn that and that that's exactly what I Would do I do a similar thing Scott and sometimes I've got some extra money and I'm just saving up for my next real estate purchase as an investment\nAnd um even if I don't have five years in that case I'll ride the market with it and I 'cause I can afford for it to go down if I mess up a little bit but yeah that that's the direction I Would go good question Robby is with us in Pittsburgh hey Robbie welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHey Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOh thank you so much for taking my call yeah\nBut as I Am wondering if I should go back to school again next year or so my question is if they work for me to go to school now I'm thirty two years old my wife is\nUh twenty nine we make a combined income right now off a two hundred and a two hundred and twenty thousand a year and um so if I go to school it's going to cost me three years of not working\nAnd the tuition off around Ninety thousand dollars mhm uh but uh our gross income after I go to school and be successful uh together would be close to a three hundred thousand mhm\nSo uh but it's a year now uh right now Ron Seventy thousand\nAnd two in here saying this is going to cost you a three hundred room three years or three years of Seventy thousand missing plus nine out of pocket yeah okay can you cash flow than on the out of pocket and can you live on her income or you're doing this\nI can live on her income for sure that's how we did it when she was in school uh but I don't think I can cash anything right now because I and I also don't have a house or at the moment so I was you know planning on buying a house\nOr or putting at least they're putting a down payment for a house next year before I start school so\nThen you need to wait until you can pay for school or whatever but you never in Thirty years we're doing the show recommended somebody borrow money to go to school okay you got the cash flow to do it it's just a matter of when you do it and what you put first what you put second you might plenty of money to come up with not agreeing\nYeah plenty of money and you don't have to have the whole money up front you just got to see in your budget how you can cash flow would um I can see it pretty easily ... owns it take to go through the glass again or go\nAnd she makes what she makes a hundred and fifty thousand you can't catch ... already granted I'm a hundred and fifty\nA law not when I'm not in coal\nNo if you're in school she makes a hundred and fifty thousand dollars and ... already thousand over a hundred and fifty to go to school year for three years\nI I I'm Sorry fifty thousand it's ... it's a it's going to be around a sixty thousand a year\nI thought you said it was Ninety thousand I'm Sorry I got that wrong it's it's a sixty thousand a year\nSeems high\nYeah it it it is a ... with an expensive program you know go to a less expensive program\nOkay but cash flow it whenever you're going to pay for it figure out a way to pay for it if\nI usually go you know they certainly have an old style stacked up ahead of time but you got to see where it's going to come from I Would not recommend you go get student loans because here's the thing everyone starts that program doesn't finish it but every one that takes out student loans just aren't that program has on student loans whether they finish or not\nAnd then you've got what's known as a freaking mess and\nSo I'm not suggesting you're dumber you can't pass the test or something like that my life happens do in the last thing you want the only time debt works as if everything works\nOther than that that doesn't work\nAnd so we tell you to stay away from it thanks for the call open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Joshua is in Dallas texas Hi Joshua how are you\nI'm good how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nSo basically I Am stuck in between whether I should file for bankruptcy or to go ahead and start paying 'em all my debt off um goalball basically all my debts except my car are in collection so that's why that's the only reason I'm basically contemplating um bankruptcy\nWhy are they only go actions um\nMhm I lost my job and that I think I think like a phone bill the narrative mhm\nOkay so how much is the repo bill\n[noise] I'm actually only like a couple of ... um ... it gets what I have on there is\nA booth nine nine thousand four\nHundred and forty five dollars\nAn old apartment mhm how long ago was that three and a half years ago\nOkay and how ... how much how much money and I don't want your medical data began\nI Would say about two thousand\nAnd one of the doubt if you go\nTo the rest of it is is mixed in there with like ... or ... I think a phone bill and always payday Lowe is well you know so\nYou're you're totally that's less than twenty thousand dollars\nRight and then I have um my car which is a twelve thousand mhm okay and what do you make it easier\nI'm I'm a little bit old for forty five I make a thousand a week I'm a independent contractor\nMhm and you're single\nOr married you're married owner and\nI'm twenty eight on Saturday there's\nHappy birthday does she work outside the home\nI'm no she stays at home and takes care of her daughter\nOkay yeah well\nLet me tell you what I'm hearing okay and I think I'm hearing maybe I'm wrong I'm a ... cat used to say that debt is not the problem is a symptom\nOf something else that's going on I'm right and it sounds like you guys have never told your money what to do you've never had any savings for emergencies so every time an emergency comes up you get thrown out of an apartment sued your car gets ... and you end up with a mess\nYou're going to be back here if I waved to want to ... go way which is what bankruptcy might do maybe I'm if it did that make you have zeroed out all of a sudden except your car\nIf you don't change their habits that caused this mess in the first was you'll be back right where you are someday do you agree\nYeah there you know so we really need to get under that does bankruptcy doesn't solve that uh you got to solve that in the mirror you and your wife learning how to handle money I don't think you're bankrupt I think you're scared disorganized don't know what to do and have done nothing so far\nI think you can probably shuttle that old apartment that for three or four grand if you're saved it up and offer them a lump sum settlement uh I\nI've actually called them multiple out of there are ... ... if you tell they were the first video that I was looking up out of it that collectors you know from underneath\nIt don't it doesn't change my answer to whether it's nine thousand or three thousand you're still not bankrupt\nIt's still about you getting control\nAnd when you do that then you're going to see your way through this bankruptcy is not a bad problem Mr behavior from Scott\nI'll help you out I'm a singer family the total money make over both read that take an extra job shall everything in sight and let's get this mess cleaned up I'll show you how to\nKeep listening meant\nUs today ramps you show [noise]\nOne of the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth that will save you tons of money in the long run to help I recommend all my listeners check out one dental dot com it's not dental insurance one dental as a dental discount program\nThat functions like a membership club think of it like Costco you join for a small yearly fee and you say big ...\nTwo of my team members have saved over a thousand dollars with the one dental plan\nAnd this is not just for you and your family there are group rates for your business church or association available fulltime part time contract employees volunteers and members joined the Fifteen million people across the country who are already saving with these plans to get a special discount for my listeners\nGo to one dental dot com\nSlash day start saving today at one dental dot com slash Dave\nAll right Chris in San Diego California sixty three thousand dollars played all been twenty two months making fifty fifty nine counted down let's hear a debt free scream\nOne two three we're still\nVery very well done [noise]\nTrisha is in Huntsville Tricia how are you I'm good thanks how are you better than I deserve what's up\nCalling about my mom um I'm not really sure how to handle her situation she had taken F.

it\nExactly and so now she's going to have to have surgery on her ... and she's coming to me because she's going to have to file SNL a says she's gonna have to be without some of her paycheck and she's telling me that\nShe can't maintain that she doesn't know what she's going today is ...\nWhat's the matter I don't really know how to what what's the surgery on the wrist\nAnd kind of not or something that's very painful and so she's gonna have to have it right and they\nKnow how long have you been there\nI think this is her wake up call\n\nOkay I think it's time for her to stay at work long enough to build up enough pay pay in a savings account to be able to survive the time the shoes off while she's only ... okay I mean what I mean what if you weren't they weren't there to bothers drunk or drink\n\nThey wouldn't be able to drink right if you weren't there to buy to buy her her drinks she wouldn't be getting drunk\nRight\nWhen you finance firm misbehavior you ensure it is going

woman loose from one crisis doing other than their own self\nCreated back you know back home\nAnd I thought I was reading that in the mail but I wasn't sure so I mean I understand and I'm not trying to be lacking compassion I Want to be compassionate but\nContinuing to assist her in this behavior line that has been destructive to or is not compassionate\nOkay so that kind of paint like\nMan I mean it has to tell you what I don't know I mean you got to sit down and figure out how you're going to do this in layers but maybe you maybe you assist her partially in return for her engaging in behaviors that she knows she's supposed to be doing\nOK but so far she has refused all help that has to do with Hirsch frightening up yeah I was a little kid my dad used to say straighten up and fly right you ever heard that\nDon't even know what that man's I don't even know what that means I just knew we'd better straighten up I never did flies or I don't know what he meant but I didn't fly right you know but you know talking about straighten up have you know ... ... and ... and I did I mean does he have little looked as if we didn't do what he said so you know but I'm the shows\nWhether ... because of her\nBecause you love her and you don't want to see her in pain and she refuses to do the things she calls the pain to go away\nMhm okay\nAnd you're more concerned about her behavior than she is so I I think I just sit down and tell her all that say you know how do you want to let me tell you when you do all that she's going to get pissed off injury\nAnd here she feels entitled to

America great from the start of your lives show it was on stage\nTalking about are talking about these three American stories that I wrote about as well as the two sports books I did it give people a chance to talk about what's happening in politics more of a theater setting so we go to Brian kill me dot com you can get tickets the I'll be in Tampa\nVirginia Beach as well as in I'll finish up in Nashville so they asked\nWhat is it when you go on stage like this or were you going to these places obviously or for Fox so you kind of have that you know oh here comes this crazy conservative guy and and and we're seeing it more and more where people are coming up and and getting in people's faces but then you write something like this and\nAnd and you know we're hearing about you know the likes of Jordan Peterson and many other people going on campuses and and\nAnd disrupting when you go out there you feeling that kind of push back are you going to people that are challenging you with you know whether it be this you're writing about Andrew Jackson he's a horrible human being because he was a slave owner are you getting any of that\nYeah sure in fact uh CSPAN televised or to some books festival the day of John McCain's funeral\nAnd they said to me a favor save some questions at the end I owe a lot more to say but I said well you know the the promoters want some questions first question grade second question great the third question\nHe hates everything about may\nHave to everything I've done probably hates my family and I'm sitting there on stage and when it does it makes everybody feel awkward instead of having a probing questions they talk about wow how bad Fox's how Thomas Jefferson wasn't really taking on Islamic extremists\nA meal Jackson did a lot of bad things to American indian\nSo it's not like they want an avid dialogue is I'm In Washington DC or eighty five percent of the people did not vote for Donald Trump or George Bush and you just have an agenda and they can't believe the American people or me don't agree with them so it's not even interesting to talk to wake you up to one Williams\nYou talked to Geraldo Rivera you talk to down to Brazil did it's called the conversation but yeah people are so angry now they're not conversations\nNo nobody's interested in conversation and people are looking for their thirty seconds to sound bite of fame that they're going to get on the Internet but the reality is they they don't want to have a conversation because you may come back with something they can't answer so they want no part of that they just want to be able to throw the first punch and then run away and that drives me crazy about today's world\nBecause we're not having conversations Brian I like having a I had a dream or on the other day we did a podcast forty five minutes of dreamer was a great conversation we had a conversation about everything from sports to what he what it's like to feel like an American and have troubles here to his wife and his kids and all of these things\nAnd it was a real conversation we did we differed in a few areas and we agreed in some but we never get to that point anymore because we want to do was yell at each other\nI think that to look at him I going to defend President Trump's riding a horse face for Stormy Daniels absolutely not I Am I going to defend\nThere are some things are indefensible that President Trump does I'm not going to put in the big picture I don't look at it get up every day and thinking how he's destroying the country\nIf you look at these numbers you see the economy increasing you see her defense getting stronger you see our trade deals getting better if you want to argue with me at least acknowledge what's happening and then challenge me and I'm not going to push back when you say does he need to tweet\nPersonal attack absolutely not is beneath the office for me yes\nBut it can I tell you that his approach is America First in every way he's lost over a billion dollars this is by conservative estimates by taking this job his company can invest internationally\nHis son is being skewered his lawyer is being Jews because the matter of time has got to be jailed this CFO as been forced to take immunity\nHis best friends office has been raided and now he's got to get immunity one of them anyway won't the Enquirer think about what he deals within a daily basis they the Trump name is lauded and hated it used to be pretty much respected\nSo why did he do it\nAt least acknowledge he's doing it for the country at least acknowledge that trade deal is that we can build another building in Mexico and Canada at least acknowledge that he's trying to get a better deal\nFor America he takes on the ... you not for his ego because he feels as though the trade deals are tilted against us and NATO wasn't paying enough he's not running from allies why can't you take a step back and say he's different\nBut let's see if he's wrong I Want to say let's see if this works\nI don't think people understand that because they look at everything so emotional they and they decided to let their feelings or you know handle everything in their life and I to me I find that crazy we're talking to Brian ... Andrew Jackson and the miracle of New Orleans ... out in paperback next week\nLike Trump well Jackson is a good point when you your regional question I did not do a good job of answering as how are they like they're like this they both were despised by or the elite or the predecessor John Quincy Adams bronco bomber they both are not accepted as presidents or the John Quincy Adams left the White House before\nBefore uh before the before injured to actually get into the White House causing it'd be a riot with a lack of security so\nYou as somebody who not like the case of the people Jackson was the first to campaign when Trump was not accepted by the Republican Party or\nA the Washington establishment he brought his case in middle America and guess worry one\nMiddle America he was not worthy of the office they looked at Jackson borne so poor that backwards or the Carolinas he used to draw in crew to be president he's from he's not Jefferson Monroe he's now Washington you know he's not out of this guy's got no sophistication at all\nYou know he's a military general that you know\nHe's good at that but not this meanwhile he is the American success story he is the guy that was offered to Thirteen to volunteer for the revolutionary war that lost his two brothers during that war and his mom and his dad before he was born who was raised by the town that county the country who blood red white and blue and live to get\nRevenge other people that destroyed his family and that's the British that to American success story viewers policies one way but I understand what he represented if you come to this country you could accomplish anything you want or at least have the opportunity to fail that too and represented\nAbsolutely and last question appreciate your coming on today or you look at this whole thing going on with a cause showy and everything that is happening and the way that Trump is looking at it and you know one of my things on the talk about uh you know has been talking about throughout the day is the fact that you know Trump looks at this any much more you know macro way\nFight monsters against what we need we need other monsters and that's a weird crude way to say something like that but that's a way that I think Trump is looking at this is it it's better than than us when it comes to things like Iran and I don't think people understand that but at the same time what took place is absolutely heinous\nIt's like this ... is is like a friend of yours who your trusted\nComes in Rob's everything from your house you know a second I came to the keys to the house I trusted you I'd left for the weekend and you're out everything and they go yeah sorry\nYou can't that cake on punished even though this stuff is replaceable I mean Saudi Arabia with all its warts and all its problems and as a society that medieval\nWe still felt as though we could trust them more and could understand them better than our Iranians and together we were bringing Iranians economy to its knees and in turn then goes the fight there goes the financing of Hamas Hezbollah\nAnd their own forces the Republican army inside Syria so that could be multiple good things happening teeming with a government we don't necessarily agree with what we understood we at each other's back\nThis crown prince iffy green light it this this massacre of this one\nJournalist who has a green card and three American sons\nIs such disrespect the president\nShe has to make a substantial hit to the relationship whether it's maximizing Egypt from Iranian or told me to the smaller nations afterwards I Am all of that Lindsey Graham camp or a and Bob Corker can't they both went to bat the Saudi Arabia made sure they got that arms deal I Am not sure the options Trump passed\nBut we have to stand for something\nAnd I have that ... thing and then I usually\nYou got to be able to look your kids and the guy and your country's got to stand for you know about what's the message to Egypt what's the message to Jordan when you know if you have somebody else writing things about you you can go\nThe book it's called Andrew Jackson and the miracle of New Orleans Brian Kenny always a pleasure to have you on a man and look for to have you on again we'll talk about other stuff sometimes we'll talk about sports which I Love\nThat absolutely continued success jet taxes thanks so much rent appreciate that actually I've been to chose your Twitter ca JD be", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Pinetop", "day": "17"}
