scholar scholar a leading marketing technology company powers millions of digital signs around the world leading the wave of retail transformation visits college outcome today to modernize your digital experience Tom\nYou have a report about two members about tied in the Arabian Peninsula now with a wanted poster ten million dollars reward for ... and up to five million dollars well ward for college I'll buy tower the where did they come from top\nWell John this is a good example of what we talk about talk about these are kind of veterans who ... who can just sort of keep operating for many many years and stay in the game despite being relentlessly hunted by the U.S are allies because ... and how it up a coffee are both kinda veterans from\nTraining camps pre nine eleven in Afghanistan so these are both these guys attended offer which was okay this primary training facility in pre nine eleven Afghanistan\nAnd so their Journey Through jihad starts all laid back then and ... actually it was again a fight very early on by al ... as the guy who should be groomed for a leadership position he somebody who they they very early on thought you know\nOkay and rabid so now you\nKnow a lot of times you hear people talk about ... pie that's OK and rained peninsula as if it's an affiliate of al ... well we've said all along is no it's not really in a ... it's just all kinda because guys like this are groomed kind of veterans who\nHave been putting these positions Toledo kinda globally so they probably in our specimen is they probably play a role in actually all kinds of global management team making decisions around the globe now\n... of course came to fame because of the um attacks that they tried to plant against the United states\nGoing Christmas Day two thousand nine or when you had the this underwear bomber on Detroit bound plane and you've had a series of other mostly failed plots some inspired like dollar sign at Fort Hood\nAh which was sort of has some sort of inspirational connection minimum take a pay for the most ... piece plots against the u._s. have failed however they have taken advantage of the war in Yemen this multi sided conflict and they've expanded their base\nInside Yemen and according to a un report that came out this last summer they now have somewhere between six and seven thousand fighters\nIn Yemen Andre ... command so these two guys who um the u._s. ... released these wars for increased the reward for one of them and actually released a new or work for the other one um these are guys who likely have thousands of fighters on under their command\nThe consistent nature of your reporting over the years suggest that title looks upon its personnel and\nInterchangeable with other personnel did they move them around in cedars to learn networking Tom do they have a a a chart a personnel chart that says let's training here let training there or is it hit or miss\nWell you know we don't know exactly what their personnel policies are we can only track these guys and show when they pop up somewhere and say that there's probably some thought behind doing that and what we've seen is not only traffic from Afghanistan Yemen and back through the years of course going back to Nineteen nineties but then you see guys go from Yemen to us\nSee these guys go out of the pie and they serve leadership roles in other parts of the kind of work elsewhere so looks to us like this a creepy serves not only is part of the senior management structure within al ... of the top leaders but they have guys who they groomed go elsewhere to sort of continue on with that role elsewhere\nAnd the fact that they move them around you set a promotion can we tell do they have levels of trust and command authority uh ... the would he be a comparable to a colonel or general can we think of them that way\nJohn it's amazing you're asking this question because there's not been any work that we can detect to actually map out what their human sort of organization looks like in years and just never at least publicly US government is not tried to even explain what the management structure of a kind of looks like and yet when you go through their primary source\nStatements and literature you go through other pieces here and there you can point out and show that they do have a management structure in place despite the relentless post nine eleven war's been waged on them\nThey still have a management structure in place to this day and its opaque they don't they don't put on or turn on line to explain it to everybody but you can pick up details here and there for example you know I'm Out here of course the emir of okay well you know he has at least two deputy in years\nBy the way who according to the UN or in Iran and helping them lead the charge for all kinds of globally from her on\nBut then you have guys like this in Yemen who are fighting the Iranians his wife gets all ... complex\nWe're also probably part of the ... the senior management team and you start putting us all together you can see that there is a a sort of a human organization they're from top to bottom and yet there's been very little done publicly by the U.S government to explain to since nine eleven members an island a commission report gave a summary of sort of a basic summary of the commission structure\nThat have these different entities within all kind of worked or to guide the organization internationally we haven't seen updated version of that I can that I can point to any way since two thousand four so that tells you how out how out of date or assessments are this you\nFor this level can you tell ...\nWell you know it's interesting last week General Dunford had a very interesting comment this is the type of thing that should be everybody's ears perk up when they hear this he says that they've got new indications are new evidence intelligence that al ... is\nAble to communicate more readily and manage more readily across the globe it sort of infrastructure in place\nThis is like this is sort of a key tell because there's been a lot of what we call it disconnect the dots announces through the years to try and explain away all ... to try and say that has\nThere is no cohesion there is no global network and play and here's yet another comment our from U.S officials saying no there actually is social cohesion here and there is there is some coordination across international boundaries we think that that degree of coordination equation is actually a lot more than even what\nSome people have said but it's interesting to hear General Dunford a very senior level expressed that publicly chosen something got some assessment got to him that said oh look out\nGeneral Dunford as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff of four star a marine general\nHe leads the effort to defeat the gal ... so when he comments as Tom says look out Tom ... one\nOf the foundation for the defense of democracy this national

more ... sending in California is down ... quote irrespective of cost consumers\nThat means higher electric bills for every one\nOf the typical Arizona family\nThey didn't come from the hit especially hard California tried this and today electric rates in California are increasing three times the national average we don't want California taxes in Arizona or California and the high cost of living why would we want California\nIraq an electric bill does it do no problem one twenty seven dot\nNo on ... one twenty seven paid for by Arizona threat Ford about electricity not authorized by any candidate or Kennedy's committee\nBut uh you know within a month or two maybe several months and things will be back to normal\nThe reason is when the United states shows strain the Chinese back off um and so there's going to be a little bit less huffing and puffing than you'd think you know so far China's been quiet about this transit I'm waiting in the next several hours to see what ... says\nAnd we'll get a really good ... of where they're going because if we get a relatively mild statement that means things will settle down if they actually are belligerent um you know I trust that the Trump Administration will meet word for word and that's something that we need to do right now to show Beijing that we do have the resolve\nSaturday Gordon is depending on the wording the communication as you mentioned but we're real skin the Chinese regime attack the United states has interests in a tit for tat sort of way and you see in the streets or anywhere else\nThey can do that anywhere on planet earth any place in space you know the universe is not off limits um and so you know we're going to see a broad base challenge um and they will do that um see Jim paying has nowhere to back down he owns this controversy with the United states\nIf he is seen to cave in um he very well may not be living so um you know this is going to go on for quite some time that is um but ... teaching paying is whether he's an aberration or whether he is the inevitable result of Chinese communism we've got him for a little while and we've got to make sure that he's\nThe number of GDP said to be the slowest in the decades since the great recession two thousand two thousand nine whatever the real number is there is a contraction of the growth how China depends upon that means unemployment does Xi Jinping does the standing committee do they have a response to that\nWell the only response John is to do what they've been doing in the last several months which is to stop their de leveraging campaign pile on the debt\nAnd hope that they can grow their way out of this which of course they can't because\nEven if you believe their official GDP number of six point five percent growth and and you shouldn't but even if you were to believe it they're encouraging one and a half times as much as they're creating nominal gross domestic product\nThat's completely I'm a losing proposition for the June paying it just a question of how long he can hold on you can hold on a long time\nBut he's making the inevitable crisis bigger\nSo they don't have any real solution the real solution of course would be to reform but see jumping doesn't want to do that\nSo he's just going to take the country off the cliff with him\nThat is Gordon how about the capital of slows you talked about before\nUm well there hasn't been very much in the way of capital outflow since September or so of two thousand six team because the capital controls right now or ... and the ones that are announced and the ones that they are effectively enforcing which are unannounced\nBut I think we're going to start to see more money come out because there's a real change in the Senate and China it's gotten quite dark um and you can see that of course with the falls\nIn the stock market and in the currency the only reason why there was a rebound um today was in China which was actually quite as strong rebound and the Shanghai composite wasn't because the Chinese authorities were making these statements about how great the stock market was and they probably\nStarting to see I think a real pessimism because people are understanding the consequences not only of slow growth but also the challenge is Egypt paying as opposed to the United states and the American response that thing that's different Thaddeus is the American response\nDoes the renminbi go to seven going did they touched that that that live wire\nYou know I think so John you know if you'd asked me two or three weeks ago I would've said no and I probably would be wrong um because I think that they're starting to believe that they cannot indefinitely defend the currency\nI thought that they were defending six nine um but you know they went through six nine so I think I was wrong on that\nAnd you know of course the only time will tell but I think that they eventually have to ... what they should do John is a big one time devaluation shocked the markets punish all the speculators but they're not smart enough to do that\nAt one time devaluation ... what would that look like\nOh you know going to eight or eight and a half to the U.S dollar um from six point nine three which is where they are now and then that really shocks everybody and it stops the slow erosion when you have slow erosion you have the central bank\nI'm starting to spend foreign exchange reserves to no good and and that's what we saw last month you know twenty two point seven billion dollars a decline in their foreign exchange reserves\nAnd it didn't really do any good John So I think they need a one time big ... I think most analysts would recommend that but the gym paying is not willing to do it because that's that admission that his policies haven't worked he can't make it an admission of that sort\nGordon Chang the Daily Beast that he's McCotter W.

close Missouri I Can't tell Tennessee I Can't tell but certainly leaning Republican\nDoes the caravan change any of those states for the Senate and does it change the house seats that are at risk in those states job\nWell it's an awful visual because I'm Democrats are almost paralyzed and commenting on this because you know there's a sea of brown faces and even black faces and the caravan and to go criticize it doesn't say that we have to protect our sovereignty is too risky politically correctness\nUp Trump and the Republicans I can guarantee you're going to have commercials for the last few days of the campaign which will feature quotes from all the leading Democrat starting with Kamala Harris and California and Elizabeth Warren saying we have to abolish ice the immigration service and then they will be the pictures of the hordes coming\nI sat next to someone at dinner who's from Hungary very knowledgeable on Hungarian politics during the migrant crisis of twenty Fifteen\nHungary

to terrorists groups specifically ISIS\nThis changed the face of the election in the Senate as you measure it David\nUh I don't think so but that's only because I think the Senate has already in a really good spot for Republicans now I I Do think it's possible this message could have an impact in Arizona and Nevada um most of all possibly Montana\nTexas a secure I think Tennessee isn't a good spot um and I think just Republicans in the Senate in general are are in good shape\nAnd they're only competitive house each really that could be swayed either way it's among the states in Nevada but I Do think it's smart messaging by the president or look at your base another reason to turn out gives them another reason\nTo get ginned up about the opposition party and in the mid term when you hold the White House the hold all balance of power what you want to do is try and convince your voters little they don't show up bad things are going to happen and that's really easy to do\nWhen you have no power has bad things from your point of view are already happening\nSo your show up to vote to put a stop to them and that's what the president's doing with this message ... you know the one counter here is republic is Democrats\nAre not playing ball they're not engaging here or Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer issued a joint statement after that Trump tweet where he said Chuck and Nancy comics we can\nTalk border security and they just turned it around to health care which is where they want things to be a but but the other thing that I give Democrats have going for them in this regard as President Trump\nIn control of national security and he has at his disposal the power\nStop migrants at the border and so it's not a situation I think this would be more potent like national security wasn't twenty fourteen when Senate Republicans and in fact House Republicans were able to run against President Obama's handling of ISIS when he referred to them as\nGeneral this is a case where a President Trump who's warning of this while I think it's a good election year message down the stretch ultimately he's in charge which means he can implement policy to stop this and that's if Democrats really get into ... and say look yeah President Trump has the power to deal with this we're not standing in his way that is\nDon't they have some type of obligation at least in terms of messaging on this I mean I don't know who's behind this march I just see a bunch of people coming to the United states for a long time for the midterm\nDon't the Democrats at least have to say something and this will be the 'cause Jon talked about a David what can they say about this David\nI don't really think they have to say anything about this and in fact I think at the same way I think it's more for the president's push this from a political standpoint I think the best thing Democrats can do is say nothing\nYou don't anger your base by ... by by trying to outflank Trump on the right and you don't play Trump's game by looking weak and looking as though you hope that everybody shows up and and and gets into the country\nSay nothing the most I Would say if I were a democratic candidate is that I Would uh I clearly for border security and this is President Trump's job to deal with this because he's the president and and that's what I think we should there John\nI think that's a good strategy except that there's somebody than the Democrats who earlier earlier said that it's time to abolish ice so if they remain silent\n'em and they don't repudiate their previous position or they tried to model that I think that just gives turns the debate away from health care which is what the Democrats wanted it to be turned to immigration\nWhich is a mixed issue for Trump but not in the districts are Republicans after hold on that is a base turnout model\nWe agree John that this is a this is about as hot as it gets as we watch these videos\nAnd that's where it gets

Obama campaigns for Clinton dishes\nBut yeah you pay is more concerned about the fact that it is being politically incorrect politically correct and describing them with the wrong words\nNancy Pelosi and telling the Democrats to ignore all because it's not playing well with that and that is the situation as it stands with the modern Arab on but again\nBeing encouraged being chaperone in many cases by the Mexican authorities who claimed that they would stop it and have doing basically the exact opposite\nMeanwhile in the United states called Bernstein says the Trump is preparing to cold midterm elections illegitimate if Democrats take control of the house I mean what kind of crazed conspiracy theorist would dash suggest would dare even hint\nOf the U.S election being illegitimate it's not

call him like a rock star without explaining that he's greeting his own supports is literally this is the official campaign channel the best so oh role and then we'll get into another video after this where\nPeople who say they support him don't actually know any of his accomplishments is the ABC News article whether they gave him a platform whether they ... him as a rock star his ...\nUm [noise]

that\nLike coal and they're all still they act thrilled and surprised when he was only supports us recognize an great hip\nI mean how do we can you get let's really that that channels now a campaign platform so there's ... character whose by the way\nIn the end zone poli seven eight nine points behind Ted Cruz the real clear politics out bridges seven so he's he's he's basically got no Chinese unless something wild happens in the next couple of weeks but they're doing their level best to turn him into some kind of uh do you see\nThe way in his own supporters were actually asked what his accomplishments where they couldn't come up with anything\nThey knew nothing whatsoever that this was campus reforms I went to the local college all the people I spoke to who liked him were then asked did they could they name any if he's accomplished ... wells are resenting no here's a clip\nHere in Texas the big race they'd overwork verse Ted Cruz if you had to make a decision right now who do you

forecast\nPool of cold air from Canada has descended on the central us mainly the northern plains and the central plains as we get into the day today will only see a high in Indianapolis for instance of fifty six\nAnd another reinforcing shot of cold air is due Wednesday to sweep not only from the mid west but into the deep south and most of the northeast as well drier cooler air which will of course drop the temperature overnight to\nWe'll see the frost them free is warnings out for the Ohio Valley in Tennessee valley\nOver the next several nights we will continue to see heavy rainfall across portions of the Gulf Coast states this week bolstered later in the week by remnants of Willa currently in the Eastern Pacific in the west snow for the central and southern Rockies rain for Oregon and Washington's coast\nDrive for all but northern Cal\nEight six six\n\n\nOr in Arizona where two members of the house democratic a Christian\nA\nCinema and Republican Martha mix Sally ... our neck in neck in the contest to build a retired Republican Jeff Blake's\nA Senate seat forty four percent of early voters had a Republican affiliation compared to thirty three percent of the Democratic affiliation right twenty three percent of early voters were not affiliated with either major party and that's a group as other in the NBC News soon or a partisan analytics\nIn Florida where a democratic Bill Nelson is running for reelection in a tight race against Republican governor Rick Scott forty four percent of the early voters had a Republican affiliation versus thirty eight percent who had a democratic affiliation\nAn Eighteen percent who are not affiliated with either party in Indiana where democratic US Senator Joe Donnelly is facing reelection challenge from Mike Braun fifty one percent of early voters had a Republican affiliation compared with thirty nine percent who had a democratic affiliation\nAnd ten percent who are not affiliated with either party you know that's something to be looking at not just the\nNot just the voter enthusiasm of Republicans and Democrats which by the way is extremely important mhm because if you have more enthusiasm of Republicans and emerge mid term election like that that's almost unheard of\nWell especially when you talk about first day of early voting one one reason they take a look at that as it because people were essentially chomping at the bet to to\nTheir first that can tell you something\nAbout the the point I was trying to bring is not not the Democrat or Republican but if you have is you know if ten percent or in the one case was it uh\nIn Florida eight Eighteen percent not affiliated were independence going right now where the polls on were independence live right now our independence being affected\nBy what has gone out now independence for the most part did not like what was going on in the cabinet hearings which may be a huge uh you know a driver to the poll of independence but we're independence going in this election I haven't seen a lot of\nYou know election polling analytics on independence we've heard a lot about the enthusiasm Republicans and\nDemocrats but of course that's key because independence and most elections decide you know where the country's going mhm and I just haven't seen much I'll just more research on it now yeah I'm going to do more research see what's out there on on independence but it just popped into my head right now\nWe spend so much time talking about where Democrats are Republicans are\nAre not realizing that a significant portion the the determining factor of vote in most states is still you know the where the independence lie mhm\n[noise] yeah you you get to the break down to the polls that we do have available to us and that number of I guess I'm not independence but undecided voters starts to become much much smaller and that's where that's why we're you know for me\nI'm anxious to look at some some of the latest polls because you go back to uh the Montana race or any of the other Senate races and if you've got numbers that are that are pre Kavanaugh that that's something very different I mean it's it's something that because people will make\nAnd any given race and it's crucial dust I think that's it's the job of the pollsters\nTo to show those numbers as close to election days you can but you know again uh they haven't been as active as they were in years past and you and I've been following it you know for a while maybe that's going to change in the in you know later this week\nWell we know for example that the internal polling that was being done roughly two to three weeks out of backing in twenty sixteen\nThe Hillary people knew they were in trouble and the internal polling you didn't hear a lot of talk about that at all in in the general public but after the election post election that's what you started hearing that they saw the you know that that's when they started seen in some of those districts in those states you know when we're talking about Pennsylvania\nAnd and and Michigan in Wisconsin that's where they saw some of the change at that point mhm\nAnd they said oh and you know they saw that swing at that point and in most elections as we see what you see in July is not necessarily what you see the last three weeks right now internally because they're doing the polling consistently\nYou have the political parties that have an idea they see where the momentum is going at this particular point because we're just two weeks out now so for the last\nWeek especially if you went inside most political parties and say we're what is your polling showing\nYou're going to have one or another say okay the momentum is moving our waivers and moving our way mhm we just don't have access to those particular polls at the moment you know what we know afterwards yeah because he\nThe adult the analyze you know what happened in a you know particular you know political election you know we'll we'll be analyzed after the election\nBut it's what's happening right now in the internal polls\nWeeks some even more than four weeks out what was going on in September is not the mindset of the voter are they significant portion of the voter\nRight now right yeah I mean it it's it's I think um it it will be interesting to see what the rest of the early voting in a turnout is like and and where those numbers comeback but\nBut ultimately you have to get down to those polls in each of those individual races and I just suspect we're not going to see\nYou know a a I guess an onslaught of those polls leading up to that a leading up to election day that two weeks from today by the way so um but the early voting on taxes in Florida\nA you know will be interesting I think to watch but then you go to those tighter races I'm In Texas it's it's a ...\nAnd and cruise cruise the latest poll has been ahead by at least in the latest two balls\nOr by seven points or so and they are CPS average he's ... up by seven and he's had over fifty a percent and and each of those last two polls so you know that's not one that I Would call at this moment two weeks out assuming those numbers are still in that goes back a little over a week ago\nAssuming those numbers still hold that's not one that I Would call a you know neck and neck or or up in the air and undecided right now I'm you know too close to call if you will I think it's right now that momentum is with Ted Cruz\nAnd if you look at it if if the last poll for the ah was ah I don't have it here in front of me the last poll for ... or a rock and Cruz was a week ago uh yeah it was a little over a week ago I guess my point would be that doesn't even include the last debate\nDoes yeah yeah that's and that's my point is that is what I was I was asking you at the top of the hour or the or the priest\nWe'll see one or later today or or Wednesday that covers the debate maybe they were waiting and and going through Monday to to have people digest that debate and uh you know I don't know I really don't know but I I expect we'll see some more polls but they probably won't be as numerous\nAs what we've seen and and um the last month or two

Hillary so it was funny because some I saw that on social media somebody said hello Trump won because all the money and yeah that was on oh Hillary raised more money and then then they just shut up they were quiet life right\nOr look at look at a a look Democrats don't complain about money in politics ... if they're raising the money\nWrong but Robert Francis O'Rourke is raising on pressure them to money first radio in fact it's quite the opposite they're they're promoting the idea of blonde is a good thing\nSo when that started coming out and that was McCain ... you know that was McCain fined gold and and that's when the rules and regulations came out as two groups of people that couldn't that couldn't run advertising or you know within most at sixty days of of an election I Believe ... sixty this within an election\nBecause it might influence an election right well that's the only reason you're running ads is to influence the election and the reason you run ads close to an election is to influence an election and at that point we just said do these people understand\nHow the country was formed do they understand about the partition of government for redress of grievances irrespective of that group is do they actually understand that and clearly they didn't want to understand it so we said this back going back ten Fifteen when you when I started working together\nSo going back Thirteen an ... maybe almost Thirteen and a half years ago right when you and I got together and I know we were saying that beforehand ... but it's like we said we don't believe in the first amendment you don't believe in the second amendment\nAnd so that's grown and grown and grown and grown and grown and since that time we have said look if you don't believe in these major tenants of the constitution of the United states you actually don't believe in the United states right\nAnd now we're to the point here where they don't believe in the Senate they don't believe in the the well the who wants it came out said that the presidency was adequate\nThat was a few weeks ago was that that was Michael Moore was Michael Moore so it was somebody in that same it was the same time well no it was at the same time when he said it's over that the ... century essentially the the office of the president of the United states you know it's over this was you know it's it's now gone it\nAnd then someone in that same period that we we need to do away with the presidency altogether right and so but we ...\nIf you go to social media or it's just not fair of a sudden it needs to go\nSenate needs to go to and as we've said that is extremely important because if you do understand the constitution which unfortunately\nThe majority of America does not have you seen the polls the majority of American can't tell you what the three branches of government are they can't tell you what the rights are in the first amendment to the constitution they don't know they a lot of them don't care\nBut the majority of Americans don't know recording to the polls and when it comes to the ... you know the separation of powers the three branches of government that the vast majority of Americans can't tell you that well then you don't even know how our country works\nWhich I then we abstain and we understand why people say the country isn't exceptional you don't even know what makes us exceptional right or if you believe that the Senate shouldn't be gone if you believe that the electoral college should be gone you don't understand the basis of what this how this country was formed\nBut it wasn't that that it wasn't on a pure democracy it was on a representative government we're the minority would be protected were individual rights would be protected something that the left used to understand and promote\nAnd now they don't care as long as ...\nAs long as they they don't care to protect the minority as long as it's the minority that they don't care about [laughter] or they don't care about individual rights as long as it's individual rights of people they don't care about right and but when you get down to it it's a clear under a not understanding of how the country was formed so\nWe have said that that's a huge issue for many conservatives because they do understand the constitution and they understand everything that we just talked about right now and that has energized them to go out and vote so beyond just because\nThe Democrats were against a nominee that Trump picked because cabin all went way beyond Trump that's why you had the conservative tore never Trump burst\nAnd that's why we've seen I I Believe more United\nA Republican or Republican Party so you can look at that you can look at some of that may be driven by the fact that look we're concerned about the house because the whole Russia investigation goes away if we lose the house and uh also when it comes to judges the fact that if they win the Senate\nOr ... and Trump has another chance to get another judge in maybe in the next couple of years and that would be unprecedented because conservatives understand that if you can have a construction is cord and you can have\nOf not only a five to four but it's six to three ... that that can move the country in the right direction for the next generation and that is extremely important and the other thing is and this is new and it's the caravan\nSure and it's it's interesting too is that it you you mentioned it earlier but it bears repeating here they even if the caravan and likely won't reach the border before an election day two weeks from today that\nThe news cycle is what's keeping that story there and and we've talked often about how the news cycle you know changes so not drastically but so often\nUm and the because the protests by the left is one thing even even during the Kavanaugh a confirmation process itself what was the first protest\nAll those documents remember we need to be able to agree we need time view that that was their first protest well then it became about Dr Ford\nBut we said after he's confirmed whatever happens and you know we didn't make it a a production but if he's confirmed on on Saturday through the vote this was before the confirmation vote then on Monday and they'll move on to something else as they did\nBecause it it but there is there is at the point being there is a new protest and new hot button or almost daily but certainly a couple of new ones every week so we got two weeks left so\nTo a consistent issue that's been around for a long time but the Republicans thanks to this current president when he was campaigning for president\nOh and\nIf you think about it you know everybody talking about the conspiracy theory and who's paying for it and who's not paying for it\nIt is working for the right it is a motivator for people on the right to get out and protect because if he needs money for the wall he needs the house the president if he's going to get money for the wall he's going to need the house right\nAnd and so to me this has been a huge motivating factor and\nI saw the other day that after uh the the illegal immigrant caravan them which is to get into the United states from Honduras that they walked about nine hours right well at that and and blisters and they were going to rest\nFor a while well at this pace they won't get to the United states for a month right so ah you know if that was the pace that they are are are going at as to you know who was supporting them you've got you know a right wing website stating

from\nSan Antonio dot com divided Democrats struggled to answer Trump's claims on my grand caravan Democrats are struggling to respond to president Donald Trump but as Republican allies were cast in the care of on a of thousands of migrants heading towards the U.S Mexico border as a failure of Democrats to hell\nOr attack on his court campaign issues given that his policies failed to reduce the number of unauthorized immigrants yet party leaders in democratic candidates have been largely silent ahead of the midterms and refusing to engage with Trump\nOn this particular issue that's why we said this was a loser from the start where people were saying you know what their hope is a you know before a election day that these thousands will be at the border and then the military will be there and there will be violence that will be going on and it will hurt the Trump and it will hurt the Republicans\nWell that's not going to happen you know you and I were discussing before and we said well maybe\nMaybe it's Charles will pick up a bunch of people in his private jet and drop a hungry at all [laughter] you know in order to ... and ... claiming while that's going to be the next thing they're to be driving cars whatever look the problem is if you have ten thousand that arrived at the exact same time yeah let's get a if it's a couple of hundred that's going to be that won't even be news\nNo well I mean because they're not going to be there won't be violence it'll be simply there'll be taken that can be violence and simply the border patrol can handle that kind of thing right and if National Guard or needed out there or something like that but\nIt's if the ten thousand all arrived at a particular time\nThat we're a energized in well fed and old decided to run across

process them like they would any others they have\nThe border patrol the customs officials there have direct orders and the job to do the process the mall and the same manner\nOr somewhere else\nWhat's that going to look like you're just publicized it the world is watching it so the border patrol will be there waiting for them and we'll process the just the same so the fact of the matter is is that there's there's one thing that this was all about\nPolitics it's no it's not going to change between now and November and it hasn't changed for years the tactics\nBy the left on immigration\nWork against them by and large the American people stand with the current president on immigration in general\nThe numbers start to change when you talk about actually building a wall or

the early voting out there that NBC reported yesterday would shows Republicans\nAre in most states are that they have a a surveyed in seven of those eight states with a close Senate races they bring the Republicans right now one of the reasons why you know one the one issue is that Democrats are using that they believe is in their favor ... what's the one issue Democrats are using right now against Republicans\nAnd it's the one that we said they would we said you got to either do nothing or do something but if you or or complete the task because if you don't do it and you do what half posterior the Democrats will use it against you when premiums skyrocket\nCome down temper and October ... as they now refer to what Trump care mhm\nThat's the one thing that they believe that's the one thing in the polls that the Republicans are way behind that the people believe that the Democrats will do a better job they do not alone and Republican John healthcare yeah as we said would happen you saw Schumer\nWas it was a a few weeks ago uh well it was actually it was right after the Kavanaugh confirmations where they talked about their their focus was going to be healthier 'cause obviously there are internal we're showing you know this is where we get a win on an issue but what's their answer\nWe can't buy for Medicare for some by the by the way it's complete Medicare where everything is taken care of ... which we can't even do for the senior citizen who put in for Medicare for their entire lives and it still doesn't cover everything right and they're promoting the fact that we can Medicare\nCovering everything for everybody twenty four seven for the rest of their lives are\nReally now mhm\nWe can't even do it for senior citizens who put in Port their entire working lives that we how do I know look at the commercials and ... the only covers this you have to pay for this and therefore you need to get supplemental that's right\nOr cross your fingers or cross your fingers right which means they can't even they can't even pay we can't have for Medicare first some as we've been saying there's no way to pig\nOr Medicare for all oh we we await ... no no no we can't\nWe can we can go into um I don't know how many trillions of dollars of debt hundreds of trillions of dollars the ... the only thing right now I think the Democrats could have focused on it if they didn't go crazy over Kavanaugh if that hadn't happened they might have been able to use that as a wet ... that's a good point take the Senate for video road log here is your forecast\nPool of

body my body tells you when it's time to sleep yeah and and I'm Glad that I can pick up on what my body tells me that because it's twice a day I go home and I go to sleep and and and then I sleep again at about five to six o'clock when my body gets tired\nAnd you know I mean you know what a disciplinarian I Am at that and people that know me and to know me and my whole life said\nYou really became disciplined I mean you have to sleep during those times when I stood up I don't it throws up mine tire mind my mind is gone if I don't\nIf I don't do it but because I'm a because I'm On that schedule rarely do I ever have to you know take even anything over the counter mhm ... anymore I I was for a little while they're taking the melatonin maybe once in a while and\nSometimes on weekends I may have to take a little bit of it because my I changed my my sleep pattern but that's even rare now I've decided no just sleep and if you wake up in the middle and I get up you know do some stuff for an hour and I go back to sleep and it was my ... my my dentist my uh who\nUh is asleep therapist who who uh said when I told him I scheduled because he was always concerned as my dentist 'cause there was also wanted to sleep therapy\nAnd I told him I scheduling what oh she's asleep twice a day goes ... that's how the basically the caveman used to do it they managed to go to sleep like seven o'clock there was no TV they went to sleep seven eight o'clock they woke up and midnight one o'clock and set up for a couple of hours\nMany problems and I haven't had any problems no type of medical problems but to me the only thing that really insurers\nAre that I I mean it it's almost said I Do have to I Do have to work out almost every day working out does make a difference for me ... tiring out my body does make a difference doing physical activity\nI'm having trouble getting to sleep I have trouble finding the time I mean my my life is so busy it it it literally is a a round the clock\nYou know huge family or other business aside from you know the [noise]\nUh and and then of course a lot of the stuff pertaining to this yeah but yeah it is but I've known your long enough you can operate without sleep I can yeah yeah well I I'm not in my mind\nIn point I was up to a um a Sunday Morning and uh up until a almost one PM\nOn Monday a afternoon that's when I went to bed Monday afternoon\nI got up at six thirty and then went back to bed for another Ninety minutes uh\nSee I I Can't I Can't I've known your long enough to know that you can operate with sleep your brain still works my brain does not work yeah the same at all if I if if I don't sleep correctly it is so tough for me to to to do that so I guess as well and\nFor the ... same thing I mean my allergy well yeah and and for me it's the same thing it is also too about the exercise and diet and everything else because\nHad died during that time I mean you know ... we had the big family wedding on Sunday and I was I mean I was there until I was the last one house at night falls closing up a venue and and uh and and clearing everything out are loading out\nA but\nI had a well a piece of wedding that's that sugar [laughter] you know what I mean and and you have to know that I mean everybody was looking at me strangely although I did\nAny problems but you you have to do that and it also has to include like for me and had the difference with people I Know people that can like drink coffee you know full strength coffee and have no issues um it's you know comedians in cars getting coffee\nIt's amazing to see Jerry Seinfeld loves coffee and he talks about it and he's they drink you know it looks like he's drinking at least two or three cups\nIf I had two or three cups of coffee and today well then that would be no I I just couldn't I couldn't do that I can drink a total of maybe one and I'm good but\nThe I have to know the the point being is I have to know that I've got to keep exercising I the diets got to be right especially during those times when I'm not going to get that sleep I'm going to have to really mind my piece in Houston and lots of water or\nThe insomnia thing I've I've been there\nUm and and maybe it's because I'm aging I it's not about insomnia for me it's about schedule a typically Indiana lately it has not been this this past weekend was a total anomaly\nBut typically it has been here lately you know getting to bed a and getting a good seven hours of sleep on the average um and I I Do notice the difference in that it does it is you are a especially physically you're you're better\nYour mentally your your better I mean this has been a big issue for truck drivers for a long time because there's hours of service to regulate the drivers and\nAnd a lot of changes to those hours of service going back to well gosh going back of the Fifteen Years and and I'm like that I couldn't do it why couldn't do it it's a airline pilots and you know they all go through they ... they all have their their hours of service\nYou know based on operating you know the the aircraft are operating the ...\nTruck for me I ... and I I think I guess eventually I'd get used to it but\nBecause you've got to ... you got to create that sleep environment right\nOr or ah people tell me though the same thing I don't know how you sleep during the day I don't know how you sleep all night\nUm or or stay up all night and and sleep during the day\nBut for twenty two years now I've been I've been doing that and it's it's perfectly normal I don't see how people work on the rotating shifts my my boat ran my best friend's father was a cop yeah\nYeah most of his career yeah he would work six weeks for shit yes than six weeks second ... right than six weeks third shift said that I don't know I don't know I don't know how we did that you can't get a routine down now got to have your routine and that's the whole thing you've got to have your routine\nWhatever that is a that works for you whatever works to get that sleep you've got to stick to that and that has to be disciplined\nAnd you know it's a you know I I don't know if they still do that is in law enforcement any damage to me\nThat heart ... well that would be an an alertness concern yeah are you alert when you're out there well I knew and you've got to change sleep just like yeah I Would be a ... total concerned yeah I have a friend who's been a prison guard for a long long time and that's that's kind of what they do they\nIt's called that's called shift work right where you're changing you know that that your routine all the time my dad did that he he was talking to me about it recently he said I I still don't know how you do this and I said well that it's easier than what you described\nA back in your military days he would do that when he was a military police officer in the air force they would do shift work especially in the early days\nOr when he Rosen rank that you know changed he didn't have to do that but uh you know for the longest time they did the same thing and uh as an MP and he said that was just for me he said that was just difficult it was impossible because you don't have a routine you know I think I Can't do is on Sundays\nBy the time Sunday night comes around I go to sleep mhm one thing I Can't do on Sundays Evers lift weights I lift weight in the Sunday I can

I think ... every every politician on boats on on both sides ... looks at people's self interest it all depends what your self interested that's I've voted myself interest right I vote for my self interest me much might [laughter]\nWhat's what my it it really didn't work out for me this last election day a week since we have to pay more under the Republican tax plan\nNo but what is my what is my bigger self interest my mind bigger self interest and your bigger self interest is not what other people's self interest is my self interest is not getting free stuff\nNo my self interest is freedom\nWell when we have the liberty of ... and and the ... of of our nation right that that's my number that's my self interest so there's a lot so people vote for their self interest all the time for other people's self interest is give me free stuff mhm that's not my first self interest because I Know\nThat it's a bogus concept I Know that it doesn't work\nI Know that it doesn't solve the problems that they claim that they're trying to cure and so they're simply selling to people who believe and don't care what the future may bring look we live in a nation that doesn't care about\nPublic and the Democrats don't care about the deficit don't care about the debt they don't care they don't care what it does to a future generation\nSo ... for both sides now keeping the status quo of what we have today is extremely important sure keeping the status quo of what we\nGet from the government I Can't tell you when the banks were getting bail out how many people called up and said they shouldn't be bailing out the banks that should be bailing out me right off the government's role is to give you money well from somebody else and that's where this shift\nWas from you know a lot of people in fact that that said that they were either conservative or voted Republican and they were talking about saying it and it it it really was kind of this\nMentality that had been built through the media and also from Capitol Hill and at that time uh you know at the uh the the end of the Bush presidency\nOr that the world was coming to an ad remember a McCain and Obama had to come off of the campaign trails\nTo rush to the White House to save the world you know because the world was coming through that uh but the that that ah a fear drove a lot of people after the bailout started happening\nTo say well listen you know if that's going to happen then right I Want mine so it became is almost the looting effect right the government money looting right idea I wouldn't mind if they if they're thrown out money to throw it to me not throw Hank right to throw it to me and we were saying no do what you know one\nAnd and that's because when government gets involved in every aspect of your life they become a ... and everybody understands is when you take it out of the hardest and talk and you're talking about should we be run by a monopoly right should our healthcare system be run by a monopoly Democrats just to be scared to death of a monopoly why because\nYou know we live in a we we live in a a a time\nAnd you know already got response whenever we talk about the health care well other countries\nSpend less on health care no they don't know not for the same services they don't know you can't make that correlation you because you can't compare you can't you can't compare it if waiting times are double for some procedures\nThat health care and tell exact timely health care is that if you talk to my my my cousin out of Ontario back Twenty years ago when he desperately called because they didn't have the technology in Canada that take care of his brain tumor right it would have died decide what they're going to pay for\nRight and you don't get a straight showing that government makes the rule\nNot only the payment but they make the rules yeah well and when you want to intellectual honesty you go to a well what's his name the\nFormer labor secretary Robert Reich who said look if we were being honest as liberals would have to tell you in order to have a health care program networks young people have to pay more than ... people die [noise]\n\nI'm not I don't I'm not worried about my children because I don't really plan on having a family I'm giving my children the debt well yeah [laughter] I'm not going to have kids because it's too expensive even when you're fifty thousand dollar plan enough it's not enough so I'm not oh wait a minute\nBy the thousand dollars doesn't help with raising my child now that's what I needed ... dollars a year I think that and help with raising my child now that's because\nThe idea is that we have you know we have too many kids in these poor families but by the time they're Eighteen they're a disadvantage because they can't afford college were home and all of this all these items well no no no no no no you're you're not you're not trying to get the future vote of those kids who\nAnd they're thinking to themselves well no I've got a number of reasons why I don't want to have a family 'cause I Can't afford it you're not given ... so it's never going to be All right so now I'm so Camilla Harris\nGets my vote because she promised she me six thousand dollars if she gets elected to have it out with my kid back I Want and six thousand now\nAnd or Bernie gives me or maybe Kamala Harris comes adds onto it and says free college for everybody and she gets my vote too because she's going to include existing college loans and of course for healthcare yes Medicare to right yeah\nSo the what you can get ... my kid you're fifty thousand I Know I'm not having kids ... thousand Eighteen years from now no and and my kid gets it I don't get ... no no I'd rather\nGet the six thousand dollars now all the way it will give me both will know give me the six to ... don't get me six thousand dollars give me Fifteen thousand dollars to raise my kids now right\nInstead of the fifty thousand dollars at my kid could use down the road right no I Want it now and give me now gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme that then\nYou're not trying to get the vote of the the baby that's yet to be born you're trying to get the adult vote they don't care about the future they care about now see they're not thinking\nWe're ... we're trying to tell them Gary we can do the strategy for I don't know a couple of million apiece

to see a in terms of the turnout yeah I originally actual article is the blue wave turning purple Republican affiliated voter it's about ... democratic affiliated voters and early voting\nAnalyzed by the NBC News data analytics lab now I did ask the question earlier this is from NBC suicide fake news that the Republicans are in the lead and it was funny 'cause I got two responses I'm sure because just the exclamation marks behind it that they came from\nPeople that aren't supporters of Republican fake I Would it's good to see though that the left now is accusing NBC effect unless ah NBC is doing it and an effort to motivate the Democrat Sam of yes we did bring up that possibility earlier on the show\nOr in the case that George Soros is paying for it or I don't I'm not sure that means that you paid for in\nA GOP affiliated voters temperature past democratic affiliated ones in early voting in Arizona Florida Georgia Indiana Montana Tennessee and Texas the data showed only in Nevada

interesting twenty three percent\nOf early voters not affiliated with any major party how would they voting that's the ... that would be the key and you and I talked about this earlier yeah they're they're asking us about a lot of research done on independence and how what how they are leaning right now\nWell because the ... and really the only thing you can do is get down to the polls in each race right and look at the undecided voters and and see if there's some kind of a indication as those undecided vote or numbers always start\nThe point would be well we need to make sure that he doesn't get the seat another construction and if you see it it's it's inevitable that the Republicans will keep the Senate\nYou know it's interesting I've not seen an ad anywhere\nThat has said don't all don't allow Trump to pick another Supreme Court justice\nMaybe that's running somewhere right right right have not seen it yet and I'm surprised I haven't seen it because in the last couple of days\nI've seen a ton of political ads on the different channels that I go to especially the different sports channels on Saturday ... that are covering some of these regional football games around the country I've seen a lot of that and you would think that that would be one ad that would be out there is that is that just not a selling point right now they're Democrats\nTested that and that's just not working 'cause you would think that would be the one thing mhm look vote for this senator don't give Trump another shot at picking another Supreme Court justice like Kavanaugh\nRight and I

there's a look at your Tuesday forecast from red eye radio I'm meteorologist John trout\n\nAbout what they believe in and we and we do believe I I Believe this is part of their statement we do believe that if they don't believe in the constitution if they don't believe in due process if they don't believe in the first amendment if they don't believe in the second amendment\nPeople are being blood insane well then what makes you American\nYeah\nAnd I know sounds probably harsh just some people but if you don't believe in you and I've talked about this for the longest time if you don't believe in the constitution if you don't believe in those basic tenants than what you actually believe in\nWell and and what kind of country do you really want right what is it that you want a your country to be you know you look at the the never Trump or is the conservatives and I think the cabinet effect was was a you know something that was\nEye opening for a lot of them who realized okay a couple of times\nUh this president has shown a\nHis efforts in terms of the highest court you and I by the way can can officially call this the Breitbart Andrew Breitbart effect\nYes because and twenty twelve just weeks before he died\nA we asked him as as we were talking to them why should we support or a moderate like Mitt Romney it was inevitable Mitt Romney was going to become the nominee\nOr appeared he would even early that year or why should we do that and his answer was guys I'm a stone's throw as I sit here and talk to you from ... so\nThey're ... it\nIn terms of uh you know we'll look and see what what happens in twenty twenty ride I didn't vote for him and twenty sixteen I stayed home or whatever but in terms of the mid term\nWhile yet they're supporting Trump there were there a couple of things at least Trump will do this on ... so I've got to get out I've got to vote I've got to be motivated to get out there and allow him to be able to possibly seat another constructions\nBut it's exactly what you said to it is\nThey're they're you were going to have to build that [laughter] Republican wall around the constitution and around the process that is in place\nThat preserved the constitution and and I think that's really a strong it at a ... a strong addition\nTo uh the Trump momentum mhm to have conservatives who are electrically driven who do know the constitution and do know and are extremely fearful of what came out of Democrats during the cabinet nomination which to them really has nothing to do with Trump\nBut it is all United in that same ideology and I like that what you call it the republic because you've called that a couple of times of Republican wall meanwhile we played a couple of of audio cuts from from President of a former President Obama for reasons mhm\nAnd that was I'm Still looking for what was the major issue because look if you look at cabinet what came out of cabinet and and I I specifically go back to a conversation that I had\nAt my at my family reunion and this was a a gentleman who I talked to a relative by marriage mhm okay is a professor at an extremely liberal college and from what I have known him as for the longest time because of other friends who know him\nConversation went on for over an hour\nAnd you know very quiet conversation just you know what do you think whatever and he just told me she said you don't have liberal I Am I said well I've heard that we've never had a long discussion\nHe goes I'm pretty liberally goes the campuses are insane because they're not liberal I'm a liberal goes maybe I'm an old 'cause I never thought I'd think of myself as an old time liberal and what I found out is he's ... he's a lot like for example look Camille ... ... you know he's an old traditional\nA liberal and he talked about Trump because look you know Trump's of stuff that goes but look a lot of stuff that Trump says actually because when he goes too far actually helps us a little bit so people make claim they really care about are offended but their nominees but\nThe fact is he goes to my dad loves Donald Trump ... my dad died before Donald Trump ... ran in a won the presidency but my dad would have voted for Donald Trump was Trump's not a racist I don't know what you know it's not a racist\nAnd and he said that goes but he goes or party because my party is killing itself\nAnd I wonder if I had a conversation with him today after cabinet 'cause Eric you don't want to you and I both know that the average Democrat I'm Talking about the working the the working class Democrat who you know who lives in so many cities across the United states I Know who they are because I grew up with them my family\nPart of my family is from that working kind of a Democrat family I Know\nThey you know we're Democrats came from in the north east you know we talked about Tim Russert ... you know and and it when if you ever read any of his books I mean he came from a south buffalo Democrat Party but they're very conservative mhm extremely conservative you know morally speaking and that's been passed down through generations\nYou'd think the average rank and file\nAverage working class Democrat related to the Democrats stain that evidence doesn't matter that due process doesn't matter\nAs the campaign thing no Democrats going out right now screaming always believe her mhm if you if you voted dumber if you bought a Republican in the Republicans going to vote for due process we cannot have due process we cannot have a presumption of innocence\nThey may have been saying it two or three weeks ago they're not saying that now\nThey can't sell it no they can't sell it to their own party so what are they telling\nTheir selling Trump fear and maybe a little bit of\nThe increased premiums for for a a ... as they call it Trump carrying around a but is that actually going to have an effect right now no no I don't see that happening if it might have had more of an effect if the whole cabinet thing hadn't happened\nWell because health care costs have been going up forever they were going up during the Obama years I mean after they put the the even out Obamacare remember the first couple of years\nLook at the ... as we went through twenty sixteen the increase their it politically you can't get away with that anymore because it is it's going to go up\nPeople with ... with with an employer based\nHealth care no the costs are going up\nSo the only thing that resonates forget about saying well a Trump care is is ... raising premiums nobody cares about that it's about what are you going to give me if you're going to you know again appeal to somebody who's on the left Rob not everyone but but then the people\nBut you know something the the free stuff and we talked about that earlier with Cory bookers you know the new new program maybe bonds and Camilla Harris over the weekend but that's more of a presidential that that's more for twenty twenty and that's not really you can as an individual congressman you're they're not walk and I'm going I'm going to give you all pre stuff that's\nSchumer is not making any noise when he announced the days after the uh just a few days after the uh\nYeah you know to what do you do they they may when you're talking about an individual which is the presidential candidate it may be the focus is going to be there but there's just too many races to be focused on right yep\nI guess as we have a fascinating to me well I just think this is a fascinating you set it earlier is could this be one of those unique midterms in terms of you know the numbers of love you know the average turnout or what demographics or what motivates anyone remember twenty six team was unique\nVery unique\nAnd we've changed as a nation since twenty sixteen\nThere are many things that have changed the left has ramped up their rhetoric and and the craziest over the top no telling what when we get past the midterm two weeks from today when we look

funny feeling that\nThis election cycle for the presidency twenty two twin ... is going to start to years prior to the election I wouldn't be at all surprised and I think it would be the last time because I think Congress will actually passed a law that says\nThis has gone from the ridiculous to the sublime and they will make a law that says Ninety Days will be the length of the election process\nOh if only they run all the primary over the course of three weeks\nYou have your convention and then you have two months and then you have your election then that's it that's certainly in it surely would be intelligent by the way former speaking of intelligence former speaker of the house Newt Gingrich I Can't believe you did that\nI think he's very intelligent personally and he was very gracious stuff when you met met us in line at the movie a league Lacey is concert of all places you and I went to see who\nHis girlfriend at the time because he had just gotten was it is girls they were maybe just me I don't remember I remember a ordinarily walk into the RIAA and they were very cordial and everything well he appeared yesterday on Fox to explain why the president\nSays that he will cut off aid to certain countries because of the caravans\nWhile I look at it is pretty clear Haas seems for Iran has those numbers there are at least nine or ten thousand potential people if you count the ones on the Guatemalan border owner come north the easy question as cause us let's say we open the border we welcome all of them\nSent pictures out across the whole planet how big do you think the next ... and the ... and then the caravan after that and the care of and after that\nAnd you get to the question here either going to control the border so you're not going to control the water and as an American\nBut we're we're the most generous legal immigration system in the world we owe a million people year legally coming American how about getting American right to be an America most of them go on to become American citizens so there's a there's a just a dishonest ally\nTo suggest that we don't have an of serious immigration program that is legal\nProblem we have is\nA lot of folks who want to break the law and and if you ever had open borders as you pointed out the Gallup poll I think the number for all of Latin America and the Caribbean was a hundred and Seventy nine million people would like to come to the U.S\nAssistance to unsustainable\nSo the question becomes what are you going to do about it and the president who is inherited a disastrous immigration system between court orders sad congressional laws federal regulation is a total disaster\nTo send a signal to the rest of Latin America no you're not going to be allowed to come in and in part\nBecause in the process of stopping if we're going to learn a lot about the laws of need to be changed and frankly Congress maybe in the lame duck session audibly challenged ... not to not comprehensive reform let's say ten dumb things let's just fix one step at a time and begin to make it possible to manage our board has\nI think he forgot he was a politician there yeah um I say\nThis that there are at the risk of sounding like a broken record I'm Still not sure why we can't just enforce the laws we\nHave more ... the ultimate question you just hit it right on the head second of all out of all these people in that care of and half of that caravan will dissipate\nWhen they get to Mexico City do you think so and so there you go to work there there's plenty of work in Mexico city but once again and this is not the fault of Donald Trump this is the fault of the last five presidents\nAnd you know the question this and I don't know ... and\nFinished worm going OK okay the last five presidents have\nCaused this and I'll tell you how they caused it they refused to help the Mexican government\nIf in fact we gave half the aid that we've given to Israel or Germany\nOr or Japan or anything else if we would've given half of that amount of money\nTo the government of Mexico to help them sustain themselves and build their own factories and build their own auto industry and the oil industry and all these things that people never would have won the least\nIs that a mountain\nThe idea was for there to be a new industry in Mexico city the world's largest city when when the eight million people twice the population of Los Angeles\nSo do you really believe that a a a certain percentage of this caravan that is coming here guaranteed will stay in Mexico and grinder way to make life their cars out why and with the last caravan that came\nI did not read ... numbers specifically saying that a ... you know percentage of them stayed on in Mexico and decided found jobs decided to make things there\nThat they didn't because once again the new word around the world and what you read in the paper if you live in Guatemala witness aries Honduras San Juan Puerto Rico is that America is taking names for asylum\nOkay political asylum these are not what used to be\nSingle working age guys trying to sneak across the border so they could come to the U.S and work I mean you and I worked with a lot of Hispanics sure loading a south wells cash just part of I live in three states that I've lived a majority of my life in our California Nevada and Arizona\nThe three largest Hispanic population who made the right right well single man would come across the border and they would work here now the problem\nThey didn't come to go on welfare they didn't come to have kids because they were single males and what they were doing though was they were hurting the American economy by taking a job earning five hundred dollars a week let's say\nPutting four hundred of it in a novel and sending it the mom of seats in Mexico city\nThey were taking five hundred American dollars living on a hundred dollars here and sending the rest of the money back home\nThat drains our economy mhm okay where if we had given them and I'm not saying given them and that term but I'm saying like we do all the other countries if we had given money\nTo the government in central Mexico and southern Mexico they would have built factories in stores and they would have done mass production for the country itself okay and would have been to come self sustaining\nAnd all of a sudden if the unemployment rate in Mexico and the ability to make a living there and feed your family and take care of them was\nNot even equivalent to the United states but let's say they had an eight percent unemployment rate or something to that effect\nWell there wouldn't be the desire for these young men to sneak across the border\nTo get an American job and send the money back to Mexico sure there are very loyal to their family law yet nobody wants to be away from their family\nFor an extended and knowing that hungry and right right so you do that I I worked with the guy's name was Frank he was a baseball player 'til he was forty then he snuck into the country and he worked as a chef and if he saved\nAnd didn't have a car and sent all the money back to his ranch in ... ... okay he could buy a new tractor\nAnd so when he had three new tractors and was able to put an ... system he left the United states and went back to being a farmer and walk I\nSee so that you did something you know it's the whole thing about if you

Carter on it and Morgan or take us they both know what they're doing um we we were transferred to a ... I Lived in Latin America we were transferred to ... Saudi Arabia after the U.S manufacturing jobs started drying up in the Nineteen eighties\nAnd uh we lived in multiple countries\nAnd we found that uh there were people within the government is not a monolith but but the people in the government like the king and his son\nThe crown prince wanted to reform ... and get rid of the terrorism and they've been working on this turkey doesn't like the state want more of this type of violence so that can move into\nThe Europe but we found something very very interesting I'm a chemical engineer but also supervise lab techs and hospital environment\nAnd we found that people were flipping out and our crew in and around that crew\nFrom brain infections and they they uh cause things like magic behavior impulsive behavior vengeful behavior anger\nAnd they were diseases that came off the Silk Road a ... a career in Congo hemorrhagic fever or a plague polio malaria all kinds of things including Venezuela Ecuador ... which causes people to act like\nAre the people who are running the the movement of ... of of people out of Latin America to our border and the FBI just approved smoke ... that the tech these things it's still a lot of money to find these swings back in the eighties\nBut we can now tests for these things and check people coming out of the country when we help other people\n[noise] yeah I ... I just do we would tell me what do you think is a is a doable inappropriate sanction to keep the relationship alive but at the same time you have another brush back but you can't treat\nA American or any other journalists like this\nYou might need to be severely prosecuted but a a present for the world that we really don't want people killed in embassies et cetera they should've he should have been taken back to Saudi Arabia and tried if if he was really a part of the Muslim Brotherhood and a within in fighting terrorism worldwide\nAnd and so the Saudis have a problem because I have a hobby there and then they have people want reform and we have a similar type problem over here so Congress and the president and the government of a Saudi Arabian need to work it out\nYeah but you you are for for a guy that lived in Saudi Arabia as crazy as that society is in in comprehensible or as it is in terms of mores uh and the way they structure things you do see the merit in keeping relations with Saudi Arabia\nAbsolutely they're keeping the middle east calm is saving us a huge amount of money and preventing so many people from being murdered by the radicals they are not angels but you have to work with them and and we need to move them more and more moderate stance and there are people who want to do that over there\nAll right thanks I appreciate George Mike ... news Ninety six five and a window Hey Mike\n[noise] I ...\nYeah the governor's race might give me your perspective dissenters birds Gillum why is Gillum in front and almost every poll\nI think is in French because there's always been this perception that most Republicans don't show up until the gate of and I think this is really has a he's got a good by behind him I think the jumping or spent works I mentioned earlier in speaking in the green room\nWith Bill Nelson versus Scott Rick Scott's very well liked by the Republican Party or any other year Gillum would probably have a shot I Know the college towns here in in Florida are very excited they are going to come out in droves I'm In the Senate rate is going to end it around\nOkay thanks so much great perspective markets way down and talked to Christ are wild about that a more\nInteresting challenge [noise] talk show host these points on TNT I find I'm going to teach me the station [noise]\nOr in other words you think it's going to be extended I think Chris right because you think of so many of these races going to be a compelling out on the west coast oh you don't want to stay up all night but you do think you're going to end up doing that well we\nWe stay up all night on the decision that's no matter what it is just whether we have company we like it if you guys stay up and watch a show because there's going to be a lot of interesting stuff you know control of house we have a we have a model that lets us predict which party is going to control the house based on the\nUh our our polling but also the early returns\nA in a you know if it's a democratic wave will be able to tell you at nine o'clock uh yep here they come in there there it goes a but if if this is what it what the current surveys indicate we're going to have to wait for Texas we are going to have to wait for all kinds of stuff to come in before we have real clear\nYou know it's interesting uh I mean as usual Florida I find the most intriguing and the headliners the governors in the senators number one I'm pure performance I Know Scott doesn't have the great or the great charisma we know that but after eight years Florida knows them and knows these productive hardworking\nAnd honest and and the other side Bill Nelson who's been there for a while has not been necessarily productive you think if he's ever going to be vulnerable it will be over after a two term governor decided to run against him dead heat and the last poll I saw from Quinnipiac\nHas a Scott down I think seven points system like yes those where you have 'em down consistently seven I had two or three and then this was big so survey\nHeard that uses the right methodology and yet Scott has consistently trail and this is also what you see there Andrew Gillum in the governor's race in Florida that should not be the Florida hasn't had a democratic governor\nSince Nineteen Ninety eight I Believe when Jeb Bush won\nA now they don't win by a lot Florida tends to have narrowly contested elections I think Rick Scott one by one point and one and a half points where his margins victory as governor um but then so Florida has been a state that has is a swing state but that has had a consistent narrow Republican advantage\nUm the fact that round as scientists and struggling as much as he has to try to get some traction and get some advantage there talks about what kind of year it is in Florida what here's basically what we have we have the volume turned up on both sides to the max we're looking at\nA year and show normally in a in a by any election in the mid term election the last midterm election in twenty four team was the lowest turn out in any since Nineteen forty two we are on track now\nTo have a midterm election turnout over fifty percent which you have to go back forty or forty years or more to find that kind of turnout you have to go back to basically the the the internal political struggle over Vietnam to find mid term election turnout like that and if that's true so here's the danger for Republicans\nThey are the the intensity is back up on the Republican side to match the Democrats but the Democrats aren't debating and in swing states like Florida in swing states like Ohio if Democrats are storming the poll if if Democrats are voting like Republicans Republicans are going to lose out on a bunch of seats because there are more Democrats than there are Republicans in America\nIsn't it great for the country is the guy loves politics to get that type of turnout [noise] um I Wish we were doing it in a less wretched way yes um I Wish that it was not so vitriolic an apocalyptic\nAs the kids would say are here for this\nOr he's ... he's always here for this pick up his book every man and king it helps make sense of Donald Trump's rise and

Trump has the right idea as far as putting military troops on the borders because uh the border patrol as you're not going to be strong enough to all all these people not only that\nBut they've already confiscated I don't know how much drugs before they even got the Mexican border okay\nSo then drugs come across our border along with the illegals and\nI think Trump has the right idea catches right to protect this country at all costs\nAnd I think they should stop them was I mean means possible like water um they these are chemicals that burn your eyes and whatever\nUm I forgot what they call it because I had to go through when I was into service\nWell look I caught it yeah I I I hear what you're saying there um and and there are ways to stop these people from coming across without you know Chris Cuomo seems to think that the military just going to open fire on ... on the illegals and and that is not the case and no one's advocating for that\nBut to your point claw and ah there's a report out of out of Phoenix, Arizona from the Associated Press\nUh they're saying that large numbers of Central Americans are arriving at the Arizona border and these people are not even connect\nRound up all of these people which is why we do need the military down their claws appreciate the telephone call thank you for a\nThank you for listening today I'm so real quick before we before we have to ... to ... to break and I understand that congressman Louie Gohmert is going to be on the program at the bottom of the hour he is fired up over this and he was at the president's rally last night in Houston\nI Know he's going to be on the show because a producer Johnny just tweeted about it so I his people are all over this\nBut there were the president was getting a lot of flak from ABC News and CNN over his comments that there were terrorist and gang members embedded in this in this army\nAnd they said well where's your proof where's your ... these are good piece these are good decent people how can you how can you say horrible things about them\nWell according to Univision or they've got a reporter or they're in Guatemala who's who is traveling with with the caravan and the Univision reporter and keep in mind these are pretty liberal folks\nThe the Univision reporter says he met many people in the in the in the crowd from Bangladesh Bangladesh ladies and gentlemen\n[noise]\nKind of makes you wonder how do people from Bangladesh yet in the middle of a of a caravan bound for the U.S border and who are these people that's all the president is trying to say\nAlso just reporting from judicial watch and they do a terrific job tracking down all of this information\nAre good friend Tom fits in who's been on this program before he says Guatemala's president announced and the country's largest newspaper that nearly one hundred ISIS terrorists have been apprehended and their country\nAnd Tom ... says why should Americans can't be concerned about as well that caravan of Central America\nTurned about this uh terrorists could have easily slipped in considering the miners who were not properly vetted turns out many of them had been violent had been identified as violent gang bangers [noise]\nSo yeah there's a reason why we should be very concerned about this and by the way the Democrats but Democrats the president says are behind all\nThe Democratic party is openly encouraging millions of illegal aliens to break our laws violate our borders and overwhelm our nation that's what's up [noise]\nThe Democrats have launched an assault on the sovereignty of our country the security of our nation and the safety of every single American\nNow I Want you to think about something here you've got Stacey Abrams a Democrat running for governor in Georgia and she's telling a crowd the illegal vote is going to be part of the blue way\nThen you've got another report out of Texas where Democrats were apparently reportedly trying to register illegals to vote\nAnd now you've got thousands of people about to cross the border just in time for election day\nDoesn't pass the smell test folks AAA seven eight nine nine one zero the number of Louie Gohmert coming up next [noise]\n[noise]\nUm [noise]\nHas got to be stopped and the president has made clear he's going to stop it and and our reminded him of when we were talking before the event last night about a ... you know Woodrow Wilson I said you know once again just like the Democrats set the pattern for I'm\nWaving cloture when it comes to judicial confirmations a the Democrats at the pattern for dealing with something like\nThis when Woodrow Wilson\nIt says you know I'm I'm ... I'm not sending our reservists I'm sending our regular army a regular military they're going to be down where we are not letting them come in and I was hearing yesterday supposedly they may be heading for a California because uh\nYou know grab Greg habits and the president both would not be that\nGreg could put National Guard troops on on the border to stop an invasion show these people may be crazy but they're not stupid [noise] um they're not going to come where they figure there'll be soldiers you know shoulder to shoulder but it the president has got\nTo stop this and I said this is a great a test for your presidency and I just know the president's gonna come through with flying colors so ... they're going to find out\nA disguise ... our president means what he says\nNow that this would be pretty interesting though I mean if in fact this uh the this mob heads towards California or what's going to happen then because Jerry Brown is going to heal welcome to the sanctuary state I don't know surely do you think the president's going to allow that to happen\nThink it will and you know as the Supreme Court made clear um even though I thought they were wrong in chastising Arizona a\nFew years ago or ... you know anybody any law enforcement ought to be able to enforce any federal or state or by the Supreme Court didn't say it that way\nBut what they make clear is the federal government is in charge of things like enforcing our border and so regardless of what Jerry Brown feels this is important for the entire country because you know California would be a gift\nRight even with the governors objection to putting people on our United States a border with Mexico in California you have a right to do that\nAnd this is going to be this has got to be so massive I mean you might have to declare martial law along the border and the Democrats\nHave been too stupid to realize that encouraging this caravan they may actually empower the president to do things they never wanted\nCongressman what would that look like what would martial law along the border looked like\nWell hopefully it won't come to that hopefully Jerry Brown will force the issue but when it comes to an invasion of this size with this many people angry\nPotentially violent people gang bangers um\nIt would it would look like the federal troops coming in and being at the border and if anybody tried to stop them [noise] they could um\nYou know be dealt with but uh you would probably made federal law enforcement to\nBe there to arrest any Americans who might try to stop it um the military needs to have their weapons pointed toward Mexico and not towards the American people but you know it may be that we have to have it in a federal law enforcement do you have to\nHave National Guard or if if Jerry Brown is going to force the issue but I Hope and pray that he won't be so stupid as to try to stop the United states government from enforcing our border\nBecause uh men were dark and you know treasonous type ...\nThe Democrats have continued to spiral up the rhetoric\nSpiral up the violence we've been going this direction for a number of years you can go back to um a while the heck Charlottesville when witnesses so\nSome people from the two different warring sides getting off the same buses and I\n... at the racketeering influence corrupt organization act that allows the federal government to go after organized crime really ought to be put in play here to be investigating where the money came from\nTo ratchet things up over the recent years and it won't be Republican money that did this but\nIt it has gotten so dangerous and with all the rhetoric stirring up people that you know some are violent like the guy that uh\nYou know try to kill everybody on our Republican baseball to eat [noise] ah it it is at such a level some people need to start being prosecuted for stirring up this kind of a\nViolent because this is not a peaceful group it's coming and you see that when they tear down barricades and they tear down order of stopping points [noise] ah so this is a group that is going to have to be dealt with with strength\nAnd we'll just happen to have the right president they can do it\nYou know one final question congressmen I'm curious how this was playing in your district I you know the ... with the with the campaign and the election coming up here or are people pretty fired up about this in your in your district\nIt it's become the number one issue it should've been the issue should have been great you're caught currently doing but what the Democrats have turned it into is uh about what we have seen as an invasion in recent years\nAnd they're concerned they don't want them as Thirteen or ... coming up uh in our district and they are thankful we have a president I'm Talking about three fourths of the people in my district\nTheir police we have a precedent that it's going to do everything within his power to protect them from that's what they elected him to do\nCongressmen were going to have to leave it there by the way the president says some really nice stuff about you or yesterday at the rally\nYou know I Know I Hope that doesn't hurt his credibility not too much about me but uh he\nLike I say he made it fun it was a good night this amazing it really was an amazing that and I think it was really uplifting to you too it was just a great now thanks so much ...\nAll right congressman Louie Gohmert as always great American patriot and he says he just says what's on his mind folks and I think we really appreciate that we've come to admire him\nUh for for doing that um but uh if you're looking for the headline that he made in our interview I Louie Gohmert says that President Trump may very well need to declare martial law along the border\nTo stop the invasion force especially if that invasion force decides to head towards California where\nGovernor Jerry Brown has declared that a sanctuary state\nI mean this is unbelievable but this is this is where\nWe are right now in in in American history we've got to take a break here ...

army have four tours and over thirty missions under my belt the question is has anyone mobilized or thought about mobilizing veterans such as myself on the southern border\nNow you know that is an interesting question I we we had a guy on yesterday who who suggested something very similar to a bad day I I think he said he was a retired a member of the military and was willing to volunteer to go down there is that somehow that you would be willing to do\nAbsolutely absolutely are oath did not it did not die with our discharge it dies with our debt\nWell that's what that is I mean that that is a noble thing uh and and maybe that just might might be a possible solution here\nUm you know my concern and again I just in the back of my mind mark I just thought the uh the caravan was going to head towards the Texas border where you know they've already got the national guard down there but if in fact\nHere in Beijing well it is an invasion you're right you're right but if in fact the invasion army is heading towards California that raises a very interesting question I don't know if you've heard the\nYou've got a governor who is probably going to say we're not going to secure the border does the president's in the military in\n... exactly yes absolutely uh this is the country or the United states of America and [noise] and he is within his rights to do just such a thing um if uh the governor of Florida wants to commit treason that's his choice\nWell and that you're right I mean that that is that is is Joyce and so we'll see what Jerry Brown\nHas to say about that but

phones at\nTriple eight eight to five five two to five that's AAA eight to five five two to five Benjamin is with us in Wichita, Kansas Hi Benjamin how are you\nI'm doing well thank you for taking my call they sure what's up [noise] well I have a ...\nAnd our FDU class there are several of us that are considered uninsured people so are one of my questions is what should we do instead of term life insurance and in my case I already have accidental death insurance in place should I go ahead and canceled or keep it since I'm now can't get insurance\nHow old are you [noise] forty three why are you not ...\nHistory of diabetes I'm no longer diabetic but I I just got that diagnosis removed but I have have that in the past five years of my history\nOkay have you checked with Zander insurance and see what they can write you\nWe're in the process of having them do that kind of a double check\nOkay on dry out or something you know because you know in every day that goes by you're going to be more and more trouble in your situation so that's great news just hopefully as a short lived to issue\nOkay because another one and I think I think you're gonna be able to get insurance I just don't know exactly when or what is going to cost that's the other thing you've got to look at you or I could be unreasonable but I'm diabetes is a real tough\nDiagnosis for life insurance really tough so um anyway the answer your question overall is if someone's uninsured people yes you would keep accidental death at forty something years old you know the probability is accidental\nThere would be your cause a except that you've had the diabetes issue um but otherwise I mean you you statistically that'd be the cause we don't recommend accidentally up as you know but it's better than having no insurance\nRight so yeah I Would keep it and it's not that expensive because it's kinda gimmick insurance is what it is a definitely would keep any term or any whole life or anything that's in place as long as you can keep it don't okay in order to the very last moment and if you're a term it is expiring see if they have you checked to see if they have a renewal and non medical renewal\nNo I have not I didn't know about those sometimes\nIf you've got a non medical renewal it may just jump way up like triple or something what you're paying now kind of thing um so what did you have like a ten or twenty year term it's run out\nRight twenty or turn when we first got married\nYeah okay All right you know that that's um\nYeah you would see you would see it go up you just to buy a twenty year term it forty rather than at twenty obviously\nBut in your case if we did a non medical renewal most of them have that so I Would check that that's the other thing then lastly or not lastly the next thing I Would do is just start looking around for a gimmick type non medical policies policies that don't check medical\nAnd that's like ten thousand dollars issued through your bank or with your checking account\nBut with that pay raise their um say that he also has that they're going to be transitioning him into salary pay she usually works between five and twenty hours of overtime each week so I wanted to make sure that when he they haven't given him a a former offered yet but when they do want it to make sure that\nHow would you how would you recommend\nTo calculate whether\nThat the salary rate is comparable with for example the hours that he was working before and the pay that he would get what overtime\nWhich will be simple you've been working Fifteen to twenty hours a week last year extra and you've been paid for that and overtime correct correct and show what was his income last year including the overtime\nWith about forty thousand\nAnd how will that compared to the salary\nBut that's the part that we don't know yet\nBecause you're going to show really read it at the salaries fifty that's raised if the salary is forty five and the same number of hours or expect to be work it's effect of Lee or pick up\nRight\nYes they're mixing it just like I ... yeah like as we were I was kind of weird because it was just more of a since we're in the ... number two I'm a I Know that he has the potential to work more hours so because of that I was\nFor him apples to apples and not\n... and ... and has he got the chance to move up in the company because he moved to salary\nYes he's going to be moving into management ... no but I mean further up later oh okay\nBut let's say like I say they offer him fifty five as a salary or sixty is a salary will we be dancing wouldn't we\nYeah\nOkay 'cause that's like that's like getting paid a lot more and I'm working in the same number of hours you know and it's like ... it's almost like he picked up more hours but didn't have to work on you see what I'm saying\nBut ... but again if they want to give him a salary and act like they did him a favor and it's a and and he gets paid forty but he's working in the same number of hours where he's working when he's making forty eight then that's not a blessing\nYeah it's just making sense to you yeah that makes sense\nIf it's even if it's forty eight to forty eight we still like the salary because of the upward potential\nOkay\nLong term it's a long term good career movies moving into leadership and the management and that's where he wants to head towards long term but I'm\nThe you know yes but but again you just compare it to last year's income so the whole thing comes down to how does it compare to forty eight thousand what's the salary do 'cause that's what he was making working the hours that he's going to continue to be working apparently\nChris is with us in Tulsa, Oklahoma Hi Chris how are you\nI'm doing good they taking my call sure what's up\nUh well right now I'm a I'm like income about thirty one thousand dollars a year [noise] I've got a fourteen hundred dollars in credit card debt or about eleven thousand a student loan debt that it ah that that about six months ago was right about Nineteen thousand [noise]\nCooks right now I came up with the idea for an invention and I don't know whether to keep you know steam rolling my debt plan and doing all that are just you know kind of jumped ship and say hey this is something that could you know be my future and potentially mhm\n[laughter] so I'm kind of want a young lady of financial advice from you know what to do with the remaining dead I have and yeah my aspirations because I'm In the process I've been saving to uh get a v a home loan and I was just about their so any advice you can give me I'd be greatly appreciated but\nWell I'm going to avoid buying the home until I got the debt cleared the only question is then how can we start working on the invention idea and make some money now because we don't need to make a bunch of money five years from now we need some money today\nOne of them twenty thousand dollars a day so the invention you came up with as a physical product\nYes sir it's a a odor the odor either slash a mold a little small machine that um people can sell in their home\nOkay and you've made one\nI just made a very um rudimentary proud of the tight mhm the next the next phase I've got is like either dip into my rainy day fund started coming into my regular cash flow\nAnd like buying a computer and get my three D. modeling and get me you know a couple of silicon prototype so I can go you know take it to a you know take the next level of what I Want to do so again by jump off my my debt plan more do I have his mind Vinton [laughter]\nOkay um well what you're talking about you could spend anywhere from twenty five dollars to a two hundred and fifty thousand dollars on it there's really no in between I mean you could just go anywhere you want to go with ...\nI'm Out there and test them and make sure that they work and that you there was a market for it before you went into production\nBecause you don't go into production on prototypes that are on tested or from an R and D standpoint or you don't go into production on something that I've got no market for it not been able to sell it\nBecause you can let you make a hundred thousand of them and having them in your basement or if you had unlimited sums ever be able to sell them\nYou know ... I'd like trying to ah continue to do with the way you're doing it and that's just piece it together and let's build one and let's find somebody to put one in there in the property and a commercial applications\nAnd let's say let me give me just let's just make up a pretend example okay here would be like your ideal thing you build one or two in your garage and you'd convince these guys look this looks rough we're not looking at the ... the form of it we're looking at the function of it I just want to show you that the idea works\nAnd if the ideal works then and what I'm going to want you to his place in order for ten of 'em or thirty of them or a hundred of them for for all of your locations okay and you find somebody like that that's got an upside to test it and then if a place that order they just place of deposit with you large enough\nTo build the order\n... and it finds itself that's called organically cash flowing something in other words you you prove it to somebody who's going to be a big customer and they place an order with enough of a deposit to fill the manufacturer your first order out\n[noise] they they got some doubt down my rather than just than all my extra capital towards paying out my credit card debt and my student loans that\nI don't have time and much capital on this you've already you already built one in the garage yeah build another one okay maybe a couple of hundred bucks right [noise] well I keep it in that but um\n[laughter] very they're very purpose of a prototype despite all the crap that's broken [laughter]\nYou're not going to get it perfect you're going to put it out there in the in the marketplace is going to kick it around and you're going to learn form and function changes informants function changes in the ... which has to be on that side of this which has to be made out of this instead of that and you're only going to learn that if you beat up about a hundred of them but let's get two of 'em in somebody's restaurant\nIn there to restaurants and they got a hundred they can put them in later are two of them in somebody's industrial application and they've got um you know they've got forty more they will order if it works because it's the best thing since sliced bread I got to have the ... I'm ... and then they give you enough money [noise]\nAnd they're a deposit for the initial order for you to do your manufacturing\nAnd basically you got almost nothing out of pocket [noise] except your brain power and your sweat\nAnd your smile out there selling it\nAnd that's how a lot of these things get off the ground\nThe way a lot of people lose a lot of money on them is they go into mass production or something to prove when he's in the marketplace or the actual prototype\nAnd you're talking to a guy's lost some money that way so stupid stuff so [noise] do easy man go easy this is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nFor years and one of the most asked questions I get is day one are you going to do a live event in our city\nWith a radio show and book tours in our growing company in family

overlooked things are term life insurance and disability insurance both plans make sure that you have income to pay bills\nAnd take care of yourself and your family if something were to happen for

I'm right now there for one am for three B. and they're with fidelity\nOkay um well the four oh one K. is after tax correct so that doesn't have any penalty took converted to a rough I always suggest as a general rule when you leave your employer take everything that's bested enroll it into an Iranian good growth stock mutual far you're more accessibility\nEmployer right some examples that I Would not converted to a Roth if it's pre tax unless you're out of debt have your emergency fund and have some extra money to pay the taxes and that that creates but the four oh one hey you can go ahead and stick that into a rough it doesn't cost you a dime\nOkay there's already after tax money that's in there um you know there could be some growth in there that how you don't pay taxes on possibly um but it probably wouldn't be much so just you know ... are you out of debt\nI'm I Will be I have about ten thousand dollars left on a student loan but um by the time I make this transition up that covered\nOkay well then the other question is when you're not going to have your emergency phone number ... so we're not we don't do anything that creates in taxes so when you sit down with your smart Mr pro roll it all over to Iowa raise\nA traditional IRAs unless you can move some of it to a Roth IRA in similar mutual funds um without any taxes and then later on if you want to convert it to Rob from traditional the taxes that are created you just need to be able to pay those in cash\nAs extra money you got laying around\nLewis is with us in Dallas texas Hi Louis how are you\nI have are you doing better than I deserve what's that\nQuestion and they set for putting an end to come and see that rock for white cat work good as kind of wondering why general ... put into Iraq I was talking to a co worker and he was saying you know right now I couldn't Seventy thousand twenty five percent income bracket\nLet's say one of my time at our we pull out forty nine thousand that would be at a lower tax bracket so we're going to be like the kind of have a mix of both in Iraq and traditional or you know\nBecause when you how old are you I'm twenty three\nHer to leave Louis is on Facebook\nShould pull a thousand dollars out of my four one K. to do baby step\nOne oh you don't cash out of four O. one K. except to avoid bankruptcy or a foreclosure when you take money out of your four o one K they charge you a ten percent penalty plus your tax rate\nNow that means if you make Seventy five thousand dollars a year household income your tax rates twenty five percent plus ten percent that means you just got charged thirty five percent interest in fact I mean it's not technically interest it's penalties in taxes\nBut you never borrow money thirty five percent interest of ... baby step\nOne no no no no no no no or would you use that to pay off debt thirty five percent hit no no\nWell they told me they're only ... percent out that's all they're required to withhold but that's not the calculation of how much the government keeps you in the teeth\nThe government keeps you in the teeth out of ten percent penalty plus your tax rate you do not cash out retirement accounts unless it's to avoid bankruptcy or a foreclosure save your home yeah or if you're so far in debt it's the only way you keep from filing bankruptcy yeah you would do that\nBut at that point you're beyond desperate you're in deep weeds you know but definitely not never cash it out\nTo buy a car or you know is is that kind of stupid stuff that people do all the time\nNo never never\nAnd I was with us in Washington DC Hi Anna how are you\nI Am I'm going wow thank you for taking my question should go into that I think my husband and I purchased our first home okay that that I ate the

analysis by quality real estate agent says is houses were three hundred grand\nOkay is that what you're telling me\nYes\nSo you must have during the world's worst real estate deal\nI I that well it's

Charlotte crown we should sell it it's crap the world's worst house\nWell here's the thing\nWe needed to do it so much\nSo you think we should wait for it we\nWe all are you willing to suck more for years\n[laughter] All right do you that that is actually my question because right now we're at a baby ... baby step number six\nHere's the thing and we gave you three hundred thousand dollars in cash would you go by the house next door\nKnow why because there's so much\nNeighborhood is not appreciating for some reason or another it's the world's worst rate of return\n...

center of everything and knowing full well that was still a capitalistic nation and even a lot of people in the left or like you don't take away our capitalism wants to look at a situation where they can come in and not be Venezuela\nBy nationalizing everything but having the government be over everything is kind of their dream no sweet and for all intents and purposes and this was more the check

those are the things we can discuss yeah no problem discussing some of those things you're not going to get Eighteen months off it's just not going to have you know that I Know and and here's the thing\nIn a world where we are going a thousand miles an hour I don't think too many people want to stop down take a few months off their career that's the that's the reality some people do some people don't\nKnow what\nBut now it starts to get real so this is what they want to remember burning them they they they believe the government can do a better and if they can't make it a nationalistic thing where they take over some of these things they want to be able to control some of these things well guess what let's talk about some control how well did government doing sweet and when they kind of ran everything\nHaving the government manage all of these things didn't work [noise] so we have too many attention in other words they privatized\nWe realized in Sweden that with the government monopolies we don't get the innovation that we get when we have competition\nAnd this is particularly true for the school system Sweden switched to a school voucher system that lets parents pick their kids' school and force the schools to compete\nSee this is where the Bernice of the world and everything this is where they're going to come out and they're going to want to pick and choose because the last thing they want to do is give schools that opportunity compete with one another every state right now going to an election\nThere's going to be on a majority of those some sort of school voucher fight or funding fight that's going on this is the name of their happening and and and\nWhile schools over their\nPrivate schools are good\nOh Bernie doesn't want any part if you tell a a socialist or progressive or even a hardcore Democrat that you want a school vouchers by and large most if not all of them but most of them will say\nUh no no now\nWhat about things like we get Social Security their pensions\nPrivatize the pension system that terrifies and obviously that scares people but when they realized that the alternative was that the whole of pension system would collapse they hope that this is much better than nothing\nYes and their pension systems very interesting\nWhen things are going good you get your pension and potentially a little bit more when things are stopped down you're going to get a little bit less oh yeah yeah because people look at it and say well I'd rather have Seventy\nPercent of something that a hundred percent of nothing and the way that it was going it was going to completely collapse but for all of the on the left to scream and yell about how they're able to do all the things that they're able to do\nWhen it comes to taxes and the fair share and the whole nine yards I told you over and over yet you don't listen how does the tax system work over there well guess what he\nWas tweeting does made surprise here despite the fact to Sweden looks like sort of a socialist country which taxes rich exorbitant the high\nThe truth is the only\nPeople who weren't below average income pay up to sixty percent in taxes this is the the little secrets about the sweetest type system we don't take from the rich and give to the poor we squeeze the poor because they are loyal taxpayers boom\nIt's a Ponzi scheme amongst the middle class and the lower income\nThe consumer goods that allow them to pay for all of the things they don't go and tax the wealthy exorbitant leave because they know that their money makers and they generate and if you start to do that they saw that in the seventies what happens is they\nLeave so they had to find another way and this is the other way income tax low but the value added tax nationwide is massive and it disproportionately hurts the people that the lap screams they want to help\n\nBut we could make the rich pay their fair share what their fair share Everytime I see a new study it shows how much they pay towards federal income tax what is enough that's the thing stopped telling me what their fair share is just once outlined it I Want them to pay this\nThere you go\nBut that's the

job\nIt's crazy though it really is and it's so funny when you listen to it because I've talked to so many people who the narrative is what because Ninety percent of the coverage is awful\nAnd that is\nA lot of what is the coverage has nothing to do with policy has old to do with personality has nothing to do with the actions when it comes to the political side of things has all to do with who the person is you may find somebody off all the human being but their work\nWe forget we we we go in and we\nWe look at history in a much different way when it comes to past presidents right\nI mean Bush got a a people looking at Bush more fondly and part of that because they don't like Trump was like oh like ... but that's the way that people approach it it's so different because we we look at it in a different way but with ... with President Obama ... the media was starry eyed\nMinus Fox and Breitbart and a few other you couldn't find anybody have a negative word against Obama\nAnd yet when you look at the people that matter the voting public they're like doing pretty good job and they're like well it's it's way this is the title because it says that people are prove that he did say

mentioned show\nIs your Twitter you can tweet at us love hearing from you Rand Paul was talking out so it was ... her show he hockey whatever they call I mean every time I turn somebody on depending what accent they have his name is different\nBut I talked about Rand Paul the other day and the things that he's saying first of all apparently Trump is is is fuming and his pissed at the Saudis and the way this thing has gone down\nAnd it is it is getting uglier and uglier and everyone has come out talking about this\nThe information on the evidence that we have so far collected [noise] indicates that ... was slain in a vicious violent ... yeah yeah\nSome guy was a journalist who hung out with bad people who said some things that were awful at times gets a ... a pass and somehow we're all supposed to care but I said well it's not just to think of it like this it's not just this\nThere are so many other things because you don't you know a NBS the guy the the ... the prince\nThe things around the prince that have added up to it whether it be the way that he treated many others\nThe way that he's violently crushed descent or anything like that the way that he's extorting money from family members that are fairly locked up his mother and and and they done so many things that's the fear\nThat people this is just the straw\nThat is breaking a the camel's back if you will that is the issue that people are having this it's not just one 'cause everybody's looking at the micro why should we care about this it's not just this\nIt is so many other things and this just happens to be maybe the final straw for a lot of people\nThink oh this was just an accidental death or you send a forensic pathologist with a phone saw just in case you might have a fist fight where you have to just remember somebody I mean how horrific\nBut then also having a body double I think there's a lot of reasons to think this was planned and I think because they have such an authoritarian government nothing over there happens it's not directed from above you don't act without orders so it's kind of a stretches credulity to think that the crown prince wasn't involved with them\nYeah yeah absolutely one hundred and ten percent\nWe were too easy to say I will give it credibility to the story and people are starting to\nA step back\nWell maybe you know even out Trump number of questioning at your Jared Kushner yesterday saying look\nJust as this story and I think that's a lot of what's happening is\nThe journalist obviously are concerned because they're seeing somebody was working for the Washington Post and somebody has been a journalist for a long time who's an influential voice in in an area of the world that doesn't have a lot of influence when it comes

he's got a lot and gall to lecture the United states about presumption of innocence the Saudis currently have over three thousand people being held without any trial without any presumption of
