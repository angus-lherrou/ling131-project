... it was going good it was because we live in a world where in politics we need the other side to suck now so we feel like we can have a victory\nHe wants to impeach he did not have been waiting for the evidence yeah let's impeach\nBut two hundred and forty two years into this experiment\nWhich is the exception not the rule in world history nothing that guarantees the two hundred and forty third

for is you know I I talked about what Thomas sold before the ... the great thing that he said there there's no solutions there's only trade offs that Truman solution is you know two plus two is four

situation he was asked because he he went into the lion\nCrude lions had why did you say that fear I went through a whole debate at SMU with Senator Cruz where he made up\nOne story after another and so I decided that he doesn't spend the rest of the debate responding to\nEvery single dishonest thing that he said or I could uh make sure that everyone understood exactly what he's doing it is not something that I feel totally comfortable with and and perhaps in in the seat in the moment um I took a step too far and read it I don't know that that's that's the way that I Want to be talking in in this campaign\nYeah I I you know I found him to be very very interesting uh he wants to do a lot of things that cost a lot of money and he's already talked about raising taxes the one thing where he differs I think from some of the other Democrats is they want to take everything back to where it was he's like look\nWe don't need to raise the taxes back to thirty five percent or these it we can go from Twenty one percent or twenty three twenty four twenty five pay for some of these things I'm willing to listen to some of this because I think some of this stuff and I think there's a better way that we could have gone about doing taxes which frustrated the hell out of me\nA with a lot of stuff that the way that they they jammed through taxes and and the brakes and they're you know [noise]\nIt is frustrating but he had some interesting things but he also talked about the expense of it and you know there's a lot of stuff he wants to do whether it's early childhood education you're paying for a two year degree and junior college or some of these things\nYou know and I'm all for investing in education and I think there's a way we can invest in education I got no problem with that because I think that there were turned on our money is fantastic\nIn saying that when you want to spend so much money there's only so much money to go around every time that you've talked to a Democrat if they want to add a new program at some point in time you're like look if you if you raise tax rates at one percent here one percent one percent\nThree two three five three twenty four

blow up an international law and so one portion I mean I'm Sorry\nOkay so he said you got a hundred billion dollars is what it is but the alliance [noise] [noise] this is how they take it on CNN\nFounded on the media was saying is that money is more important President Trump has made the same kind of statements\nGrotesquely calculating the cost of human life in this case it's a hundred and ten billion dollars that is a grotesque calculation to make a I Will point out this administration is not the first to make it it's the first really to make it openly and honestly and as sort of make ugly as time passed\nSo let's see here what he said again let's go over that so yeah it's about money\nWrite them a hundred billion dollars worth of arms sales which is you know that's one of those things with more than that we've got to have some Arab allies\nBut more than that but more than ... Van Jones\nAs a person the fake myself on and we and we share the\nTry to put literally material as opposed to consideration over the dignity of human soul is against Christianity\nSo disingenuous it's not even close to that he said allies\nOver and over again he said it is what it is the money is what it is and I'm no fan of Pat Robertson at all but if you stop being disingenuous he didn't say it's the most important thing he's the most important thing is what having allies\nAre ...

people of the GDP even a currency any any hope of an infrastructure because of the drying up of resources with the sanctions will that bring the regime down\nMichael a very good evening to you I remember the lesson from Eastern Europe that I connected immediately with your observations that at PJ Media\nThe observations were when the regimes fell apart in Eastern Europe this is\nOf the early Nineteen nineties the late Nineteen eighties about time of the Soviet collapse it was not from the bottom it was from the top you needed to know that the leadership no longer a beta orders and that there was new leadership\nHow do you measure this effort to bring down Iran by so do I do bag wearing the population that there'll be something like the ... good evening to\nHire ... thank you uh well two things\nUh first of all those kind of a a vulgar mark to submit work we're told slim if things get bad enough\nThere will be revolutions ... for evolution was something that just happen naturally they're part of the normal course of events when I'm Rio or the revolutions are\nCertain getting worse but when things are getting better and to you can go back to the French Revolution when things were getting better even though we all quote with the meat cake for Marie Antoinette\nAnd a Hitler came to power as things are getting better in Germany in moose we came to power when things were getting better and Italy or too sick or more [noise] and all that so it's it's actually the opposite of the conventional wisdom\nThe ages so off which is so often true ah I\nI just had a detail here Michael because I don't know what you're saying is correct all historical evidence points to that it's puzzling to me that this administration and the last administration both believed and from different sides of the same coin\nThat encouraging the population with a generate a allowances allowing trade to come in again or discouraging the population as the Trump Administration she was both both the Obama and the Trump people believed\nIn that what you call crude Marxism they believed that the economics what's going to drive the story\nRight right they all believe plant and and most of our pundits belief that in a fairly most where policymakers belief that\nBecause they keep on saying we don't want to change the regime we want to change its behavior and how are we going to change its behavior sanctions\nWere going to make some more miserable and it says if there was some kind of magical tipping point\nWhere when things got bad or no for the Iranian people they were going to rise up and change the regime [noise] and I don't think that's what happens I think that we're gonna have to support revolution as we did in the Soviet Union [noise]\nOn human rights violations that that that is what undermined the leadership and the Soviet Union\nYeah that's correct\nAnd uh and and we reached out to the dissidents and the Soviet Empire and we said okay we're with you what do you need\nAnd it turned out to things they need to work all that difficult to I mean they needed above a means to communicate with one another\nAnd ah they need that in order to tell each other how things were going all over the place so people in Leningrad had to know what was going on in Moscow and what was going on in ... and so forth\nAnd a ... and the best way to do that was the radio sets wire radios were such a revolutionary instruments so they had\nA Radio Free Europe radio liberty voice of America all of these broadcasts going in so that we could tell them what was happening there\nWe're not doing that and then in the case of of ran ... we're not talking to the Iranian people are broadcasting our first language broadcasting into Iran is is not very aggressive\nAnd for the most part the people who run than operation or carry over from the old days\nAnd they tend to support the regime as Obama did\nTrump doesn't support the regime but Trump doesn't seem to get that if you don't want that regime to go on you've got to go after it you have to fight and he's not doing that\nMichael I wouldn't want to remind everyone that you wrote about the green revolution\nAnd then the Dina shot in power before roe any they were under house arrest the last time I checked on them and you have you had a plane\nThat in door thing the green revolution and encouraging that leadership and it's a technical in all cities was a positive thing to do is that still positive I mean is that still possible\nOh yes absolutely possible easy better than possible [noise]\nIt's it's ... it's easy or you know if there was like a few personnel changes as I keep\nSaying the thing that the Trump Administration does worst is person that they make terrible personal assistance they have not changed\nA Farsi radio management or they do not have we have all kinds of leading this would have to remember that guy\nUh bought to be who was on the cover of the economy was holding up his\nBloody T shirt yes yeah well he's here in Washington and you'd think they will have him on the air all the time but did they use you know as if he didn't exist and there are many others like\nThat yes I speak to ... a few weeks he ... he was a member of the government at one point he's now in Washington a prominent journalist and here are the is quite capable of telling the facts to the people in Iran I'm surprised that he's not an used\nYeah I'm I'm Amazed just honest and just made all of those things it's\nVery discouraging spring going on forever and ah for some reason the United states of America which is arguably the most revolutionary country in the world [noise] maybe in the history of the world does not use revolution as uh\nAnd all the John Edwards no and they ... they're scared to death or the ... if you see what Rouhani says what he says\nAll talk about the United states try to foster a white revolution which is say a non violent a peaceful transformation those through regime and they know that that could bring them done them but we don't we don't go to\nMichael the dean of the foundation for the defense of democracies riding most recently is PJ Media about the imminent severe sanctions

tonight they end up getting that field goal after a really big\nA trick play a reverse pass 'em but you know one play that really stood out to me and it happened in the first quarter was a pass by Thatcher\nThat actually looked like it was getting into ended up being an interception and this is on I think their first Dr you can see it get right into the hands of the defender of the ... valley out there and it bounces through bounces back into the possession of 'em\nYeah trace good one Goodman a and that that play right there what the conceivably could have been turned over for around Delhi and kill as Dr should have been yeah and instead left out your way down deep bench around valley territory ended up I think being a part of their\nFirst touchdown possession and or just a huge play that had a lot of significant set the time and you know it you know Thatcher ended up kind of running away with the football game thereafter but on a early possess\nWell if you'll recall that that what the faster it had a couple of miss cues holding call and we're deep in their own territory they were trying to fight their way out at that point so that was in my opinion a very pivotal point in the game because prior to that neither team both teams kind of feeling each other out and that kind of set a tone\nFor the rest of the night for the factory goes that's are below worth it on a

the distance and stuff and and uh we just had to stay focused execute our players and that was the difference was we executed and we cleaned up a lot of stuff as we can practice and so\nYou know it just came down to ... inches and it's an inch of game so this week we we brought the inches in so good\nSo so coach talking to you guys at the end of the game there and you got a lot of fans here and it's pretty cool you this you can live pictures a soccer coach talking to you guys are then again what a coach have to say you know are you guys thinking about game to game or you're really thinking

know when you look at the depth they have we talked about\nYou know colon Thompson and his return to the team I guess that's being his first game this season he he had a really impressive outing defensively tonight I felt just a really strong rush or\nFrom the outside and we just saw three players that Ron interviewed all having great games uh and that's their entire backfield will not their entire backfield but a big chunk of their backfield and oh by the way\nSome of their better defensive players as well Brock Jones another one that I thought had a really good game tonight we called his numbers several times and the you know Britain dodge number twenty had a good game\nBut it's so hard to pick out one because they're just such a dynamic and very very talented football team but uh\nI guess since we have to pick one you know Riley more has really stood out tonight\nSo a huge game for him um we saw great speed from him on those longer on this longer run he's basically out running most of the defence the defence of secondary\nFor round valley a so just a outstanding but I was really also impressed with his defense of play tonight from that outside linebacker position just doing an outstanding job\nUh all around for this uh for the stature eagle to denied played probably most of the downs if not all of them I don't even know if he was on special teams or not but\nUh just a outstanding athlete among many on this uh Thatcher eagle team but I'm hard to ignore the great production tonight Riley Morris and I think he certainly deserving a player the

lot of things well they're well coached team and we knew that we're going to have to play better than that we had been playing not make some of the mistakes that we've made in the past\nAnd I think we've cleaned a lotta those up today you know we certainly talked about for example volleyball security and we did a pretty good job of that\nOne of the things I've noticed is speaking of just a well coached team your team seems very disciplined\nUh from from you know on the sideline to after the game and in in the uh uh you know in the end zone there so a great great job of for you and your your coaching staff of bringing these kids and um and just a you know growing men into boys\nWell you know I I have a great staff or you know I have guys that have been coaching for a long time and\nUh

where every tweeted by a lot of uh I Alone look what I did look John ... to me I really was I mean I I Know you know who it was it was I'm like you've got to be kidding me really I mean it was like

night and not moving the football it was there oh see my ...\nAgain Jason lock and force that this is going to happen it seems like firing left which is the guy there in Arizona so you know me I like

my mind I say you know blaming him\nA filled go back to sleep while you are in the [noise] Charlie Batch like the tree [laughter] so what is your dairy Charlie bad\nAnd I thought oh I'm kind of making fun that you know like he's still the back of it but he liked it and I thought that was pretty cool that you know he ... he liked it and saw that I was making a joke right up good with the\nWay he had a good run I mean we're talking about guys that get to play for a while right he always had one or two games he had to come in occasionally fantasy ... because you had high or those guys running or I\nGuarantee you if Ben Roethlisberger couldn't play for a week and you went to the average NFL fan and said who's got a backup who's going to play now they would say\nLeft which Charlie Batch\nOr Landry jumped right they would say one of those three guys is going to come into play and they think that they'd be why they would say that is because everybody thinks the Steelers still have all three of them\nDon't they get all three of those guys right again and the other way around it sure of the ones on the practice ... they think they have all those guys they think so Charlie batches but out of leaks in twenty twelve I Know but he's [laughter]\nAnything like that we\nWant to hear though I mean I played games over twenty oh six or seven\nThanks\nBut we look at those seeds like the Steelers don't change their principal guys around all the time they don't it'll jettison you enjoy your gun robbers burgers started out southern or whoever and he's never heard enough to miss a lot of time usually misses one now\nAnd that's it it makes it seem like he's going to miss more time but really I'm coming back sooner so it looks like I feel better because that's been rough as burgers act

downs in his career have you seen him sort of mature change [noise]\nYeah I Know one thing I'd say is I think\nWhat's fun for me to watch is I think Ryan's and joining us as much as anybody on our

should've happened today and the national football league my car really you know not many\nI thought it was going to hear more inspired takes recent memory I think it's a good deal I think it's I think it's a very good deal I think it would really comes down to it is\nThe either love of lake Bordeaux has exemplified 'em by\nOne of the characters on the good place who uses like morals whenever you possibly can ... it's a it's a good show you should check it out you'd like to show that mentions like ... well yeah exactly and he becomes a cult hero for this guy from Jacksonville but given the fact that John Gurdon seems like he doesn't like his roster\nAlways defending what's on his roster hey look at all the young guys I got your actually the oldest roster to know a lot of guys that are long in the tooth on the other side now marshal on Lynch might be done for the years to ... it's it's kind of being the taking mode of your hurt right you're a four week injury there's things we know you're done [laughter]\nSo you're a ... you can have some pop up stores at the home dates that'll be great mhm but everybody else it seems he's he's either had an opinion about why they were over drafted why they're no good I mean he's taking a baseball bat to Reggie McKenzie legacy or how many times in the last month\nSo yeah I thought your trade offer made sense\nWell here's the cars here's the deal will yeah Jason lock and for on the show last night who told us that yes the raiders fire sale is real it's happening anybody is available look John Gurdon traded college Mac and Jason locking for said listen if John Gurdon would get a first round picking a place\nThe trade that should've happened we watched more Sean Lynch\nIt get announced that he's out for at least a month with a growing issue could be longer he could wind up being an I. R. but right now he's out at least a month so that happened for the raiders so now they're taking is going to be even easier because Marshall which is actually running for tough yards for them sucks for me that I'm a fan of say\nNo I understand what about you were able to pick up Chubb guy on the other end of that I think that actually up\nAnd I was excited how I picked up job wow I should not have said that\nI'm so glad to slide over baby our eye and find those led by sort of busy watching on it because he's trying to blame you try and read the screen\nWhich means the ranch fix all the more than my iPhone all the games are over right now so we have a horror movies on and ... is just enraptured\nWith unfriendly really have a friend it I'll tell you an friend it is a very underrated horrible [noise]\nDone so differently in a way that I thought was going to be incredibly it would bother me after a few minutes but it was just done so well\nYeah I I thought it was not even in a unique story telling experience yes Washington and type ... busy watching that instead of paying attention to that show [laughter] channeling is you know that's ... ...\nIf you know I was no listen I'm big on job I just did it again a but before I get to that how I picked up Chubb less\nNow say stuff like that all the time 'cause I get well it sounds as long as you get that surname into the mix the we got to be able to market that right we can have a whole T shirt line out by morning the jaguars traded for Carlos Hyde today\nThe brown sent high to the jaguars in exchange for a fifth round pick and now Nick Chubb is going to be the number one running back in the backfield for Cleveland the jaguars aspect of this is we have a really good team and we can't let this go down the drain we can't wait for Leonard for net to get back and get ...\nBetter to the point where the guy comes back and then he gets hurt and then he comes back then he gets hurt so they said screw it we need to have somebody so they went and got Carlos Hyde was completely serviceable and it's a good trade\nBut the trade the jaguars needed to make was hey John Gurdon who's got itchy trigger fingers like a fantasy owner you want to move Derek court will give you a first round picking a player will give you first round on a player for Derrick cart easy\nDerek car is a pretty good quarterback\nHe's twenty seven years old he's on on the hook for the next four years\nVery affordable salary because everybody else has jumped in and this year even though he's having a bad years quarterback rating is still Ninety which is a little bit above average\nAnd this is the guy that said better years the last few years and Andrew Luck is that he had a thirty two and thirteenth season twenty Fifteen was twenty eight and six and twenty sixteen even last year which was a quote down here he was twenty two and a Thirteen\nRight so it's not like there are cars that horrible season and he's twenty seven he needs a change of scenery he needs to change of scenery because some\nPlayers just do and it's obvious John Gurdon needs to save face so I got a trade everybody to make it look like well the team I had two years ago when we won twelve games or the teen the raiders out two years ago when they won twelve games that's no longer viable so I got to get rid of everybody you get their car and suddenly the jaguars turn into a vertical off ants\nThat goes down field that now the quarterback as a weapon\nAnd now you are trying to win because of your quarterback not in spite of them I Know look they extended Blake portals for a year and they tried but really they struggle too much to score points and Blake portals is just not that good\nHe had the one the one good year for years ago and he want me a couple of fantasy titles will always have that year Blake board all but really he's not a guy that's going to get them\nPass the chiefs past the New England patriots because they're not going to score enough so if you get their car\nTwenty seven years old but people don't like that my comment that oh you're crazy like I'd like they like they don't think there are cars any good I don't I don't get it well they've been\nSold a bill of goods because the raiders stink right that it's it it all on him and certainly John ... didn't help things when he started calling him out for throws missed and everything else I'm already Cooper that they'd want to be part of the fire sale was in concussion protocol so that might stall things on them if they're on their thereby post\nPost London but you you look at Derek car and what is ... ... you mentioned the salary is at not by Ninety million through twenty twenty two he was one of the first to the trough them first get fed so all the escalators and and monies for quarterbacks have gone up the last ten guys are so that have\nOver thirty points in ten rebounds again just the fifth time and his career he's done that the raptors or two into and it looks like he's back to being the top five NBA guy he was not the selling player who we didn't know if he wanted to play or not last year\nNow to be fair we didn't know how ... was we're only write so well and he was away from the team and didn't plan it any other games they might have just been a lot more hurt was out in my family talk\nI was playing Fortnite for for it and I got popular is playing Fortnite when it was four\nAnd now he's moved on to play basketball again not see that it got over ... and\nPlayed for a week or so those are two great stories and those are pretty good yeah Jimmy Butler food profusely before as soon as he was introduced at the\nEnd of it on a score thirty three points and get MVP chance by the fence post game says it's OK to boo me I'm Still get a play hard [laughter] maybe he wasn't shape Glenn Taylor than the owner of the team when he was shaking hands before the game that I Do it so bad everybody booed him then they're chanting MVP from\nThat might go by Jimmy Butler Jersey that well don't because you don't know what team is\nGoing to do that for sure I got to celebrate his entire catalogue this point based on his uh embracing is in a

to be out several weeks with a groin injury and there's some talk that he's possibly going to go on I are and that his season is over\nAnd so it's just another blow\nIn in in a negative story and a negative issues surrounding a team that's been the butt of a lot of jokes\nAnd has been mocked and ridiculed and crushed this entire season and even a little bit before the season based on personnel decisions that were made by you know who John Gurdon\nAnd so this is just the latest in a long line of bad moments for an Oakland Raiders organization that's on its way out of Oakland and headed to Las Vegas the raiders or finish this year\nThey're done we we all the knowledge that it is over that's a wrap they were close in a few games they battled and a few games\nThe seasons are rap I didn't expect it I thought\nThe raiders were borderline playoff team I think I even made it picked him to win a wildcard spot\nNow I made those picks before clue Mack was traded but nonetheless I I didn't think the raiders will be this bad I didn't think they'd be sitting in this spot with a wind over the Cleveland Browns and when that maybe they don't even deserve because of some of the officiating down the stretch but I didn't expect that at all this isn't something that I looked at it and said oh you know what\nI think the raiders are going to be one of the worst teams in the league in fact I think the raiders are going to be up for contention for diaper fire of the week every single week in the NFL through the first month and a half of the season had no expectations of that had no idea the raiders were going to be this bad now there are skeptics who thought it wouldn't work\nThey thought\nJohn Gurdon coming back he's been gone for too long no way it's going to work and they're feeling themselves and you've heard them and they're the ones that are letting you know yeah I told you before the air out of feeling John ... not going to work he's been gone for a decade game has changed it's passed him by\nHe's totally out of his element now\nHe's in way over his head with a bad organization and a bad football team and what appears to be a bad roster and now on top of that he's making the roster worst see you're hearing all of that stuff\nBut I don't think that's the story I don't think the story is the two thousand Eighteen raiders\nI think the story is the twenty sixteen raiders because I think we all had a part in this I think you owe me an anybody to watch his team a couple of years ago all have\nA part in what's going on and Oakland and why the raiders are what they are and why the perception of the raiders is is it as ... as low as it's been in a few years\nLook that much worse\nGo back to twenty sixteen stink about where we are twenty sixteen two years ago the raiders are twelve and for they go to the playoffs they suffer the terrible injury to Derrick car and they go into a playoff game against the Texans with Conor cook at quarterback\nWe know what happened there it was awful done\nSeason over what a bummer their car goes down with the injury what could have been\nAnd the talk was but don't worry about it they're so young and they've got such a young core and there are so talented in so many key positions that they're going to go on and have a ton of success moving forward you've got the quarterback\nYou got started wide receiver you got one of the best all kinds of lines in the league\nYou got one of the premier pass Russia's in the league don't worry about it this team is set up for success bummer that their car got injured bummer that they lost in the postseason game against the Houston Texans but don't worry about a day or set up to be a great team for years to come\nTheir team to look out for that was the talking twenty sixteen\nWe all assumed they were it\nThat's the franchise you got to look at here in LA in Los Angeles the joke was of all the relocating teams chargers rams raiders of course LA would land all but the most interesting one\nOf course they land the two worst you know because at that time we didn't know what yard golf was we thought we did he was a bust\nWe didn't know what the hell the chargers were they were like a five when team at that time nobody\nKnew nobody had any clue\nHere in LA we thought man not getting the charge you're not getting the raiders were ...\nThose teams and better roster and a better future the Oakland Raiders we'd love to have the raiders in LA no of course we couldn't land them what a bummer\nBut let's actually take a closer look at twenty sixteen 'cause this is where the problem was how were they twelve and for you take a closer look and you realize nine of those twelve wins we're by one possession or less\nThey played eight games all season against teams with a winning record\nThey played three playoff teams all year long\nAnd we're one in three because they played Kansas City twice the one when they had against the playoff team was the Houston Texans and rock off Wyler who was a disaster that season\nYou start to look around at some of the other close games that year opening week\nAgainst the New Orleans saints the raiders lose that game if they don't convert on a to point conversion late in New Orleans and then the saints missed a field goal as time was expiring\nYou look at another close game that we're a couple of weeks later at Baltimore they were trailing with under three minutes left to go in the game\nThere was another field goal game later in the year against the Carolina Panthers the raiders were trailing in the fourth of that game there was another field goal game against the awful than San Diego chargers that the raiders one on a Sebastian\n... field goal we overrated this team we completely misjudged the Oakland Raiders\nThink about it when do we get them\nOr rags and to our new lawyer John what are you going to have a\nWhen you say every day\n[noise]\n\nJonah\nJosh ... radio\nSomebody alive you are from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios I'm so there is a really really great thing and sports and it's great for everybody except for a certain group of people to groups of people\nIn the world of sports because it's absolutely miserable walks with that is coming up here momentarily here on Fox Sports radio also in about ten minutes from now you're on Fox Sports radio we will\nBe playing another edition of the game do you care which is ... becoming one of the highest rated segment on Fox Sports radio while it's on and nobody else\nIs hosting and nobody else's anywhere near the building so that is a\nGood thing for the show we'll take that as a when a there's a lot of buzz surrounding the name of Jonas all over social media\nI'm Jonah syrup go with a chip in winter for the Golden State warriors so now the hashtags Jonas I Believe is trending I always thought that when that happened at this time of night it would be because of this show [laughter] of course it's not of course why would it be right you know ask me why would it be\nA clay Thompson sent out the following tweet we can't confirm whether or not this is in reference to me\nOr if it's in reference to his teammate Jonas ... said the falling on Twitter\nThey didn't want your Jonas I'm just going to be humble and assume we talking about me and again that's just that's me rounding down that to me you know just being humble here I don't want to you know I'm not trying to make\nOurselves a game seven on Saturday Night the ...\nThe brewers where they convincing win in Milwaukee stave off elimination whatever the hell stave off means but I I heard somebody else uses I'm going to use it the brewers stave off elimination they take care of the LA Dodgers\nTying the CS it three games of peace and we move on to game seven coming up on Saturday Night\nI'm here's the best part about this\nIf you see you and you'll hear players say this when they talk about game sevens or they lose a an opportunity to close out a series of the Dodgers had an opportunity to close out the series and they were really feeling themselves\nA extra inning game that went late\nControversy mainly Machado a intentionally tripping over some guys foot at first base um than Cody Ballenger with a with an extra inning base hit and the Dodgers winning the game will walk off\nAnd everybody's stoked about it and everybody's excited in LA and then they come back and for some reason they play the game the next day at two o'clock local time which is a complete screw job\nOf the Milwaukee Brewers having a play a game on the road and then having to get back the next do your hotel and the next day you've got to play a two pm local star time game didn't make any sense to me and the Dodgers well not that one so the Dodgers are feeling themselves man and out here in LA nobody\nJust shows off their highs and lows this fans like Dodger fans do eighties amazing to see\nBecause you would assume when they were down to the one that it was over not only were they done not only were the play offs over not only was the season or rap they weren't going to move the team to Bangladesh you would assume that\nAnd they're sitting at three two and Dodger fans were all over social media all over with the hash tag last year it was this team I didn't even know what the dumb hash tag is this year the teams use hashtags\nIn the postseason irritate me we've gone over that before it bothers me a a will play that game at some point down the road where I Try and guess what hashtags belongs to which team 'cause none of 'em make any sense and so\nEvery everybody's excited out here in LA loving it man the Dodgers are back and then you go to friday night and the Dodgers get hammered I mean get hammered and the brewers left a bunch of guys on base and it probably should have been worse than what it was and so now we've got a game seven and so players will tell you\nIn a situation like that where they were\nUp three games to one and didn't close it out and now it's a game seven or they're up three to win didn't close it out and now it's a game seven they'll spin it and they'll say things like you know I mean listen if somebody told us before the season you'd have one game to win to go to the world series\nWe take that [noise] yeah that's good that's great for players that's great you know it sucks for brewers in\nDodgers fans especially Dodgers fans right now there's an old adage that the only thing worse than getting you're asked what just waiting for it to happen\nI'm telling you right now we're looking at\nAbout Eighteen hours until first pitch\nI'm telling you right now the next Eighteen hours are going to be here misery for Dodger fans and brewer fans and if you're one of either you know what I'm Talking about it's even worse for Dodger fans because they had it wrapped up they thought they were going to win it was done\nBrewer fans or at least going into their sleepless night with a little bit of hope Dodger fans have none of that\nAnd there is something to stress free sports there's something about it\nThere's something to not being a fan we all grew up with a team we all grew up with several teams a team in each sport and there's something about not being so committed and so dedicated to whatever your team is and you can just sit back and watch that's really enjoyable\nI mean it's really enjoyable look you can make fun of browns fans all you want you know what they've never had to worry about stressing out in the postseason\nThere's something to that there's something to\nHey you know I kinda know what my plans are each January and February 'cause they don't involve the playoffs I don't have to worry about going to watch my team there's something to do it no stress completely stress free\nBut those fan bases going up until first pitch at five ... local time here in LA and ... local time in Milwaukee this is pure misery\nMike mayor is a Cleveland Indians fan\nMike mayor two years ago when the Indians were up three one and they lost and it was three two and then it was three three how would you describe that time between the end of game six and first pitch of game seven for using Indians and um it felt\nLike a thousand years was miserable it's awful oh it was in the worst thing is about game sevens in the way baseball is structured is they do it the next day they don't even give you a day\nOff it that's what sucks yeah it's um now I Would I Would argue that that I Would rather have that than having to extend the misery for another day [noise] um but this entire time up at like no matter how how bad do you think things are right now you may have just walked into a bar\nAnd and and and costs your wife with another man okay and she completely lied to you and said she was going out with Megan\nYou're sitting there with a bottle of whiskey trying to think about what life's going to look like after this and I'm telling you you would rather be that than a brewer fan or a Dodger fan up until first pitch eighties miserable\nAwful it consumes every single thought tonight screwed you're not getting any sleep tonight\nThat's not happening and if you do you're not going to sleep well the euro try and get your mind off everything up until first pitch coming up that ain't happening good luck with that you can try and distract yourself do laundry go to the gym or whatever it is going to consume your thoughts\nAnd you almost wish she'd been eliminated earlier so you didn't have to deal with it you don't want such like bank my if I knew was going to come down this I mean it ... the ... when sixty games I'd rather have that and not having to worry about this\nLike it is consuming eight is stressful it each you up man I'm telling you there is something to stress free sports it's awesome it's great that you're teams in contention it's great that they got an opportunity to go to the world series\nBut you are now dependent on something that is completely out of your control [laughter] like it's completely out of your control you ever seen those nicotine commercials where the uh uh the woman walks into a liquor store\nOr or or the guy walks into a liquor store and they've got to pay for the pack of smokes [laughter] and so they like remove a body part to do so or they pull out a tooth\nBecause you're so committed to that one thing and it's completely outside of your control that's what it's like going into game seven when your teams playing for all the marbles and the national league or whatever to go to a World Series that's what it's like\nGet a life okay the bodies aren't even cold yet and you're already previewing what's happening down the road smell the roses enjoy the season stopped for speeding us these stories\nAlright last one here ah who was a big story early\nThey're cheating and then major league baseball rule that there were no violations in the matter was closer joined us do you care\nI Love

draft\nYou've got the first round picks a you traded or when you acquired or that you acquire from the bears in return for ... for for a little Mac\nSo it's a bad bad situation in Oakland no doubt about it they are bad football team and there it looks like they're only gonna get worse this season\nBut a lot of this is on us men are the only reason we expected the raiders to be good last year and to potentially be good this year is because of two thousand sixteen\nAnd I just think if you go back and you look at how many close games they were in the schedule they played their record against

games and there's like nine other one's going on\nNo no no no\nThe difference between having to sit on the top of your head and having one in the middle of your forehead on the top of your head it's covered up by hair in the middle of your forehead you looked like a ...\nDay Thursday Night Football for a bad NFL team is like the and the Cyclops everybody gets to see it\nEverybody gets to see how dysfunctional you are you can no longer hide you ever been talking real loud at a party all of a sudden it gets quiet\nThat's Thursday Night Football for a coach of a bad team you weren't just having the same conversation same conversation a second ago\nExcept now everybody stop talking and you're the only one and now everybody can hear what you're saying it's kind of awkward it's the difference between an argument with your girlfriend at home and one that's done in public\nYou can have the smallest disagreement it can be tightened just a tiny disagreement\nYou could have said something not even intentionally bad but it kinda rub gr the wrong way you can have that same conversation at home no big deal nobody sees it who cares all of a sudden now you're in public everybody can see it\nRoom full of people friends all the dinner table and now you guys are giving off the perception that you guys are an unhappy couple and all you do is fight\nThat's why I tell people don't only go to your friends for advice on your relationship\nOn your relationship when things are bad you know they're going to do\nAfter about the fourth time in two years they're going to say why even in it man like you said you guys are always fighting minute you're not always fighting you just\nOnly are showcasing the bad times\nLike\nIf you're mixed in with a bunch of other games nobody could see your flaws I don't mean come on I mean you're you're there's all sorts of stuff going on red zone channels not on your game\nPeople have no idea what's going on they're not paying attention to you the Arizona the Arizona Cardinals or a bad football team they're bad\nReally bad\nIt's not that much of a surprise though have you been paying attention I mean you watch them on Thursday night that game was over after about three minutes this terrible it was over\nAnd you don't know I Know the Arizona Cardinals were bad 'cause the Denver Broncos are bad too and they won by thirty five like\nThat was that was our prelude a two week seven with some good games coming up when we seven and the first thing we got the appetizer to the entree that is weak seven this weekend in the NFL\nWas dog vomit on a plate as or d'oeuvres while we get ready for the good stuff but here's the thing\nIf you've been paying close enough attention to the Arizona Cardinals if you're in Arizona cardinal fan out there and you're listening in the desert we got listeners an Arizona man we're big out there in fact we've been called the biggest sports radio show in Arizona if nobody else was on the air\nEver but if you're in Arizona Cardinals fan you know what's going on there often is disgusting Lee bad it's terrible\n\nScored six points through the first two weeks combined lake\nThere are converting twenty three percent of their third downs\nBy far and away the worst in the NFL in fact they went on a stretch to where they were old for Seventeen on third down like\nThat's almost impossible to do at no point there you couldn't have had like third and one with a quarterback snake you got one of the best running backs in the NFL certain to couldn't convert that baby either oh for Seventeen was the streak\nThey've been out scored forty nine to seven in the third quarter\nJust think about this you go in at half time you've\nJust seen what's happened the first half everybody makes adjustments everybody in the NFL makes adjustments in fact if you talk to people people and they discuss bill bell or check you know what they say that makes them different than in every other coach in the NFL he's better at making adjustments\nHe figures it out he's better\nAt adjusting to whatever it is that you're doing and coming back and figuring out how to overcome that and getting back into a game\n\nMember of the super bowl a couple of years ago how do they come back and beat the falcons adjustments so just think about how bad the cardinals are that after making all those adjustments and a half time they've been out scored forty nine to seven [laughter] third quarter I ate is\nShockingly bad uh the Arizona Cardinals we continue on the flaming vomit bomb that his ears on a cardinal off in the er thirty first in the NFL ahead of only the bills in passing yards for a game\nAnd passing yards per attempt gay so under six yards in\nIt's all about off and that's all about passing those are their numbers and oh by the way they're averaging Thirteen points a game [noise]\nUm the team at the top the saints are averaging thirty six [noise] like it it's unbelievably horrid often ... for the Arizona Cardinals\nBut if you've been watching the cardinals if you've been paying attention you knew all that what you saw Thursday night was nothing new the differences you actually saw it\nYou actually got to witness it so of course the Arizona Cardinals had to react to that and had to\nCome up with an excuse for why it is they've been so atrocious often so what do they do they fire their offices of coordinator MIke McCoy\nGone\nMy McCoy is the reason that the Arizona Cardinals couldn't figure it out and you could actually say to my ... one of the more unlucky coaches and in recent NFL history\nOf those six seven years source for stock in sports and the white now you're covering national and international news from ABC racy Leslie gets your day started early boxes Killeen is on the

was talking about this a little bit earlier\nAnd I think there's a deeper conversation to be had\nSo I was mentioning the news that came out on friday and it was more bad news for the team that's been dealing with a lot of bad news all throughout the course of the season\nAnd that team is the Oakland Raiders and so this news came out the Martian Lynch is going to be out several weeks who's got a groin injury or there's the possibility that he's going to go on and I are meeting season's over so the raiders are done\nThis season is finished it's over that they're bad um they were\nBlown out and completely embarrassed in London or they were in a lot of games early on they were closed and a lot of games but it just they weren't able to figure it out and now there are bad team um who's dealing with the injuries are who's just\nNot anywhere close to the team that they were a couple of years ago and that's really the problem\nBecause people look at this team\nAnd the expectations that you had for a raider team of a couple of years ago was based on one\nSeason and I mentioned this earlier like there was a joke out here in LA where\nKnow we all assumes because of that one year and twenty sixteen when the raiders one twelve and for that they were just the most stacks of all the teams that were going to relocate at the time\nSing futures of those three teams at the time the raiders would\nBe far and away above both of those teams\nBut\nWe had a joke out here in LA that of course of the three teams LA ends up with the two that have the least brighter future ah with with the diminished future moving forward because we all assume the raiders are gonna be great as it turns out it was completely the opposite\nThe rams are a monster the chargers are getting better and better and the raiders are getting worse\nBut that's why it goes into a deeper discussion with\nAlright what really was twenty sixteen because we actually go frame by frame and twenty sixteen which is what gave us all these expectations for this great future and there's this great roster of the Oakland Raiders you actually look at that season you realize oh\nYeah I mean they were twelve and four but nine of those were by one possession or less those games are all decided by one possession or more or less um you know they only had eight games against teams with a winning record they were one in three against playoff teams they're only when it was against ... Wilder who was atrocious that season\nUm you know they they want a couple a one point games in which they were trailing late one of 'em they went for two late which is why they won the game um they had a a a ... field goal was the difference in in several games that were ... like there was a lot of things that went the way of the Oakland\nAnd twenty sixteen that I think we all just assumed oh they're twelve and foreign they've got their car though they're they're fine the raiders man the more than we think about it maybe this is on us that we overvalued in overreacted to what the raiders really really were\nMaybe we'd just anticipated something greater than what we the evidence showed us\nStep back and realize you had this team wasn't exactly what we thought they were in twenty sixteen if that's the case and we can all agree that they weren't as good as that twenty sixteen team and that they weren't there's this great young roster that we all thought they were\nThen can we really put all the blame on John Gurdon for where they're at\nCurrently if if knowing now what we know and going\nBack and looking at what they really were a couple of years ago how much blamed is John groove and really deserve\nLike\nDo you still blame him for doing what he's done with the roster mean they're even accusing John Gurdon if tanking that was a conversation that came up this week that people are so oh John ... the other they're tanking here was Gordon\nHopefully this we're not taking anything and I are the hatred out there some of the rumors that were tank it has to get a first round thicker higher ... you know we're not getting up at four o'clock in the morning to tank and nobody taken it\nAnd who wrote that are who said that who thinks that but thanks a case here you know we're gonna continue to work hard continue to build our team and um that was that was part of the message\nNobody ever be able to prove that they're taking but if they were I wouldn't blame him I mean\nOn man like you got to be honest about this roster and you've got to be honest about what your expectations were like this is this is on us we all assume myself included and you included we all assume that they were the next big thing in the NFL because they had one good year do back and look\nThat wasn't just one big year that was one fluke here so our expectations were out of whack maybe John ... is the only one who saw this team for what they really were now the ... trade\nReports out there that will they can't afford they couldn't afford him you know they they just financially couldn't afford clue Mac they're broke I'm a you know there there there are completely broke there and and and and Mark Davis is is broke and he's the most broke owner in the NFL\nI talked to somebody who is connected to the raiders I had a conversation with them so it happened the raiders had a contract out there for a little Mac\nThere were an offer I'm about twenty million dollars\nWhat ended up screwing the raiders is when Aaron Donald signed his deal because once Aaron Donald signed his deal\nClue Mac and his representatives came back to the raiders and ask for more and they couldn't go any more and John Bruton didn't want the highest plate paid player on the team to be a non quarterback that's what happened\nIt wasn't they couldn't afford it it wasn't a John group and just being reckless with the franchise they had an offer out there and offer they felt was\nWas up to up to par an offer they thought was was a pretty good one and it was an errand Donald got his deal include Mac and his agent and his representatives came back to the raiders for a counter offer and they weren't willing to go that high\nSo like that whole narrative on on you know John grew in dismantling the roster and trading away a hall of famer it's not like he didn't make an effort to get him it's something you didn't make an effort to keep them around he did it\nBut the market balloons and it ballooned fast and they weren't willing to do that high and I think John crude and looked around and said All right with colonial Mac we're in non playoff team\nSo what's the difference between having them and not by twenty five\n\nLaugh\nCollege football\nWhen it goes down in Georgia rose you all talk about football for you like better we're the ones that you do\nSee a swat sports radio sports without I have\n... ... well you\nKnow I was going\nTo find out by sworn off your TV show to Fox Sports dot com or detail tap tap water\n\nDr Marshall was radio where you live from the guy go boxer shorts radio studios are so there is a\nCoach and the NFL that is hitching his wagon basically putting his career on in the hands of\nSomebody who's never done it before it's all explained that is here on Fox Sports radio a couple of minutes from now I hear all of us are also\nA a reminder we've got a something at the at about nine ten minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio in which we're going to discuss\nA couple of stories guaranteed right I don't promise you a lot\nBut I'm guaranteeing these stories will make you feel better about whatever the worst situation in your life is right as we shine a spotlight on some of the biggest losers you've ever heard of in your life right so that I was so stick around for that that is coming up ten minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio\nUh speaking of losers that a a a guy\nThe meat heads and there was a video attached I opened the video and the video was a guy attacking his buddy\n\nWith a sex toy and using using it like a one of those inflatable hammers you get it a county fair if you make a three three shots ah at the basketball hoop if you make three shots at a five you get like one of those inflatable hammers\nI'm using a using a sex toy and chasing his friend around a parking lot\nWith it you know that item\nThat was thrown onto the uh Buffalo Bills field the bill do a one of those\nExcept uh um it looks like a a a Wiffle ball bat with a little bit of gifts to it\nSo ah [noise]\nAh so apparently that's our audience that's our crowd that is what has been sent over a very [laughter]\n[noise] oh that uh we have somehow got to figure out a way to invent the breathalyzer for people listening to the show to where you can only listen to this show if you blow into a breathalyzer and it's above one point five because if you do that\nThen it'll unlocked the heart radio lab and then you'll become a qualified listener somehow we've got to figure that out\nLike set some out on a on a so\nThere is a you know we were talking about the John Gurdon situation and Oakland ... going to take the brunt of it he's going to get killed for it but the difference between John ... and other coaches he's got a ten year deal is not going anywhere right don't don't buy the crap that ... gone this is a a long term play\nAnd to somebody who's never done it before is a coach in Arizona so I was mentioned this earlier that the only people that dislikes Thursday Night Football\nMore than the actual players in the game or the coaches for bad teams because we're a coach of a bad team all your flaws are exposed on Thursday Night Football\nI mean the Arizona Cardinals are terrible\nThere often says terrible that the only difference between what's happened already in the season and what happened on Thursday night as you actually got to see it so of course the overreact and I want to say overreact but they react to it\nAnd the Arizona Cardinals decided to fire there often some coordinator MIke McCoy on friday\nSo here's where this gets interesting because it all ties to Josh Rosen and Josh Rosen's future\nSteve Wilkes that had coaches in a bad spot he is a coach of a bad football team and the coach of a football team who looks like they don't know how to protect the quarterback Josh Rosen's already banged up right but ... and a tough spot because of this look around the league\nWhat are you seeing in the league that's had a a certain amount of success over the past couple of years young quarterbacks who get hitched up with often said minded had coaches\nAnd if they have a little bit of success that's going to be the copycat portion of the NFL for this window they usually lasts about two three years similar to the wildcat civil the mobile quarterback\nThe NFL has their fads everybody copies it tries to emulate it everybody tries to have success but really only there a couple of make it but it doesn't stop teams from trying everybody in the NFL does it\nShawn McVeigh has made it really really difficult to be a defensive minded coach\nBecause ... broke Jared God's will get the guy who had no business being in the NFL shared golf didn't even suit up the first game of the season and he was the number one\nPick playing behind case keen on him and Sean man and he couldn't crack the top fifty three he looked great look done he was embarrassing\nThe rams are embarrassing it was terrible terrible look you look bad on hard knocks you didn't know which way the sun rose each more like it was it was a bad look for Jared Goff your Gostin the MVP discussion less than two years later\nThe customers and BP like he did he look broke two years ago but Sean McVeigh has done such a good job but now everybody's copying the rams\nThey look the eagles also are trying to do the same thing while the eagles were kind of around the same time but look at Chicago Bears one out got to have an off into my head coach Matt negative got around turnaround mixture risky that's the plan like that's the move now\nAnd if Trump is key turns around and as a great year and he's already on pace to\nIt's only going to continue so Sean McVeigh has made it really difficult for a defensive minded coach trying to be a head coach\nAnd that's what Steve Wilkes is\nAnd all they got to do is look in their own division at ... at at a at a situation right now and actually two situations if you will look in their own division and they see Shanahan in San Francisco and McVeigh in LA\n\nAnd so you'll get Josh Rosen the guy's got a lot of talent he threw a passing the first half that was pretty thrown ball as you'll as you'll see anywhere the spin on the ball was beautiful\nCardinals is the worst off into the line in the league they're the worst so Steve Wilkes a first time head coach in a defensive\nMinded head coach he's already got that working against him in a rookie quarterback who can't stay healthy and one of the worst off fences in in the NFL in in in an off ... era Steve Wilkes his now depending on the first time off sensitive coordinator in Byron left which\nIn order to potentially saved his job that is a bad spot to be in in this day and age of the NFL where it's all about a fence\nAnd your go to to potentially save your job is a coordinator who's never coach to that high of a level oh and trying to do it with the worst off into line in the league\n[noise] [laughter] I don't even make they is made the\n... the head coach in position for a defensive minded guy almost impossible because everybody is going to think it's a quick fix it's not the offensive line is is terrible that's where the real problem starts\nCan't keep the quarterback healthy not enough time to throw the ball like David Johnson you can't do anything with him he's one of the best taxing the league but because of\nSuccess ... is head it's going to go all back to that\nHe also had a T shirt that said blank when police arrived at his home [noise]\nA man in Virginia was busted for stealing twenty right foot shoes from a store this year and he also had a T shirt that said blank when police arrived at his home [noise]\nSo clearly we know this is not a story about Iowa Sam clearly that at the\nIowa sandwich you like to fill in the blank fleas or I'm going to say\nHe had kind of an ironic T shirt on and it said a left you do it right\nAbout that\nA ... a bunch of red shoes\nYou're such an Earth Day I'd love to do right okay\nAll right Mike berry you want to fill the void please a make America great again I'll come on\nMy way or the railroad your\nYour last match came after dark and you gotta you gotta bring up\nThe Trump ... on the same segment I got to go and I got to go out with a bang man but Jesus so we don't want to go you know we don't want to talk\nPolitics on the show are somebody with a lot of room talk with a mega with America had according to our maggots shirt according to my married let's see if anybody got the point you're a match game after dark\nA man of Virginia was busted for stealing twenty right foot shoes from a store this year all sweaty T shirt that said\nCall my lawyer when police arrived at his home mad no point but how about\nThe balls on that guy uh first of all\nWhat a weirdo why is he going around steel and just a rightfully choose\nMultiple times you broke into this place by the way yeah what what's what's happening like deep twenty I think twenty like three separate occasions guy broken into the same place as an archaeologist out there to disrupt the system that would piss me off though if I tried on a pair of left footed shoes and I said God these are these are great and I see these and an eight\nNo we can't okay what about uh eight and a half now out of those too\nAnd I know\nWhat about uh fourteen nope why we're missing one half of all those by me off I guess this is an archaic well put Iowa Sam ... the last one here on ...\nIn Iowa\nWas arrested after going on a rampage in a hospital where he was being treated for blank [noise]\nEight twenty six year old in Iowa was arrested after going on a rampage in a hospital where he was being treated for blank [noise]\nMike that night mayor\nFinal time filling

partly to blame for it and your partly to blame for it as well too and I think at least acknowledging what it is that we did wrong in our part in the unraveling of it\nAnd and he'll and recover from the damage that it's done because as it stands right now there is somebody who has taken a beating for the status of an NFL franchise that somebody is John Gurdon\nAnd I was mentioning this before that\nWe are partly to blame in a couple of areas when it comes to the demise of the Oakland Raiders or the status of the Oakland Raiders or how bad the Oakland Raiders are because they are the butt of every joke in the NFL\nI'm John ... gets mocked and ridicule that every single press conference\nAnytime he mentions not having a pass rush or somebody goes\nBut you're on a job in Detroit you\nKnow that same tired actor tired routine that people's view out on social media\nAnd so John ... getting all the heat he's getting ready for it and so the news comes out that Martian Lynch is is is possibly done for the year it's another blow in a series of blows in a bad season for the Oakland Raiders and I think\nThat if you actually look deeper\nIt's our expectations that got us to this point with the raiders because\nThe only reason we all assume that the raiders were the next big thing in the NFL is based on one\nSeason so the story is in two thousand Eighteen for the raiders this story really is twenty sixteen\nWhen the raiders were twelve and for when the raiders went to the playoffs when the raiders suffered a terrible break no pun intended\nTo Derek ... their car and had\nTo go into battle with Conor cook against the Houston Texans\nCame out today but they're built for the future this seems built to last to get a franchise quarterback they've got an elite pass Russia they got an a superstar wide receiver this team's built to last\nOut here in LA we weren't pissed off three teams are relocating we got the two worst chargers in rams\nThe team that was on the rise as the raiders we were so pissed man we can't even get that right ... luckily lucky for Vegas\nBut the fact is we all assume that this team was great because of one season and now when you have a little time to reflect\nAnd you have a little time to look deeper into things you realize yeah twenty sixteen wasn't all it was cracked up to be you see the raiders were twelve and for that year\nNine of their twelve wins we're what by one possession or less in fact there were a couple of games that they won by appoint a single point week one against the saints how did the raiders win that game or they went for two late\nFlip a coin a couple of weeks later one in Baltimore\nBut they were trailing late night game in fact the raiders only played eight games all season against teams with a winning record they played three playoff teams that year\nThere were a one in three because they played Kansas City twice or oh and they lost the Kansas City both times\nBut they did beat ... while they're in the Texans you don't ... the same guy who was a disaster he was one of the laughing stocks that year of the NFL because he was a member of the Houston Texans and he took all that money to go to Houston and he burned the Denver Broncos and as it turns out he stunk up the joint\nThat's on us we overrated the raiders\nI always say when we go get the most disappointed in life when our expectations are way too high for things it's the difference between getting flakes on\nBy somebody who's dependable and getting flake down by a flake you expect it when it's a flake you bake that into whatever your ... thought processes up upon their arrival time or when they're going to show up or if they're actually going to show up\nA Mike says she's going to be here by thirty but you know it's my kill probably nine Fifteen or ten o'clock\nBut when there's so many dependable who doesn't do that in our expectations are really really high that it hurts the most our expectations were way too high for the raiders that was a fluke here\nWe assumed they were the next big thing but if he actually took a deeper dive you realize a lot of things went there a way that year and so now John Gurdon\nIs the guy getting the blame for because John Bruno how dare he trade away ... Mac yeah man how dare he trade away that guy you know the guy that they offered a boatload of money too and they thought they had a deal done and all of a sudden the air and Donald signed his contract and the raiders came back for more and then they decided yet we can't go\nThat high so they traded him away\nBecause the way John crude and looked at it won't mean if we're not going to be a playoff team with ... do we keep them around when I can actually cash in and make some you know get something back\nFor a guy in his prime\nYeah but it is as Reggie McKenzie is guys like he's going after Reggie McKenzie is guys before John Gurdon got their Reggie McKenzie said five years with the raiders organization they were thirty six\nAnd sticks the boy what a group of guys that is\nWe were wrong about that I think we just really really were happy to have the raiders back and I'm guilty of a two\nBook man [noise]\nI don't hide it\nI Am raises the rebellious attitude of certain at\nMe from sees Conor McGregor so Nick Saban all of our favorites\nHere on the show all have a common denominator and says with a B sometimes they're in a ... and the raiders had a reputation and growing up [noise] you always heard about the old school later was violent they were called they weren't edgy dorms the greatness of the\nRaiders native rebellious owner who fought against the NFL time and time again [noise] demanded more respect to the NFL\nTook him to court when it was a ...

[laughter] ... cardinals again for free that was terrible and awful football game\nUm so I acknowledge that um your ... going on\nAnd I was more into LeBron James is debut at the Lakers and I wasn't anything else\nLike I said it didn't matter like ... Thursday night game could have been a great game I probably would have still lean towards LeBron James and the Lakers and I was totally hypnotized by the NFL because I poke fun at the end at the MBA um I I ... and and I poke fun at what they do and I was hypnotized by the NBA in this regard because\nThey try and throw out all these garbage stories\nI mean we've got the season underway and all the talk by some people try and force feed you these stories are or what about showing show who may go to the Knicks at the end of the year oh what about nuts free agency Kiss My asked what about this season it's not even under way and you guys are already talking about which to super stars are going to team up for the Knicks\nI ... ... what are we doing\nAll right do you have that little confidence in your regular season that you're only focused on the off season\nBut man all the talk during the off season all the hype about LeBron James and the Lakers it worked\nI cared more about that than I did Thursday Night Football or the American league championship series which was the deciding game in which Boston went on to the world series\nAnd both of those played second fiddle and third fiddle\nTo the NBA which was LeBron James making his debut for the Lakers\nAnd it was all that hype that I didn't think we had an impact on me and it\nDid\nIt's it's great for the NBA cars look I poke fun at the MBA because of the the the\nDrama it's over the top it's ridiculous but I also do it because look let's have an honest conversation about it\nI think there are some really good reporters an analyst to cover the MBA and then I think there are a lot of fan boys and girls\nI mean a lot of pom pom waivers\nA uh a lot of uh a lot of uh\nPeople out there who are hoping that they get daft up at shoot around are hoping they get a get a follow on Twitter by some NBA star\nOf the game seven of you know so yes for the Dodgers\nI Would imagine that would have a little bit more important\nThan the game number two of which will be many of the brawn James playing in the Los Angeles Lakers uniform I understand the significance of it as a star player in the city of LA but it's the second game of the regular season versus the opportunity to go to the fall classic I don't see how there's much of a comparison so if it were me and say I couldn't go to a sports bar\nI Would have oh I have my eyes trained and focus on each and every pitch in Oso yes well periodically checking in to see what's going on with the Lakers\nYeah but ... it's LA man you know we've been here our entire lives uh they have an affinity for new and shiny thing this is true and that's LeBron and this team could be\nFor one eighty one and this is their last chance to win a game and I I think there's going to be a large portion that are are going to be so in tune with that and ... it's the first game and if the Dodgers are getting\nBlown out at that point oh yeah uh all all\nThe bandwagon Dodger fans are going to go ahead and turn those a Dodger hats inside out and trying to turn into Laker fans all of a sudden a it's a great fan base but you know this ... and look I was making this a seeing this earlier\nNobody goes from high to low faster than Dodger fans of anybody I've ever seen to where they were mad it was over and they were cocky and we've had crickets since\nLocal affiliate I Know how it goes up some NFL or the Jacksonville Jaguars lived a pretty charmed life last season not so much this year they've been struggling\nLast through the last four and got absolutely both raised by the Dallas Cowboys last week in a big reason why that is the fact that little for another place in week one\nThey're going to be out again this week as the nurses that hamstring injury um I don't know if there's any way any light at the end of the tunnel for the Jacksonville Jaguars this season if so it might be a train coming but obviously all come on disappointing I'm Sorry I'm just being honest just be an artist Jonas ... obviously a disappointing season for people for a team people about what's going to take a next step\nAnd they were taking about what three or four steps backwards more there were last year\nUm ... I mean they're tied with Tennessee in Houston\nTennessee is so bad yeah mark is Mario that stinks sorry guys that I and I know we can make as many excuses one he's not very good Houston's got no business being three in three I still think Jacksonville is going to win the division that most disappointing part of all this is now ... and talking\nTo solve the book I mean if you're not doing that what's the point man like nobody nobody goes to see a comedy special and the comedian just doesn't tell jokes like if I'm going to see Andrew dice clay\nI'm going there to see some of the rhymes I I'm not I'm not going there to have them read poetry yeah come on man like your jak wars nobody's going there for ...

anyway let's I don't know [laughter]\nHow was it\nWas short man game it was horrible but maybe a game was horrible and the experience to London was cool man a lot of rated nation people are like ... like to do something out to the silver and black faithful that made the trip over there I Know you were not pleased with the best game but thanks for coming out and it was there was cool man it was cool\nAll right well I did a little bit you got in on one day\nWe left the Oakland Thursday night at eight o'clock we got into London friday afternoon at one thirty\n... the man yeah she was late like at the veer these coaches are dumb I Swear to God why you're going over ... the body changes way too drastic you got to get these guys more more time to acclimate\nWhat I I Believe that for the main reasons [laughter] you'll hear the funny thing is um when I went on a went to a little party a friday night and then after we got there and then sleep on a plane 'cause I Can't sleep on planes\nAnd so um the the layout was for the players ... charter virgin Atlantic\nAnd they put all the players in the sleepers in the first class cabins so there had to be about fifty fifty because there is on average forty people in that they're out there\nSo that would be about fifty um sleepers all the players that sleepers than the coaches and the administration had everything else in the back the plain states probably over three hundred um and there were only a hundred and Seventy\nPeople on there including seems to happen everybody's going over there so you had room but people like me who cannot sleep on planes it wasn't\nI'm not exaggerating that I think I went to bed probably around twelve thirty London time I didn't wake up till three in the afternoon the next day\nHoly moly yeah\nI I mean I slept through the whole date and you had your your body had needed the rest I wake up yep\nSo that was just saying why didn't you guys why are they so stubborn ... time change is real fatigue the raiders looked like there was like\nThe whole game yeah look they look very they looked like they were sluggish the different space now she conversely Seattle got in the day before\nThe writers that Seattle last Wednesday night gotten Thursday and you know you know for what it's worth you know Seattle or you know there were a number of intangibles in the game but Seattle looked fresher than\nThan hasta yeah how's the party\nParties were great man London's ... you know live there I mean look London you already know this ... you've you've been\nYou've been the mind then right yeah yeah London's a beautiful city beautiful city I mean I like it it's one of those New York yeah it's it's those major metropolis is around ... London is like New York or Paris or you know the Tokyo I mean you've got these major cities these utopias\nWherever I mean urban utopias where everything is everything you know and it's a city that never sleeps to London was great itself the weather was beautiful friday and Saturday\nOr Sunday had rain them typical over whether but you know for the most part of the weather held up\nThat's nice that's nice yeah just she was such a quick turnaround because usually on Saturday yeah exactly I mean they didn't like the one that's going to\nSay they play the game on Sunday and then we could we flew back right after the game got back in Oakland at four thirty am the following their\nYou left some day and they get back on a trip that as you get back four thirty in the morning Monday morning yup yup\nFly home yeah with with that Seattle to you because that's where I was even a game\nAnd I wasn't even it wasn't again for the most part here's the thing there are there there are a number of people that I've talked to throughout the week that want to know what's going on I before for well I mean when you talk about the details ...\nThe fact is the writers have three first year players in her office in life so it's going to you're going to have to if you're John Gurdon us off and you're going to have to get creative you're gonna have to move the pocket you're going to do things differently because you cannot stand bacteria and expect protection hold up\nThey they ended up one match protection which is seven and protection which means you're only basically had two to three guys out routes Seattle just played Zalmay bracket at the top receivers and they they played everything else like everything else underneath you're not going to live on like that\nNow you know you know you can't ... and ... and that's a huge problem with them the problem is is that they can't protect car no car is car puddles when there's pressure yeah and that the effects lax teeth yeah\nOther than that it's all good golf now [laughter] you put it that way one is five and a nothing good about it [laughter] why lord show I got to ask these questions do you ... it grew Nevin buyer's remorse\nNo no because I still feel that grew in trying to put his own stamp on this team ... trying to prove that his way now for what it's worth for the average raider fan they're not going to be happy with because it hasn't translated wins you know and I told you just like when we were talking about chip Kelly back in the day when it comes to the players and fans that we don't care what you do as long as you when\nYou won one game so far not the season you expect it not the season I expected either\nIt's true um yeah it's true it's\nBut you expected him to build on it now I\nKind of terror back down because down it just feels like it there down job well I mean that's it I mean and of course the you like I said when in my talks with people people feel as though he's taking\nYou know think because you ... when it's not it's not unusual for us to save as we've seen it in other sports who's doing it in basketball we seen it in other sports so why wouldn't it why wouldn't you try to get the first guy that I have nothing wrong with that and I know of course she didn't city of ... love loves the tank so I'm\nLike I'm a\nYeah I Do listen to like get it\nOr I get it\n... was one that translate into wins that's all good and that's all yeah but I expected to I mean I think they'd be too good to tank\nWell I mean I thought they would be better than theirs as well I mean of

I mean it it really makes you hard the hard to beat because you're chasing it from behind their officers want to score\nYou see what I'm saying so even if their defense as an as an as capable as it's been in the past and we know how to how that is with saving the teams like that in the I don't see how I don't see their them losing\nYeah I Know and they have tendency today and I'm thinking that because there's some good games Michigan Michigan State yeah today Michigan only\nOne loss Oklahoma only won the Clemson\nThey got a pet Tennessee TCU yes you're right you have a Washington Colorado today which is in the ... all the ... beans like you said and she stayed in clubs in what does that mean the that these two teams like I look at ... and I and I'm underwhelming by Clint\nAs you should be a\nBecause they had there hasn't been in the span of in comparison to Alabama doesn't stand out even close I don't think there's any one that's in the same picture unless maybe he said Georgia if you want to throw that out there that that compares Alabama\nYeah yeah I I I I don't I don't see it of course the big one of the pack twelfth night with Washington state and Oregon that are right here on Fox will be incredible with uh people flocking to Pullman\nAnd there's a state of emergency in Pullman which is really kind of cool because everybody's freaking out there ah there is a a it's a big deal\nI won't get into all that but next I Need to touch on\nThe association\nBecause it has returned\nWe had a great time in London and you'll be freaky this is the most Ricky thing I've ever seen in the NBA and not in a good way right and it has to do in Minnesota so we'll we'll touch on that next we're the bell is right here\nOn Fox Sports radio [laughter]\n[noise]\nThe place it makes you rise out of your chair\n[noise] you know\nThis is why you know what we are and how\nWalk sports radio\nMexican interests may apply\nWhen did it become OK for men to be lazier softer fatter we need to bring them into this country back to greatness and it's easier than ever with age list male Macs a patent pending formula with an ingredient that helps boost your total testosterone\nPromoting greater increases in muscle size and twice the reduction of body fat percentage that exercise alone\nPlus an amazing sixty four percent increase in nitric oxide which can be handy in the gym and in the bedroom take your manhood to the max by try your first thirty day bottle free shipping and handling not ten days not Fifteen days for the full thirty days supply free when you text the word\nMad to Seventy nine Seventy nine Seventy not\nFinally a formula that boost total testosterone if you'll results with ageless male Macs are too intense please decrease use for your free bottle text\nMad to Seventy nine Seventy nine Seventy nine text M.

Tuesday night Sixers Celtics now my Sixers are back so you know I feel about my Sixers\nShow the Sixers Celtics It's Tuesday night and then Wednesday and\nThe rest of the early ... and and then Thursday night it was a mother double header Sixers bowls and then reporting on was on in Portland I watched that one that one like I was out quickly on average only Denver Thursday night\nAverage only ever was such a bad game oh by the way Josh ... she I'm never drastic quarterback with small hands [laughter] I've told you before about the hands thing yeah yeah I I this Josh rows and\nHe he can't hold them accountable\n... how about that I rent a lemon which\nHe ... he he put the ball and the carpet like five times\nWell I'll tell you what the second pick six thirty through the Chris Harris junior was was bad play because he was supposed to take the out\nAnd I don't know what mistake I'm told him to take this the the the the slant route because the receiver was only run into pick route he wasn't really running around so that I I I give I give battle and put him on a put that on him\nHe had no business throwing that ball that was the ... the first one was a tip ball which you can say really wasn't his fault he could've ... you know man of the line\nI don't I don't hear here's the thing I don't know how to why where\nHe's a while I don't have a problem with small hands I just have a problem with your eye on what's going on here and I don't like it a lot of lot of I don't like a lot of the picks their cars thrown because it hasn't been a smart decision it's not like the other players\nReally made a play is the fact that you you put the ball jeopardy is way you don't do that for your quarterback amount of small and look at your lawyer or they\nMorale and you're out for me uh he's out you're out out for me I like big heads right Mike\nHe liked those big hands yeah you've got your hands been yeah fourth quarter buying me yes totally a but the one thing I had to ask you guys 'cause you know you guys are talking about like how bad the office of line is how bad your eyes Rosen is\nBut what about the head coach because they know Thursday night like this ... this was a bad game like this is a really bad game and it was so bad that people are watching the bronze debut because obviously it's called ...\nAnd you're also watching a game five of the L. C. as with the red Sox and the ashes but\nIf you were watching that game and you're seeing how the coaching staff is and they fired my McCoy yesterday\nHow long this Steve worldwide she'd had good luck and vibrant life yeah good luck white Byron language but how long this Steve Wilk staff because I don't know how the court the dead man walking no you know he's going to be done at the end of the season but\nTime deal like the fact that this was on Thursday night and they're playing another bad team and they get boat raised by thirty five points like\nThat's not good well here's here's what where his which after taking consideration generally coaches don't get fired after the first year I'm not saying that's unheard of a generally they don't [noise] I Do believe this that when you talk about the Arizona Cardinals\nAnd you talk about their future there are a lot of things they need to pay attention to\nMost importantly they've got their quarterback they feel for the future but they've got a lot of holes that has a film and then and this division I don't think I think we'll survive this is what I'm saying even even if they don't you know if they if they can't get any more games winning more games\nWind you really your throat and you throw the whole it earlier I don't care about anything they look like a well I mean that's that's why that here's here's the thing I Believe that the ... fire was something that was handed down from the ever ministries in doing it right now\nYou have to make a change right now because you generally don't fire coaches in in in that early and that he was from\nWhat I hear you yeah not requiring going in the eighties and yeah that's ... like you never see that you're not\nYou're not going to fire him during the season but at the end of the year there's been vote one and done and I got that having them as pets germ or in New York\nYeah Don oh man that's the one that seems there's bad coaches man back\nIf you don't have it I I won't even waged a novice jacket like I go out I'm moving on I I don't even know why you would wait another second we're patch Irma\nYeah when I mean I'll say this like and I know this has been bringing my browns fan sand them into this whole thing I mean if if your Jackson doesn't get it together like he's going to be out of a job there too 'cause I think he's been a dead man at a dead men walking for a while I yeah but it's not his fault it's not it's not really his fault but at\nWait a minute hold on hold on how is it not his fault but it's ... the works well and their their first year in in the organization or one guy that you you can't here's his first year\nPlanes team yeah but that gave me the chargers was John okay oh it's All right I think that we went one game but they've been in every game on unlike years passed because they have a quarterback and they're building something they're actually they're actually playing teams tough well I I\nAt the other reason why I think he might be in some trouble because you know you know how it goes in the NFL like when the new GM comes and they want to have their own\nGuy and I think what happened with Hugh Jackson getting this opportunity to stay on one side she probably got fired is has many ownership just didn't want to have it and it's like\nIf they don't want a certain number of games and I know it's completely unreasonable because there are very young team and they've just made a big trade yesterday with\nCarlos Hyde but if things don't work out you could conceivably like I've I've been hearing people talk about this and I know it's it's kind of\nOut there there's some there's some names in college that really are interesting to me that could potentially come into play because you see looking to move on already yeah yeah 'cause it violates yeah I I mean look\nAnd we got into a little bit of a discussion about coaches or to stay in through ... through this right let that go through\nBecause reaching that point of whether or not you would swing voter yeah All right well\nWhat happens more than they should be at least you got to wait to the halfway point before you see someone that alright\nOkay well let's let's do it All right like will go through what you say ... everybody then for you\nI I don't know I mean what about everybody is that right now I I don't I don't you\nTell me whether or not this guy's this scene is warm or hot right\nOr you just you know they don't know what I'm with you know I'm I'm a little exercise let's do it because I I I got I got to Mike ... looking at college groups like who do you want Mike ... Jackson\nI'm ... from what I've heard and the names that are really intrigued me Lincoln Riley I Know it would be different from going from Oklahoma\nTo Cleveland but even Oklahoma\nThe reason why the ... the reason why it's interesting and the reason why I think the browns will definitely explored if they get rid of ... Jackson is this is what's gonna happen in the NFL for the next\nCouple of years you're going to see you guys like you saw it with the bears with ... they go with the office of guy who's an offensive coordinator who's called place it started with John ... this is going to be a trend in the NFL if you've got a good young quarterback like it's going to happen with the Wilkes like it's going to ... it's going to happen because even though Josh Rosen\nHasn't looked good the office of lines terrible you got to bring in an offensive guy who's younger who has\nGot over that until there is no other\nOfficers of guys out there right exactly yeah that yeah I mean 'cause it'll do I not everybody McVeigh right no exactly but like I was saying it's it's going to last for a while because everybody's going to try and emulate that\nNow without your child I was just what Lincoln Riley is not going to ... yeah I ... I mean you're you're you're you're up there for like ... year right yeah he's gotta you gotta go in and try to compete for national championship\nHe's got a big one that I get ... you're on the road I picky when I went to Raleigh or what\nPercentage you haven't really accomplished anything either yeah and I just want to well it's a pie in the sky\nLittle theory just because like I've heard that they would be a huge would you want well yeah of course because it's like 'cause bigger Mayfield had\nBut he was the highest efficient even the most efficient pass or in college and one Heisman Trophy and was in college football myopic twelve right yeah I mean it's like it's like I said you you get these things and like look I\nI I it's it's because of this whole thing with the Jackson and it's not your ... and look you're right and some of it is not his fault but at the same time there's been some coaching decisions that he's made in some gay guy I Know you're a browns fan\nStarted off to start off um and that's the west I sew nightmares Dave Ramsey stay Seattle Pete Stark her to go anywhere like I don't like the I I I still\nI mean if he got hit ... last year of his contract is great so I mean I've been here I've been here since speculation that he just he might just walk down entire game I retire and just leave because\nWhat I mean especially now the last fall and I mean I think we're going to turn over the world and Paul Allen ...\nLeads you to boom I Know the lead you to prove like did the whole thing's come and do all of a or the end so he could he could I'd like to eat a lot of most of the Arizona we just talked about Wilkes and whether or not\nThey just look like they can't compete they're terrible\nOn it's not even just a Thursday night game it's not always every game they scored I think they scored six points in their first two games and the thing that the thing that drives me the most nuts I mean I don't know that oh him ... own him personally and fantasy but if you're a David Johnson odor and fantasy\nYou every time you're looking at the ... you you got to be wanting to throw something because it's it's infuriating how they're using him I I you know the fantasy thing\nYou've got to stop or well well I I'm just out of ... but the point at the okay come on my little brother [laughter] I had to bring that in there about the the the ... I got no sympathy for fans to the point that I'm trying to make is when you have great players like that you get them the ball and they weren't getting him the ball\nLike David John swallowing nothing Wasik marine oil in the street right here\nHere's here's the thing when it comes to coaches I've always I've always believed that the head coach is supposed to help create your team's identity works as a defense is decent defence of mind to coach can be in the corner coming from Carol in Carolina Panthers and I didn't know much about him when he got the gig I live in Phoenix and and\nAfter the first year because they've got too many holes\nAnd if they if they believe they've got their franchise language I rose and they've done [laughter]\nLot of holes in the desert a lot of holes in the desert but I mean you know the whole thing is though the whole thing was it about creating identity he's supposed to be the sense of mine because they have yet to create their own identity owner although they're twenty fourth and defense and they've got to be better so you don't know what they're doing on defense you know what they're doing an on it so you haven't made a\nMom I wear boots on okay I I I for the record I Would move on I don't know why you would stay with his swimming coach he's just swim it's given\nBegins subtle our one can do it or not I can guess out here All right uh let's\nMove on the NFC North everybody looks good shake lines are new bears what good the ... ah the Packers now here's an interesting conundrum because let's say two stern I got I got news for\nI I think I'm ready to move on if this year\nAnd the way I think it's going to end and the way it looks to me there ... fetch Asian any good they are the same team relying solely on our Roger\nI I think I'm ready to go before Aaron Rodgers the yard and I need a new voice because that voice that McCarthyism it's out working wow so I Would move on wow why\nThere in second place right now isn't I did they pay the disappointment ever since they won the Superbowl they win the super bowl and then they just lose they lose to the Giants' ... the year after\nWhich I don't even know at home in ...\nThe effects is terrible I mean the niners if if the\nMatters to defend their side lives they might win the game now Beau\nMonday Night\nI Know I ...

I think I put the majority of the onus on at times in the front office for not putting a top notch defense around them because then they want us to have bought\nTheir anymore do you think I just I think yes fear of horrible\nHeat they ... they have always said the best he's better than braid I'm Sorry are raised you Rogers is the best quarterback ever I agree I I I really believe that as far as the skill sets concern no ... percent of rain this coach wasted him wasted them see I don't know if there's been\nCoaching blunders I Would blame their ... and the whole season\nHas been for Salk team Rogers that would be he says\nI mean on a journal Alison and a bunch of I mean what are we talking about here to hear that ... yeah\nYou're a coach in the NFL for Thirteen Years on the same\nTeam and you get to one the Superbowl and you haven't been back and you went to the super bowl in two thousand ten and one and you haven't been back there since the closest you've been was in the championship game twice when you've got both raised in one you should have one and you play the game and\nHere from all that was supposed to his\nFault he didn't but the but the point that I'm making is that\nYou look at how\nAaron Rodgers even he's making a voice and he's taking subtle dig\nAt Mike mccarthy and\nYeah ... ... go back to playing D play music garage [laughter] whatever music we got I got my sitar and hear how 'bout that are good go through that go through that for yourself a brown and be quiet right what's a brown I dunno I mean\nA clash of whiskey whiskey course at around ... brown alright alright I guess you've made your wife is dirty the brown do you not listen to the show I'm here baby I'm listening\nMike can you please stay\nI Wish I could mad and I mean one of these white [laughter] you can't leave it would just do them that got figure still here yeah I mean figure you'll keep him on line but man yeah yeah we see today and you are [laughter]\nYou are ...

I don't know how they operate but uh the you know that's that's the millennials and so when I Move\nMy wife and I are going to handle setting up the kitchen the dining room but it's a long process right when you move across the country or even if you're moving your own town think about the last time you moved it's always been a major headache for me and the problem is moving is a process that doesn't take days it doesn't take weeks it takes months\nAnd when I'm watching the Lakers Thursday night\nInstantly I'm like man they they got the talent they got the depths\nI Love this roster but this is going to take a while and I talked to a movie um\nUp next thing you know your two months in and you've got about a bunch of pictures laid out like I Do in my office right now after two years they're still not hung up because maybe the dresser needs moving right\nUh that you know the chauffeur is not an optimal spot for hosting gatherings moving takes a while and and that's what the LeBron and the Lakers are going to be dealing with\nFor a little while though the winds are not going to come overnight\nAnd that's why I was so surprised friday you know obviously after a big LeBron debut I mean and if you're already sick immigrant folks this is a generational athlete you're probably a guy who would have been sick of Michael Jordan back in the day but you've got to really soak it up because when these stars are gone\nOh we don't know how much longer LeBron's got three four years maybe\n... you're gonna miss them so really enjoy and now that he's here and I I gotta tell Laker fans you got to be a little patient\nOkay everybody on friday on the TV shows are saying well the Lakers are ... and they're going to win about forty three that's not the right analysis their way off\nI'm going to actually give you some things right now that you can use talking points for what's really going on with the Lakers okay the number one thing is have you looked at the schedule\nEight of the first eleven games are against playoff teams from last year eight of eleven and the ninth game is against Denver who they they miss the playoffs in the final night of the regular season okay the schedule for the Lakers out of the gate is absolutely brutal\nAnd it's especially rough when you've got three new starters LeBron roe John Rhonda who is tremendous against Portland and vale McGee who's also a very good\nBut you got three new starters and two of their top five reserves lent Stevenson who you know I'm not going to sell him after one game but cheap way too much land Stevenson loop\nTags and the huddle okay this is gonna be a process for the Lakers just like moving into a house as a process there's going to be growing pains\nAnd the next point is well let's look at the numbers when LeBron changes team you know I'm ... I'm a kind of numbers guy especially when it comes to gambling\nAnd I you know past performance is not an indicator of future results but you can use the past as a guide so ... got to the Miami Heat he brought with him Chris Bosh they got rid of four of their top six players from the prior year and what do you know\nIn Miami LeBron's eat started slope\nThere were eight and seven and then there were nine and ... and that was the famous bump game I'm sure you guys remember LeBron comes off the court I think it was the second quarter and he'd like his coaches talking in the Bronx bumped into him with like a shoulder and it was like whoa now this was before social media has really gotten huge\nAnd I remember on the big lead we did several posts out of and got a ton of traffic and of course later on the I think like this year last year came out that after that nine and they start LeBron went in to meet with pat Riley he had Bosh and Wade with him\nAnd a LeBron asked and I'm putting air quotes around asked LeBron asked\nTo pat Riley have pet do you ever uh think about coming back to coach ... Riley was essentially like get the hell out of my office I Know where you're going to stop just stop stop right now cut it off\nAnd of course after that nine and they start in Miami getting growing pains moving it takes them time the heat peeled off twelve straight and then Twenty one twenty two so it took ... some time when he got to Miami now\nI can already hear you shouting into your radio but the judge to those were a little bronze prime years he was like twenty six yeah that that's true okay\n\n\n\n\nOh you'll mobile luckily I have another one that\nWanted to see more of an dot com

have you guys dug into Ozarks at all oh yeah I just finished season to actual OK okay keep it keep it quiet over there for you pick what uh we're about to finish season one this show is so good I mean listen for the longest I'm One of these guys I think I've talked about this\nI refuse to follow the crowd and and do everybody's watching as you've got to watch you got\nSo I like held off on north coast started watching our goes boom amazing\nHeld off on Ozark just dove into it and it's like every night we're watching like thirty minutes forty five an episode\nIts power dark stuff really dark for sports fans it's the perfect get away 'cause you know you're watching sports and you're like ... and then it's like a total change of pace it's like when I read whether it's um magazines books I don't read sports\nI Try to get my mind out of sports 'cause it's so cluttered with support 'em\nAnd and as you know I wanted to talk about the NFL and how difficult of all you get is to understand I mean I spend all day during the week trying to understand the NFL\nI mean during the fall that's what I'm trying to get a grip on the league and nobody understands it it's the most difficult lead to grasp like college football\nThere's three or four good teams they're going to be there okay in the playoffs at the end of the ... that's just how it it almost every year maybe you'll have some sort of outsiders creeping but by and large you know what you're getting in college football yeah they're going to be great upset um I got one upset coming a night I Hope Michigan\nAlabama's going down I don't care of two of plays or not you know maybe they struggle against LSU but that was going to be there in the play offs\nAnd the NBA the warriors wouldn't have catastrophic injuries to not be in the fight the Celtics in raptors in Sixers are gonna be there\nYou don't really get outsiders in the NBA making that massively like maybe the Utah Jazz get to the western conference finals wouldn't shocked me you know what the words you're gonna be the pendulum it but the NFL you just have no clue\nNone\nYet last week was I thought a perfect example\nAnd this is why it's so tough to bet on the NFL and this is why talk about gambling on the NFL does his wife started a pod cats coming up winners check it out on I tune this is why\nI'm diving into it because I Want to do better and I feel like I I don't want to sound cocky or I'm One of those guys like challenge me on anything and I'm going to overcome it\nI like being challenged\nI Do know the the one thing in life I just don't want to be challenged with is a Rubik's Cube I've never ever been good at those things I just threw in the towel you know I give it a couple of ... not not not for me I Can't figure this out\nBut like video games you challenge me let's play Madden fine I'll play I'll probably lose I haven't picked up a video game and like seven years you know probably lose and then I'm going to play and play and play and then beat you\nPick up basketball Gulf whatever it is I I I'm competitive by nature\nI was in newspapers I said let me start this blog thing I Would go full bore in a blog got successful and got lucky and sold by radio came to me\nAnd I and I'm loving every minute of I look forward to it every Saturday morning\nTV you know I come out here to do TV as one every day I Want to try to get better I'm asking people how do I improve what do you see what do I need to work on the same as with NFL gambling and and and even if you want to remove the gambling and say well I don't want to bet on doing fine you don't tell me who's gonna win this week\nCertainly try to understand the NFL and the the perfect game was last week\nChicago Bears going to Miami I Love the bears all week awful by blah blah blah and then Ryan Daniels ruled out ... Brock Tobar\nOh but I don't get in trouble for saying this rock out with my Brock out you know like there's all these things for ... and the lines sores up to six and a half I'm feeling great about my three loving every minute of it and and the bears turn the ball over twice in the red zone\nThe bears who led the NFL insects didn't touch Brock us Wyler says meant shoes off Wyler\nThe bears the I think the second or third best defense according to yards per play\nOut of the blue gives up for a hundred and Seventy five yards seven point three yards for ... Brock off while they're in the best that and I gave this out on as one yesterday so the bears\nWho is a first for weeks had missed Fifteen tackled that's a total shore tackling team great defense they miss nine dean against the dolphin no team tackles Mitt\nSo you're telling me you understand the NFL you saw that coming it's such a week to week league folks last week ten of the ...\nSchemes nine games of the fourteen on Sunday and Monday ended in one score game and it's like that every week\nI mean that's what's so insane about the NFL the Packers had to come back in the final two minutes when by three at the buzzer the patriots you know you knew they were going to win but they didn't cover they won by three at the buzzer\nOkay dolphins insane game overtime buzzer finish Steelers beat the bangles ... touched down the final seconds\nI mean the the ... it's a heart stopping leaf fund the NFL and now it's also frustrating and we'll get to the the picks and a half hour because I feel like you understand the team and just when you think you've got\nIt slips through your hands like whoa did not see that game changer coming anybody see Dallas beating Jacksonville forty seven nobody nobody had\nThat nobody I mean it's\nSo difficult to understand the Cleveland Browns and just beat the ravens they're playing the charges at home Vegas makes it a one point gave\nThe browns off by a million\nNow I Will say tinder Nick who's coming in here uh thirty minutes I think he liked the charges a lot but again\nBy and large the NFL is so tough which is what makes it so incredible are coming up next year on the big lead Fox Sports radio I just said it's impossible to understand the NFL will coming up next Amanda Albert breeder\nHe's going to dive into bears patriots all the fun stuff we've got the big trade that happened yesterday and hopefully help the jaguars and what's up with levy on bill we'll talk with Albert rear about that next but first\nOr you want to talk me out of this still around you know your thought I'm\nWorried I just tell you I think max can apply or like everybody else like I just I Know I Know a pass Russia's looked like when they play things up and that doesn't mean like ... not going to give a hundred percent or effort or anything like that but\nYou know this ankle injury robs them of explosive miss those things are back to fight with those positions\nAnd if that's not a hundred percent of the Chicago\nHonestly J Mak is one of those things that sort of moves that one off the court for [laughter] you\nKnow and like I said\nIt's hard it's hard to know what I mean you know hey look maybe you get the Sunday and they shoot 'em up in it for three hours he still out there and be unbelievable for or maybe it robs them of a little bit of as a explosive mix and he's not quite the same I I think that's a pretty important variable\nAnd we're going to find out listen to the patriots go there and dumped them than we can just erased patriots on the road are struggling could listen if they get home field advantage we know they're likely going back to the super bowl but if they don't have enough yeah potentially Kansas City\nOr I don't know maybe even a Pittsburgh we'll see if they can recover or Baltimore it won't be easy\nBut if they get home field advantage forget about it and and yeah and I'm like ... ... ... what about the fact that ... the bears coach\nYou'd have to be under Andy Reid who just played ballot jak and we'll look at the ball at will he could play a factor\nBut they let me let me ask you this question than just hypothetically okay this book called the hypothetical if you're Andy Reid and you just lost some ground in New England on a on the ... the race\nFor a whole field do you think maybe you might pick up the phone and call and old buddy of this week the whole head\nOh yeah I mean listen to the city chiefs don't have the ... coup against the patriots and now you know you need the bears to win this game yeah they should die like that we're a good yeah I\nI I I there are there are certainly some carry over there's going to be some stuff that bag is going to be able to look at look at me banjo has had some set against Brady in the past and I are able to sort of some interesting stuff but the I I just think\nThe patriots defense is a liability still right yeah and we saw last week in Kansas City I think are often it's pretty close to being fixed you know a few weeks after it was really really bad I think they're off it's really really close\nAlbert Greer thanks Alberta not enjoy the weekend or a great stuff from Alberta listen that Tampa Bay buccaneers thing ah I think we've got to get that on the up on the website there ah Gavin that is interesting book potentially trading for levy on bell\nAnd looked at temple started you know maybe they make a run or coming up next year on the big lead Fox Sports radio one of the top top draft pick in the upcoming NFL Draft\nI think he made one of the smartest decisions I've seen from a college kid in a long time I'll tell you who that is next\nWhat's the story of the door and she is we have opinions on the line who think they think ... days

I mean it's easy I for some reason I'm able to find angle that I like all the time and I mean I Love this weekend in sports there's so much to love\nActually am a November guy because a college basketball\nWhen you get NBA college basketball meaningful NFL great college football rivalry games like November's off the hook but October right now is great we've got a game seven tonight\nDodgers brewers opposite look bronze home opener out here at staples in LA I Will be in the building for that and I'm obviously we have a tremendous NFL's like tomorrow and to talk about the NFL and I'm an asking about abroad because he was coming after me\nGood morning may or how many bad MBA takes have you been spewing [laughter]\nComing after me record and they were Ninety eight on the floor each other before we get to NBA by the way I loved the card and then all of a sudden last night I started to have some panic just as a heads up I change a bunch of ... but go ahead go ahead shred me for my MBA take\nI mean I don't know where to start I'll start with the Gordon Hayward taste because you know I Love ... work but um you know when you said he could be a second team all NBA I couldn't I couldn't believe what I was reading\nDo last night I missed some of that game\nI think we're working coin flip the ... he's an excellent player but that theme is loaded he's the third or fourth option he's coming off that bad injuries are you going to play twenty five minutes a game\nOr ... minutes restriction\nTea is not about a five minute restriction early on I just think it's that great player in Utah he was the only option but he's not going to be thought second female MBA come up\nInteresting All right it's not fair enough and now I Want to quickly ask you before we get to the NFL bit fading look Ron a you had the blazers opening night I Believe I did and well you have Houston tonight\nActually you know it's funny I thought I thought because of all the public sentiment you might get the Lakers as a one or two point favorite but rightfully so those that Houston Open up mines to now they're up to three and a half all this money is on the rockets look I\nI watched that game I've watched the bronze since he was a junior in high school I was writing them live in Ohio and so I followed them you know he is so good at setting up three pointers and looked at you can say what you want about the cabs but they were just always a deadly three points shooting team and the\nGo to the Lakers team all of a sudden that age thirty three to have the fast paced game or in the last couple of years in the NBA right off the bat you're going to where the guy down he can't they can't shoot three they'd have no legitimate shooters outside of Josh heart I I don't know what they're doing over there and\nThe score the Lakers I think it's going to be I actually think the total over two thirty poor as crazy as it sounds\nI think that's going to be an insanely high scoring game the Lakers can run on the fast breaks I Will give them credit they said look good from that perspective but they've got and you're gonna wear yourself out for the fourth quarter and the rest of the season and are against three ... a good three pointing like the uh the rockets I I just don't think that they can hang with these\nGuys are ... what did you see the rockets opening night they look like high garbage I mean now I Know that was the pelican NBA scoring his way out but let's get to the NFL yeah All right so everybody's very excited you know this is the only radio show in the country where two people in the top two thirty\nIn the one point four million dollar super contest um and we're going to chop it up TA last\nWeek you when two and three I went to increase my purse losing week yeah oh yeah okay I I went three and two so I'm I'm two and a half points find the leader you on what one point out the arm to point out actually points out okay let's get started I'll let you go first you got\nSo I I'll just say I said last week that a heated the card I thought it was a tough week so it didn't shock that went through and grief I really love this\nWeek oh no okay All right well kids aren't\nUm and it started off with the first game of the day I've got the heightened\nUndone right\nIs this a tremendous value on kind of see you know the look a headline was was chargers minus three yeah book reports Sunday\nSo you're getting you know for for a line to go three and a half points the other way just for one game I think is complete overreaction I got a good trend for you and I'm not normally a big trend guy but I think you know this doesn't make sense\nOr when you get underdogs of re points or more which obviously tendency is in this case and they're coming up or shut outlaw like that that against the ravens I'm forty five and ten against the spread the following week wow ... ...\nJust look these teams when they get embarrassed like that they they get you get all their focus the next week\nSo and maybe the other team the opponents you don't let down a little bit because of that so\nYou get kind of a combination of all those factors and you're never as bad as you were the prier where you can never as good so uh and this year by the way that trend is to uh no I'm Arizona covered against the bears and a buffalo covered against the titans ... I'm In the same situation so I think the you get an overvalued chargers team right now\nAnd look we know the chargers don't have a a great coach and answered it when I'm Still don't trust him and there are special teams are still struggling so hey look you might they might go up a six points and missed the extra point and then you end up\nCovering [laughter] I I like to know the titans I I was just citing at the end between the titans and the eagles and I went tightened so I'm happy that I'm On the same side as you are\nI'm going to go next I have the un and I'm sure you didn't take the the jaguars favor by five against the Houston Texans know among them as well Oh nice to be got my concern is the blink portals factor or he's been bad\nThe last couple of weeks and it almost feels like the defense he's feeding off his struggles and they're struggling to you know last\nYear they only gave up more than thirty points twice the whole season and the regular season\nThey've already done it the last two weeks I just feel like perfect bounce back opportunity and I think that awful offensive line of the Houston Texans which are the quarter back to the ... the most into Sean watching taking the most hit by a mile in the NFL\nI just feel like this is the game with the jak de just owns it and and they cover fairly\n... I agree with all those points and I think again similar to Tennessee and the NFL you get a team like Jacksonville there's been embarrassed back to back weeks you know they're going to show up especially at on they're totally different team on the fence at home um you saw it against the patriots earlier this year at home so they still have it and um and again that that old line but\nThey could not protect the Boston and look it's not all the all but it's a lie to me the Sean watching holds football way too long he takes a lot of those hits all their self inflicted and he had a couple of turnovers couple of bad interceptions at\nThree ... three times I mean I only lost one but still\nYou up and and look using that last in running efficiency on all fenced in Jacksonville number one in the league I just think you don't really need to rely on ... ... the formula that they lived off of last year was take you know your defense gets gets you in good deal position\nUm you get the leader early and then you kind of sit on it and let the kids go to work I think you'll see that this week night and you you you got next I've got to go this is my last trip that that I like him ah

... somewhere according to some guy to pick me up on Twitter but I'm just curious if the rest of America is as into gambling as I Am and\nOf course some states have it some don't but it's I've compared it to the marijuana rise um and I do know some people I've met out here in LA who have got into and it's funny because they don't say\nYeah I'm into marijuana they say I'm In the Kennedy has been you know it sounds a lot better I don't know that sports gambling has a term like candidates for marijuana but I guess maybe that well you're not really book making but\nIt's one of those situations where I'm telling you in three years sports gambling is going to be so mainstream nobody's gonna care\nAnd the key is getting in early on the ground level and I guess that's a good segue to my college football picks for today now I had a greatly week last week when foreign one I don't feel as comfortable today kickoffs in about twenty five\nSorry thirty five minutes I Want to start by

horrible it's got to win\nA new section with all these college but I have a college football I have an NFL the notes that I have on Michigan\nI did not bet this game I I think it's a great game to watch I don't want to be financially invested Michigan is a win Seventeen against ranked teams on the road since two thousand [noise]\nTheir favorite my seven year it's picked up to seven and a half for me it's stay away my college football picks for today against foreign one last week a little a little lucky there was some of the fix was get into him\nFirst off I like Oklahoma favor by eight it's a big number they're playing TCU TCU is just not as good as last year Gary Patterson is a good coach Oklahoma\nBeat them handily twice last year TCU coming off a fad last Texas Tech Oklahoma's favorite by eight I like a big ... Oklahoma had to buy and before that they lost in Texas I feel like this is a strong bounce back statements game\nFrom ... in Lincoln Riley\nThe big numbers the big surprise is temple here okay Cincinnati comes in the bear cats are ranked and they're undefeated\nBut they're reporting underdogs on the road I think this is a somebody knows something game clearly Vegas is all over temple I like temple favor by three over undefeated and rank Cincinnati\nI took clumps and it's a huge number of their favorite by Seventeen against NC State but here's why I took clubs the public is overwhelmingly on in the state I mean folks the public is eighty percent backing\nA road I Believe a Seventeen point underdog I'm looking now it looks like it's up to eight teams I mean really the public you think they're right on that they're never write\nI took Clemson favored\nA pick I hit last week I'm going to go ahead and take\nThe Washington state cougars at home against Oregon Oregon of course one there's Super Bowl\nOr last week taking down Washington in overtime Oregon with their ah NFL quarterback I Believe he's going to be the number one pick Justin Herbert\nHe's a really good player Oregon wandering overtime but they they didn't really I'll play Washington they got kind of lucky Washington missed the late ...\nAnd then of course Oregon winds and overtopped hey everybody needs to look I think Washington state another game on Fox or if it's one Gavin is is the big night game I think it's on Fox big Fox are going to want to keep an eye on the Washington state quarterback gardener men to\nWhy those two guys Kevin Love and Chris Bosh were scapegoating to use your work because they were the third option right Kevin Love wasn't really criticized last year when he was the second option\nYou know so when you're in a third option you're going to be consistent you're not going to you know put up the numbers you did somewhere else when you were the first option so that's why the old guy was in that situation random ain't going to be the second option so I don't think it'll be the same situation\nAnd these young people do he's growing and left prices expectations for this team art championship we're both like they were with queen\nMiami I Can't oh Sarah pizza crusts there in LA Santa Cruz theory in LA LA only wants to deal with stars\nWho've expect in a family should I mean not this year but there are a guy that's almost as if they started out when to if they lose this game tonight and they could and then they got the spurs again on Monday and they start oh when three you're telling me there isn't going to be a little and unless we understand ... patients\nBut the fans in the media social media exist people live on the social media stuff I think\nYou tell me your buddy ... they're going to pop off somebody you want to see something\nSo what you expect people to go after brand new thing or when they're only three\nWell I think when you say hey Jimmy bunkers out there killing it why don't you bring in butler in rent them you know one letter we were treated for\nRenting renting for why why would you written Jimmy\n... well Jimmy ... signed him in the offseason your rent them and then you will see\nIf you know you drink the thing that's one thing but no look Brandon Ingram the Lakers have high hopes for an ... of high hopes for he can be an elite ... for a very good defender and it's like he's not that strong jak you keep them from becoming elite unless he gets stronger\nBut we live is athleticism is quickness\nHe can be a very good defender we can ... you can make place he's a decent shooter like he's got this you know the great yet no no but he's growing and he could become an all star caliber players so look this can't be a senior in college\nYeah look look at look at color Anthony\nTitles right now yeah what eight forty something\nNew he's ... well ... yeah\nSo I'm just saying you got like we ... what happens is I get it the culture of the day with all the sports talk shows twenty four seven new you know a ham radio talk show which we are starting treaty\nIn every single NBA day yeah like it's college football and you write like last night uh if if you know Toronto beef I'm sure we'll get their Toronto be fought there are probably people\nTripping out over that is one gay Austin wasn't going to go undefeated\nBy Chris less relax we got thirty seconds your thoughts Jimmy Butler he had a great night he was booed at the outset than they were chanting MVP those clueless minutes\nHe needs to get into a ... like a a bidding war over Jimmy Butler\n[noise] well he's he is a great player and he's getting better that's the thing I mean he just getting better and better\nAnd that's what you like uh the clip or the leaf it this way would rather side butler in free agency or remember father's not if they if all way exactly as the clippers would hope\nButler wouldn't be on their team and free agency it would be covered the ... and ... those are the two number one they may be ... times that wouldn't even be ahead a butler on their list so\nTeams are looking at all this stuff there are some things that some things don't really care about is added to others are a little bit bothered by the way gone about things a USA Basketball he was refuted that you know just kinda rubs some guy the wrong way so\nDifferent scenes look at it differently Miami if butler I don't really want to go to my end 'cause what are they going around he goes in Miami's first round and out for the rest of this you know I

tried to preach patients\nEarlier in the chauffeur Laker fans I went over it was Chris Broussard he's in agreement with me\nThe problem is I don't know if the masses are going to get it so here's what I Want you to do if you listen to this podcast when you hear a Laker fan starting to be like oh they stink their own to if they lose tonight or maybe oh in three if they lose to disperse folks I'm asking\nYou send him a link to his podcast where I break down number one the Lakers schedule let the jump is brutal\nAges or first eleven opponents made the playoffs last year and then the ninth is Denver who lost on the final game of the regular season or they would have been in the playoffs and then number two when LeBron goes to new places he struggles rubber I went to Miami\nLeBron and a couple of injuries missed a few games there the bottom line is it takes some time the analogy analogy I used to think about moving\nWhen you move whether it's a house in apartment down as whatever\nIt doesn't take days to unpack it doesn't take weeks to take months you are months before you get into what you can consider your new place it's gonna take the Lakers at least until Thanksgiving but more likely Christmas they're gonna have to figure out a rotation\nYou know I got to be honest and I don't want to nit pick I don't want to go too heavy on the Lakers year will come back to them in a moment what I saw was too much land Stevens in the open or let me get the rookie from Kansas for three point shootings V.\nFind the mismatch somebody and guard there's got to be a slow guy out there that we can get matched up against so I I'm I'm cool with CNN for ... minutes not too much land Stevenson\nAt any rate limit I'll come back to the Lakers in a moment but I Want to quickly talk about something I did see in the NBA that I see a lot of in the NFL this year and with good reason so if you remember last\nYear in the NFL everybody bemoan the lower rating and the politics and blah blah blah bigger than all of that\nThe reason the NFL was not amazing last year in the regular season was the quarter back injury I keep coming back to this when you don't have Andrew Luck when you don't have just Shaun White's when Carson went to was the MVP leader when he goes down late in the season\nAnd on and on down the list I mean Aaron Rogers was knocked out last year and miss more than half the season for the Packers when you don't have these started quarterbacks you don't have a great product\nI Know Jake Cutler came off the the reality ... reality shows so far to be the quarter back when you don't have them\nWithout good quarterbacks the league is just not as appealing that's the bottom line quarterbacks are the most important position in the NFL and it's not even close\nI mean the ... the Minnesota Vikings I Know they would deepen at the end of the playoffs case Keno main guy you're like I got to turn on my TV to watch case keen him\nSo keeping the quarterbacks healthy was a primary focus of the NFL and the off season so they instituted a basically like Joe ... Joe land on them\nAnd look at this through six weeks all we've lost his Jimmy ... any law got lost on an ACL injury and you know that that stinks because he's a big money quarterback in San Fran got a lot of good games a lot of primetime games\nYou know that's a big loss and the other one is Josh Allen who's a rookie use dumb must see TV a very good\nBut your now down to quarterbacks we cannot afford to lose more I'm telling you don't want to lose the quarter back to the NFL is not as appealing now when you look at the NBA and I specifically watched the the Utah Jazz warriors last night\nThe one way to get it the warriors is to rough up Steph Curry I don't like it\nBut opponents know that I remember back to the cabs in the finals courageous murdered them on the threes so what they do the next year they came out and they were physical with\nMatthew Delaware Dover was kind of physical with them and they knew that's what you gotta do bumping screen them a little harder you know stuff that gamesmanship but there's a line there's a fine line there and last\nNight when I saw was the jets taking shots of curry\nYou can have star players going down you absolutely got to protect your stars and let's be honest the warriors was Steph Curry or the greatest show in the in the day\nYou get curry and Duran splashing it's it's a must see TV it's text your friends get to a television\nIt's riveting right now ... homes chiefs they're fun to watch\nRight now Jarrett golf the greatest show on surf\nGolf girlie that's a fun watch we can't have these guys injured do you get it the NFL wants to protect his quarterback the NBA should do this thing right now I'm going to pivot quickly to\nYou know it's Saturday Night it's October\nIt's a time when you know maybe the weather's getting a little chilly you want to stay in and watch some sports\nNext weekend is Halloween you obviously got to be out with the famine next weekend I was the wife e out with the girl I Would decide peace no\nKidding I'm and tonight you got a decision to me\nEspecially if you're on the left coast which is the best coast but from the east coast you're obviously interested too because LeBron is one of the number one sports draws in America right now I Know the NFL's obviously number one but as an individual\nLeBron's Lakers they view is must see TV but\nAt the same time\nYou got a couple of really good college football games FCC LSU Missouri to rank team's gotta watch that pack twelve possibly the game of the day\nWhere you can enjoy the huge ... address back bays with why farm\nHaunted me ... ...\nA lot of 'em is given all of\nThat overall one hundred and Seventy dollar value melted mobile lotto glasses day\nBy day and then says to the middle class and then\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo mobile Wi Fi I call political six boys there'll be mobile ad I saw one of the dot com for detail and killing you said\nYou just lie or whether you lead upon yes we are getting millions of download the seafood place is right here with us it's a nice place you work so we'll let you some will protect you well than male or ... or ... years old\nWe're Fox Sports radio\nAnd that's why I'm a ... year I saw one of those things\n[noise]\nHere on the big league Fox Sports radio\n...

NFL games are out obviously so it's like again this is early in the morning this is maybe I don't know nine AM and we're at this pep boys now they they they drop us off the car in like kind of a side slash\nBack of the pep boys and it's in a strip mall and there's no other stores open so we're like on an island there there is no other cars really around so we walk\nTo Denny's or like two blocks and we didn't really know when we were and I'm not saying we were hung over but you know you've been drinking at your high school reunion you weren't a hundred percent aware and we walk into Denny's and it was like a scene in the movie where you walk in\nAnd everybody's stares at you and I didn't even know but like I look around and everybody in the Denny's was African American and my wife is you know an Irish\nUh sorry an Italian a girl and she's the only white person in there and I was like oh shucks where are we\nHe'll mobile with the dog when I was six point seven mobile apps visit I dont want to six points dot com for details\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise] ... what was going\nFor each of us have coverage is cracking back on the\nBall Saturday with the hard Mitt and Kelvin Washington\nYou know here's the augment them Kelvin Washington\nIn a dream once again on a fabulous Saturday on the vast Fox Sports radio network hit his box football Saturday Hartmann and washing with you how many alive\nRun the guy go Fox Sports radio studios Fifteen minutes can save you fifty percent or more on your car insurance is a guy go dot com\nFor a free raid quote\nWe have a very interesting dynamic going on where we broadcast from here in the LA area today\nCame up we have tonight game seven of the national league championship series between the Dodgers and the brewers Dodgers trying to get two\nConsecutive World Series for the first time in forty years less than the Dodgers played in back to back World Series Nineteen Seventy seven in Seventy eight\nAnd yeah that's not the buzz in LA it's all about LeBron James and his whole debut tonight with the Lakers\nDare I say Kay Deb tonight doing my local TV I can guarantee you on our ten o'clock sports\nWe will lead Lakers\nNo no way the Lakers and then I'll go like this and in other sports news that do go into the world series oh way I Am telling you how the okay vote on night but what what my man a run in the board right out what's your name\nThat's ... Roberta owed Kelvin nice to meet your brother and I sent me to revert to a ... do you have on a Dodger\nThe what the Dodger head so who I Am watching the Lakers tonight I'll tell you that way that's what I feel I think I think\nIf you're asking where their allegiance would be in totality people are going to say the Lakers but I think that because we already saw the brunt of the Lakers on uh what was that Thursday\nThursday night I think it\nWas Thursday was a Thursday or Thursday yeah you're right it was there's yet thoroughly already forgot yeah they\nGot to see them got to see what was going on I got to get the feel for them how they're going to play what you're gonna see it was exciting and love LeBron goes back to back dunks I think people are going to taste is okay great the ... can be a fun season let me watch my daughters\nAre so off he's at the staples center to the staples center debut regular season oh reading those crowds outside the staples center\nAt whether it's fair now let's just hope mainly the world series to me I agree with you well it took me it's obscene but I Am tell you right now our programming people where I work at the TV station in LA they are going to tell us you lead because again remember the Dodger games at five oh nine\nThe Laker games at seven thirty some other tell me get to the ten o'clock\nIt [laughter] it's absurd is this going to Santa Barbara and let's go to staples LeBron all excitement in other news Dodgers are going to the world series okay now I'll maybe even ... I may grant you\nYeah for television purposes right because it's about ratings when you think the people of LA\nIf say seven thirty begins and we're in the seventh inning right and it's\nA three to two game either way you're telling me people are gonna be like well it was nice watching your doctors I got to go to the Lakers and I believe clearly strongly the Lakers are number one in LA no doubt about\nIt but we've got eighty two more or eighty one more game yeah looting tonight ... it would be nice if there was some way too\n... get a second TV Gavin you know um it is a unique situation if it really shows you about\n... aircraft with Erica has their own dynamic on priority sports wise I get it I mean whether it's New York or Chicago or Dallas or Miami or wherever you're listening to right now you have your own local dynamic on the pecking order a teams\nBut the the whole dynamic\nOf LeBron and a Laker uniform now this may wear off you know a month\nOr so into the season because I Do think based on the bronze track record that it's not going to be a fast start for the Lakers whomever this when he went to Miami and they started nine and a eight\nWhen he went back to Cleveland they started five and seven both those teams ended up in the NBA Finals yup not that this team is going to but the track record says that LeBron joins that team it's going to take a while so I could easily see the Lakers any attendant ten after twenty games or something along that\nAnd maybe it'll die down but it's the dynamic of his first game at staples I mean it's going to be a superstar crowd at a staple center\nBecause all the Dodgers play the game seven\nAnd ... you know who's going to be sweating a ... outside\nJohnson is going to be All right now because remember he did that last year where he was that the Dodgers game and I think it was the game to push it to a game seven of I'm not mistaken right and then he flies over to the staple center and he's in the tunnel and looking nervous wreck he was and that's the I Would have the Lakers doing\nWe're going to see that Magic Johnson again so that bald head is going to\nBe like a gay man I didn't hear I mean it's I mean you've got this game seven uh and look at it it's a coin flip tonight anytime you have a game seven there's so many dynamics were going to get into the whole dynamic how even got to a game seven with the Dodgers and the brewers and obviously the the Red Sox by the way how about the red\nSox going into Houston and sweep\nSeventy three nine warriors where that's just what they've been doing all season yeah so I'm with you like it clearly that's an impressive feat of especially about ... a year ago but I think when you look at what they've been able to do all season long it's kind of goes\nHey I mean they've been by far the best team in baseball so it it's kind of par for the course even though it's absurd what you're saying I mean there\nWas an amazing baked or as a hundred and eight when team Alex core of\nBy the way ... story about Alex Cora when he was with the Dodgers my sons they had this deal where the kids can run out in the field in in in and so my oldest son was seven I have my youngest son was six that was the cutoff age six year old and sold nine kids run out in the field decked out in the Dodgers gear and they go to the\nBase and each of the Dodgers sign of bought baseball further and well my six year old\nHe runs out on the field and he's going to second base and he still has his Alex Cora baseball now the manager of the Boston Red Sox\nVery it so I I Would imagine he'll enjoy name Boston Dodger or you know Red Sox Dodgers where he will of the question is a day Roberts hit the Dodgers lose tonight will they be handing day Robert ... firing you fired a\nWrong straight up I'm telling you that it's fair he no he hasn't he has no contract for next year they're only pay him a million dollars anyway they basically saying that you're replaceable\nEverybody but here's the thing okay so if someone is replaceable but yet and and the other side of they're doing exactly what you said in so far it's worked with a tuna\nPotentially to back to back World Series appearances first time in quite some time three straight league championship actually so I mean then why if I'm going to why would I bring someone else who is already doing exactly what I'm saying [laughter]\nHe's already doing exactly what I say to the tune of us again going back to back World Series potentially that's why would I change that hit on my bringing a guy who might say no I don't want to do that\nHe takes the blame I think we're I think we're better than that I think we know\nUnless he does something absurd you know unless he you know he clearly\nA who's going tonight who's on I'm On a night it was it again that would be a Walker ... Walker ... mayor ... on a short rats waiting in the wings abuse or even waiver we eat a little bit oh yeah we've\nSeen ... and we've seen Clinton come in and do some damage relieving so I'm going back to let's say he pulls Walker too early or keeps them into long then we would criticize him but if he just falls the script\nAnd just does what he's supposed to do I think he and I think he's\nDone an exceptional job of that and I know it sounds funny is kind of embarrassing but he's filed a script well he handles the media beautifully handles the media beautifully which is important a yeah it's really important B because you're in Los Angeles right and I think he's great with the players the players by and norm I think he's been able to manage say goodbye to your point for the most part has been much\nIs almost frozen rain\nThat's worse it's cold obviously you're wet it makes the field are weird and its muddy and it it that is where you'd rather it's no because it's just it it does all the you know it's just kind of like whatever it is almost kind of fun freezing rain is the absolute worst\nNo I I Want to update you because I Know your game today is Michigan\nIn East Lansing against smarty yeah so Michigan Michigan State and if you're wondering why we're not watching that game right now that is because they're in a delay but a lot of delays with your eyes on me a lot of delays lately I mean I even had a delay down in San Diego and I want you on a friday night did a lightning in San Diego\nAnd wars diamond ever they did not sticking out because so Cal people are not about that light all they all left they all left they all at the ... when he left will say\nIt would have well in\nThe rain in fact they would history that's all it is raining it's not even freezing rain and they were stuck it out\nMake or break season for a gym horrible I mean you know Michigan some pretty good shape right now obviously you've gotta when you got to win out I mean you're going to have to at some point beat Ohio State which seems a tall order right now because the buckeyes rolling but how many more close\nSeasons can you afford if your gym Harbaugh in Ann Arbor here\nHere's the difficult part about that his team's overall overall especially minus last year has been successful he's brought some prominence back to the university where at least you're talking about it you know they're getting you know big games with people who are interested for a while there there was no interest\nBut at some point you now need to of course back that up with wins\nAnd even if you didn't back it up with ... megawatt ... like national championships or you know are they getting into college football playoff as you just mentioned you can't be I think he's like two in eight\nAgainst Michigan State I think a Wisconsin in in uh Ohio and Ohio State or maybe it was Penn State but the point is you have to beat those teams and so far this year you beat Wisconsin\nAnd now if he can be a party he's on to something and so this more than anything I think today's game even maybe so more than Ohio State because look Ohio State can win the national championship but none of us would be surprised\nBut if he can beat Wisconsin was yard he's he's already done then they have a by week and then they host Penn State\nIf you win three of the for writing you beat Wisconsin Michigan State Penn State unless even say fought Ohio State right you're on a Sunday clearly you'd rather be Ohio State but I mean you know that this one I mean there are a job or not they are a juggernaut so yeah they are great those quarterbacks have been that they've had the last seven years or so not Haskins\nPlanning on his mind going into that mean they're scary team\nThat that win against Wisconsin was his best when I mean they dominated Wisconsin\nConstantine they're talking about the best off and so on they ever had Michigan dominated that game show but you've got to follow it up then obviously right now it's being delayed lightning and everything else going on in East Lansing right now so as soon as that game resumes will bring it up to date ...\nGoing to say they embarrass the whole you know it was in ... like I feel bad for him I was like okay maybe he should really make sure he gets his degree [laughter] I really strongly consider ... career after football\n[noise] no I'm orders restore the only two teams undefeated in conference play in the Big Ten or Ohio State Michigan see that's the way I grow up and and that's the way I grew up\nFor the most part for the most part it was always get you know you had your northwestern how to season rarely I'm layers there yeah yeah you had a a Michigan State will have a season here they're Penn State but for the most part it came down to those who to cease to be exciting though you\nKnow I went to the big ... you've been to at least one thousand twenty six sporting events that are very major [laughter] I've only been to I Would honestly say major sporting events that I've gone to like I I had I never saw Tyson fight or I never even saw version of the best box of his generation in a a a Ford may whether\nI was just missed the things you know I didn't see a Jordan pistons eastern comes fine or something back in the day I was too young\nThe biggest things I've gone to was a Michigan and Ohio State when it was the year Charles what's in won the Heisman that we're going up against David Boston where they're at the end zone fighting and then be returned what's in return to the point I was sitting there fifty yard line at great seats\nAnd that was that was the biggest warning of him as an amazing game and then a game five pistons the spurs NBA Finals two thousand five when Robert ory hit that big shot yeah as a I was sitting there on the phone screaming at my boy\nWas shot up and what happened they let ... about\nIt a shot so so point is Michigan Ohio State they're released a matter of course back in the day 'cause that was the biggest event I go to you and the other hand\nYou probably would there too I was there were there when they were born in his home run I\nUh I was there the first ... first tooth Nineteen oh too when you're ... blitz staffer forty nine or ... or one touchdowns are only worth five points will probably go\nRose Bowl year after year 'cause I ... I ... I went to yeah I can I can do all that stuff but I I don't want to go down that path I don't want to go down that path All right\nUm I Do want to go down the path to more college football or by the way my Bruins\nGot the big win last week a brass getting ... northwestern games maybe an omen for UCLA later in the day in Nebraska was up and we're like All right it looks like the husk or is it going to finally get their first win\nAnd you know I was just talking to Ralph who's a filling in today for gas gone and ah you know they are suddenly it was a a northwestern scored on a field goal\nAnd Nebraska basically just needed a first out is what they needed to run out the clock and they didn't even try he's around three plays into the line kicked\nIn northwestern came right down the score tied the game they were losing or something at all bad omen\nChip Kelly they unleashed their fury on Berkeley thirty seven to seven there are now and and they get Arizona today without ... UCLA might get them a little bit of rural right now ... son getting his first start a threat I think his ...\nIs ... Rodriguez but um yeah so so this is what if you're a\nFan of the hiring of chip Kelly this is what you were hoping for right you of course you can't finish Owens well you'll get a few victories get some momentum going have something where some new recruits can say All right I see where you guys are going I see the off as an explosive I see and I already know about to kill his history and pedigree especially in college football\nLet me go ahead and join in and get some things going so there are some hope shouldn't you know what they mess around\nAt the end of the season looked like a gym or theme\nSee everything will be fine if he got those traditional games those traditional match ups if you find a way to win that game in a racist bad season seen many a bad season or race simply by winning that\nThat they should get it I get it and I'll tell you what venue since you want to keep firing day Robert\nI Am not firing gay rights I Would not sign into a ten year deal a long day brothers but the Dodgers but it will all of a rubber does give me that\nIt was that I was out of date Roberts I don't know man [laughter] oh man he's a straight championship series yeah but he burning through the whole roster buddy burns through their raw or see on the ...\nYou realize that in the first six games are first five games with the national league championship series the brewer starters combine for fourteen ...\n... what does that Ohio and then starts the very end up\nHome I had with him and thinking oh David Freese so early in games it's like the most fits a legislator I time in ... and his army and he takes them all like in the second inning David Freese is your\nView fire and you know I Would have is the day they got to let you go what what did you hear the Dodgers you know David Freese is going on about anger and not curse shah\nPhrases now the VP men\nNo we're not saying he's not good but I don't think that's the reason I'm sitting day Robert here and get a\nScene with Mike travel to the playoffs Okay David Freese is not any part of why ... wow\nLook at with either way there's relevance to what we're saying well yet how much longer can baseball I like at what point does Rob Manfred say hello hey I'm missing angel y'all got you got to trade ... I'm not going to have the best player arguably could be the best player outside of\nMaybe what Ron and all the sports maybe ... out is how does it make\nBefore we go to Ralph it's because yes I'll tell you in the other high ... nice ordered ... Alex ... will be joining us as well when the guy go Fox Sports radio studios that check out what's trending right now\nIs Ralph herb well thank you very much Steve and we are still in a weather delayed East Lansing number six Michigan at number twenty four Michigan State the latest report has them getting started again at one fifty to eastern time so maybe the next twenty to twenty five minutes they'll take the field again\nJulio Jones finally gets a touchdown catch yes seven hundred seven receiving yards if he's going to pay a tactic know scores I think that changes I guess the giants events go looking for answers we can blame Eli all we want but if you're going to school at forty point to came to win that's a problem and that's where the dry and throughout the country right now they have no answers under James ... system\nI give you that but I tell you what man that's been the weirdest dynamic in football for now maybe a year year and a half is how ... Jones is for some reason and he and Matt Ryan cannot connected residence one of the strangest things he would be the most obvious dominant forging Iran's zone ever I mean\nRight I agree but here's the thing though the falcons right now I Believe or third in the NFL in red sooner efficiency\nI mean they're scoring touched down there I Know we saw the first game and we all think okay that you know I'm not saying you are but a lot of folks like oh well that's the falcons red zone office right now they're not good no actually since that first game they fixed everything\nThere's corner a bunch of points that like I could I could say oh well they can't get Julio Jones open because Austin's Cooper's getting open most of the new ones getting old and he does Smith scoring I mean you got so many different kinds of doing things it's been tremendously ...\nAnd I think it's a ... it's a compliment to Julio by the way the attention he gets opens up opportunities for others\nThere you go I was just going to say so maybe that's a compliment to who you know the guys are double team driven seeming spying him so that these other guys like Ridley who's having a nice ... campaign are able to score\nRight exactly and that's and that's all matters I mean look really does got the numbers I mean you look your contract for a pro Football Hall of fame career I think there's two numbers of Julio Jones truly cares about the first one in the wind column and the second is what's in his paycheck and trust me on the horizon goalie\nDegrading charity free agency and he's an awfully good defensive tackle in their system but we'll see how it goes but I mean trust me storm clouds building on the horizon as far as what Julio wants to get paid touchdowns or no test that\nNight before we let you go here or you got it gives a little insight into next week or the whole cocktail deal in Jacksonville, Georgia for what is that like\nIt's insane I mean just because basically they tried to eliminate the alcohol part of it as part of the pregame promotion the world's largest outdoor cocktail party right but it looked just we don't like Georgia now LSU may have ... Georgia a little bit in recent years as far as the hate factor Tennessee is really high up there\nBut I mean Georgia is just you know they're because they're so good now\nThese things start meaning something again and the way to Georgia why whipped up on for the last year not going to forget about that so I I just think though that we really and remember too at at Florida feel they don't serve alcohol SEC home games there was no alcohol ... I don't know if you saw UCLA now at the rose bowl they are selling alcohol day\nYeah and if you end up in ... when you decide who gets what happens when your wife had\nRight if you're watching a chip Kelly coach teen nowadays with everyone caught up with is often that's what you're getting so I agree but there'll be alcohol involved at the stadium there'll be sale that's something that doesn't happen normally at a Florida game so that's a little juice to this robbery not saying it's right but it's so but\nIt's going to be just on believable special because this one means so I'm really the front runner it's going to be the winner this a front runner and the FCC's that she\nWill next Saturday at this point a very distracted Alex ... joined us from Jacksonville up trying to talk NFL while he's on the cost of the big Florida Georgia showdown I have a great weekend we'll talk to you next week front of the cocktail parties\nHave flown in by the way if I call you if you've had over and I'm Sorry I remember I said I mean the distraction less\nUnderstand very understandable to Alex ... everyone again series\n... stories we did not discuss with Alex ... is really a buzz subject among NFL Owners this week we're going to tell you what it is coming up next [noise]\nCollege football [laughter]\n... ... touched down when it comes down and see the LA football coverage on your radio [noise]\nFunny face to face Fox Sports radio\nMine number two does not look like a number two I don't know what to call it is there a number three [noise]\nPeople for for police\nAnything close to the restroom [noise]\nMiddle seat with the stomach problems\nMike Guerra flying\nSound like you if it does you could be one of the many people with a digestive condition called X Okrent pancreatic insufficient see or a pie I even if you don't know what he ... he is you might know the symptoms frequent diarrhea gas bloating stomach pain if you have even just one of these symptoms you could still heavy\nPI because not everybody experiences E. pi on the same way which is why it's so important to open up to your doctor about oh your symptoms and the good news is\nA pianist manageable so don't keep a lid on it good why Denis ...

them questions wow\nMean it was it I've never ever seen and then Joe Buck within the last thing you said was oh and a Denver gets the ball first and the second half\nIt was almost like laughing as they say in it so um but as far as the Dodgers are concerned this this is such an interesting dynamic that's going on with this Dodger team because of the fact that it's been Thirty years\nSince they won that last World Series and when you think about\nDodger baseball right you know the one of the most absolutely iconic names in the world is sports any consider the fact they've only won\nSix World Series ever and it's not like the Lakers who won you know sixteen MBA championships or the Celtics or the Yankees or the Canadians are the you know the truly dominant forces in their individual team sport\nDodgers have won that man it's been now Thirty years since they were\nThere has been an element of not over high because\nThey've been good as they've been they've won six ... now three championships series ... you know if they win and I back to back World Series appearances so they've not you can't say they've been overrated but there is an element of these you know when a little bit more for what you know for the all the hype now that\nClearly living in LA helps because if they were the ... and trying to think of a middling if there were the Pittsburgh Dodgers yeah\nI don't think we're talking to even though they've had success with no I did live in Pittsburgh it'd be a bigger deal here let me let me play\nThis scenario out for your show the Dodgers let's say the Dodgers when the series they do it big parade in LA but how many people are looking over their shoulder like what's all brawn doing right now the timing of this where the Dodgers may finally have their breakthrough in when this World Series\nHow was that countered by the overwhelming presence of LeBron James now in the city of LA\nLet me throw a Steve Hartman theory at the apartment right so let's go with your theory they win the world series we pray were hanging out it's amazing thing right and let's say we come February near all star break in the NBA\nAnd the Lakers don't look good there maybe nine Tim Steve right down to ... and and ... and in the Bronx drops another movie a matter of fact with Brian jobs to rap album out of the blue you always wanted to do this\nAnd people are gonna be like you know what I'm over this he's not winning I told you it was especially the ... I mean the Kobe fans\nAre going to go out in the Bronx I see I told you it wasn't worth it why do we do it magic robber crazy he's hoping he's not Coby and you know what man let me live Dodgers including some and they want a World Series and that got a job\nThere is someone I Do think there's going to pay him if he if he\nWants to sit down with ... who knows ... shall we we said you know his last start might be as last any hits a beautiful gay he did and that was that was vintage courage shot when they needed them the most might've been his best clutch performance ever in the postseason for the Dodgers\nWhat if he has to come in tonight you know let's say ah you know it's one of those close games and and the kids run out of a gas Mueller has to walk out here's Kurt shop and he gives it up\nAnd they lose now he has to make a decision within ten days after the completion of the world series whether or not he is going to opt out for free agency\nOr you know play out the last few years of his contract to the tune of nearly Seventy million dollars if he were to call you ... ... I'm really on the fence what should I Do what do you think what do you think\nHere's the thing though he would have called me two or three months ago meaning I think he already knows if he ... that means maybe not one hundred percent for certain but maybe as aging look\nYou know making a teams ah razors and uh you know the tigers night are really interested they said we gave up on our land or too soon clearly maybe you have some left in the tank you know we're interested it's just a male be reminding you that we live in a city where near at least where the angels gave\nAlbert photos seven hundred million dollars for twenty five years I mean I could be exaggerating a bit they gave John Sam exascale through the summer right now hopefully doing speeches about addiction and and he's really rehabilitating hopefully and he's still Casson angels checks [laughter]\nSo there are some of the baseball [noise] who is going to pay could encourage job because they're going to look at it he's only what thirty he's thirty I'll be thirty one coming out only thirty the Yankees could use them thank you ... I mean ... and ... and to your point here\nThat's a yeah I I it's gonna be\nAn exciting and nervous were moments are when are you know with Bill before us on the side effects like hey I feel\nI ... my mother and my sister and I ... I was always around ... it's it's it's it's a it's a testament to how mainly I Am how to pull this off [laughter]\nYeah well your daughter's get older you going to have no say in that house a man I Know\nYeah well my daughter hanging on now yeah it's it it it's unbelievable I mean you know one day you you know I Will say that my daughter is it's still daddy daddy but you know when they're Seventeen as opposed to being you know two\nOr three daughters who are trying to boss me around or any man let me tell you my\nDaughter she's she'll be two next month we're ... we're starting to have some ... hey hey moments where I look at a now yeah she had no say everything is no no no no no no no no no you don't want to give her that say you want there's no no no no no and then she pulls me by my she pulls me by my shirt yeah\nSo I guess if I gave her I'm making it you know I give her a banana no no no no no so pulled me by my search to the to the cabinet right now and then she doesn't even know what she wants to go\nPut her finger on her cheek well how do you think that dynamic with the two girls has gone way yeah I Try hard to say hey let's try [laughter] there's an amazing me\nA war Samuel Jackson plays a character in a movie I forgot them that will be movie where if anybody recalls that tell me it's the movie where he takes some girl to be like a like a slave because she was I'm Ross say this ah [laughter]\nSelling her body will read okay but he wants to like teacher a lesson I don't I never really saw the movie but the mean they got\nThat black snake mon black snake mon they ain't got no but I knew I Know the mean you're talking about and there's like a chain or is yet and there's a meet with the ... his eyes that Samuel Jackson we all know his eyes but he's he's got like the character has a like gray and white hair all around and he's like\nHe looks his eyes are big he's looking like a you know looking crazy and they said this is the face when you become a father this is the face do you make Ninety percent of the day that is ...\nYour daughter transitions getting older a little bit where there will be moments that are\nCompletely out of your control and you just had them off to you're you're just like I I Do know that until your wife look that [laughter] I'm excited about that I'm excited about the ... even more you move on I give you an update on the poll for those all ... now what is going on you have a poll going on about the dynamic of\nGame seven of the national league championship series\nVersus LeBron's staples debut tonight\nOkay so um the poll right now as we speak ... thirty six percent of people saying they are more excited for the Brandon Lakers like the bronze staple center debut right sixty four percent now are saying they're more excited for the Dodgers are poor game seven in ...\nWell let me ask you this even though it favors the Dodgers how is it the thirty six per that they're not gonna allies saying that\nGame to an eighty two game regular season is more significant than the national league championship\n... I'm not gonna lie I'm with you that I thought it would be more twenty percent I I Know it'd be a decent percent to age but I didn't think it will be thirty six so I'll keep you updated maybe every hour or so I'll check back in\n... how can they get this poll where they\nLive Kay DU B. B. L. I. V. E. ...\nAway and we just re tweet it if you follow Fox Sports radio we just retweeted by very good\nIn on that Paul I I wanted to mention you know you know when you um\nWhen you have somebody that has done a job for a long long time usually toward the end of their career there's a certain reverence\nYou know you sort of appreciate why on this guy this individual has been around a long time and the only reason they'd been around a long time as they've done a great job and and there's just a a certain reverence like you know future hall of famer you know or you know let's say let's enjoy these find a year as well\nAnd his name is Joe West so boy the major league baseball umpire let let me put his his career as a major league empire in the context Jill West I'm prior to his first major league baseball game\nWhen Gerald Ford was still president [laughter]\nAs as Nineteen Seventy six he is actually I'm tired in more seasons\nForty than any empire in the history of baseball in fact he just passed Bruce from Maine for the second most games ever hired in the history of baseball guy named Bill Clinton from the early twentieth century is number one on the all time list\nSo you would think when you've done this job as long as he has and your name as the top or near the top ... an all these longevity records that you wouldn't be held in reverence in twenty eleven they did a poll of major league baseball players asking who is the best umpire and who is the worst\nFive percent five percent said Joe West was the best umpire in baseball\nThey always say that because that's the only may make a big write to us\nSame poll forty six percent said he was the worst um higher in baseball they did an updated pull he was voted the second worst umpire and baseball now I'm just trying to figure out how\nJoe West is still allowed to empire baseball games when he's been universally recognized is if not the worst one of the worst on a very short list of empires and all of baseball year after year and it was on full display would that ... bats\nAll too may play and so he's working the right field line and Joe ... gets it wrong every time again could move the bats have made the catch\nLet me just to get his blood up that high shows these amazing athleticism but that wasn't the question the rules states that once the ball clears the wall it's up for grabs if a fan reaches over the wall\nMember of the kid was his name Jeffrey a member of the Yankee oriole game that was over the wall if he reaches over the wall that's interference but what some of those over the wall\nIt's up for grabs\nAnd Joel West got the call wrong\nAnd then they want to replace did you just have to watch the the announcers are like oh that was clearly a home run you know great opera by ... but that was clear and he comes out of it out I'm like I don't even know maybe the replay hat or reverse and he still sitting up I'm not going to get overturned on this one yeah I'm cowboy Joel West\nOkay the only thing I can think of in that instance is if he did he by chance or get room\n[laughter] because I Believe ... years as a major league I mean\nPersonally Milky bets would've caught it but at the rules states hey it's fair game that far into into this you know friends that it's fair game then he has to go with that and less again remember I Will say and I don't like Joe ... so it's not fair but\nThe idea that it has to be you you have to confirm it you know has to be\nSubstantial evidence we have to know without a shadow of doubt otherwise you have to call it as it stands and he called it a and out and it has to stand because maybe he just didn't see enough evidence\n[laughter] I mean I don't know what ever the announcers the ball was over by the way Joel West did you see all the other earlier game in the playoffs he had this play it was a it was a play at second base on and there was an attempted steel ... and he is the second base umpire\nAnd the throw from the catcher hit some right in the chest\nFirst of all forget the fact that he couldn't get his large\nAbout the play well even if the ball had gotten a second base why are you standing ten feet in front of the bat how would you have even made a call safer out at second base based on where you actually standing my point is he's on fires have way too much\nGuaranteed longevity is not the Supreme Court okay this is baseball umpiring if a guy is not getting the job done if the players are recognized I think players should have a pretty good idea because they don't condemn all empires writer outliers in fact anything if I was a player I welcome good empires\nI I mean I applaud guys that you know have a good strike zone and I I Know where I stand that you're getting the job done but if you can just simply voted the worst or near the bottom\nHow are you still how it still guaranteed a job\nIt's strange because if it any other profession let's go the opposite of what you're saying if you're the worst ... you're let go\nYou know if you or I or elected we were the worst you get let go if somebody's been the worst day they definitely don't keep their jobs so why is baseball hell bent on keeping him I'll give you an example though where it seems very similar how ends badly and it left a bad taste and everyone's about\nIn the NBA joy Crawford\nYes where all those years he was he was a a a rough I mean ... years upon years he was the most known referee and then all of a sudden the last five six seven years you're like this guy's starting to lose it\nCalling terrible cost kicking Tim Duncan our Tim Duncan sitting on the bench\nIt's not far from the only one that could faults are more than any other one will be the NBA right or at least a year or what I just watch stories last night play the most in Utah Jazz who scored eighty one and a half right and somehow they still lost\nI Know that like that I was watching that game think in\nUtah has a tough place to play I think they were up like twelve yeah late in the third and you're like the team in control um by the way speaking of the NBA I Want to get to a a certain subject matter as far as early MVP we play one two

max will probably ride the wave of two ... maximum maximum\nSo I'm pretty sure that yeah I'm I'm Still you know where I Am I mean there is a goal or bringing sexy back\nI must admit [laughter] so [laughter] where it was like oh a sexy back and say I I could throw for more than a yard\nAnd you know I always say that like oh I could do this I could you know I'm married which are sort of hit that I can hit that you know you couldn't now I truly believe if you gave me Eighteen snaps college football you complete a pat I regularly for more than a I had gone to the twenty five yard [laughter] I really believe that\nI ... it does seem him pause especially in this day and age when everybody's throwing the ball so freely and you know again all the rules favor the fans and ... and I always also if you\nGave me if you gave me this entire season to get in shape and then you said next season\nYou can be the Fifteen minute on the Lakers and in one game will give you five minutes\nI can get you through I can get you through to\nReally I have a three throw a couple of times you think you get hit in Hungary\nI really believe that they do I do but he ... well what you'll get me a little brown James past world wide open how he does he jumps in the air and throw that to end up passing the corner\nMoney don't let me go to the grandma will pull ups and footage weight level\nI you know I think that when I was I I Am not watch a lot of NBA game regular season games beginning to end I did watch\nThe lake or Portland game from beginning to end and it it just one of those historic moments where first of all you're just trying to get your eyeballs adjust to the fact that that's a little brawn James in a lake or uniform\nSomething about that whole dynamic scenes way out of whack because this this is a problem that little bit and when we were even talking about this earlier off air about the whole dynamic of liberal on with the Lakers\nThat even if he were to win four straight championships as a Laker it will never change the mind of Michael Jordan supporters the joins the greatest of all time correct no matter what he does LeBron James he will never get over the Jordan home\nFor a lot of people maybe even most people so I think that he is\nComfortable with where he is in history I don't think he worries about it I think his mindset is already on life after basketball I think he's made that clear since he moved to LA with all his multitude of projects is involved with but the problem for him is is\nLaker fans do not care what he did as a cab a layer or as a Miami they don't care the only thing that Laker fans will judge him on his what he does as a Laker and ultimately it that does not include a championship\nHis stay with Laker fans will be an F\n[noise] first of all now mayor of honor him but that's where a Laker fan of alternative volume down on that being Roberta okay the money it was never been that allowed ever before and now all of a sudden he's talking about the brown and lake or the I'm deaf over here you got it so loud doesn't like Gillibrand now does that number to live\nIn a number two oh you like or is not even Laker fans ...\nIts Coby fans let's be specific yeah because there is a factor this society in LA yeah who actually just say I root for the Lakers therefore I Love Coby and I am bracelet brown because he's the best player and he's a liquor and hopefully get this back to prominence\nThere is there is a portion of of LA fans Lakers specifically I mean but then there is majority or the Kobe fan Roberto can't even give me eye contact right now he won't even look I'd be abrasive around but he's not Coby ... why does it have to water that happen to be that why is that they just why can't you just say I\nBooms and you weren't bums with koby the last few years almost pose any ... told me he already done his thing\nI don't but my point is data and bad and now we have a chance to be great are going to miss that great but good potentially grave you're going to run and then whoever they get next summer why ... why is it like this right Ron I got about half clap and I know in the back and I think tell me if I'm wrong I think\nMore Kobe's what they'd rather the Lakers felt with ... no ... no no no no and a lot oh I I ... I like I Love Kobe Bryant of the Lakers way more okay\nThen you are different but I mean this might be a new play I go I I think you hit something on on the on the head because there are Kobe fans where there's Kobe and there's everything out there somewhere to though the Kobe I I used to just marvel at this and I I had a lot of\nYou know back and forth the Kobe about this I'm not blaming Kobe and this is other people's perception of him\nBut yes I mean like is that reminded Kobe I was a Laker fan long before you were born\nI mean there's there's a lineage of three dominant forces in lake or history Jerry West Magic Johnson Kobe Bryant everybody else other they got from elsewhere you know all the bags they got all sort of liberal on is is an import but when you have those lifelong Lakers Jerry West Magic Johnson Kobe Bryant\nThose are the three biggest names in the history of the Lakers and\nThat's the lineage and yeah they're they're just a completely different dynamic but Coby was the extreme I mean it got to the point where nothing else mattered I remember going when you know when they have that down period when Shaq left before a pow showed up and it was just Kobe throwing up eighty one point\nThey were like a dream I like this was their dream like we don't have to worry about anybody else hits all of our combing shoot\nDoug is calling me gets points that's a signal you wait\nIn an argument for me [laughter] so those people that were part of that era you're right there's no way there rooting for LeBron ... I'm a I'm going to go to Twitter\nAnd Instagram with that kind of live I think there is no greater fan base in this entire world except maybe a K pop group 'cause man they have some fans across the world right I don't know if you're up on that are you on that yet K pop\nNow you already know that is no you don't know ... during the break I'm catching up we are safe fans the beehive ... and Coby fans those are the two they go heads up those are the two greatest fan base is in the world\nI mean you do not say anything about beyond say if I just randomly go right now ... ... sucks\nThe Dodgers when they're going back to the world series to lose our do they keep getting crushed shot today Robert Gibbs job what do you do with this guy doing finally try I'll see if we got a lot of things happen based on this game tonight with the Dodgers\nHigh so continue to get the votes in I Wonder if that's going to flip it all seems like it's pretty steady I think it was one study at this point um but I don't know maybe it'll be interesting to talk about it\nWhen I come back the next week I'll be out but what are you know or maybe I'll talk about it on Twitter that closer to gain time I think it's going to be interesting because you can you know you say something in the ... by the way they move the Dodgers game back to five oh now it was a six to nine and they moved to the five oh now why do you think they did it\nBecause of the labor game it's seven thirty that's in power right their head is somehow a we have our second game of eighty two\nCan you move your game back a little bit about it's like it's a matter of the game was at six oh nine so you at seven thirty year like you know fifth inning and it's like a tie game or a silver\nFlip over to a Laker game man that's when I say one of the national league championship series you would think baseball would be like by golly we used to be America's pastime and we're not budging either way I have I don't know I had to sign that said that I have a an a\nOh lord yeah uh 'cause I have rarely rarely talk about it I mean never yeah I have a Heisman vote oh boy and so because of that we have a very special segment\nOf the high male\nMen up tight so each week I went up day to where I stand one two three\nM. I. Heisman bally things have been pretty steady [noise]\nBut we really haven't even gotten to the media to sketch everything alma normally at this time of the year it gets down to like the last three or four weeks\nAnd I've had weeks we're all three of my guys are gone the next week\nYou suddenly get those big games where you know this guy better do oh he doesn't miss I didn't even see the sky where to go up so it's going to start getting interesting in the weeks ahead in the race or Heisman that being said here's my current number three\nTexas only twenty five thirty one Murray you gonna run to the south side\nTold me rolling field with the call right there Well Tyler Murray had the week off last week by the way today\nOr his final networks to give you a Oklahoma just teach you fifty two twenty seven Murray off day Nineteen twenty four two hundred and Thirteen yards for touchdowns no ... or ... yeah that'll keep a minute that should keep a minute here is my current number\nTwo has just the staff picks they handle the Minnesota thirty five throws\nDown hill Seventy order slippers bring some of the founders\nHaskins probably running a right to the end zone Jamil with it\nTwelve yards passing three touchdowns new picks leaves the nation with twenty eight touchdown bachelors I'm Sorry who is that on the Caldera given that was\nA Ohio State I Am gee what they call their eyes so Murray three Haskins too I guess what can let me ask you this what can I ask you do to jump to number one I mean at this point I Will tell you I Will tell you I Will tell you he's getting close but he's not quite there here's my one\n\n[laughter]\n[noise]\n\nWhy he like older cars to voice their on their field to attack of Iowa actually had an off day [noise]\nHe really didn't have overwhelming numbers but he did throw up or to sixty five and three touchdowns and the winner gets Missouri on the year Twenty one touchdown passes no picks protected by lower this year on the number one team of the countries also run for a couple of touch downs I show you mentioned Haskins [noise]\nI I Will say this if Haskins I mean look at the\nBig games coming up he'll be at Michigan State and a few weeks obviously wraps up the gets Michigan if Ohio State roles roles and goes undefeated ... wins Big Ten championship game and they get they go undefeated\nTo me it's going to be a coin flip no matter what Tego by law does the rest of the way I mean if both quarterbacks go undefeated\nI think it's going to be a very close vote for the ... Heisman\nI agree I still think the only thing that could hurt too is ah if if all of a sudden Jay Lynn hurts maybe get a little bit more run a he gets a couple of more plays and it ...\nWay maybe there's Alabama fatigue\nWere voters and you know there are still human you guys are human I think your human up [noise] and um and maybe it is I I'm Alabama doubt because they went championships with high summons they got out of that and so maybe that could have something to do with it but the way to ask you again I keep mentioning this week in week out of the scariest thing is how he's better than\nAny other Ohio State quarterback but every Myers had ... or liars has\nHad you know quite a few really good quarterback but none of which made any mark obviously ... Miller curtail Joan ... none of these guys have any NFL I mean any\nOther okay like I had signed the guy that suddenly went to the next level and showed something I'd agree with you on that I Will say however\nThat they're in the NFL right I mean ... all of a sudden turn into a receiver Cordell Jones is colonel Jones get released by the chargers somebody's going to pick them up here will be the league for another five seven years were you one of those people when he had an amazing runs the national go\nOh this guy is a revelation remember then he had the big press conference we'll assumed he was going to the NFL and he goes I'm staying I'm like man wow\nListen I mean he looks so good for three games let me tell you about the thirty games ... good what there'll be called cardio Jones the reason you should leave that it has got to be spinning during ... Barclay yeah barley another guy you I'm Serious it's okay here's the reason why if the\nUltimate goal is to go turn professional as it is for any of us in college right you go to college because you want to turn professional royal I tell my boys\nAll the time understand college is a stepping stone to your life out of college exact you need to learn something in college that is going to be applicable to your future there you have it so if that is the case then why\nIt might not going to turn pro at an extremely high rate mines you not just turned ... maybe\nThese are probably be like a top Fifteen pick you better go I I\nLook at it I cannot agree with you more the idea of staying in college is ridiculous if the option is there\nFor you to go to the next level only example I think is I Do think it's a bit different in basketball because it's one man has a different route to his wife or who's supposed to be the guy this year so here's a guy on Williams\n... and let's say they're going to be a top three pick is I on came back\nI think most likely okay you're dropped down at the end but he's not going much further than that football there are rounds\nAnd you can drop from one to five of us all your shelf life is shorter and football than it is any other actually so ... ... am money and the guaranteed by the way there was a turnover Michigan fumbled are at their own about ten Fifteen yard line and Michigan State recovered it so now they have a chance to finally puts a points on the board\nBy the way I I Do want to mention one guy in my Heisman Shays because I'm reminded by gathering all the time\nOr speaking of Justin Herbert of course the Oregon quarterback and it was interesting last week or so to monitor some of the other Heisman pools in the ESPN he was actually six\nThey add add all over the defensive tackle the Houston for it I mean the big three that I mentioned are everyone's top three right now they're all ... in\nThe back of Memphis got more votes than Justin Herbert who by the way is being mentioned right now is perhaps the best NFL prospect in this year ...\nYes okay\nWhat do you wish that upon anybody honestly at this point just every what they're saying that he'll go to the New York giants the giants having passed on a quarterback to take say Kwan Barclay if they're if they're season plays out the ... or the way it looks right now\nWell done trust they trusted the process ... three D. chest pain here if you're telling me I can get the best player in this year's draft and say Kwan Barclay ... methane is the best quarterback clearly 'cause he's not what I mean he's not that position but the best player yeah now I have a back for a decade\nHey you're telling me we're going to still stay with the lie\nAnd I just signed arguably one of the best top three receivers in the game so I got back from junior I got sick one on the cheap and I'm going to get a quarter back here on the cheap because it's not like this Matthew ... right man they won okay I've got a quarterback receiver in a in a in a running back\nThat was a YouTube sensation that he started to blow it become a famous OJ Mayo yes I remember OJ Mayo is with the first guy I met him all the way Michigan working and just start in radio and they just read your mailman OJ Mayo might not like a little light mailbox damage but [laughter]\nAnd the little orange juice you own a mayor is not a good combo and so and actually you know he ended up having a good career but not great but he was the first guy I remember being in there and you always have that so you're right it was I on Williams is have this opportunity to go and make a hundred and twenty five people want to go see him\nBecause he got a dog what everybody's going to be spoiled\nOught to remember this whatever NBA gee league team gets a certain player then they also have an amazing advantage because they get to centrally scout this guy twenty four seven and then make a decision next year and the draft\nWhether this guy is a guy that they want to keep on the team where they want to move up in the draft to keep them\nI I did it again I it sounds okay because I liked the idea that these kids have an option a viable option not some lame option or twenty five thousand dollars for one year with the ability to sign an agent immediately and make additional money and everything else\nSounds fair for these lead high school basketball players\nBut this is where it's falling into a a gray area and right now today breaking story about this impasse between the players association and the NBA on how to dissolve the one and done lower the AIDS back down to Eighteen\nYou know the NBA they don't want to have to be scouting and high schools this was a nightmare\nLike that but they don't have the resources to be sitting there at high school I have to figure out whether this guy's right for the NBA right now if I got a list of all the kids who went straight out of high school and the NBA\nI'm willing to bet\nForty percent of them were either real players in the league you know where they had a career right so it took to the LeBron and Kobe status\nI'm On a bed because there's a lot of guys who went straight out of high school and NBA that we don't think about that ah that had a heck of a career we just forget like JR Smith had a heck of a career yeah Monti Ellis out here and there was over ... Lewis there's a lot of guys\nWho came straight germane on there and we always uh Kobe Bryant immigrating drugs were we'll go we'll go Kobe the broader main O'Neill then we'll go Kwame you know what I mean we were both extremes there's yeah guys with Dwight Howard\nI'm willing to bet\nForty percent and that's just like any draught abs absolutely\nI Want to see if I can find out well you figure that our and the guy go Fox Sports radio studios are as we get ready to find out who's going to face the red Sox in the world series with tonight's game seven of the national league championship

you just like for a great great now for the day I'm great I'm a great uh my dad was a math teacher oh yeah no\nGeico Fox Sports radio studios Fifteen minutes it's David Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance guy could account for free rein quote it's going to get hot today less than it is a big day in sports we got a game seven in baseball LeBron's going to play\nHis uh his first home game as a Laker or Cory pocket where in the studio with a bunch of Laker fans who are still like I I don't know if they like\nActually made out with their Kobe pose there's this morning\nIn order to make it okay I have to root tonight like there's there's all there's a big dichotomy going on in the city right now and then also all the college football that everybody can handle and uh and and the potential injury in the NFL that we're going to have to set my alarm at five thirty in the mornings or more to find out if\nA guy's active or not we'll tell you about that so there's tons going on and I'm so excited or to to jump into all of it here's the math question I Would go there was a math class\nOK is a winning percentage of Seventy four percent good is that good but it's excellent that's excellent that's excellent so standing by the way here's a so\nYou're thirty four and twelve mhm your winning percentage is about Seventy four but if you go thirty five and twelve\nYour winning percentage still rounds off to about Seventy four but you more about Seventy four and a half ... that's what's on the line right now for big blue the fight and horrible cause\nNow I just wanted to throw this piece of math out and then you tell me whether this is a worthwhile piece of math or not\nAll right so Jim harbors winning percentage at Michigan is Seventy four percent he is thirty four and wealth they're up fourteen to seven with two minutes to go in the third quarter against Michigan State there'd be a very big win and then he would be\nJim Harbaugh never wins big games is disappointing with his time in Michigan did you know the Knicks savings career college winning percentage\nIs only about Seventy seven Seventy eight percent right about the same thing er which is obviously incredible incredible to be an almost eighty percent at his winning percentage if you just look at Alabama I think he is actually potentially over eighty percent it's it's incredible\nBut Nixon's career college winning percentage about Seventy seven and a half percent and Jim Harbaugh is about Seventy four and a half percent\nSo why don't we doing\nI mean come on hot take what are we doing Hi tell me\nWhat are we doing well out but now what do what now are there any drawing\nMan I Know you're dead is great with the numbers\nMight be listening right now and I know what you just did the math problem that you bought up yeah\nThey're Seventy four percent when he's at Michigan comparing savings career record of Seventy seven ... you\nYou kind of move the goalposts a little bit how I Do that because you didn't tell me what are you that Alabama well knows diary is higher or much higher right not much I mean you can't how much higher can you go into super high yeah yeah yeah like I'm In urban Meyer only one year\nNot Alabama and it was his first one do I think that they have been lost more than three games right one time it's ... it's amazing and so so I'm not here to tell you the gym or was Nick Saban\nNo but I'm here to tell you but the group that is right behind him he's in the group there however\nWhen you dig deeper there are some valid concerns about his inability\nTo win the big games while he's been at Michigan are there yeah he hasn't been he had to be his rival Ohio State well he did ever\nThey moved out I Can't worry about the goalpost it was moved the ball I Can't where does that mean there's no better but neither can eat like how can a coach went a game if the officials move the ball he just didn't win so he does that but when it gets Ohio State how it does in my mind\nYeah in ... he his record against the others when you look at Michigan State Penn State ... Wisconsin He has been\nLowered it over those he's been right around average in dealing with those\nThose teams so he's going to be one of them today at their place re now think he'd go we gotta we gotta hit a major event you know it it will it will yeah Michigan when the game you know and again\nSo I think he is one of the top five coaches in college football\nHold on both can we stop right there yeah didn't we stop right there right but right now he's a effort with no clothes\nYou know in the ... in his city at the same clothes that he's not on we need some titles\nNeed something I Need a big tent title title of the national ... minute big money only the coaches women national championship or validated I'm about to fire a lot of people now or I mean yeah there's a lot a lot of people\nThere are a lot of people but the standard is when ... I mean so if I can win a national tired and I can't win the big can it can at least have bragging rights is either have bragging rights over are you a steak\nCan I ask you if the standard at Michigan football is national championship is it yeah they won as a titled there before how ... how ... in Ninety eight or nine nights I was Twenty years ago yeah before we actually even how did I suppose yams ... but it's been proven that it can be done they can what course it can be done\nAnd even even even when it Notre Dame but they don't do it anymore\nI don't know like but you remember who Jim Hobart play for right a bow shepherd's pie from Michigan to quote there is there in in\nThey're not chance right now is this fifth or I mean how am I suppose the way what do you\nMean how long how long I lay out the way the way I mean\nThere was like oh you know it is so I Can't have my cake and eat it too I'm just moved to look at a cake\nA I've never understood that phrase right because who the hell has cake by not eating never understood that when the only thing I mean\nWhat is having your cake and not eating it mean what does that mean I Want to you well know exactly what else would you do with ... so the unless you go there and you're just shoving it in your new spouses face that's the only other thing I've seen someone doing okay\nRight so now I'm Jim ... look you're more of a ... you say this is your ...\nIsn't it is time right well okay it's time and\nI Wish I had for like ... and how we don't ... recruits how we're doing we're doing OK okay we do OK well Seventy Seventy four percent is like really solid over five or ... or number six in the nation but we gotta when\nEverybody tells me that it's all about rings is all about rings and think why do you listen to those people because a lot there are days where I wake up especially in Southern California and I go hey say it's gonna rain and guess what it doesn't [laughter] yeah but I don't really care what they say the people\nThe people to tell me that you judge by titles\nYeah brings such than watching them why St Charles Barkley employed why is this on popular why do you do when ... exactly when but how does it when he speaks on TNT or you just like a loser no there's no thank you\nExactly he don't care about all of it you don't care about all I don't care about the whole they let anybody you know it well ... how do you want to be I mean did they ... they just let me introduce my intro as you go hall of famer even though I played five years and didn't really do anything we can just say hold her favorite fell Jennifer Psaki\nFor not being ready blown up or phone right now okay thanks maybe that's something to do with the fact that they're still sending out minutes going the same because of all whether delight earlier or what the fighting\nOn that the fans are you kidding me the only reason Michigan State scored wants today's 'cause Michigan fumbled the red zone\nThat they've been driven the ball on them all day long about is about to be Twenty one in seven twenty seven extra point on the way machine's gonna win a feel good about it fighting horrible as thirty five it's well what a great coach I'm All right [laughter] yeah so ... uh let me run this by you\nSo the two biggest words in sports I feel like our game seven mhm I'm the only reason I hesitated on that is because they don't apply to football and football's the biggest sport out there but a game seven gets people's attention no matter who's playing in about a no matter the sport and so we got a good one night\nAnd I've been a you know tongue in cheek poke poke poke fun at the expense of the Dodgers all year because of something that happened at the beginning of the season what happened and I wonder if you remember this do you remember\nThat there last preseason game I think they're supposed to play the angels and the freeways series at Dodger Stadium and they cancelled the game because poop literally starting to seep up\nLike a septic tank or something broke and there was like poop on the field and so there were like you know what let's just go home this is awful I'm this doesn't smell good we don't you know we've got more to do so I don't know about you I Believe in in science\nLeaving I Believe I Believe that you believe this is why I Believe in the season I don't go into in in ...\nI don't know I don't know see the thing about science is you don't know if when you see a sign if it is a sign store and a half as I Am I going to follow this or not so when I saw that I'm like\nOh that's that's not good that's that's not a good side not it doesn't mean it's definitely side but it ...\nGame seven at home of the world series think of the Atlanta Falcons and the cost of the super bowl everybody goes oh there's got to be hanging over the next year a little bit and so I'm thinking I think this might happen to the Dodgers to\nAnd for most of the year it looks pretty accurate the most of the year it looked like they weren't going to win the division ... and then they rally ended up in the final week and they had to go to the extra game and they won that extra game and they won the division so great job\nAll right so let me ask you this\nBased on the payroll the expectations what happened last year\nIf they lose tonight is out of crab season no not at all\nNow Roberto who is wearing a Dodger hot is nodding and the other room which is why I asked I Know that the global answer is no but I Want to know how it will be received by the people who care my contention is the answer is yes I mean I hear you do\nDodger fan [laughter]\nOr heart goes through their voters do different things going on here\nThere are a lot of people who live in LA this is what happens anytime somebody gets into the playoffs right all of a sudden at the bars everybody's like oh I'm a Dodger fan\nI'm a Dodger fan I [laughter] Dodgers okay\nYou know no no no no you don't actually care I don't know I'm not saying you I'm Talking about the person that's like yes won't have to Moscow meals in La Crosse the Dodgers getting in in in in a whole lot of social I'm Talking about and I'd charger fan\nOr you know I mean are you I'm not because I Know I'm not keeping the book there's no score card every day I watch them on TV or not\nHey look OK so third at best correct maybe but and some tells you actually like golf better than baseball\nI mean tiger's playing [laughter] when you go see a series of do case there were no hell no orders fan now it's like somewhat with the band the kids watch Dodgers game I was okay wait it out there I can tell you asked me you know to ask you about your belt lineups in order to know this is his\nTonight please last games of Dodger no no no I Can't be see I I every time you say now I look up and Roberto the Dodger fan is nodding probably yeah it could be because I mean they might win so that it definitely wouldn't be but if they will\nLick the bed and [laughter] they might break the pat tonight and I had two other kids that were going to let them let them out\nHere is how I can test you if they lose tonight how long does it take you to get over it\nI mean\nI'll be over by midnight for [laughter] and that's the problem if all goes through a ...\n[laughter] I went to the next day which\nBy the way and and I wouldn't be distracted because the Lakers you're okay so because I Know let's give you another scenario\nGame starts at five or not we know that these things and like I don't really know at least I didn't even like sales so far I don't know I have seven thirty I'm expecting them to be an I don't know about the third inning and the ... will be on their aid censure sweet so it's the third inning the Dodgers are up to no one\nThe brewers are making their age pitching change\nAnd suddenly this time it's LeBron time what you're doing it to see the king\nOf the the game for a minute there ain't no doubt [laughter]\nAin't no Dodger fan I guess you would do without a Dodger fan I got to see\nWhat again what did you sign by the way your how I Am a flip back when they're when they're up to bat when Alonzo some\nI Am a flip flip back and

perfect I'm not saying they should have been I'm just passing along they will not suspend them they did find him one hundred and twelve thousand dollars\nThat's only because he's viewed as a repeat offenders so that's one of the finest so egregious viewed\nAs a repeat offender it appears that you might not agree with this\nI mean some of those things\nAre you are defending wants is perfect this will be the first time I've heard someone to do this this week\nWell obviously this all the rules\nAre designed for the quarter back then I get it into receivers are kind of walk through the tulips in the middle of the field and never get it right and so\nAnd certainly rocky and have it both ways you can't actively seek extra yards and that is maybe get drilled that's part of the deal\nRight but have and some of these hits looked\nVery very head hunter is I mean it'd be slowing down like one thing to get Bert ... slow and it's one thing to get hit hard it's another words that are leading with the crowd at the helmet into another helmet\nYeah but he he didn't the other guy Jesse Bates is the one that made him and he ... he just kind of gave him a little form up into the gym but no look to the music\n[laughter] it's like a high type fits you're such a deep be as they like\nCome on man von says is darn oh God says is dirty I'm and I'm an artist and he's a clean his player however he's dirty\nMe\nYou have to be able to shut down the middle of the field I mean I Know you have you have record numbers up quarterbacks throwing all over the yard receivers catching balls everywhere doing whatever they want to do\nRecord number little a middle of the field yep record numbers of concussion door scoring is up\nYou can hit people hard you can't hit him in the head\nWith some ... legend quit French and quit floods and good luck in trying to get down man [laughter] you can try something a lot um penalize for you to run the turtle look\nListen there are a lot of DVDs in football I haven't noticed any of the other ones do it this way I haven't noticed any of them by the way I Know he's not even a deep yeah there's yeah there's nobody does it like this so why are we defending him nobody else I'm not talking about anybody else I'm not talking about general rules about violence as\nPerfect every team is evident force\nEvery team okay every good defense has to have an air force and none of the other teams have won like this how are you playing because even well nobody's playing defense right and I think it is because they're not they are the ... by the way you know having been forced to get out and went in the middle didn't weren't did it to discourage any better on a minute and went right\nDown to feel like I had lived through butter last week we did yep I'm All right here's the other note Melvin Gordon has been downgraded to questionable with a hamstring injury he wasn't even on the injury report at the end of the day yesterday\nSyrup right see next week I mean\nOur best to charges of also just promoted a running back from the practice squad do they're active roster although we don't calling Melvin a game time decision and led super serve what the audience actually thinking about here because it's not just about the chargers and one of their big off into weapons\nI'm Melvin Gordon is one of the if not the biggest player in fantasy football this year and if you live on the west coast like [noise] I Do and have melted on your fantasy team like [noise] I Do know you're going to wake up about five thirty in the morning tomorrow to figure this out [laughter] if you are you going to give them is eight months off at six thirty in the morning\nAnd you got to be ready because you probably won't know till tomorrow as to whether or not he's going to play\nA ...\nPromoted to go to ... but they downgraded him the question will I think this points to the sun and he's not going to be ... in fact pose a betting man and I could put a ... been up in Vegas\nI Would probably put the ... over what color sweatshop he wears [laughter] more cars in London so dizzy where the blue in the where the white one how sick is it\nYou gotta buy coming up next week yeah and I know the NFL teams don't think this way but it's oh they charge you should be with or without Melvin Gordon\nI Know the titans are three and three or whatever the heck they are but it's a team that charges should be with or without Melvin going they should be able to beat them I Would think that they can knock them out okay you're telling me my fantasy team's gotta know Gordon for two weeks now\nI'm not out who else you know I mean there are other people but that's my guy\nI'm a guy that's my first round draft pick and he's been performing like one on one of the few guys that has the first time I've been listening performing like a first round draft pick David Johnson no maybe on bell no Antonio Brown no Alvin Kamara they're worried about a marking on his back down because you know on and on and on\nSo early and like you know drafted girl [laughter] they did I got in the last well you're the cream hot soda girlie Gordon\nThose are the guys that one too if you're in a redo it today right\nOkay so that's the problem [laughter]\nI mean the problem is is a bit of land is a bit of a guy as my guys are ... you know it is personal smell luckily I'm a morning person so I'll be up at five thirty with the kids no matter what anyway we'll be checking the Adams chapter on Twitter and Jay clays or whatever\nUm but ah yeah that that is not trending in the good direction um by the way speaking of fantasy football I wanted to bring this uh this is really interesting and then Alex market as ...\nThey set a new low\n[laughter] four\nGames televised on broadcast [laughter]\nOkay now what that means is a game it's televised on like at work television network television's a standalone primetime game it wasn't just on a cable network is all\nOf the combined rating of six point six was well below the prior all time low generated by a sea hawks buccaneers game on Sunday Night Football ten years ago that was the all time low\nBut let's be honest with both of these teams\nWith Arizona corners you don't have a national fan base correct this isn't a scene that it is it a national team lost and ... now a little bit but I I just feel like you kind of have to regional teams playing out if there's one has a chance to expand beyond\nMixtape once you spread makes David likes to not cover the spread every single week so let's keep an eye on that twenty eight so there you go everybody in Vegas furious again mixtape and keeping them alive\nThe extra points and it's thirty five to fourteen for Alabama's swimming it goes in and it does All right so there you go keep an eye on that ah for everybody who has got some sports gaming going on Alabama today\nI'm All right mark with a Bucky Brooks let's get Alex mark as any our buddy it's been a little while so alec thank you so much for coming on where you were you settle this forest because we were just having a conversation with a fine and know suspension coming down for volunteers perfect\nIt certainly sounded to me Bucky or like you or advocating or the volunteers perfect defenders still need to be able to play as well everybody needs an enforcer I think the guy is a completely dirty player who's out of line Alex water most people in the NFL think\nDirty player who's completely out of line down and you know there was in listen this was\nTrying to hurt somebody and I think that was really the the sentiment of you know where that form that was going in you know unless it's old school type of stuff Mike Brown is an old school type of owner I think that there's there's a feeling inside that organization and I know I'm pretty darn well that you know he adds the toughness\nTo this team and an intensity on defense that you know quite honestly among some players and the league you may not find today you know just because it is a different league or than it was back in the day when you had some guys like their story out there that\nYou know that they took it maybe to a different level at sometimes listen I understand there's an intimidation factor and it's something that you want to be able to get across and again that's why he continues to stick with the Bengals he liked by his teammates he's really smart guy\nWhen it comes to knowing the defense but at what point you know it was enough enough and you have someone who's out they're not there to play football but to intentionally hurt people and I really think that's that the NFL and when you fire that shot across the bow with a hundred twelve thousand dollars in fines\nOn somebody owned by the way let's not forget contest also losing some paychecks earlier this year on a P. E. D. suspension I mean there's a hitch in the wall and they should get his attention stop doing this\nYeah I think you're definitely will have to get a detention um when you think about the bingo squat in with buttons Burbank having these issue how to more of a new deal with it when you have a player who is reckless but it's also one of the best way that you have all different\nBut it's funny you guys were talking about the Alabama Tennessee score writer and you know I used to cover Nick Saban back in the house the on days when I was in Miami Dolphins beat writer and he said that if you keep doing the same things you get the same results guaranteed\nMartin Lewis and a lot of ways continues to do the same things by keeping people aren't as perfect\nOn his team right I mean you know what what does it say two or three other teammates when this guy continued to get a chance after chance by this organization you know and and putting his team team in a tough spot you know what I mean can you trust Vaughan says when the pressures on if someone is taunting him not to do something of that is you know that's\nMarvin doesn't want to give up on players this is a guy who you know we'll stick with his guys until the end he'll fight for them I mean and Marvin himself monopoly paid there's anything wrong with with volunteers perfect did it and this is from a guy was part of the NFL competition committee but look or these the same old Bengals but you were going to find out a lot about this team a lot more about the steam\nComing off that Stiller's loss that was the same old Bengals type of thing right loser the Pittsburgh Steelers at home I Believe it's seven straight now they've lost five straight home games I mean so you know that's the same old Bengals singles in primetime against good opposition that's also offer the same old type of thing you know if you look at any dolphins numbers\nWhen he's on on you know the primetime matchup they're usually not very good now they did beat the Baltimore Ravens and we too but I'm very curious to see what bingo team showed up and if they're the ones that could potentially slowdown Patrick mountain the chiefs on Sunday Night Football\nAlex how did you read things from the jaguars perspective I get what Cleveland is doing hey let's get another a drop pig\nAnd let's clear some time for next job because he looks really talented but in the jaguars acquiring Carlos Hyde yeah Leonard foreigners hurt but we didn't think he was going to be out for that much longer DJ yelled and has looks really good and been productive when I'm Out why did they need Carlos Hyde and what's their plan\nWell I think their plan is to you served TJ yelled and to be quite honest with you and you know a little bit of a I don't wanna say diminishing returns but he just doesn't scare anybody I mean his big carry game came against the New York jets Eighteen carries from fifty two yards\nAgainst Kansas City ten Terry's for fifty three yards but they were just so far behind and really get to run again going and then I think you saw against Dallas said Carey's for just forty one yards and it looks like from that I Would not be surprised if he misses another three to four weeks because of this hamstring injury and then at that point that's where a guy like Carlos Hyde can really help you\nAnd you know cars running backs you can get up to speed I mean I get so many questions about well why don't the cowboys trade for mark Cooper why don't they trade for you know blank wide receiver right and I'm trying to explain look you guys don't remember Roy Williams eleven years ago right when\nSorry the first round picks for him and how he couldn't\nGordon is around the New England patriots but he's not their first off not their second option on that team right I mean you're just working him into the system\nYou know because ... who by the way reportedly didn't make the flight to Chicago I and maybe out on Sunday you know those are your main guys so you know again that's what I think some of the differences with that type of situation but for look for this jak team they're built to win right now\nYou know they've got a lot of contracts coming up guys I mean even with the salary cap the way that it is and I know numbers can be manipulated we're talking about the team that is projected to be over a cap of a hundred and Ninety million dollars\nAnd it's going to have some tough decisions to make up some veterans that they're trying to get some traction going this season\nThey believe Carlos Hyde can provide some of the punch to that often in a running game because when I talked to people in that organization they're feeling as this third innate we've got trouble third and three we can do that and we'll be okay by the way why didn't they trade for a slot corner maybe they should have done that as well because that's another area where they're really hurting just as cold easily he's still getting arts against him right now\nYou know it's funny because you know about um having someone to replace potentially teacher yelling or being able to have a feeling ... but the elephant in the room is Blake morals\nI my sense was cause I was brought over not only do give them a star runner or lead runner litter permitted there it can is a doubling down that if we can run the ball consistently are quarterback isn't good enough\nTo get us to the promised land what do you think about the sentiment of Blake borders in Jacksonville right Neal\nYou've always been a smart guy in ten thousand percent\nBehind you right there and they've got a they they're not trying to give up on like ... you don't hear talk about oh them go into a backup you know Cody cast for is going to start getting a shot for the Jacksonville Jaguars\nThey know that wouldn't Blake gets on a role that that he can be effective as a quarterback you know he's a guy who can make plays with his legs I mean you know it and that's you know you got to have some fear in the running game to be able to open up some things in the past and game I think that's how they feel let's not forget to end this is something that\nSt Louis diminutive he's about five eight five nine but man oh man the guy just always seems to be in the right place at the right time and when he went down and you combine that with with Leonard for that they tried doing some scrap heap stuff running back and it just wasn't working you know Jamal Charles I mean\nSadly he's just seen better days so that's the thing and look in two thousand Nineteen it's a different world right I mean the drugs will have some decisions to make it the quarterback position that can be criticized for saying you know why didn't you dropped a quarter back this year put 'em in the pipeline did you really need to take a defensive lineman\nIn round one my feeling was that they they are going to be moving on from Dante Fowler junior they've got to pay homage and got way they're paying class Campbell you got ... Jackson I mean I you know you've got a lot of big money guys there I'm ourself dairy is so you know you're going to need a defense along with us on point but that's where you wonder\nCould you have taken Lamar Jackson and spending you're developing him and then you could move on from Blake bottles\nIn twenty Nineteen but I think that you didn't want to cause their own controversy this year at quarterback you know they felt that they were so close because that defense would be able to carry him to play really solid special teams under Jodie from Alice in the office would be okay and would benefit from both of those things clearly not the case they very desperate jak team heading into Sunday's game against Houston\nAlice Martinez joining us Fox Sports radio OK Allison I think this actually might be an interesting spot for the giants on Monday Night because it Lana is sold bang job\nDefensively put them on a fast track let's see if they can actually score some points I don't know if they'll stop Atlanta but it might be a spot where the giants can do some things in common everything down\nBut man do they need it like what what is the fallout although down bathrooms comments immoral family even getting in on the conversation where does it go from here and what changes might be made if any\nWell see this is such a a these are the types of things that that that organizations do right you sign a player to a contract expecting them to change because they've been paid\nHuh yeah I think about it don't don't you change first show you've changed over a period of time and then get paid\nLike that and that's exactly what's happened here without backroom junior I think that they believe that oh del by paying him you wouldn't get some of the public comments that that are being made you got someone who started this whole thing\nBy going outside the box doing a non approved team interview with an ESPN employee and and kudos addressing the Anderson for having that type of relationship to get it done you got a little easy sitting in\nAnd you got your quarterback getting thrown under the bus and you've got a guy who seems completely on appreciative of the franchise\nThat paid him record setting money to play for them and to be a representative of the team and\nYou know then you get into this it's everything is becoming about oh do back from junior again right you've got a new head coach and new general manager and patch rumor was hoping some of the stuff you know you'd have live veteran leaders be able to lean on O'Donnell to keep them you know keep them out of the spotlight now we have a dealer oh back and junior apparently doesn't like war\nWell although office wind certainly not helping them I mean the guy drops back and if someone in his lab communism some sometimes you know what I'm times they're not playing\nThey're not playing great However I've seen Tom Brady play with any and everybody up front of him doesn't affect him to the point the way it affects you\nLived or worked out so if what you're telling me is the giants had a chance to take quarterback last year didn't do it ... and oh Dell is basically going public because what he's trying to get across is don't you dare make this mistake again next year\n'cause now I'm here a long term and you're about to ruin the prime of my career your fifth and you don't\nFix this now if that was the fundamental point he was trying to make mhm [noise] that I think it was productive\nBut I actually think this works out better for the giants and I can no longer say because people to take me to task on social media multiple times because in the past years up until giants fans to printed shirts [laughter] because they're going to win the division\n[laughter] no no no no more than a print lawyers back ... years hang on that they're only thoroughly through James out of first place I look I I'm not the only the first place I'm not backing down I'm not I I still believe that somehow\nThey can dig down deeper way okay to get those shirts friend I have a personal bit but I Would like to see that happen However I'm Becky\nWell for the giants now everybody realizes ... to try to tell everybody ... we need to get another quarterback but when we did that yes she was upset numbered seeing what a number didn't do\nThey go take me out the game and the second I guess I Can't I Can't I Can't keep up\n[laughter] if I Can't play I'm Still thinking about what was it up in New York with absolutely\nList I don't remember that press conference oh you don't know you'll remember that one I\nMean I you know you don't remember right he expressed disappointment and not playing who wouldn't wouldn't\nThey didn't bitch um they were just don't take 'em out they gave me the second

like we'll see Ken the Lakers get by Houston well I think there are a few different things that could actually take place in the west\nBut it does sort of feel like a fate accompli or whether or not it's the you know the warriors that a chemist stay focused enough in the Lakers be better than we thought so we'll see but that big party and it's going to happen in the east between Philadelphia in Boston yeah are we sure\nAre we sure are you sure\nAbout that oh without a doubt your\nPositive okay you do you feel like there's someone else in the party who is who else could possibly be invited to

bunch of drama Mm and a bunch of names that we've come to know in the NBA and respect a like a great ...

Leonard ... are you telling me see just what I feel like has happened in that trait what is that\nPeople went oh okay you know like they got caught by the other one got them all the same position just got to swap 'em and there will be the same thing yeah so now co y and Z or more are the same player I mean is that what you're saying\nThey're not [laughter] they're not the\nKind of ... I mean ... super super strange laugh like a really uncomfortable laugh them that's supposedly what we got out of the off season we've found God how\nGood he is he is a great legitimate great player with a championship pedigree it's going to change rabbit\nWhat does that mean changing the championship pedigree what does that mean what does it mean to me it was really NBA Finals MVP which is something that the Toronto Raptors\nYou're not out in fact what they had in that position before was a guy who's ... most famous quote was ruined want if we ad lib Ron that I I mean\nThe Toronto Raptors every year they get the one seat or the juicy they get to the playoffs and see that's why I Can't ... well except for two things here by up to them but two things very significant happened in the offseason the gecko why when they got caught by and LeBron left the east yeah but the Celtics are right\nThese I said nobody diseases there they're going to beat the Sixers hardy is alright the party is that the Boston Celtics are going to play the Phillies Sixers in eastern conference finals is just a done deal I don't I don't think the Sixers are as good as Toronto\nI mean we've now seen the Sixers play Boston which since Ronald play Boston\n... looked a little different than that yeah but you can't you can't go no go by what games did you go deeper into that Boston game they blew\nOut Philly did you notice something about that Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward terrible ... Mm combine for Seventeen points vegan yeah and they still won by Eighteen\nEarly I don't really listen I was I saw the Sixers ... the next night dismantled the Chicago Bulls ... early so you know you know\nWhen you're talking about Iran always going to be good okay so I hear this right now okay so ironic so it was going to be here would here's what I Will tell you because I thought you were going to bring other team that I think\nThe biggest surprise surprise in terms of they may crash deport okay\nI don't know if you've been paying attention to the New Orleans pelicans [laughter] see I like the law [noise]\nI don't know if you're paying attention because\n[laughter]\nLet last night they put one forty nine up one forty nine\nFor them good that's a lot of points they got the brown I'm going to give up one Twenty one twenty nine okay it's just a high scoring game it's just been noticed I mean they\nThey probably the the the ... those guys just says\nI'm In a beat the Sacramento Kings okay [laughter] it's not a great match it for you guys who warriors sounded great matchup pelicans ... minutes\nThe ... the kind of bigger than what really happened really yeah I Know they've been with for oh four one yes\nAll those games all those games real close to right I I'm a I don't\nRemember what they were ... they did not sweat in that series they did not sweating it is what a little bit\nOkay I'm a look it up you know you and I think in the ... I don't dislike New Orleans but you can't see and I'm not big on bail in your right now I'm telling you right now the Toronto could make the NBA Finals the New Orleans ... they're not going to the NBA Finals mark into because they can't like it'd be the second the ... the second best team in the way\nThey I mean maybe that there is dealing and play the game where you know shot of beating the Golden State warriors\nNotion no shot that team was really good\nLast year and the you know where you see where he's been struggling right like they're winning but it's a struggle this year compared to other use this your first one or two games and bowl games have been struggles\nFirst of all opening night was not a struggle and second of all I Would have told them I Would like little ... on the road at Utah holding the opening night they won by ... points\nOut Casey was within one with there was two three minutes left\n... first of all that's not accurate and say it was not a one point or not they they ... Ninety four game was never in doubt oh my God that game was did you watch the game I did my dad who was there ever a moment where you're like oh my gosh this undermined when\nYou know if he were PG ... PG Thirteen gotta stop when playoff he showed up I'm OK hang on just a lead just sent this to us\nMhm I'm All right here is ... year is last year series against the pelicans pelicans did get a game\nThey got game three okay the warriors one game one by twenty two points the warriors one game\nAnd I don't really know where the bronze on the floor what it is but Lorenzo does so\nKeeping us up well I I kind of I kind of like the Lakers have have done a good job of protecting long ago this season finally after kind of feeding him to go off last year this year he has an opportunity to show whether or not he is that guy or not so\nHe's protected by rock on who you're with the community to compete with that job um otherwise he can continue to grow with the second unit of the Lakers which is probably a little bit more\nUm consistent with where he that in his career but I mean you're right look I mean you take in the world by storm in its first\nFirst year and a one game of his career or you have there have been ups and downs he's only play three games so far this season counting to ... the parents and Thursday with LeBron James so I Do think there has to be a little bit of patience with him\nA plate fifty two games last year but there are there are all questions about how how good he can be a long term and\nAnd the shot is still it's still a big question mark 'em look better attacking the ... got the outlines of wasn't good at a year ago so I think you have to give them a little bit of time there\nHe still looks so comfortable on his hands it's kind of what happens\nAfter he gives it up and kind of how we can impact gained beyond\nMaking goes passes and in setting up a nonsense Kenny Kenny PS scoring threat defensively dogs may you may be the Lakers that's defender actually like defensively he makes a difference but he needs to earn the trust of LeBron James is she Earth Day\nTo convince the Lakers that he is the guy going forward and I think that's so not quite sure you want to say the ... you can already you know make the assessment but I Do think that this season and it's going to eat critical that he can be the guy the Lakers close on a lot of it\nAnd looking at the Lakers in the open or even the Portland TrailBlazers who a loved one up on the floor however the one thing that doesn't really work ruined his league when you have a team full of guys who can't you do three will how are the ...\n[noise] well I mean that the answer may prove that may very well proved to be that they can't keep up with those teams [noise] um but the strategy that or at least trying to avoid the season is\nKind of beat him in a different game which is what you like you said get up and down the floor get those easy to lose your ears torn on break away dunk\nThose are those are even better than than um than uh than than three pointers and so\nUm [noise] so I think that you know you look at that that opener is fifty of their first sixty three points were in the ... they had something like twenty seven points in a in transition so they're they they are doing what they want to do\nBut the problem is I think I think I think and kind of what you're getting at how sustainable is it when that really your only option I mean\nThe Lakers started over Fifteen from three and that is something that is going to um yeah I mean you can't win that way they they shot seven to Fifteen from their for their ... and it's like thirty three missed the first Fifteen then shot seven Fifteen so you wonder are they closer to the over Fifteen team or the seven Fifteen theme um\nBut it was certainly ... it was a heightened microcosm of their problem but it was a microcosm nonetheless\nBill or um is with us the athletic on the Lakers bill I I think it's so interesting that writers LeBron James is making his Laker debut in these first games\nIt's alongside the fact that the Dodgers are in the national league championship series and trying to get to the world series against the red Sox I Wonder like\nYou know your your digital analytics and whatnot or or do you guys have any data on what is his trending as more popular Laker content or Dodger content right now at this time\nYou know I don't have that in front of me but I what I can just kind of speak to the vibe in Los Angeles and the and the energy that's been around town because I mean when when it when in LA team is good it does it does kind of changed a lot around the city I mean you see Dodger had Iran\nMiss joy she always wants to talk about what happened in the Dodger games there is a lot of excitement about about that team and the and then you put on top of that back not only are the Dodgers up because of the world series that you have the best that ball player in the world\nSuddenly a plane and purple and gold and and and helping propel the Lakers back to if not their great type probably this season certainly to um you know back to relevance which is something that Mr there is definitely a buzz around the team in town right now and um it's it really doesn't get a whole lot bigger than a game seven and all the bronze age you you're absolutely right\nYou're real if you were at home I mean I'm like you had to choose between game seven of the Dodgers are watching the Lakers home debut we pick\nOr I get the question would be which one would have on the big screen because I definitely would have I'd have 'em both on it I Want on the one on one on the\nTV uh me I mean I'm a basketball guys I probably have I'd probably have a look around and the Lakers on but um I I if you if you if you only have one screen to watch I think you'd want to keep that uh that last channel button working pretty hard all\nNight yeah no doubt that's my plan for sure bill you know you mentioned earlier we'll see over time if the Lakers are more of the first version or the second person as far shooting threes but\nBy the same token we expected that a little bit coming here and we looked at the roster and went oh there aren't a lot of great three point shooters there's some guys who can hit a three but it it sell all along like the prominence he wanted to counter program the warriors not try to beat them at their own game\nSo do you think so make any moves to try to become better three point shooters or do you think they're trying to be a team that's physical and mark it up against the relatives of western conference\nThere was a really different it was a really interesting case study in the first game because the Lakers got down by twelve point of lasers in the fourth quarter and and the Lakers had to go to the to the old model the LeBron bottle we've seen for a long time as well\nBut then they found themselves in the very first game of the season play that ...\nYou saw Luke Walton out sprinting Ingram ostensibly the second best player on this team to the number to score the leap what they can be\nSolved out in in crunch time for Canadian Caldwell coke was non existent on the floor in the open our bodies at least a better three points here\nSo they built this roster kind of of the strategy that they had to abandon in the first of eighty two games so I think that is very telling 'em I think I think the thing that we all have to try to keep in mind\nIs is this\n... when the Lakers did not get Paul George I mean the Lakers and not ... are not able to add a second superstar this was ... by by by necessity rather than design became a transition years so this year is going to be about getting getting as much out of your young guys as possible\nTrying to mix it up a little bit in the playoffs they brought in guys who are playoff says that we're going to help them when playoff games\nAnd then and then get comfortable with LeBron LeBron get comfortable these young guys make sure that he's comfortable with all of them and then try to add that second started another year so when it comes down to you know all the hand wringing over what kind of shooting team they can be\nUm the Lakers are obviously tell you differently but from where I said when you're down in the weeds like that I'm just not sure any of the the exit the nose and and you know real number crunching really truly matters and the big picture for the same\nBill if you read the gas you know project out them getting better as the jail once you're just as to what kind of see do have in the playoffs\nI think they're somewhere in that five six range\nUm you know I've had people with the team who really like what they've seen and the whispers been like I get on with the two seat you know I don't I don't see that I mean he was that golden state's Utah game last night I mean that was a different level of basketball that we've seen for the Lakers so far um but I Do think you know that\nTrip this year but certainly um are are very present in the western conference playoffs picture that said I mean there's nothing to say the Lakers couldn't find themselves\nYou know months to go you know didn't mean that a run to get the eight feet I mean the west is so completely um\nCrowded that there's really no guarantee that the Lakers get there but my my bottom line on that is I I don't feel the brawn James St missing the playoff especially one that has the pieces the Lakers house so if they're within a couple of games playoffs they're going to get in they're going to find a way in\nIt reminds me of you know years ago I used to cover the Utah Jazz and there was a year Kobe stories Achilles\nAnd the jab are jockeying with the Lakers for that eight bought up to the final few weeks of the season\nAnd you you knew there was no way that the al ... percent lead jazz\nWe're going to be a we're going to win that last playoff spot over at Kobe Bryant led Lakers team that Coby was going to find a way to get the Lakers and there\nHe did in ... the wrong to find a way to get the Lakers and this year too um but the west is an absolute mess but I Do think want the Lakers get there if they've gel like in a way that I think we kind of think they will by the time we get to the second half the season\nI think they can be a problem in the playoffs are higher seat if they in fact are the lower seeds or just because the way their bill I think this is a better playoff team than it is a regular season team\nBelgrade stop it's great to have

J FEMA rosy looking forward to that live Geico Fox Sports radio studios in the middle east is that is just ... percent or more a car insurance I could I ... for ... do we just ended up jumping into a identify quarterbacking discussion and it's interesting for a couple of guys right now um\nAnd you don't hear a whole lot about it your hearing some about Darren car just because of everything with the raiders it's actually drew in and so there's all this discussion that ... are they going to trade I'm Ari Cooper what's going on with their car was crying last week by the way\nWas crying [laughter] I'm trying to figure that out did you see\nThis is where I was crying every now\nAnd I think there's quite a budget cry about actually if you were the raiders right now do you I'm sure it hurts like hell you keep getting hit they got really ... can't when football games here's my question though you know you brought up Mario though oh you can bet we talked about Eli Manning earlier\nThe whole talk of the league has been\nAll of the rules are slanted towards the quarterback you even said it how many quarterback separating over a hundred right now a loving laughing quarterbacks\nOr even not progressing now in these rules in these times\nFrom what am I supposed to do with you if I'm running a team that's the problem it's a major problem and you're looking at some of the guys who are on this list is the usual suspects Drew Brees filler rivers many ISIS on here's your pet more homes ... show right now we're at golf MVP\nRussell Wilson Carson when skirt cousins surprisingly this is going to surprise a lot of people Mitchell\nTribute that'd be sure now he's been really good seven then passer is hold on hold on to pump the brakes on a really really good thing it's been good he's been protected okay fine man that he's done a good job protecting\nWell wait a minute though like how come if Jared golf is going to get a lot of credit and because he hasn't he has a coach that had a no no no no then all of the doors for him why can't\nThe I died like looking at the two different players oh\nI'm not saying this is a star and my point is is that if a coach comes in and opens the doors for you and then you execute you get credit for that and he's been good he's been good\nMom brothers got eleven touchdowns against four packs in a rating on one of five six he's been good you stand there and ... and right now or is it are they still in first place there so first place right there half against that and they'll say anything that you come on man\nHe's been silent I've watched all the games to my city on Sundays we watch all the games I he's ... he's a yes he's not been great he's been good he's been good ... Russell Wilson which no one would think because Seattle feels like they're just lost this year and like I guess some for you ... what are you got\nRussell Wilson right now he is averaging ... Russian yards few as passing since\nBut ... ... ...\nWell they're trying to reestablish the running to him because he was so bad the last couple of years are we get back to our conversation a little bit right now is welcome to Jimmy job\nWho is that the Michigan Michigan State game and then you got a little bit more than you are than you bargained for and there's one right like you you thought you were just took a football game you got all kinds of controversy today\nBoy I really did guys and we had extra hours with the delay some scandal before the game uh I'm probably not going to make my flight because it was so long but hey we're not worth it we got the game we wanted\nTo talk a little bit of a new to the robbery was ... some of the stuff that I saw him pre game between the misuse the blues and a couple of ... out for the new can you explain what took place for you\nYou know that was really interesting for me because I just finished up in an interview with coached Antonio and you know we kind of\nSeen some some action going on behind me and the story and the stuff that made the news that you probably on social media was seven Bush he was seen a you know on the video kicking and kind of like stuffing up this part logo\nAt the fifty so the story goes from both sides I talked to numerous people about what happened in the Michigan State guys apparently worldly that's what Michigan was telling me they were ten minutes late to their walk they do that walk always before every game so\nMichigan felt like they were late we already needed to get out there and um the Michigan State side said well once we came out Michigan should've cleared the fields and that was kind of the\nThe story I was hearing on their Michigan's s id they have that kind of confirmed with me that there was a little some words shared apparently the headphones\nOf course I'm Devin Bush kind of taking it out on a ... in the middle there on the logo so it was if you will the fire but this had been building I mean all week the rivalry and when I talk to the players they use the word we hate each other I mean this is in your blood and all\nThis stuff this was real and especially from Michigan theme that feels like they are out to prove something and they keep saying never ran to or I'm going to take that\nFrom chase women vets who has been bring it up and he's becoming my new favorite interview but they've got a lot to prove this team and they they're showing us alive\nYeah Jenny I I Would say I I Wonder if down the road this won't be a game that they end up circling and saying couldn't even be the turning point in German ... tenure there because there are who's right there's this that have been floating around is always never been ranked team\nAll the wrong and and so you know there was the Ohio Senate vision and controversy in the crazy play against Michigan State last year and all this so yeah so the exercise all those demons\nAnd they'd been laying in the weeds or you know I I Wonder having seen them today and experience with the experience how realistic or their chances to end up in the playoffs now\nI think what's different about this Michigan team as one they've got the quarterback and you know that they've struggled with that in the past what she's doing and what he is meant for this group is clear and you can feel it and that the differences I feel that this seemed belief in themselves and that was a conversation with Ben bread and isn't that I had\nA this week and he said we finally figured out how to finish games and when you hear that and it felt\nLike he believed that this is that coming from someone on the line which has been criticized you know for the Michigan team they believe in themselves and that's\nOn every every aspect of the team leader\nThat the coach ... said that there's something unique about this group it's hard to put his finger on it but they believe in themselves and that loss to open against the regime feels like a long time ago for the team that is the last thing that they're concerned about they've got high hopes and that is to go all the way to a playoff\nThe you briefly mentioned she knows what he's brought a to B team just Europe's division of sleep medicine is really going to be the leader of that often as I was out of just do removes solid playing quarterback was this\nI think so I think that shaped\nEvery time I see and I see a little bit more from him on what was really telling was when we covered them against north western and the emotions that I saw from him for getting that when I mean he\nIn that position on the road to have a performance like that and really to you know it should have been closed against north western but it kind of was in the end and they found a way to finish that game and the fourth quarter and you can feel the emotion he started crying of it I mean he was he knows how hard is works to kinda get to the\n[noise]\nOkay great news quick way you can save some money with the guy got a guy could I comment in Fifteen minutes you could say Fifteen Percent or more on car\nInsurance mandate is crazy a you know well what you were talking about earlier those uh NFL passing that they really tell a story I'm not a stat guy but so you've got eleven\nEleven quarterbacks with a rating over a hundred however that does not include guys\nWho appear to be playing very well and I obviously established themselves as the man future hall of famers in many cases Tom Brady is not over a hundred Ben Roethlisberger is not over a hundred\nOr Matt Stafford Cam Newton Andy Dalton people believe is having a nice a nice year but he doubted around Ninety four and a half\nThat's like the top Fifteen or so and then you get down the the quarterback who has taken a moment\nJeep his rating is Ninety point nine ... Fifteen Years ago people would be a high five and then ... always flag yeah\nNot anymore but he like many years ahead of the shah Watson ... Derek car Andrew Luck Joe Flaco jak Prescott\nBlake Bartels K. scare them markets Mario data and all the rookies all four of those rookies were playing ... all of them you know what I meant [laughter] at an all of those guys I'm drop below two although ...\nHave you been talking about Jim each of you know ... ... okay I'm going ... rating is right at\nNinety ... um but yeah small sample size there so um I don't know man I don't know\nI I look at a lot of these guys right now you know I always say like again I'm not a stat guys certain ones do tell a story and have all the names that we just threw out there I Do feel like there are let me count I'm\nSurely as many as six\nWho based on this out alone may not have the gig next year that they have now six well let's run through it okay let's mothers' you lie manning oh you're very Archie Blake portals\nHe may not may not he should be up but he'll probably hang around go with me if it's even with Avi OK okay\nGotcha to Marcus Mario ... yeah it it hasn't been great um case keen him we've seen and he's just back right right but and that's\nWas a one year deal um their car oh you can get\nNah player trending up joining up good game last week the game really good game last week on owners owner loves him today he's here today he's here\nOkay but I still give you five you did\nFive in the air live in a possible yeah five and a possible\nAnd then the other ones that are in this makes I mean obviously the rookies you give them a path because the rookies they are going to be there you know Donald and Mayfield and Rosen that's going to be their quarterback Allen for a little while\nAlan and I was at the bottom Allen says the very last yeah ... years thirty fourth or out of thirty four guys who have taken enough snaps to be eligible\nSo Josh Allen his last I'm Joe Flaco\nIs down there and because I wouldn't say he's in danger except for they drafted a first round quarterback\nBut he's he's been what are you going to do there he's been there having an okay season okay and he's in just okay\nYeah no he's twenty fifth he's twenty fifth I mean it's sneaky nine touchdowns for\n... you wouldn't be like oh there's no problem there but ad in the you know the lack of yard as the ... the dung whatever\nThey can don't yeah and the big thing that you have to look at when you're looking at these tasks to keep in contact so they pass the rain is being because it factors and everything\nWill yards per cent\nCigars are exempt or gas for it to him because to me it it can reflect you pushing the ball down the field\nAll right let's get on that you want to know who do you know off the top of your\nHead and looking aids the NFL or the re doing at it now managing\n[laughter] Ryan it's Patrick this magic that's hysterical or but on the second Jared golf golf\nMy home and here's the golden boy ... yeah Philip reverses format Ryan has five okay I'm going to say something\nPaying attention what I say\nPhilip Rivers is having a strong year Philip Rivers is in the top three ... raised right eye areas I paid I kind of a kind of brushed aside like Randy go whatever\nBut quietly he is really having the MVP caliber you know one is talking about it he's almost completing Seventy percent of his past six to eight point six Seventeen hundred passing yards eight point seven yours for a temp Fifteen jobs only three interceptions\nFifteen touchdowns number two in the league behind ...\n... one Fifteen point one pastor rating\nQuarterback rating and force in the league and really started a league 'cause I don't want to count fitzpatrick third in the league in what you're saying yards protect wow only behind golfing homes neither of whom have lost a football game until last week\nThat's made like seriously that is that is amazing because a lot of times what gets lost with to fill the rivers conversation we wax nostalgic and poetic about Drew Brees Tom Brady\nEven been robbed has broken older cats still getting it done this and that we rarely mentioned Philip Rivers in that same category ... but if you really look at how he's played and what he's played with\nThere is no question he's one of the best quarterback that we've seen during this this time period during this whatever twenty you for your with the quarterback play\n'em and I don't know I Know we talk about hall of famers and go jak than how everyone gets in oh he's gone I I just think the discussion is going is going to be so fascinating when we look back and we talked about eleven manning Ben Roethlisberger and Philippe rivers\nBecause the resumes will say that he like manning might be the best of them will\nAlly mailings then then then fill in terms of resume but in terms of good\nJulie ...
