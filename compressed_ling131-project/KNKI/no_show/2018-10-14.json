soup again yeah yeah like lightning you might tell her to run into that just to just to make sure I you know I don't want to say is superstitious and the suit did it but let's just be sure\nLet's be sure for sure\nWe're going to hone in on the game but I'm going to stick with soup for a second job what is your favorite in Leeds favorites soup\n[noise] least favorite soup a cow and wedding soup horrible [laughter] but not not a fan favorite soup\nThat's tough question I Would say I got to go gumbo if that's the soup\nGumbo zoo vet ... isn't it is hot and it is savory so I Would would gumbo in the soup family\nAbsolutely\nWell Joe you know how would you evaluate your performance today Fifteen of thirty two hundred\nI play pretty decent um we have a lot to improve still wasn't our best game still but ... you can never complain about a W especially over at the end like that where I come in this rig get the get the mistakes fixed and we're going to be ready to roll\nThat's awesome what what does this say to the world to the NC double a about you know you're you guys is pushed to the to the playoffs in the national championship\nUm [noise] you know I don't think it really has a statement we just come in every week to try to be want to know every week our plan good football right now have faith in each other have faith in the coaching staff and we just try to be one into every week\nYou know ... what would you say about the defense of effort today George only gained three hundred and twenty two yards and total off and and if you were to give those words in your best and orange run impression that would spice it up a little bit too [laughter]\nI'll tell you what I'm gonna I'm gonna have on the coach of impersonation but but the events definitely showed out today against one of the top officers in the country we have faith and those guys when when you have a defense like that it makes our job\nDo you guys had a great a great game you yourself had a great game that's the way to lose your team against a number to Georgia Bulldogs window you gotta get outta here please go enjoy your soup and a gives him resume thank you I appreciate that are held in absolute there you\nGo that's Joe burl quarterback of LA you've taken down the number two ranked team in the\nCountry or to gain looks good game and they really came out to play them and they were not playing with Georgia, Georgia today\nThey were not and I'll tell you one at the beginning of that game you saw George ... running the ball swift in Holyfield they were just trucking guys are having all types of big gains and I'm like man I Wonder how those games\nAnd they didn't look like Italian wedding soup out there\nToday that much of the LSU looks really good today I I Love them or to seem by twenty points yeah that's\nA statement I Know he didn't want to go on record saying they made a statement but that's a huge statement when it comes to you know getting down to the meat of the schedules and a couple of weeks I'm going to Alabama and and so on and so forth but the committee has to look at this like okay well we'll see LSU\nYeah and men think about that it seems like ... light years ago that Edwards Ron was on the hot seat [laughter] you know you fast forward they're taken down the number two ranked team by twenty points they just have one blemish on the season they're putting together a really nice year\nThey are and you know it\nSeems to come from out of nowhere man like you know they were they were projected they have a good a team this year but they weren't on anybody's radar uh as far as you know possibly being in the playoffs so it'll be interesting to see like I said a couple of weeks they got Alabama\nSo let's see if they can you know role this through and and and keep going or not to overlook Mississippi State as right wing fourth in the country or next week but that ah Alabama game it's going to mean something especially if they'd be Mississippi State next year I mean next week\nYeah and like you said to you from if they beat Mississippi State then they get up by ... before that Alabama game so man if they could win those two games you're sitting pretty\nSeven in one going into the by yeah yes indeed we got action\nGot action and you look at the landscape of college football especially at the top you look at the top ten so you have number two going down you've got number seven Washington going down in overtime against Oregon very fun game to watch a lot I tell you what DJ for Adele he's the running back from\nHe's the guy who had the game winning touchdown run into the against Washington so redemption for him that's really awesome yes redemption time for CJ ...\nWe can talk about an outstanding or a nail biting game from number five Notre Dame against it I mean we can talk about that I even shared some some uh you know ... some positive text with you during that game 'cause I knew you were going crazy\n[laughter] yes I was um\nI'd be lying to you if I said I wasn't you know like punching the cow I Know I Know what what ... what did I send you it just it breeds you know breed\nBreed just breed that said I was like ... 'cause you know me from I'm watching as many games as I can on every device that I ... I had a game on my phone so I didn't see it until a little bit later\nAnd so I was like Notre Dame is that what it was it was there oh yeah [laughter]\nDo close man but they survive or learn hit Nineteen fourteen I don't know what's up with pit man they are giant killers they will show up against these teams that are highly ranked and I don't know where they go to the rest of the year I don't know how they can hang with the big boys and then end up with the record that you like\nHow did they be Clemson again you know there happens like it\nDoes and you have a team or in pit that gets up for a huge games but\nDoesn't bring that same effort in a in that same drive to the normal games on the schedule you know and and and that's the detriment\nTo the team ... it doesn't matter it shouldn't matter who you're playing against if you came out with the same ferocity against all of the people on your schedule then be looking at a different America right now yeah\n\nIn ... words or Sam ...\nWhen I was down on the field [noise]\nOr the other way around\nIt all from me [laughter] ... breaking it falls down you know what can happen in your home for the best football coverage on radio waves right here on Fox Sports radio\n... village and you\nKnow I don't want them\nTo find out past one I'm your TV show to Fox Sports dot com or details pass pass while [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] sure I remember the name your price to choose from a range of coverage options and pick the price that works for you visit progressive dot com today [noise] [noise]\nI'm Brian no easy from slum here on Fox Sports radio\nComing to you from the guy goes studios you know a big man\nNot only do you owe me for a candy bars you owe me a hundred American dollars as well do I\nKnow you do you do because on Wednesday I went in\nAnd completed the NBA three point challenge oh three pointers how many I mean do you make\nForty one really yes I mean the ... you need ... what I you don't trust me\nNo [laughter] [laughter] oh no no no no no I mean the I mean but\nYou don't know me well enough you don't think\nIf I made I don't know let's say Fifteen that I Would come\nBut it's I I I you know I'm not I'm not interested in anything you're saying right now I Need to have the footage\nHe need footage have footage right\nThere is absolutely footage good yeah\nBut it was documented the crew of the show that I Do here in Portland during the week\nUh they were really trying to conspire against me [laughter] [noise] yeah I was legitimate forty one\nYou know it was legit it's actually if you see on my Twitter page at the no show that is the picture that you will see I had a T shirt printed up with the lovely Christie ended that night that simply says forty one man I've been wearing it proudly\n... pretty good form not bad for her to go now to add not bad yeah\nSo are you going to do or you argue dollars in cargo short I am [laughter] that was a big one at this guy sure yeah yeah so here's the thing he from All right I didn't realize how odd it was to shoot three pointers and car goes until the crew brought it to my attention yeah\nThat's a that's the first thing that popped out to me [laughter] cargo short yeah yeah\nI was going to the gym to ah just get some shots up before the challenge and they saw my car goes I was just carrying them and they were like are you going to the gym in ... I'm like yeah they're like [laughter] the prediction just went down about our\nTown so that would just like okay well [laughter] you might not make seven yeah\nLook you end them may call this sense in the world but\nI've had a couple of knee surgery a couple of shoulder surgeries so when I go to the gym to lift weights I don't do a whole lot of cardio you know my knee doesn't like when I run right so I don't run very much so I always go wearing cargo is and I've been in the habit\nFive I was just shooting side just crabs some car goes and they're like dude you're wearing a belt while shooting them like make a point you have a belt on yeah\nDo you have changing like different things in the pocket [laughter] garage door opener in your pocket a dollar a you know I\nI mean come on\nI Know now I Am the the pockets for what it's worth but because they gave me such a hard time I had the word the car goes for the shootout you know that's my brand so I had to ... her brand I had to be true to form\nAnd it honestly probably cost me a couple of may jot [laughter] but it's All right they don't breathe they don't [laughter]\nYou don't get a lot of breathing with cargo short no true you don't but you'd be proud of me from I Do have basketball shorts but later that night Christina Christina and I went out to grab them food we're at the mall\nAnd I went into a sporting goods store and I'm like you know I should get some basketball shorts so I did get some basketball shorts that night what kinda G gift though some Nike's\nThey're nice and what what a friend in the Nike basketball Sharon ...\nUm if you were wise though [laughter]\nI Will get some footage who you are you from I Need to because you know you turn into Barry Sanders when it comes to paying bats here you go from a left tackle to like a a great running back with elusive moves you know if a pond footage mhm\nI see you make forty one that's a that's a hell of an average it's not ... forty one percent\nYeah that's right\nNot bad I mean that I should have made more I'm not happy with the ... yeah I I'm happy getting\nOkay I feel strongly if we rent it back I could do better than that\nI Wonder how many I can make ...\nYou know what it Christina and I've been talking about coming out to LA we almost made it happen does very next week you always say that you know but we're going to get there we're going to get there soon big men absolutely\nIt's happening and I don't I don't maybe we should have a three point showdown when I'm there what do you think I like that yeah [laughter] [noise]\nFight a gym of your choice or well it's a beautiful weather out there to ... you can yeah anywhere you can't be windy though you know and I don't know when nothing worse than when you're shot is right on line in the wind just out of nowhere like Wesley Snipes and white men can't right right right\nRight [laughter]\nYeah that's no fun I so I'm the fundamental difference between you and I ... from\nAt least when it comes to sports I tend to look at who teams play in who they beat the quality of their schedule and correct me if I'm wrong but you seem to say who cares they one doesn't matter who they played is that a fair assessment\n[noise] not quite like that no no because if you're you know three and seven I'm not talking about that but have you\nBeen able to during an a a winning streak greater than ... ... in any sport then that's to be commended because no matter who you're playing against that's tough to do\nYou know what I'm saying like you talked about the Seventy Sixers my dog last year\nA show they want to happen because it doesn't matter they want to say about it in a row it doesn't matter they want to Seventeen\nAn actual team a\nThat is the perfect example to back my point up\nNo no shot they ran into a better team right what's your memory lane you cannot deny it rarely now you can't just credit what they did they just run into a better team look\nWe're going to go back in the hot tub time machine for ... at a time machine and then bring it back to the here and now with UCF here and now\nIf you look at the Seventy Sixers I think they won their final sixteen regular season games something like that mhm\nAnd they won I think it was four of those games against teams with winning records and through\nThe rest of the bunch or a hack teams that had losing record some of them trying to think for a better draft pick professional teams but it was the biggest food gave the winning streak of the entire NBA season\nAnd some people pointed to that and they didn't take into account the quality of the opponent and they said hey sixteen game winning streak as if all sixteen game winning streak so the same and then what happened when they ran into a better Celtics team they lost in five\nThey got dumped trucked in five games\nAnd so I Will say so do you mean by it in the um yeah I had a conference final that's right okay the second best team in the eastern conference\nOkay cool cool go ahead yeah they did so same thing with all due to the better team\nThey were better team coached better did you know that for sure heading into the ... the series the way the soldiers were playing yes I did know you did in are you going up here and tell me that I didn't have all the pomp homes in the world\nThe money because they don't deserve the prompts like here's the thing he from I disagree with your point I understand it in a lot of people think that way this is about the twenty eight teams season it's not about twenty seven scene is not about any of these teams what they did last year it's all about this year\nExactly until it you combined them right so they have the nation's longest winning streak at Eighteen right so that's a that's something that's going to continue to be talked about every week as long as they went so you can't ignore it because it's part\nA winning streak didn't know whether team in the country has so you're going to have to keep talking about it\nI look at them as a cheap version of Boise state's\nReally that's what I look at UCF okay at least Boise State went out and they played a legitimate non conference team every year they played one team that was ranked there were like wow that that's a big time when let me and I said not one team on UCF schedule and the regular season where I'm like as big as a big time when\nYou know these teams have to agree to play you how many teams you being while playing audio\nSo everybody somehow Boise State found a way to play a big boy every single year yet the countries of running in fear the phone rings they're like hello hey it's a UCF click like well gosh do nightmare is just the fact that they called it they would actually\nSign up to use the of early on in in in my schedule I mean\nYou know you can be Alabama and play south Alabama state right\nWe're talking about what that doesn't come on man you\nDon't appeal where Alabama lacy you Ohio State played TCU they were ranked number Fifteen at the time LSU plate number eight Miami\nThey play in the SEC you think L. S. U. was like oh we can't play the UCF nights we'll play Miami but not the nights really\nLook man I'm just letting you know OK I'm letting you know Israel does not a bunch of teams that are going to be lined up to play UCF than if they're not\nYou know there are takers not Auburn played Washington that number six versus number eight\nSo when you have your Alabama would you sign up to play Arkansas state or UCF you're going with Arkansas state [laughter]\nYou are one hundred percent\nNext year we have ah the undefeated who you're undefeated UCF or we have Arkansas state why does the idea to sound like that or we have Arkansas state oh why why there's so much trouble ... which\nOne which one do you want to play [noise]\nYou know he's going to say it was gonna say Oregon State\nOr something you see they play at the beginning of the year we're going to play\nThe raging Cajun\nOkay All right that's what they're going to do they're going to put a raging Cajun [noise]\nAll right we

we rank a conference of choice by ferocity of nickname right is if it's a tangible thing right\nSo we take our rankings very very seriously on the program\nKnow we don't mess around and so I was thinking this could be fun if we rank the toughest defeat of the day I think that could be an interesting discussion if you look for the top three worst losses\nOf the day and it's subjective because you could look at it one way I could look at the other what have you I'm going to throw some stuff out there okay and we're going to whittle it down and we'll see if we can come up with our top three\nOr at least will it down where we can say I think this is the worst loss of the day how about that All right what's your number one I'm with you with it I'm with it okay\nSo we throw this out their Nebraska Nebraska falls to a win six at one point they had a wind probability of Ninety eight point two percent and they ended up losing in overtime\nJohnny come lately they are all in six he from I was actually watching the game they showed pictures of the season the last time they started off oh in five it was black and white pants [laughter] way back when uh the so we got them in the mix\nHow about Memphis Memphis up on\nUCS they were up to thirty to fourteen at one point a\nFading score a point in the second half they were right on the outskirts of field goal range no time outs they complete a ball in bounds [laughter] not for a first down ... keeps running they run out of time and they lose at home against the undefeated UCF nights\nAre they in the running yeah that could be in the running okay\nHow about Georgia number two team the control you definitely whisker away from winning a national championship and they get dumped truck on the road road by LSU\nYou got them in the mix yes okay how [laughter] how 'bout\nBaylor Baylor played really well against Texas\nTexas Dick or the kicker right last week good old the red river showdown he misses the fifty one yard or toward the end of the game six point ballgame Baylor is right around the red zone right and they throw I think they're inside the red zone they throw a ball in\nThe end zone that went out of the end zone final play the game pet peeve of mine he from\n[laughter] keep it in play chess given a chance right you have a chance got to give it a chance so we've got a Baylor in the mix and then also how about Penn State yep number eight team in the country\nLine throw and Michigan State scores a touchdown there's about twenty seconds to go look like sporty was trying to kick again tying field goal you go to overtime instead they get the game winning touchdown and Penn State in terms of their\nSeeding out their position in the Big Ten is over what their second laws in the ... conference back to back games they had to buy week leading up to the game against Michigan State and the previous game of course was the meltdown against Ohio State\nSo back to back losses in their division they are done\nThey out of those ... you have a a write in you know we can take that up those five Nebraska Memphis Georgia followed by Penn State and Baylor where do you think is the worst way to lose but the worst last\nI think\nThe George or loss is is is the worst loss mhm and I and I and I picked that one because so much was on the line right right so\nIt's not okay now we have to regroup in and get together and and finish out strong is no way this year or two last team is getting into the playoffs\nAnd they were in prime position to get themselves in the playoffs and play for national championship again mhm ah this loss in the way they lost to LSU it it it it it's over for that no matter what happens anywhere else for the rest of the season it's over\nSo I think that's the biggest upset and the biggest loss although LSU as they are a ranked team in you know from a a dynamic conference I just think the ramifications of they'll also Georgia too big to overcome\nBut the odds aren't great because you look at their next three games man there they take on Florida mhm there at Kentucky right and then they host Auburn those are three straight ranked teams that\nI get it but what has to happen though not just what they have to do right it's no longer in their hands anymore they went out right right but it's no longer in their hands because he got Ohio State\nYou got Notre Dame right you have\n... Alabama of course you have what ah Oregon ... you know what I mean you have these teams that are position even Texas\nUCF [laughter]\nLeave [laughter] I'm Sorry I had to throw that in there I I had to put it [laughter] I'd like I couldn't even do it out loud but I I just had it but you have these teams ... you know I'm just saying that you have these teams\nThat if they take care of their business them down it doesn't matter what Georgia does it's over\nI I I look here's how I look at it I think that today proved that Georgia won't run the table right\nBut I think if they were to run the table they would be a playoff team because think about what it would mean\nYour beatings three straight ranked teams huh one after another after another you would then circled back after the S.

percent\n... what are your thoughts [noise]\nYeah well cats gotta go tigers definitely scarier bigger more ferocious\nBy default you got to knock out the wildcat\nAnd it it's a ... I'm Still thinking about this gator tiger situation\n[noise] oh man this is an easy one right here really\nIt's tigers all the way\nThere's a reason there's three of them\nBecause of that ferocious that chant tigers are ferocious now I mean they're not in the ... to laugh at but I Will tell you this\nDepending on\nOkay let me let me just argue for the gator All right [noise] mhm [noise]\nIf you

going forward on four thousand inches of course you know that Jason Garrett and the cowboys decided not to go forward on fourth sports in it like a yard and a half\nAgainst the Texans they pointed didn't work out in overtime you think that shows up you think that follows them to this game against Jacksonville at all\n[noise] um I think so I Do think so mhm I'm you know when\nThings don't go your way like that and you lose its that did you get a serious hangovers hard to shake off because everybody was like well we should have the ... the questions started coming out right like we should have did this we should have did it and sometimes it's hard to\nLet that go yeah I think the dangerous part is you start evaluating other people and it's like ... said yeah I Would have gone for it that's the nights version\nTheir own mind [laughter] you know right so ... got it they would have gone for it but that the coaches decision we live by it defense is playing well inside he might be thinking maybe we should have gone for that finally go for it because the one that game why don't you believe in those sorts of things\nAnd then you add Jason Garrett talk about the passing game\nWhereas like we just need to find more consistency with the passing game and he's right the offensive line has been suspect that hasn't been killing it the wide receivers on exactly going to be starting on your fantasy team you know\nSo you're starting to see others evaluate others you at Jerry Jones this week said it saying that he should have gone for it it was a time for risks\nWhen you've got all these people evaluating everybody else and when you start looking at what someone else isn't doing you stop looking at what you aren't doing then that dangerous man really dangerous\nYeah it is dangerous and um\nI I you know I the cowboys got they got a lot of issues they got some things that they need to work out I mean is this the year that we see the end of Jason

this\nA patriot pins makes me sick they really do I have to deal with them on a constant basis is if if they don't go\nFourteen to every year and the two games they lose our because the NFL wraps rip them off that's the only reason why they would lose that but what's going on you're right there were so many upsets today real busy show first of all let's just get everybody caught up in the lake games are going on in the world of college football Arkansas an old miss\nThis one was a good one that's coming out late old miss now with the thirty seven thirty three lead I think they just took the lead on the touchdown so forty two seconds left there ah BYU and hope\nL. D. S. right now Astros three red socks to Red Sox padding in the bottom of the seventh nobody on nobody out in that one and so many other things to get to but the boy what a crazy day in college football today\nAbsolutely Arnie by my calculations we had what I'm trying to do the math in my head I met this not my strong suit here we got for top ten teams five of the top sixteen if you add in Miami which just last what am I the way\nWhat what what about Iowa State was Virginia\nI said five top top teams I Would say I didn't I didn't hear that go ahead I said for the top ten Ryan ... if you include Miami five of the top sixteen and I would add by the way ... sauce Texas almost lost Ohio State did not look good it was a wild day in college football simply\n... let's get right into it first thing I Want to ask you and I'll give you a while I'll give you a four or five upsets Tennessee over Auburn was a big one obviously LSU Georgia Michigan State with the late score against Penn State Oregon\nAnd Washington that the going over time I just brought up Iowa State and West Virginia which was the one all upset that we should have seen coming and matter of fact I think I told you last week that she was going to win but out of out of the last five which is the one that we all should have seen coming coming into today\nI Will agree with you on that Ernie the one that I think we should have seen coming at the very least a close game it was about a touchdown spread was Georgia LSU\nFirst of all LSU has played so many tough game to this point they played Miami they play Florida they played all burn they played a bunch of big road games they finally get to come home and if you kind of look at what Georges done they've struggled\nThey they won by about two touchdowns at Missouri but they had a couple of non offensive touchdowns which made the final score look bigger than it actually was they struggle\nThis one was one that that could be an upset I don't know that I could have I I that I Would have said it would be twenty points though the way that ended up\nBeing no no I mean how could you even think look if I thought she was going to ... that I did pick that gave I would've said it was coming down to a few goal or maybe they won by a touchdown\nThey they just dominated they did whatever they wanted to do against Georgia they went forward on for its downs they've scored a touchdown that kick your goals are they shut down that George up and for the for the most part that was that was the first of all around ... issue right now\nI totally agree and I was thinking about something you know we we spend a lot of time on the show kinda crediting at or drawn because frankly as a lot of these big wins\nUm a lot of people don't notice when he got the job he took less money in salary to pay for the best assistance that he could get a Ellis used defensive coordinator is at the very least the highest paid defensive coordinator in college football he might be the highest paid\nAssistant coach period that guy earned every dollar that his salary kind of includes today I was just thinking about that today as we gifts to us so much credit to the head coach but it's the assistant coaches in in today LSU as you said Arnie a complete team effort\nShouldn't we have seen the Michigan State Penn State upset I mean\nA look it's obviously a big conference battle between these two\nUh Penn State's had a phenomenal year coming in but they only lost one game a Michigan state's had some troubles though I mean jeeze I I thought at least Penn State which looks a little bit more up ... Seventeen points you know\nYeah and the thing was Penn State was they were coming off of pie too right I mean that's usually when you get a team's best effort actually Tennessee today was coming off by they look phenomenal other teams have looked really good off that by so that was the surprising thing they're at home they're off the by either\nTeam coming into this year they haven't had the results that we would expect but they certainly have the talent capable of pulling off something like this so I Do agree with you Arnie or that I Am not really surprised by this one even though Penn State was at home and a big favorite coming in\nNow that just leaves what Ohio State to represent the big ... or the or the Big Ten although I Do well what about our Michigan Wolverine ...\nYou know I had ... wrote them off after that the that first week the block or the first couple of weeks or when they were living up to expectations now they're kind of back on track I'm not so sure though that they're good enough like some of the other ... uh upper echelon teams in the top for\nWell I don't disagree with that I I don't think look I don't think they're Alabama I'll be honest I don't think that they're Notre Dame 'cause Notre Dame already beat him\nBut Ohio State hasn't look that great over the last couple of weeks and you look at Michigan the the the rest of the seasons in their hand I'm not saying that they will make a run\nBut there are six and one right now if they win every game left on their schedule they are going to be in the playoffs that that would obviously me by the way beating Ohio State beating Penn State beating Michigan State next week and then having to probably beat Wisconsin again\nIn the Big Ten championship game it's a long way away but Michigan I think it's still very much in that picture although I Do agree with you Arnie that Ohio State is is clearly right now that seem to be\nOr should I be impressed with what Michigan today I mean Thirteen seven to have I I could not be quarterback in Michigan up there when I saw a horny brook do seven for twenty hundred ... I don't know if I could do much worse than that I either this guy's up or down and today he was really down\nSeven of twenty for a hundred yards today\n...\nWow Arnie you decided not to answer that you could do you think you could do better because I I I I'm not positive you could but I'm not I'm not opposed to it\nJeeze I Know they had a little bit of the writing about the good run every time but again like I said Michigan scored Seventeen points in the fourth I'm not so sure if I'd be says so depressed or the ... was confident that couldn't score to get out of their own way\nWell but football is played in three phases often defense in special teams and I will say Wisconsin look I think they're pretty limited offensively but if you look at them defensively they are really really good team they came into the game\nAre ranked in the top twenty five nationally in defense and I know they're not\nA kind of the team that you think of you know what do you think defense you think Ohio State you think Alabama but they know what they're doing over there was constant it and I think look if you want to make a point that Michigan piled on late that's fine and if you want to certainly make the point\nThat Wisconsin is very limited offensively I Will not disagree with you on that but I also think by the way I think we got to get Michigan a little bit of credit here too I mean this is the horrible effect right when when he wins he supposed to win when he loses he's the worst coach ever\nHe's boxer sports radio\nAnd I will do the twenty four hours a day seven days a week on on them [noise]\nThat's one of your TV show to Fox Sports com for details man walks\n\nGood evening everyone here with tourists already span your mother was like before you go to Vegas club or a um [noise] that's a great Saturday Night three nights in the on the air or if you want to go in\nAnd say we Aaron underscore tourism ads thinking genius one like Gary sense and you guys are amazing I think he meant to say I was amazing I think wow I ... I think that's the type\nYou know he said why don't you know I think you meant to say or any is amazing yeah I think you meant when he said you guys I think he just above me and him and I I mean you are you guys\nA typo that that's got to be a type of all I think it is [noise] trust I wouldn't say it was a I was just for [noise]\nDoes that make the most money in the record and of course ah\nAh you know the normal suspects are up there on top urban Meyer seven point six million\nOf course he's seven and Nick Saban seven point five million I'm sure that's supporting him up you know what I mean that he's making a hundred thousand dollars less than urban Meyer a gym horrible seven point five million have six and one ... Fisher a them seven point five million\nAnd then you get to number five ... six point seven million for three that's not going to cut it at all and is it by ... you better start picking it up because uh at six point seven million going for three is not going to cut it\nYeah that's not going to cut it get when you're the a fifth highest paid coaching college football and by the way as eminent pointed out to me before the show second straight lost at home they look miserable man and and and it's crazy to because if you remember\nHe had the chance to leave last year Arkansas he's from Arkansas they wanted him and he they they had a lot of money on the table you decided to stay at all burned and here he is obviously the fans very unhappy I Would add they still got a lot of tough games on their schedule you still play Georgia they still play bam a it's going to get worse before it gets better well then\nWhat do you say about some of the other coaches that are making over five million let's go straight to Scott Frost oh in six for Nebraska um and I feel about it we're going to live I actually feel bad that they must northwestern today but as they had that thing in control and let it slip through their fingers\nI I don't know what what exactly is going on here I Am not saying that's the coaching it can't be the coaching or they just getting far inferior kids here I'd never happened to the brass 'cause there's so many good college football players you can't get your fair share in Nebraska\nThey had a lot of guys transfer when he first came in and look I mean they went for an eight last year so it's not like they were that good but then he had a ...\nSo they play two games without him right yeah Martinez is back right more Cheetos bag yeah he's back true freshman right things will get better but yeah I Can't get worse and it oh and six rank at it I Know I Am I correct me well you don't even have to correct me but uh it is the worst start in school history\nWhich is saying something by the way they still have Ohio State on the schedule which means that there is no way they're going to a ballgame so a pretty forget it before it's it's it's unforgettable in a way but it's also pretty forget about a year for ...\nAnd why is Libby Smith on this other guy that I always [laughter] I'd and Illinois a three and three I Believe um look I don't even know what to say they've been so down and not for a long time a three and three I'd take it if I was a Illinois fan I I don't know if that teams ever going to turn it around we'll look\nFirst one of the year and guess who they beat Kent State\nYes that's I was there were ... they were losing Kent State should have at the upset in that game I was watching that\nGame Seventeen to three at halftime of Korea box where I'd be lying if I said I remember it really well but ah Kent State home of a shake Spanier\nYet my son who got his first victory is a goalie today so I was very happy I'd start he got well I I drove to us we go yesterday okay to watch the game because I thought he was going to get the start he didn't he got to start on Saturday\nNo no yes yes coach coach must hate you you must be a a patriots fan I think that's what it\n'cause yeah probably so uh yeah he won a three to one girl a good that's good to get his first college victory how there was about how real\nQuick how is the pizza situation going for people who don't remember he won like a year's supply of pizza or something\nYeah the my son ... was a picked out of a crowd won a year's supply of pizza a but at the restriction was he could only have one pizza a week so that was fifty two pizzas for the entire\nIt's already it's not surprised I mean a re weeks ago he was halfway through every ... surprised on this\nWhile I mean he's a he's a he's an athlete I Would assume that they would\nWell the other athletes you know whether they throw a party it's like get ten more pizza that don't even know that they don't they just get ten more ten more like that more that\nFreshman Fifteen I mean maybe that I Know how it's going to say something inappropriate yeah well you need a block shots or I don't know how much space there isn't that cool if you had only during the pizza\nOr anyway Ohio State they wouldn't Thirteen fourteen I was watching this um Minnesota did everything they could especially defensively they really hampered Ohio State in this one\nReally opened up my eyes was Ohio State scored a lot of points this year and have dominated as pretty much scored it will and Haskins through for over three or four hundred yards and three touchdowns but when you see me thirty points just setting yourself\nThat that you know it's not match up here a Seventeen fourteen ... there was up by three uh then it was a still a game going into the fourth or it was just a Minnesota could muster up in the ... and the second half of of this one so they drop it thirty for the but the fence I thought they did a real good job\nAnd I know PJ flick a little bit I've talked to them about this team and and he said look we're really young this year but we think that we have a bright future and I'll tell you I mean you saw that just on display today they were really good in the trenches they played heart Ohio State you know doing Haskins was awesome but\nStruggled in the ... game Ohio State I'll tell you this\nI don't we just kind of ... are just pushing Ohio State in the play off and they're going to be undefeated in represent the Big Ten but two weeks in a row now since at Penn State and they've been a little bit sloppy I mean last week against Indiana they won going away but it was another one where if you watch the game it wasn't as dominant as the final score and a kid I felt the same way today and I feel like\nMaybe this was a sign of things to come and still like as asking had over four hundred yards so um it wasn't like he wasn't and he was one thirty four forty four so it wasn't like he was a complete and passes\nIt was just that it was just one of those weird games where at the end um they should have won by more but again like I said give Minnesota a lot of credit defensively they did a really good job\nOr through the first three quarters of this when I I thought it was remarkable so\nI wanted to go out and said that because because other than that they they could it was like fifty six to ten or something you know\nYeah no they played hard and I'll say this is that early in the year we were talking about the big tent potentially being the best conference in college football\nI I don't think that's the case because of the way the SEC a shaken out Texas a and M. really good Kentucky really good Florida really good\nBut the Big Ten we are now starting to see that it really is a dog fight any given night obviously with Michigan State beating Penn State today Minnesota plane Ohio State tough\nNorthwestern coming down to the wire against Nebraska even though the brass 'cause when they played a bunch of team stuff so I ... the top isn't as good as the SEC but day in day out outside of Rutgers pretty much everybody can can ... at the very least is competitive\nNow we had five upsets or we could have added a six and I thought we were a because Notre Dame was losing the pet it was seven six have pit was winning was fourteen the six I Believe that until they came down scored bits a to point or a and then got the touchdown and the fourth day when it Nineteen fourteen\n... really couldn't must are already up in the fourth quarter in this one I mean there were four points total or not in a professor impressive performance by\nBy the Notre Dame Irish and this one a book was good twenty six thirty to put the two interceptions is what killed by a ... not a great overall performance they're lucky to escape with this one because they lose this baby they kiss a goodbye that four team playoff totally agree Arnie I'll say this all just\nWhen there's a performance like this are all well this is proof they're not very good\nLike Notre Dame was coming off to really really emotional wins against Stanford at home at Virginia Tech last week a game that we you and I were watching during this game and you come home they have a by next week and you play a team that frankly you know you're better then right I I I don't know where you stand on\nAlready but like I I Know we want perfection we want every team to be Alabama just steam role everybody they play that's another sport works and I I think Notre Dame getting this when that's all you gotta do keep winning nobody's going to remember this and we\nI I Love you hear such this dollar the silver dollar for good luck I touch it he puts it in any way he puts in three dollars anyone that ten thousand okay wow\nHe yells is because he yeah he wins while we're on the air I mean you hear the the the ... going off and he goes it's because of your good luck your good luck to you and he's yelling in these yelling and I'm On the go and I wonder what this guy's going to give me as a tip right I'm I'm kinda curious he gives me back the doubt or\n[laughter]\nYou went ten thousand that you want to give me a dollar well you\nKnow I mean after taxes and you know you got to pay you know you've got to get dinner I can see I I I'll defend them I could see that that makes sense\nYou know

Fifteen team in the pre season so I don't I don't know that anybody was surprised by that one I I think Miami to me was the most surprising and then the other one how it happened\nUm Michigan said Penn State Michigan State scoring weight in the game I think it was what a twenty two yard touchdown a that was the difference I thought they were going to pretty much just to get in the field goal range tried to tie this thing\nThere and gave up that late touched out or you know that's got to be just destroying them up as they had that victory they had that game in their hands and delivers you could say come on down and get the touchdown that's just horrible the do\nAbsolutely and for people don't remember this exact same thing happened last year Penn State had a devastating loss to Ohio State last year it was by one point this year was by two I think or vice versa whatever\nUm and then they go to Michigan State last year a and losing some crazy game was postponed by whether all that stuff\nAnd the exact same thing happens this year you lose by one to Ohio State you have a game that you should have one that you could have one you're off of by you have no excuse\nAny lose to Michigan State and now let's be honest the seasons basically over and by the way schedule doesn't get easier they still have Michigan in Wisconsin on the schedule\nWow wow uh Roberta greetings from ... one Sunday here\nBut you can't lose me wow ... pm Sunday I feel like that's like back to the future and she's going to tell us who won Sunday's game Roberta call back later and Libya or sweet sweet later let me know when the Kansas City patriot game so hit the ... there there's an NFL\nGame in London tomorrow has that game already happened or does refer to know about it there's so many once you cross the international dateline I voted for years about yeah so she's in the future in Okinawa um so do we not I am very confused as\nTo what is that means ... NFL suddenly football's NFL Monday football over there\nIt must be yeah Monday I don't know if\nI liked that all day Monday did and it does make Monday pretty exciting then I mean think about that but you got to go to work and could you imagine it's ... o'clock on the east coast or ten o'clock in the west coast and all the games last ... I got to go to work my job is is a horrible like VW tournament or something yeah\nTheir work week I guess I never really thought of it like that but thanks to revert from the future you know that most NFL games in Asia and Australia or played Monday and I wonder if people those don't watch in there\nI Love it I just went through some of the other games that are ... that happened to the top twenty five Alabama know prop well\nShould I say no problem with Missouri it was thirty to have time no it wasn't in doubt they took to out because of uh what was it the me on the side that was hurting him back to before he went into the slide but he was seen laughing on the sideline\nSo it didn't look like it was that it you know that that much of a problem twelve or twenty to sixty five three touchdowns\nNot great performance up for a guy that put a better numbers in that\nNo we saw we saw him walking around on the sidelines after like you said he's joking I think you'll be fine Ernie I Will say though I Will say this I listen I'm not calling and upset because I'm not a crazy person but all of a sudden\nI don't think I'd be that confident you go to Tennessee next week you better hope to as close to a hundred percent and I know head of the one the first FCC gave in in two years they beat are ranked team on the road jeeze and by the way they played Georgia tough few weeks ago too I'm not saying they're not going to pull the upset\nI'm just saying all of a sudden that game looks a lot different on paper especially if you can't go with all due respect Janet hurts like he's a good player but we've seen this year why he got beat out last year why save and put them in and who was a better quarterback is\nI I agree with you on that also by the way US scored a touchdown mayor now a fourteen seven over Colorado or we also go to Ohio State over Minnesota this was a seven teen fourteen game at the half\nA it was twenty to four team also and and I believe that the gay Minnesota um you know how to turn over the hand of points to Ohio State but bottom line is it wasn't as much of a blood as the\n\n\n\n\nThe news and talk all we can do is just for\nWhich is\nAll I Do all day long like we said that very\nFast [noise] arguing\nGoes where we have\nReleases at least [noise] we\nHave a family they ... they would you would see on on on on Fox Sports radio I listen\nTo I mean the cardinals here I saw one of those things have [noise]\nYou know that's one of your TV show the Fox sports com for details walk\nI become a new car to discover card or that cash back you burn dollar for dollar at the end of your first year or more I discovered dot com slash mad\nLimitations do apply you there in ... near let's go right up to the guy go Fox Sports celebrity hotline joining us now as he does every week you could check about it the big boost\nVegas runner I you know the biggest runner\nBusy day in college football couple of big upsets you know you saw a a a\nLSU be Georgia that was huge there that was even good for the books uh there was a lot of Georgia teaser sway you know where the number two team in the country pretty much just had to win the game\nOut that right that's what I wanted to ask you which one of these Tennessee a shoe Michigan State Oregon Iowa State oh which one of them had the biggest money why pay out\nYeah there were there were some some big I'm On the dog that that came through today in in college football I ... most of them that were around that Eighteen point range tendency race they were\nGiven about fine but don't want the money line you know\nA nice little score for sure I you know but nothing tuition ... extraordinary because it wasn't all that high\nUm but if you saw a lot of even around that touchdown favorites not get their California lose an outright thirty seven seven to UCLA\nSo there was a lotta upsets and that usually is going to result in a really good day for the sports books anytime they could wipe out a lot of those exotic wages that are a large part of their handle now those Caesars and money line parlay is it's going to end up being a very profitable bay for them\nOne team that did hold on obviously didn't cover was Notre Dame I think I've asked you were biggest runner but I Apologize if I have one of his biggest think of Notre Dame because they're always perceived to be this overhyped very public team but when I watch them even though they struggled today I see a really really good football\nYeah they they are really good football team you know right now they're a little bit over valued meaning that they're they're not a top five team in the country they're probably top ten team in the country if they were playing Alabama on a neutral field\nFor sure if it was on a neutral field there was in Alabama forget about it um buy and own a neutral they'd be at two touchdowns ... now maybe they shaded a little bit lower because the book trying to protect their you know themselves and their their their manage risk\nSo they're going to want to a action and Notre Dame getting to touch down to number five team would probably look to appealing\nAnd a lot of public money one sign it so they might bring it out at like eleven eleven and a half but then the white guys would be on ... and you get the public on Notre Dame but yeah most our ratings up of odds makers would make Alabama to touch down paper it\nAre the biggest one of ... let's get right to it let's get the ... the big game Kansas City in New England\nUm first of all how much line of credit do I have with you because you're going to told me I get a team that's perfect the five known you're going to give me not only three points but you're going to give me three and a half ... you're going to be maybe the best team in the NFL puts the patriots deepens I got a lot of question marks also\nOver under fifty nine and a half to like one of the highest over in the regular season about jumps or numbers I've ever see them my wife and how much money's being picked on this game\nFifty nine and a half has left the building ... one already in most thoughts my friend\nUm yeah that that line was only gonna go walk but listen this is the year where we're seeing\nPoints scored we saw it at the quarter poll more points have been scored this season than any other and if there's one market that the fish in on this planet it's the NFL betting market\nAnd that it's going to evolve quickly um and that's why you saw some really high totals even as as early as last week by week fine but the NFL season you saw Pittsburgh, Atlanta total fifty seven last week\nAnd all of a sudden this week you have a sixteen Kansas City New England you have a fifty seven on the board Tampa Atlanta where when I first came out here Twenty years ago is run around the start us\nProbability of on on the game if they saw fifty most betting syndicates fired on the right away\nSo the fact that here we are Twenty years later ten points higher and you know if people are actually ... the over\nTells you how much the game has changed as far as what you're saying I understand what Kansas City but here's what you're going against with New England you're going against a lot of trends and the fact is this New England teams only lost nine games at home in the last nine years wow I'm very very strong\nHome field advantage and more importantly if you just bet them in twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen you did nothing else but woke up and bet New England um whether they were at home where they were way you're twenty four and eight against the spread\nOf the five percent um and you know\nThat's a pretty good uh a winning percentage especially on a public team like New England that the books no are going to get money weekend a week gal\nAnd supposedly there's a premium attach so they're flying pretty much telling you that on a neutral field it's about a pick on 'em you know maybe in a New England about I Am not a wouldn't even say half point better because they private three three and a half point home field advantage when the strongest in the NFL season\nSo I think the lines kind of right uh so far books are getting good to a action\nArnie believe it or not and there's going to be a lot of New England money I think even the Kansas city's been that public team getting last week in and week out five into straight up five and more importantly against the spread\n'em in the world the will of land that you'd have in the when the ten I still think new England's that team at home that people are going to bed so I think books are going to get a ton of bond you and pretty good to a action\nChargers at Brown yeah opened is now the brown slowly favorite ... biggest something or is this simply the public loves bigger Mayfield than the ...\nKnow I actually a sad scene betting syndicates on opposite sides on this game\nI was surprised to actually to to see on the Cleveland sign because most would would\nMake a the chargers power rated over a Cleveland at least on a neutral field or a lot better but the white Cleveland has been playing a blade and more importantly against the betting market is I think why you're up against the betting line is why you're seeing\nThis um I think when when the money comes in from the public and most don't bet till Sunday I don't think Cleveland is going to be the\nSign that that ends up getting the money I think the chargers will get money from the public so I wouldn't be surprised see this line drops some and I think that books are going to end up needing Cleveland when this game kicks off\nA again I it takes a while for the market to change their minds on teams and and when ... you know a team like Cleveland's in bad for so long even though there for and won against the spread very profitable this year um they haven't really been getting money weekend we gal\nBiggest runner um Chicago was what point favorite on the road of Miami we know Miami is a lot of injuries now with the miners for you want to take the Chicago Bears a huge news use if you miss up but uh still profitable but as one of the big wide changed\nIt really is and here's what you have to remember on if you wanted to bet this game last week um you could walk through the window Seventy six days ago and they would have gave us at Miami minus one\nThat are serving this game off just six weeks ago or six days ago excuse me so I don't believe it it's that\nThey've now one seven straight without Scott Ross maybe it wasn't Scott Frost maybe they just have a really really really good teams Scott brushed it abroad that team with a minute rascal\nOr should have stayed at Central Florida because it's not working out in Nebraska I mean you know I look I don't know how many teams have to lose in what everyone's record has to be for them to be a series playoff contenders when he won Nineteen in a row I mean we got to give them a little bit of credit right play a big boy they did they'd be offered in the peach bowl lashed\nVern last year who beat Alabama\nEnd they play that you can huskies to open this season was the one in Yukon huskies [noise]\nI'm careful with high there you go our top four plus one nuts my top four plus like three or four or whatever was on you look I don't know what more I can say about manning I Know everybody's piling on um I Love you I I think he's still a hall of fame quarterback but the last couple of years have just been intolerable\nI I I'm from I Can't take it anymore [noise] I'm not his fault if they pick the sixty three yard field goal a couple of weeks ago or against them\nTo win that game or a Carolina did but um doesn't make a difference at this point one in three one for one in five\nOr the law says just keep piling up the season's over just like last year the season's over um I think oh do back um juniors or a clown I Would have not signed them were traded him um before the seasonal before I give them the big money or\nYou could lose with them if you think you wouldn't want them you could certainly lose with them because that's what they're doing\nI just I'm losing respect for this guy but it's a complete debacle in New York right now and\nI agree with everything you said in my only real thought on hotel is I just so disagree with what he did with the uh ESPN interview with little ... by aside um you know my my whole thing is like look it's not like he's in the middle of a contract\nHe knew what this team was going to be coming back this year and he chose to take the money and by the way a lot of people every day choose to take the money choose to take a situation where maybe they know there is a better situation where they won't get the same money or they have to risk giving up something\nHe took the money and now he's the proverbial guy that wants to have his cake and eat it too and you can't be that way and so to me yes we can talk about how disappointing the giants are how bad Eli has looked but I also think that when you're the highest paid wide receiver in the least\nThe to the to the locker room with time left on the clock you can't be throwing your quarterback under the bus I mean but again\nThat to me is inexcusable you let him walk away and not make a big thing about that they don't want to hear about he was the hydrated and all that ... that is just disgusting that he left his teammates out there by himself by by themselves\nTotally agree and I just think that you know look I Know Charles Berkeley once said that I'm not a role model just because I'm a professional athlete\nBut when you make that much money you have to be a leader in the locker room and I think he's totally sending the wrong message good for a young kid like say Kwan Barclay just put his head down and play football and not get caught up and all that could say corn was phenomenal and he's very clear to the future that organization regardless of Eli in regardless of whatever else futures\nBy the way I think I saw a good start on that uh that the giants are foreign Seventeen since uh oh Dell was on the party boat or whatever that was\nOh yeah [laughter] I Would say that's why he's the hydrated spending too much time on boats out there that love is such a bomb or just the way the world\nWill come back we'll check it on the weight scores late news and notes ... some of that for us

I'll give you my thoughts on I just want to start this real quick for the last hour um I told your story um how the local deli or that I go to every day here in ...\nUh in the Vermont state lottery and I'm I'm pretty sure it was the old lady I cut in front of me um and and when the money so that that really should be mined by the way if I Try to doubt announcer for some of the money is that you think she would only like maybe fifty or a hundred grand or or not really\nI wouldn't give you a dollar now that's why I thought also did you hear about the couple that had one thousand dollars in an envelope because they were going to buy you tie you season tickets\nAnd their two year old boy put it in the paper shredder\nI did see that yeah\nAnd they put it in the paper shredder obviously the thousand dollars got shredded up and they they couldn't use the money those banks that maybe in two years\nThey can get their money back I I still don't know what a two year old is doing sticking his fingers near a paper shredder have you ever had your dog or and if you have you ever lost did he think of like big values sports wise or anything like that Aaron or or ... nothing like that where it's like a thousand dollars you're using the buy tickets or or anything like that\nNo and I'll be honest I didn't really follow the story so forgive me for lack of details but why it was a kid right next to a paper shredder as\nWell I guess his father you know like just read papers or even you know like a CPA so he's constantly writing papers\nAnd the kid you know works with the ... does that with his dad was towards the paper son envelope and just put it in the paper shredder my thing is you know they were looking for the money did not hear the papers are going on with a kid starts like in the body down there or what\nYour right Ernie I Will say this though I I I actually feel really really bad for the parents because they not only were they oughta thousand dollars they don't get the go to the u._k. they would have seen a dominant you've performance against Arizona last night oh my God Arizona like a JV team out there so I Can't believe\nYou never lost or misplaced anything of value when I was speaking about getting married when my wife and I got married we got a a a president from friends of ours that gave us too\nTo free round trip tickets and my wife misplaced the tickets\nWow and she also you also won a trip to my crew in Asia that young to take the newlywed game we went to a trip we won the newlywed game on Sunday we'll have to play the uh the final speed round of that that's pretty funny and uh we won a trip to micro nice job\nAnd uh we never took the trip unfortunately but I I Would have been I I I Wish they would have just sent this to Hawaii would have been a lot easier than me go to Mike Mike whereas micro knees yeah you know\nSo shoot vacations she's basically to blame for that you miss\nPretty much much on their eyes so there you go I or the game of the week the game of the NFL is Kansas City of New England um I've been waiting this one\nI Can't believe that a lot of people on the New England side\nI've watched every patriot came pretty much from start to finish and people think that older packed the patriots are back oh because they get a couple of wind and they'd be the dolphin team\nOf that was absolutely disgusting and never got off the bus I mean it was just horrible oh what they did not games all of a sudden the patriots are back to their old and they're going to win the super bowl\nAnd let me tell you something uh first of all their defense is going to have such a tough time\nKeeping up with this Kansas City speed not even going to be funny also no way they're going to be able to match point for point with this Kansas City chiefs team over under what now sixty is Vegas runner told you\nHighest overall under any regular season football game a New England defense just can't slow them down as for keeping up with Kansas City offensively yes they got better a little bit better with Edelman but besides that\nThey're not going to score and more than thirty points on you I think Kansas City is going to route this patriot team\nI completely disagree first of all you say they're not going to school more than thirty well if you look at the chiefs\nIf I if you look at the chiefs I mean look we all love Patrick homes it's a great story whatever look last week he wasn't that good he wasn't that impressive it was probably is worst start twenty to thirty eight zero touchdowns to write sections\nThe defense was what was effective last week and you look at as I said earlier in this segment\nThey have some injuries the Anthony Thomas old though statistically it doesn't look as though he is an important part of that often he's kind of a kind of a key ... as far as the mist directions and all the stuff they do he's out for the year was an injury the offensive line has beat up the last one of their starting guards for\nTheir but everybody thinks the patriots her back just because they beat the dolphins and the colds back to back out of home which the culture the worst team in the NFL pretty much in the ... were just no they are they're the dolphins are worse than the cold well a stop and and you know I mean those were too easy victories for that meant that people think the pages are back but they got those two victories\nToo easy victories except you were telling me three weeks ago how great the dolphins\nWere ... there were three you know they should do what the ... before and one right now they blew that gave me gives a Cincinnati\nThey shouldn't be foreign one and the patriots bloom out I mean here's the truth about the patriots their their ... we'll see what you want about um worst of all one into\nThe big thing you've got to remember the patriots is that they are everyone's biggest game on the schedule and we've seen that look the jacks have not been the same team since they beat those patriots\nThe lions have not been the same team since they beat the patriots although they obviously had a nice one last week against the Packers right but when I look at the patriots there are completely different team at home they're averaging thirty four and home only Fifteen per per game on the road\nAnd you bring up Edelman back you bring up Josh Gordon being back ah the the run game as improve Sony Michel is getting better every week I just think it's a team that's continuing\nThere's a month and that's what I was going to say I don't want to quite call it a pie week but getting those two three extra days 'cause they played last Thursday to Thursdays ago I think that's a factor I think the patriots won this\nGame I think that as a fact of the extra couple of days off but you think that this patriot defense is good enough to slow down more homes I I think bought homes who like you said didn't have the best the games last week it had the two interceptions\nI think this week's all of the story I don't see any speed from the defense of a team of knowing and especially the corners I think bombs 'cause I have a big big day of four and more touchdowns in this one\nYeah I just think looks sometimes in in football you see a team kind of going in the wrong direction and as good as Casey has been\nThey haven't been the team the team that we saw it just just blitz through everybody early in the season\nThe best news in ... and we do for his duty for all weekend or students intelligent informed but you see is how I talked to one of the six months or ...\nLike Harmon Archie you know people say it's good news there that day and they bring you the best sport dogs\nOr your we pay for it I think so it's a wonderful thing are you with us or its radio it's\nInteresting to listen to you more on\nThe lights on and what it was like for instance [noise]\nYou'll find that last one I'm your TV show that Fox Sports ... details while\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] good evening everyone Arizona's audience that you're the segment broad Dubai discover card we treat you like you you thanks to our friends over to discover card I guess a good day in Los Angeles\nDodgers one UCLA Bruins won the Lakers are going to win every time they play ride every everybody's all excited for a perfect day too\nYou know everyone that lives here is associated with me which I think is great for them congratulations to them\nThe ... I've lived in a lot of places\nLiving in that way just took like twenty extra years off my wife I Want you to know why the traffic ... I just couldn't deal with it anymore I I just couldn't take it you know and besides I'm a New Yorker right and when you're east coast guy and you're in New York or\nIt's hard though you don't watch sports and talk sports the people on the west coast they're just not as educators as the people on the east coast so it was very tough for me in in that situation\n[noise] I'll tell you this or any I Know that was a lot of people yelling at their radios right now I've read now I I uh I'm from Connecticut in yeah though I I I feel somewhat oh the auditory\nPart of Connecticut I'm sure no I'm I'm from the the the rough into ... so if you're from Connecticut the whole state forty toity but go ahead\nI mean I'm not going to I'm not going to that you ever heard of gun wave in New haven they don't mess around over there\nHow about the dirty water Waterbury ever been there that's a tough little neighborhood yeah come to my neighborhood of the Bronx New York I don't know how to come to come to that maple syrup a farm that you live on in Vermont I don't think that's I don't think there's a a you\nKnow right here there's no crime is I'm the only person that lives here that's why there's no crying I Know I let me get the Tampa in Atlanta you know not that this is a big game or anything like that I just got to say something if I'm a falcon fed at what an for saying that you're disappointed it's such an understatement\nBecause this is people this was people's long shot maybe to even go to the super bowl\nAt least maybe the division and make some noise in the playoffs now would one in four I thought of one in three I said if they lose and water for their seasons on maybe I'll give them an extra week if I had a million dollars and you told me the bed a million dollars on one game I Would take the falcons minus three\nSo you're living life on the edge over there aren't any I Love it or to I'm not I'm not so that any cans of anything will be open one because Tampa's coming off by two last time they were on the field they got absolutely embarrassed by the bears we talked about it last segment ... six touchdown passes\nAnd I'm just not sold on these falcons I just I just don't think that they have the capability to do that to anyone in this league especially defensively I mean they're down so many starters that I just feel like whoever they play it's going to be a high scoring shootout at best and worst they're going to lose 'cause I just think they're so beat up right now\nVery Pittsburgh seems to be in Cincinnati watch a whole Cincinnati Miami gave him a last week a game Miami shouldn't have lost their up Seventeen nothing Seventeen three in the fourth um Cincinnati very lucky to pull it up there to pick sixes\nA to pull away in that game Pittsburgh the much better team but the games in Cincinnati I I think there's going to be one of the better games in Cincinnati just the point that favor the I guess the same Pittsburgh's a better team\nI still expect Pittsburgh to win but\nI'm Still you know questioning whether this bingo team is for real or not\nYeah bangles fans are going to be mad but I'm with you on him and you mentioned last week don't forget week one against the colds the self described worst team in the NFL according already Spanier\nThey completely controlled that game they being the colds or in complete control for three quarters before the bangles came back the falcons game was back and forth bangles one by one point\nI'm just not sold at the bangles or that good I just think that the competition they've been able to overcome inferior teams the Steelers need to win this game and they are going to fall back in the division I actually I'm with ya I like the Steelers here\nA game I'd never thought I Would say is a monster game but it is the chargers in the browns the line on this game has been absolutely crazy ethics charges rights\nBut I also believe in this charge team who wants to what Kansas City and the rams so how good is this charge a team and throw it to us is Kim it gives the top two teams and the other federal Aaron well it's\nAn interesting counterpoint but look at who they beat though\nThey beat the bills right the raiders right and the forty niners without Jimmy ... ... so it it it's funny that you brought it from that perspective because I brought it from the prospect I was thinking\nComing into this game why would they be yeah that that's exactly what I Would I said like they could have been five at all because they lost to exactly so I I Will say this I think it's going to be a fun game and you could say whatever you want about the the chargers but on the flip side with the browns\nLook we all love the two two and one start and by the way the two losses\nAnd the Thai they could have one\nBut the two wins they could have lost to do I'm just saying I still think with the browns we're still kind of trying to figure them out as well\nAwaiting here by Cleveland\nAnd that you know even there's still one of the two to one but it wouldn't your by Cleveland\nReally sets up to ... them making a run it may be eight or nine wins you know maybe surprising all of us remember I said they were going to when I was at the beginning of the year ... butter when here says hey we're in this for real we're not going to you know just go away and I so badly wanted to see what Baker Mayfield is going to do in this case\nWell let me ask you because I think there's kind of an interesting narrative that's kind of forming here we know that for two three weeks Hugh Jackson did not want to play big or make the right and now I feel like Baker Mayfield is the guy that's going to save his job I almost wonder if you're a browns fan maybe it's time to bring in ... back\nThere but do you I didn't know you Jackson was still the coach I thought he's just the ... a figurehead entering coach until they got urban Meyer well I didn't know that\nI'm just saying is how much do you really want this team to win because you win enough\nAnd I I was excited because yes he he was able to get wins out of a raiders team that for up until the point that he was the coach of the writers they weren't winning but now I'm starting to see it more and more why this team was one in thirty one you saw and hard knocks I Know tours and we've talked about\nThe army are are already you're pointing out to urban Meyer the name that I'm circling on an eighty I think I told you about this Lincoln Riley that's that that that that's the name that I think would be really interesting because\nYou're you're seeing this new age of off into minds like Lincoln Riley is like the perfect guy to jump from college and with the connection Baker may feel they ever they had a really great connection because he was the officer coordinator for and brought like two years and there but\nThis guy or a guy that goes they said I don't know if you could do that by the way that I could agree they're not going\nTo go in and they because they're because they're going to have one tie so they'll go eight seven and one or seven eight and\n... okay but if I buy them a huge accident and even though that they won the game against bombed on loan to yeah he was holding up two fingers like what do you say you want to play two more I I when I was wondering what the heck that was that it was like why why why why is the celebrated\n'cause look because he was yeah 'cause if you look huge accident he's a good football man but you could kind of see just from all all of\nThis that it's the problem with him is he's he's he's not a good coach in the actually the nose can only get you so far he's a good guy and I think the big the best quality that I've heard about him\nThrough like the hiring process is that he's A People's coach late and that he gets along really well with his players like\nThey brought Snoop Dogg to practice this week it's like stuff like that like that's not going to get you to wear the problems want to go just like John Dorsey was they were willing to get there were willing to get it to give it to him but but if you look at like the game management stuff I mean you talk about the putting that you think\nGrown to the ground at the line of scrimmage yeah\nEverybody's throwing their hands up and he used to stand in the area that they would in\nThat my whole thing is that if you're the head coach you got to go to that for your you got to let your guy that you're in their corner and he's just standing there ... you know staring at the butterflies in the sky and it's like being a good guy only gets you so far I don't I don't feel like he's got those head coach quality\nThat's what I'm saying the rams are in the middle of a three game road trip right now I guess you'd call it a road trip I mean in baseball you called the road trip with three straight they wanted to Seattle last second last week or they play the Broncos this week then next week against the forty niners\nI don't know I mean I I think that I I Do think this would be the week where they get tripped up I'm just surprised that we're seeing all these these random three game stretches but I I Do think it could happen this week because you have the you know you're kind of in the middle of that low I just can't see it I don't think the Broncos can produce enough often\nAnd the first coach that will probably lose his job\nOr is adjacent Garrett cowboys at home against the jags\nFirst of all cowboys will not be able to keep up with this jags team or even though it's a little disappointed with the jags have done lately jags defense just way too strong and you want to talk about being behind the eight ball lasting the cowboys can afford to do was dropped a two and four\nAnd be behind the eight ball and this division even though it's not a hard division jak Prescott looks like a one year wonder I really believe that they missed as I Can't believe I'm saying that uh ... Elliott spin\nCould but not great I expect a lot more out of it but he needs more healthy they just don't have enough offensive weapons around them and say goodbye to Jason given how many more years to go where he said Nate\nWell ah Jerry Jones thinks that that they can turn around and make the playoffs this year he also sure sure Jerry he's also said a deck is a combination of a camp new and charity golf but luck on that too yeah yeah ... it's funny 'cause we lay offs\nWith the Garrett stuff I actually looked it up because I was like I was like this is just as bad as it gets so eighth\nAnd the Sixers Marvin Louis oh jeez so the only guys that have been at their jobs longer are ... check Marvin Lewis Mike mccarthy Sean Payton Mike Tomlin John horrible that's it\nThey all want a Super Bowl except for Marvin Lewis who don't have high expectations anymore then do they\nI guess not by the way they want a playoff game in the middle that's like those\nOn ... I guess he has to be wonderful yeah he's one of ... ... I'm pretty sure I double check me fact check that but I think he has one of ... well whatever he hasn't won and I mean those I think it was it gets Philadelphia well those guys haven't but I'm not sure that wasn't ... maybe it was against\nDetroit maybe yeah you're right yeah but then they lost the Packers\nYou're right okay so here's one playoff yeah but you're right it was one playoff when\n... but before the ... gun Seventeen years\nUh without ... loose so that's an excuse eight years one playoff one yet though that yeah that sounds like she was I think it will do well I think we've covered up a will give our picks will tell you we like against the spread we'd been right on that's coming up next year in tourism only spend your ... says Fox Sports ...\nPlayoffs talk about the play offs you kidding me play offs I just hope we can win a game [noise] [laughter]\nCollege football [laughter]\nMy cat shepherding fumble hammering touchdown\nWhen it comes to see the only football coverage on your radio\nWanting me these these Fox Sports radio\nHey it's been Mather here everybody's got to do list drop off the dry cleaning pick up some milk here's an idea let's that save hundreds of dollars on car insurance and the good thing is you don't have to drop off or pick up anything or\nMore on car insurance that extra money in your pocket it just may be the most rewarding to do that you do today\nThat's when the Michelin Man is on your side helping you sleep better and drive safely new Michelin premium white Berkeley\nDesigned with exclusive smart looks technology or English beamed has a Michelin blades flex to the curb of your which giving unparalleled streak free long lasting ... performance\nSo when the going\nMichelin ...\nIs a difference you can see Wal Mart and then the other line retailers [noise]\nMy name is Tom Thornton and my name is Cindy ... we've been married thirty eight years we're retired and this is how we live in Idaho\nWe play golf and we travel but we also decided we're going to get to and volunteer with the United way that our community free health clinic and\nIdeas and nursing at the clinic I work the front office checking in patients greeting them making them feel comfortable\nUnited Way is how we contribute because we now our time and money are going to the right places [noise] the places that need it most and implemented bath\nJudging by the thank you as we get at the clinic I'd say we're doing the right thing with our retirement to\nWe even get a blast is incredible\nWere common Cindy Thornton\nWe volunteered our community free health clinic\nSo we don't just where the shirt [noise] we live a\nGift advocate volunteer\nLiving on its good living on a daughter worked ...

Fifteen minutes could save you Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance visit guy go dot com\nFor a free rate quo so if you are looking for a little bit of action we have one top twenty five teams still playing\nTo go in that game at the coliseum we will keep you posted it or anything happens in that game as it pertains to the betting line and how that stuff works out but right now it looks like Colorado is going to go down there were undefeated heading into this game and so Colorado appears to be falling\nFrom the ranks of the ... beat and here at the coliseum going into this game of note USC was a six and a half point favorite and the total the point total was at fifty four and a half\nSo USC going into this game six and a half point favorite or if you're a Colorado better you're looking for a little back to recover to try and save your Saturday depending on how the rest of your games when but it is a busy weekend in football obviously college football\nBut here on straight out of Vegas these Saturday edition we look ahead to the weekend in the NFL because there are several match ups in the NFL that our analysts are insiders are sharpest if you will the guys who are responsible\nFor building the mansions that they live in based on their picks and their ... throughout the course of several years covering football college football the NFL the NBA they have broken down several games in the NFL and they have given the reasons why they liked the line\nOr they lean in a certain direction when it comes to the line and so we get things started with the biggest game of the weekend and that game would be the New England patriots hosting\nThe Kansas City chiefs and New England comes into this football football game on Sunday Night Football right now the line is set at three and a half and the discussion earlier this week on straight out of Vegas between RJ bell and Steve ... was how bad is this Kansas City defund\nLast week five hundred yards they gave up to the jags five hundred\nKansas City has given up more yard than any team in NFL history so by that metric the worst defense and the history of football size [laughter] we know homes as my\nGood pass favorite by three and a half later like yeah I like the patriots I bet the patriots minus the three and a half and also with that case the defense as bad as they been RJ they got three defensive back on the injury less they may be even worse\nLet me ask a quick question quickly devil's advocate in your power ratings you put them out every week you've got Kansas City in New England almost tied three is the typical home field why do you actually like the patch lane three and a half\nTen days to prepare and new weapons with Edelman Gordon ready to go\nSo the new weapons have caused an upgrade and the pat yet\nAnd this game is going to be fascinating on Sunday night because I Love the idea of Andy Reid who's like an old school Mason but he's got a brand new saw and he's going to go into Sunday Night Football was something that he's never had before any time that he's face to build Bella track team\nAnd that's a quarterback who can throw it down the field and an offense as dynamic as any in the NFL if you remember a year ago Kansas City went into New England as New England was raising a Super Bowl banner and they put one on New England on national TV\nAnd Alex Smith put on a show\nAnd I give Andy Reid credit and I've said it the entire season it took a lot of guts for Andy Reid to look at is roster and say you know what I'm tired of going ten and six or Lebanon five or maybe even twelve and for\nHosting a playoff game possibly getting by and they're losing that first home playoff game or winning it and going into New England and losing I'm tired of it and he decided I'm going to take my shot and I'm going to do it with a guy who's got the greatest feeling of any quarterback that I've ever coached outs\nLove with Patrick Boyle homes way before anybody even knew who the hell he was\nTheir general manager was sending Andy Reid clips on Patrick my home's\nSaying check this guy out you've got to see this quarter back what do you think of him that was early on in the process so now Andy Reid shows up on Sunday Night Football and he's going against Bill Belichick and he's got this brand new toy that he can unveil on bill ballot check but the numbers and all\nThe history that goes with Bill ballot check and time off when he's got extra time to prepare a vet Bill Belichick has been preparing like he's never prepared on a ten day\nWeek in essence because they play it on Thursday Night Football just looking at every angle and every aspect of passer bones heading into Sunday night and he's got a little bit\nOf tape that he can look at against Jacksonville\n... homes through a couple of interceptions it was clearly has worse game as a starter in the NFL and so that's going to be a fun one to watch and you hear the sharp you hear are ... leaning towards the patriots minus that three and a half coming up on Sunday night a straight out to Vegas here Fox Sports radio so there's another\nGame that is a note and it's an old school division rivalry and AFC North dual you remember all those\nClassic matchups between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Cincinnati Bengals and it just always seemed like the Steelers had their number\nAnd it's because they usually did\nAll the guys were breaking down this match up coming up on Sunday where you find the Cincinnati Bengals sitting in a one and a half point favorite over the Pittsburgh Steelers who are visiting coming in off a big win over the Atlanta Falcons at Heinz Field a week\nSteve ... talked about sort of a false narrative when it comes to Cincinnati Pittsburg at Cincinnati Bengals\nSince he is a ... worse than its dealers\nWho do you lean to who do you like I like the Steelers I bet the Steelers plus the two and a half it's all about the bangles being over rated ESPN has them as the number six team I have the Bengals as my number four team team RJ and it's because of all the close games the Bengals have had and somehow they keep winning these coin flip games\nAnd he's got a point let's really ... let's break down Cincinnati's wins and if you're listening in Cincinnati this isn't trying to be negative this is just call it how it is in deep down you know this is the truth\nSo you beat Indianapolis at Indianapolis with Andrew Luck returning from a shoulder injury and throw the football since like the Nineteen sixties and you beat Indianapolis week one and then you get Baltimore and a week to but you get them on a short week\nAdvantage home team which was Cincinnati\nYou lost that Carolina and then you want to Atlanta because they're secondary use soap banged up and it took a last second touchdown credit all credit on the road ... credit goes to to Andy Dalton and AJ green and Marvin Lewis and that whole bunch\nAnd you throw a late touchdown and win that game at Atlanta but Atlanta's not even close to the team that you thought they were and then last week against the Miami Dolphins Miami had that game in the bag\nCincinnati didn't play well\nAndy Dalton didn't light it up last week Miami had that came with a bag\nAnd they let it slip away multiple turnovers which resulted in the scores so few actually break down the foreign one record of the Cincinnati Bengals it's just not like a normal foreign one record\nYou've got to do some digging you can't scratch the surface on the Cincinnati Bengals and to the point of RJ and Steve ... when you actually do a little bit of digging and it's why they're as good as they are you get to the bottom of things and you find out that Cincinnati is now they're cracked\nNews while looking for a while you're on TALK of the coin growing\nUp I was one of your TV show to Fox Sports ... detail why [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\nThree out of big box stores radio I'm Jonah stock sitting in for RJ bell and Bernie Fratto [noise]\nSo in a couple of minutes from now we will be disgusting [noise] a really good story in the NFL it's a really good story unfortunately we have to be the bearer\nOf bad news that it's not as great of a stories you think it is so we'll get to that here uh momentarily on Fox Sports radio some nervous energy for batters who are currently still holding on to hope\nIn the U.S see Colorado game where the USC Trojans who came into the game a seven point favorite at home against the ranks Colorado Buffalo's\nAndy point total for this game was set at fifty seven and a half\nRight now three minutes in change Colorado's just recovered in on side kick us the is holding onto a thirty one twenty lead this has got the makings of a bad beat or a backdoor cover if you will\nAnd it's got the makings written all over it's right now Colorado has the football near midfield and if you had us the minus seven and you had to be under of fifty seven and a half\nNervous energy right now because this will determine whether or not you eat for the next forty eight hours so we will keep you posted on or what happens in this game as the finish up there at the coliseum um do you want to get to this though because\nThere's a really good story going around the NFL and I've talked about this a little bit on my show here on Fox Sports radio and it's the ...\nBut the browns have return to the glory days there are no longer the laughing stock of the NFL it's a great story\nThat's a great spin but see been a great narrative on an NFL team unfortunately the reality is um there are still a five hundred football team\n[noise] and ah their star quarterback because you know they found the guy in as much as I like Baker Mayfield and I've been a believer and Baker Mayfield he's still a sub sixty percent completion percentage guy\nAnd he's got his many touchdowns as he does interceptions so I think we need to slow things down just a little bit as far as the Cleveland Browns go but the browns do find themselves\nIn an interesting spot a favorite at home\nAgainst the LA Chargers a team stumped people thought was a under the radar Super Bowl team before the season started and so the discussion became what kind of role this fatigue play and RJ bell talked about it earlier this week on straight out of it is\nTo me it's all about but he was the chargers they're off to overtime games now historically that doesn't affect against the spread the third game\nWith the browns are only the second team in the last three decades three years\nTo start the season with five straight games all decided by four points are less we know those type games or stressful during tense all four quarters the browns every game has been tight and intense and the last two have been\nOvertime so to me you got to wonder about the browns and their energy level\nAnd I'll say this they're the most exciting they might be the most exciting team to watching the NFL now Kansas city's got the most exciting often but their defenses atrocious we talked about that a few minutes\nThere are in a fantastic football game every week\nWhether it was the Thursday night game against the New York jets and which Baker Mayfield came in at halftime whether it was the game against New Orleans in which ... uh forgot whether he was right foot or left foot in that game\nWhether it was the Oakland Raiders and a bunch of bad calls and then it went into overtime and the raiders finally getting their first win or a week ago\nBeating the Baltimore Ravens Cleveland in a bunch of exciting games and it's a it's a legitimate point if you like think about when you're the most exhausted\nWhen you're the most exhausted when you get into work is when when you were racing to a beach traffic and you're almost going to be late and by the time you get in and your shift get started and you're working and you're hustling and all that all of a sudden you sit down and you get a break by lunchtime your gassed\nBecause it's the adrenalin dump and the browns have had to go to that adrenalin dump every single or if I had to deal with that adrenaline high every single game\nIt's just natural there's going to be a dumping that game and I just wonder\nIf this is the one where the chargers come back\nThey remember what happened on Christmas Eve a couple of years ago and the chargers look at this and said this is our chance to get revenge they got their first went against us they're feeling and and writing Hi this is a time we go in and we show everybody why we were a Super Bowl contender before the season started\nA straight out to Vegas is brought to you by guy go what does it mean one guy go says just Fifteen minutes could say be Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance\nMade you probably should have gone to a guy go dot com fifth teen minutes ago again you can hear this show Monday through friday straight out of Vegas with myself RJ bell Steve ... and Brad powers\nA three to four pm Pacific time six to seven pm eastern time the pre game show you always wanted right here on Fox Sports radio we now go on to ...\nHosting the Chicago Bears the betting line in this game it started as low as one and a half in favor of the bears it has now moved up to four three and a half in some areas but it's a round a field goal give or take a point\nThe bears favorite coming off of by week in Miami and the Miami Dolphins\nWho come into this game having choked and given up a game that they should have one on the road at Cincinnati a week ago the dolphins find themselves\nNow losers of two in a row after starting off the air hot and RJ bell talks about why the advantage and the focus may lean towards the Chicago Bears coming off that by week\nTo me this is the trend of the week this one bears repeating road favorite so the bears are favored on the road\nWith Thirteen or more days rest so that effectively a pot roast favorites with a five sixty winters against the spread twenty two losers only sixteen twenty two sets Seventy three percent\nSince two thousand and two [noise] so what does it mean row favored often overlook them 'cause you know you're the row favor you're clearly better who's your favorite on the road for\nWhen you have a five year rested and focus is kind of the same theory of Minnesota I like dogs usually 'cause the favorite might not be focused well I Know the bears are going to be focused\nAnd also when you couple that with the information that has come out within the last couple of hours that Ryan tannahill according to a report has an AC joint spraying in his shoulder and he may be a game time decision\nWe might get ourselves a little bit of a ... or maybe the quarterback for the Miami Dolphins so when you factor that in and the bears coming in after putting up a huge performance against Tampa Bay they're going to be fully rested the deep\nQuarterback everything points to the bears in this game\nAnd when you see the amount of money that's come in on this game and you see the point going from one and a half\nThe industry to three and a half now up to four in some places and if you go to pre game dot com that's where it's at at four points right now and I'm pre game dot com\nIt updates while you're looking at if you go to pre game dot com you go to the game center you can see all the point totals you can see just spreads and if something changes while you're looking at it it'll be updated on the spot so it took a fantastic tool when you see all that action and all that money coming in on one side\nAnd then you factor in a banged up starting quarterback and a team that lost a brutal game on the road a game they gave up and they have not looked the same over the past couple of weeks\nEverything does point to the Chicago Bears in this game Jonah stocks here straight out of Vegas on Fox Sports radio you can listen to the show on the\nEye of heart radiolab I'm coming up next

Caroline it and\nIt's amazing that there are certain teams that just figure it out every single year and going into the season I don't know that anybody expected much of Carolina a brand new offensive coordinator\nOr you know Cam Newton getting up there in age plays a physical style a quarterback how much can his body hold up a ... can you rely on Christian McCaffrey uh they've got some veterans on the defense or are those guys going to be able to stay healthy and now here's Carolina\nThe NFC South which is one of the better divisions in football\nAnd we can pooh poohed or sixty three yard when er sixty three yard field goal a week ago to get the win\nWin win win in the NFL they want to shoot out against the giants they figured that came out and they're getting gray goals and back most likely for this football game and they're also going to be getting Thomas Davis back he is off suspension it looks like a pretty good spot for Carolina I'm surprised at Washington is an underdog here\nI'm surprised Washington at home against Carolina is getting points\nBut then again that's why they're the experts it's all about the match ups and there's a lot of experts out there who like

you\nNeed great acting or you'd need this stuff leading up to the ending to be really worthwhile it could be a car chase a fight scene or whatever but if you knew the ending going into a movie what's going to keep you around\nYou know you gotta have something that that is in in print it in your mind you've gotta have something to look forward to if somebody tells you the end of usual suspects it kinda ruins the whole movie but if they say\nYeah but you know there's this scene where they're all standing up they're getting ready or to get their their picture taken and they're all kind of messing around and goofing around with each other it's really really funny I Would recommend\nIt or you know the ending to the movie heat somebody tells you how the movie heats going to end what is going to keep you around to watch that movie the shootout scene in the streets of LA\nLike you need something to ... an epic in between in order to make sitting around for an ending you already know worthwhile if you\nKnew you were going to get fired if you knew for sure you were going to get fired you knew exactly when your boss was going to fire you how would you spend your last days at the

football season appears to ...\nIt's not even close if you listen to straight out of Vegas you're on Fox Sports radio they've talked about\nHow much Alabama would be favored by going into each of these games Ohio State looks like a good football team right 'cause you're a pretty good team Georgia looks like a pretty good team right up until Saturday and and ... and LSU ah hammering I'm at in Baton Rouge\nBut those are good football teams those are like the next good football teams compared to Alabama at minimum this season Alabama on a neutral field would be a seven point favorite\nAt minimum a seven point favorite that is how much better they are than every other team in the country\nIn fact Alabama's been so good\nThat they're starting quarterback hasn't played in the fourth quarter of any game this season [laughter] just imagine that they're so good that they're starting quarterback doesn't know what the fourth quarter feels like\nBecause the games so out of hand that there is no reason for him to be in there\nThere's no reason like that's how dominant Alabama's been in fact Alabama's so good that they're backup quarterback is twenty six and to end his career when he starts\nTalking all time talent here like ... or possibly and historically great football team\nTalking two thousand five taxes we're talking Matt Weiner Reggie Bush us see we're talking about the Miami Hurricanes of years past weren't talking in all time great footing\nIt appears that it's just a coronation waiting to happen Alabama's\nThat much better than everybody else there that much more dominant than everybody else and even on a neutral field it would be considered a slight upset if somebody just lost by less than ten\nYou know if you'd you just keep it within single digits at least that team will cover the spread\nLike it it it it's done like we're watching football right now and there's nobody out there and their right mind who can come away from this saying yeah no I really like so and so on that match up with Alabama no you don't you know you're lying to yourself stop a ... year then that job pool a poison the tree\nUh your your your your the the crazy fanatical one who pulls out a a sawed off\nOn his neighbor because how dare you root for Tennessee when you're a Memphis fan like like your that guy\nYou're crazy we know the ending to the movie so what's going to make us watch what's going to keep the interested\nAs many big time programs playing and as many big time games as we can get\nThat's the only thing that's what you need\nOtherwise we're kind of spin in our wheels right now kind of waiting for something to happen kind of hoping somebody gets knocked off I set it on the show yesterday root for Jim horrible you may not want to root for him\nBut just do it root for Jim or a bar roof from Michigan\nI Know you were probably one of those people who call Jim ... overrated but I'm knock knock\nThere's Michigan after losing week one to Notre Dame and they want every single game since\nThey blew out Wisconsin on Saturday Night and they looked like this\nRoot for as many possibilities are as many uh interesting story lines are scenes from the movie before you get to the ending if you already know what it is\nRoot for Harbaugh route from Michigan it's good for college football you see the big house on Saturday Wisconsin in town that place was jumping it so far\nCry from where it was that before ... got there so when they were slinging two liter bottles that Dr Pepper to try and give away free tickets to a Minnesota Michigan game in Ann Arbor\nRoot for Jim Harbaugh in fact the one better route for Notre Dame even if you're not Catholic just do it man referred Notre Dame you don't want to college football playoff at Notre Dame and

X. crotch job and telling you to go stick it out back him again I felt\nLike there was supposed to be so his face and\nIn our lives then who look like you know the things that I said 'cause they in Vancouver can be approach and been in a different way could have been handled in a different way\nI think when you look back on anything and um there's there's things that are completely thing or or you know things they gave me stop you always look back and it could have been handled a different way\nI Know it may have came off however it came off but my message will be nothing more than encouraging everybody to be their very best\nTo pick it up even more than you have to to dedicate and sacrifice more than you ever had\nUm and if anything can be taken from those messages are just to me and my eyes and but I actually care\nI really just have found some off color muscle\nChair about what I'm doing\nNow year oh do back in when you go well it's a little bit over dramatic and I agree on that is a little bit over dramatic um what about them sounded like he was a it sounded like\nTrying to get erotic there during that time by which is bizarre but nonetheless I actually defined do do back in because I don't know what he did wrong\nA key punched a swamp cooler he got pissed off so what\nWas he wrong about his criticisms of Eli Manning did you watch the game Thursday\nLike people that go in with this preconceived notion that oh back um is a bad guy and he's a bad teammate All right well\nLook I all I Know is that when he made the statement said he made they came out after the fact and they played pretty damn while if that was the guy who is teammates didn't respect and a guy who uh teammates just didn't like at all\nThen they would have come out and they would have been really bothered and they would have ostracize them and they would have or are they there would have been tricked place called for O'Donnell back him after the fact he was saying what a lot of people felt and what a lot of people felt for a long time he was saying\nWhat Ben Mac do saw last year which is why bench deal I may end up on that road game in Oakland\nSo this whole thing\nIs going to take a turn and I'm calling my shot right now and I'll tell you this upcoming week\nThis is now going to turn into shut up bowed out back from Europe noxious nobody wants to hear from you now he's not apologizing it was a bad move signing M no it's a guy who is fired up he wants to win games they're not winning he's not getting the football\nIf he didn't care right after he got his contract then that'd be concerning but he's calling it as it is man\nIf you're watching the giants on Thursday night it there's no threat down field everything's a dump off the sake one Barclay and he shouldn't have to apologize I Wish more people were honest like this\n[laughter] and I'm but I'm telling you you just go into it with a preconceived notion of what to do back um is and you're just gonna ride that for as long as the last Jonah socks dear Fox Sports radio eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox\nSo ah cod McGregor again we have a special guest who is going to be appearing here coming up\nNext year on Fox Sports radio right and about sixty seconds from now here on efforts are and the only hint that I'll give you is the following the gardening right so find out who that special guest is next year on up is our but for all the\nLatest from around the world of sports the most violent man in sports talk radio rapper well thank you very much Jonas and major league baseball playoffs continued Saturday with the Houston Astros kicked off the AOL cs by holding Boston to just three hits\nSo you do that are going to be replaced the most important position but also just the change of philosophy a change what they're trying to do just that we as well\nUm I mean I remember calling a game I Want to say gosh it was one of the ... I think it was a couple of years back now and when they play out in Austin and it ... it was the sound effects according or the time he was trying to change them from a a fourth reader three four which takes a while modest the fact that\nYou don't even have the kind of the same type of body types thrown that sort of skiing so you've got to recruits or more time in the waiting room\nTo build up some of those guys who need to become a little bit bigger or recruit guys who have more speed on the edge and and they were done he was going after one year so that's the difficulty of it is\nWhen you've got to change in scheme philosophy you know it's not like you know so we have a huge roster turnover you're working with what you got for the first year I think that's partially the difficulty but uh again going back to I I just think people don't realize what kind of undertaking that a brass was going to be\nAn end to give it to the point where they're going to get back to competing like levels they're accustomed to seeing it's going to take a number of years and chip Kelly the same but UCLA they've got some talent but they're they're devoid of it and most places and he's still trying to teach his system or to what is it a decently young officers as well\nA Brady Quinn Fox NFL college football analyst you heard him on the call us the beating Colorado on Saturday Night also Fox Sports radio host you will be on the air with me eight pm eastern time of Lebanon or a dual Evan pm eastern time five to eight pm Pacific time\nLater on Sunday night here on Fox Sports radio last one have you already eaten what's the post game meal a choice when did we flying out what's happening here\nIf flight out and about five hours a day early\nI Wish I could've hit up in and out I always eat is the opportunity to get in and out about it on the west coast because those birds so damn good but uh unfortunately I don't think that the cards forget it I\n...

to the show in the eye heart radio lab you can always find this on serious ... channel eighty three\nAnd were ever you are listening and all our great affiliates we always appreciate a few minutes your time it is a Sunday Morning in most parts of the countries we get ready for weeks six in the NFL so\nUm we started doing this a couple of years ago and if you've got to a last name that rhymes with something\nYou got to use it so we kinda you kind of work in reverse\nIf you come up with an idea usually you have the idea and then you come up with the name afterwards like the band Korn get rid of the story about how they got the name corn\nTheir ... their original name was LAPD [laughter] I don't know whose idea that was what an awful idea so clearly they couldn't be LAPD\nSo they had to change their name now the ban was already set they were already going to get signed that they had already are built a great following and so they were trying to come up with a name and somebody is a joke throughout the name corn\nOkay why not uh yeah let's go with corn you know it didn't really matter what the name was the band was already set you knew what your the the the they were growing that we're following that a record deal there\nSo I thought of knocks locks\nAnd then I thought of what it was supposed to be afterwards right I should have built the segment and then come up with the name but I figured All right well knocks rhymes with locks and it's better than some other things that it rhymes with that we could probably use it would get us fired which many people have made reference to\nA hence the last part of the south Carolina mascots name you know what I mean so I decided alright so knock slugs what are we going to make it everybody does it a standard uh picked segment on their show everybody makes pigs what can we do that's a little different so I said screw it I'm going to call my shot in five different games\nWhere I Want to make five different predictions sometimes it'll be\nA standard betting on a team to win by four points I'll make a pick a team to win by five points all make a pick up the point in total in a game do I like the over the under sometimes it'll be standard like that and other times I'll go out and I'll just pick random games and I'll pick a random lines and I'll pick a make random\nAh predictions and I decided to modify that this season so\nI entered last week three into on the year\nLast week I went five no\nNever been done in the history and knocks locks five in oh I gave you the Seahawks a I give you the Seahawks plus seven and a half against the rams that was a when\nI told you owed out back and was going to catch a touchdown pass the first of the season and their game against the Panthers that was a when I told you the Steelers would score over three and a half touchdowns against the Atlanta Falcons that was a when I told you that Patrick my Holmes who hadn't done it yet in the season that Patrick\nMy homes was gonna thrown interception not only did he throw one he threw too that was a win and then I told you the cowboys getting three and a half points at home against the Houston Texans I told you to take the\nThe Houston Texans kicking a field goal so fresh off a five and a week I Am at eight and chew on the season which brings us two weeks six\n[noise]\nYears it around [noise]\nFalcons or a three point favorites is the one pm eastern time kicked off on Fox I said it a week man I sincerely feel bad for the Atlanta Falcons if you just think about where they've been in the last year and a half [noise]\nThey had Tom Brady and bill bell a check in the coffin toe tags printed ready to close it throw some dirt and some roses and a tombstone over the top of them\nAnd they gagged away that Super Bowl\nAnd after that they rebounded they figured it out they got back in the postseason they want to post season play off game in LA against the rams\nThey won a playoff game in LA against the rams then they went to Philadelphia had the eagles on the ropes and couldn't close the deal\nThey came back into this season a lot of hype\nA lot of promise a lot of returning stars and they've had closed last after close loss they've been dealing with injuries in their defense and there are secondary it's been an awful year for the Atlanta Falcons I sincerely feel bad for them\nOutside of last week in Pittsburgh where the Steelers were due for a breakout game the falcons had been in every game this season and you could argue the Atlanta Falcons should be for one right now\nTampa Bay turns the gym It's Wednesday\nAnd I'm not sure how that's received in Milwaukee and I'm really not those guys really seemed to rally around Ryan Fitzpatrick\nAnd you remember the confused looks on their face when James Winston was eating his hands saying we're going to eat a W\nTo Sean Jackson\nSpoke out and said there's no way you can try and Fitch Patrick\nThey seem like they were a little bothered by the move by their cutter so I don't know what to expect the often look the best it's look since dirt cutter got there under Ryan Fitzpatrick I may be the last one who still kind of believes in the falcons this could be a pity pick because I feel bad for all that they've gone through\nAnd although I Do think their season is probably over I Do like the Atlanta Falcons in this spot minus three [noise]\nChargers it [noise]\nThe Cleveland Browns stop the presses Ari one and a half point favorite at home this is they won the eastern time kickoff I liked the chargers in a spot I really do I like I said yesterday the vibe around the\nBrowns is that Baker Mayfield is for real and the Cleveland Browns are back and forget about all those losing seasons the browns you're back this was going to be like the late eighties Marty ... Bernie ...\nUh uh all the great players the browns had a ... all those ... epic playoff battles\nAgainst the Denver Broncos the browns are back pepper Johnson you remember pepper Johnson when he was a big free agent signing for the browns when he came over from the giants they're all back man\nLet's go ahead and just to peel away the hype and the hyperbole of the Cleveland Browns and let's take a let's take a real close look at what we're dealing with here\nYou gotta quarterbacking Baker may feel that everybody is talking about as they finally\nMade the right pick a quarterback\nCompleting under sixty percent of his passage he's got his many interceptions touchdowns I liked Baker me\nNice to round three to four thirty six years old I Can't imagine how great you know created using various household let them fall more information by three full on the road in the ...\nMountains in mobile bottle glass is away oh\nRight yeah I mean when you're insured windshield replacement dollars ...

off\nAbout a football coach will tell you that is coming up your momentarily on Fox Sports radio a gas that garbage or NFL trivia game\nBe a part a guest that garbage and here's how it works it is all basic trivia\nNFL trivia all things relating to the NFL that have happened in the last week so you don't need to go way far back it's not a story that's going to come up out of the blue it's all recent NFL\nInformation statistics game storylines I'm going to give you the opportunity to start a national radio answering basic NFL trivia we do it every single week they catch with this though it's not like a normal trivia game\nThe catch for some reason Everytime you guys get on the air you crap down your leg I don't know why not not literally well maybe something you do you been pretty hammered when you call in but\nYou for whatever reason get nervous on the big stage I ask you a simple NFL question we've had we've had times when we've done the game and I'll say\n[noise] uh which NFC East team a\nLast one of the division two years in a row and we've had people say things like\nThe Washington Wizards\nI mean it's it's kinda ... yeah it doesn't make any sense but we will give you an opportunity if you want to play I guess that garbage eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox eight seven seven nine nine six six three six nine that coming up less than ten minutes from now\nHere on Fox Sports radio operator standing by we only have a thousand phone lines they fill up pretty quick so getting now or get lost\nAll right so sometimes the message can get lost because of the messenger and I acknowledge that like certain people can say things to you and you kind of dismissed it um you can dismiss the criticism\nAnd you can not pay any attention to it and and what you'll do and we all do this and I even do it sometimes I'm guilty of it is\nAnd thinking that maybe it's a valid point we just sort of dismiss it because of who it's from an hour harsh it is if a buddy of yours points out that you've gained a little bit of weight\nYeah you might be in a whole but it doesn't mean he's wrong\nMaybe I've gained a little bit of weight maybe you should investigate that as opposed to just being so dismissive but where the comment\nIf you're a girl won't kiss you because you just said a bag of onions you can be offended or you can put a stick a gum and preferably two before the college football season some anonymous coaches were asked about the most overrated coaches in the country\nAnd one of the names that kept popping up in this anonymous poll was James Franklin of Penn State he was on this list in fact\nSome of the explanations for why James Franklin was or is overrated were detailed in this anonymous poll done by CBS Sports quote\nJames Franklin his coaching peers no he's full of it and quote\nHere's another one quote when James Franklin got the Penn State job I thought man he's a good marketer he did a nice job with that it'll be interesting without say Kwan Barclay say corn is underrated he turns a lot of no gain plays into sixty yard touchdown\nAnd quote Penn State has now lost twice at home to Ohio State a few weeks back in which James Franklin with\nPlay calling and terrible decision making light trace mixed orally every one of the games of his life and James Franklin chooses a running play on fourth in five late in that game they get swallow it\nState and then again on Saturday it was Michigan State\nOn ranked in late when at Penn State to shock Penn State who was ranked aids coming into the game\nJames Franklin is now three and eleven against Ohio State Michigan and Michigan State since he's been at Penn State\nThose criticisms got a lot of pushback before the season they were dismissed because of the messenger well it's anonymous because it's not they didn't put their name on it\nWhere they wrong\nI mean kind of a couple a glaring\nPerformances by Penn State a couple of things have happened since that anonymous poll came out that have shown that\nWell maybe they weren't all that wrong there were some people that\nEven called the jealousy you know they're jealous because they don't have that Penn State job you know they're they're jealous they're not getting all the notoriety that James Franklin skating\nAll right well that's fine you can focus on the messenger but was the message wrong is he not a better marketer than he is the head football coach his decision making and play calling at certain points in games not been a question with James Franklin\nWere they wrong\nThere were even some people that through a racial element out there but you know there's a there's a racial element to it I don't know about that but all I Know is that a lot of people said he was overrated and a lot of people have

our here on earth as our every Sunday five am eastern time two o'clock Pacific here on Fox Sports radio we talked nothing but the national football league\nFor an entire hour\nThe big story in the NFL and the big game on Sunday is clearly Sunday Night Football\nTo provide you with everything you need to know about this match up I Will take\nA step back I Will let bill Bella check have the floor because nobody breaks down in previews and does the ... and the grunt work of a football game especially one of this magnitude\nLike the great Bill Belichick a here he is riveting riveting commentary

moving forward or she has provided us absolutely nothing in that break down but in all seriousness or this is a fun game man this is a really fun game but it's not just fun because you anticipate that ah Chris Collins or\nThis getting heavy Ali shocks you know I my ... and\nYou're going to assume that al Michaels is going to drop a gambling reference but\nUh this is a good game because this showcases two coaches who subscribe to this theory of adapt or die\nWhen coaches it because it's such a it's such a fraternity there are certain some coaches out there who don't want to adapt they're going to play the way that they play and they're going to go with their style\nAnd that's just going to be what it is and for all that you want to say about bill dollar check and for all you want to say about\nHis personality and how he's not related to today's athlete and and he doesn't he's he's not somebody that they can go to or they can they can lean on because he doesn't want to have that kind of relationship or whatever you want to say about bill bell jak he's been one of those guys in the footballs in football circles and the football universe it's always been an adapter\nDied guy his weekly games\nYour team and and elevating their play if you play fantasy football and you're listening to the show how frustrating is it to have a patriots running back or a patriots wide receiver\nYou never know which we who's going to be the best guy you never know who's going to get the bulk of the carries\nYou never know who's going to have the most catches\nThe only real consistent player you got is Rob ... he's usually I mean he's one of the better titans in the league outside of that you don't know who's going to be the star one minute it's James White\nThe next minute it's James dabbling\nOr the next minute is Julian Edelman ... do a orange Chris Hogan like you wouldn't have no idea\nThat is a guy who's figured it out adapter die he adapts every single week that's what ... does\nSo when there's the talk of bill ... not being able to be relate a bowl and him not understanding today's athlete and he doesn't understand today's NFL no no no no no he understood it\nWay before anybody did bill bell or check flu where to study what team ... years ago\nOregon\nBecause he kept hearing things about this chip Kelly guy and so he went to go study um how do you guys do your practices what do you guys doing differently that's not one\nOf these old tired or a cranky football coaches who refuses to let the olden days go you know that's a guy who was constantly learning constantly evolving\nNow fashion wise not so much\nMean I Walk by the bus stop outside the studio two weeks ago or saw homeless guy loitering for change I said hey\nStandpoint he's always adapting he's always trying to figure it out\nThat's what he does weekend and we got and he doesn't get enough credit for that for all the criticisms that bill ... gets for his personality he deserves a little bit of credit for being able to adapt to today's NFL and he's been spot on and he's been doing it longer than anybody wants to acknowledge\nThe other guy he was doing that and the other guy who I have so much respect for based on how we approach it\nThis season is Andy Reid ... let's let's not forget what the Kansas City chiefs for a year ago\nRight let's not forget that the Kansas City chiefs\nOutside of the patriots and the Pittsburgh Steelers have been to the playoffs in consecutive years more times than any other team in the NFL outside of Pittsburgh in New England after them it's Kansas City\nAlex Smith playing the best football of his career a legitimate MVP candidate\nHas the best season of his career and what is Andy redo yeah we'll see\nYou or we're going to go and send you over to Washington and I'm going to go with this Patrick ... guy who's a little bit of a wild card ... got a great physical abilities got great talent nobody knows where he's throwing the ball from time to time but I'm going to take my shot with this and I love it\nThat's a ... he could play it safe India.Arie it's always been accused of a guy who plays it save\nA guy who's got this shutdown often and he's got you know it's just yeah you know at the chiefs are they get to a certain point and then they just can't figure it out you know what the eagles were they got to a bunch NFC title games where they could just never get over the hump\nAnd finally Andy Reid at this stage of his career I think looked around and he said to himself you know what man I've tried it I've done the safe thing I've gotten this far as I go\nI clearly am not going to get it done doing what I've done and I've got a great quarterback on my roster\nA guy who's proven that guy is playing the best football this career take a walk I'm going with the young guy\nIn Kansas City for everybody that's surprised by the by the development of Patrick ... homes in what he's done this season Kansas City was on ... homes for years their general manager was sending Andy Reid film in and sending him tape on pasture bought homes because they had their eye on them for a long time\nThey moved up in the draft to take Patrick ... homes that move was determined years before that because they've been watching him and he got what the right guy because he got with a coach who also\nIs adapting to today's NFL Tom Brady had some comments he was on WSBIU this week and I think people took this as an insult\n\n\nWant to you for seven three six wheels that make you smarter feels like when you're

injuries\nOr it could be a blood joining a in Miami and hard rock stadium or hard rocks the whatever hard rock cafe who cares wherever they play football there that they ah did they give away free tickets 'cause nobody goes um but nonetheless we will keep you up to date as to whether or not Ryan ten here will play it are going to give it to go and warm ups reportedly\nUm it could all be a ruse though it could all be an illusion Adam gays trying to get even with the team that he feels like he should have been the head coach for the Chicago Bears and he was assistant\nCan be some of that but nonetheless the reports are Ryan tannahill sprained ac joint multiple injuries they're not sure if he's going to be able to go um they'll give it a go and ... and warm ups and if he can't the great rock Oscar Wilde will be the quarterback for the Miami Dolphins uh the game that I I\nThe Broncos um and it was in one of my knocks locks picks by the way knocks locks I was five and oh we could go see can go ahead and poo poo it and move it along and say oh it's just the typical gambling NFL say well what are we hear that before not everybody is eight and two through two weeks right I Am\nBut one of the things that I was talking about is\nThe rams haven't left the Pacific time zone\nLike they've they've they've they've just recently uh went and played in Seattle and that was a close game ... a game that you know maybe Seattle wins that game if not for some questionable decision making late by Pete Carroll\nBut they've never left the Pacific time zone this season so they finally do and they go to Denver and report the latest is\nThere's going to be a bunch of snow in Denver it's currently snowing right now and it should stop around kicked off but nonetheless it's a team who is not used to playing in the elements like that they do have a ton of injuries on that team\nThe defense is not anywhere close to what anybody thought and so they go they're they're playing in Denver all of that and you've also got a Denver defense who still has talent but it's been exposed a couple of weeks in a row\nAnd I'm I really am I think last week for the rams was their most impressive one of the season\nAmong all the things that the rams have done all the performance is that they put up whether it's the Thursday night game\nAnd the rams put up that huge huge huge performance against the Minnesota Vikings um whether it was a as a you know showcase on Monday Night football in week one where the rams came out and\nThey beat up on the Oakland Raiders late and close the door and the Oakland Raiders either get last week's game a division game on the road maybe the toughest environment in the NFL they've got a battle\nThat with concussions and the rams when it and it's not just that they won that game in Seattle it's how they want it because their coach had the balls to go forward on for fourth down to seal the game I\nThink it was their most impressive one of the season and then they come back a week later and they've got to go to Denver to take on a Broncos I think the rams are gonna win that game\nBut I think the elements are going to play a factor\nUh I think they are banged up\nI think the secondary has been rattled I think there's gonna be opportunities potentially for ... them to put up some points who knows maybe ... is still a little pissed off that he's not still a member of the rams but I like Denver getting the seven points in that game so I Do think that's going to be a fascinating match up\nBetween the Denver Broncos and the LA Rams are coming up four oh five eastern time\nKicked off on Fox so that should be that should be if I Want to watch um\nThe other one that I I Can't help but notice\nIs that Seahawks raiders game in London the one eastern time kick off on Fox you know John ... not dumb I Know people like to pick on him and then do you like to take your shots at him he's not dumb he understands what's happening he understands\nWhat went on last week this didn't get discussed a lot because it was again that was played in a soccer stadium and there are a bunch of other more important games that went on\nBut you remember when Derek car laughed at the idea of not giving the Baltimore Sun Lynch it the one yard line like Seattle didn't do in the super bowl a couple of years ago what happened\nThey get to\nAsk the goal line against the chargers a week ago and their car throws the ball and it gets picked off by Melvin Ingram and Martian Lynch made a comment about it and it didn't get discussed a lot but he made a comment about it after the game not to a pool\nA concerted effort to get Martian Lynch the football as much as he can and I think he's going to do for a couple of reasons one it'll be a make good the Martian Lynch\nFor last week to it's an opportunity for Martian Lynch to stick it to his former team\nI think John ... knows this I think John ... is aware of what's going on I think John ... understands he's got to take a little bit of the pressure up their cars so he's not forcing some of these plays\nNormally a fringe third fourth wide receiver becomes a must play in this type of situation alongside Ridley alongside Julio Jones will eventually scored a touchdown it has to happen mathematically\nAnd asked her ... seven Coleman again pushed to the forefront has devolved into framing back out with an injury so you're all offensive weapons Hooper it's a\nFlip a coin depending on what else you've got a tight end on the other side you know when you're talking about the the Redskins Smith is a high and number two and probably a decent daily fantasy play right if you're going to die dive you want to look contrary and I think in some of those situations where it's not an obvious play because Carolina\nCertainly not an easy defense to navigate a but Adrian Peterson coming back probably get to play as your back and\nNumber two wide are running back and making them all white out since he's catching passes\nAll of a sudden this year and they have nobody left that's healthy a cause a whole Richardson probably gonna miss the gift you that's that's we're starting to get dicey so Smith more number two guy but on a roll the dice that he does find someone in a day daily\nRight last one from my arm and Fox Sports radio is fantasy football insider or you can get him on Twitter at swollen dome\nOr it is ninja time I'm going to pick a couple of positions or ask for under the radar ninja picks guys that people aren't anticipating having a big week that you look at it and go that might be a spot here the to position okay never one running back I Want a running back and then just somebody who is probably available in ...\nYeah this week I'm going kicker somebody out there who you can grab 'cause you know he's going to be available that you like to put up a big spot in in in in the game that he's performing in on Sunday my comment to potentially when somebody a daily fantasy and we get ... all we want\nWe tell you something I've won games in my fantasy leagues because of a kicker\nOh no that's it once you start getting into bonus die right that's why I like Justin Tucker kind of goes against the grain where you may go around earlier All right we're going to take in what should be a field goal contest against Justin Tucker will get Ryan ...\nOh oh oh right yeah it is because we can say Ryan stuck up to forty two on the west coast year uh and then we go back to the running back position eventually Green Bay has got to realize Aaron Jones is averaging six yards of carrion actually give him the ball\nA and then you go a little bit deeper or we're going to go with the tag team you got Lindsey is going to be the leader rush Freeman still going to have him so probably eighty Ninety total yard but you know run the ball against the rams\nThere is my comment Fox Sports radio is fantasy football inside or get him all morning along at

[laughter] and I went\nThere on Wednesday and then I got there I got to the magical forty point land or forty made territory if you will right\nWell that's good oh not bad well All right you have I'm a writer sound like you're upset no I'm impressed I really am I'm impressed because not only do you have brains do you have athletic ability I mean that's great I mean really that at all I said it way back when I you know your everything I Want them to be in life really [noise] our ages ... to go by the way they live Andy\nYeah yeah I'll get some video footage since you doubt I'd love to the accuracy of this\nI'd love to see them by the way speaking of accuracy there wasn't much accuracy and the college football grin ions yesterday for the top eight teams Georgia\nWest Virginia ... Washington Penn State all going down your number five Notre Dame escape just by the city ... hairs with a with a pit uh yesterday so basically it was a you know I look at the schedule yesterday it it shouldn't have played out that way but it\nTurned out to be a tremendous day in college football and perhaps maybe the best game of the day was the seventeenth right the Oregon topping Washington thirty twenty seven and no tea and\nThe dish that you have a diverse Dale up to Maryland [noise]\n[laughter]\n[laughter]\n[laughter] oh\nYeah she said it was a big debate did duck they needed a risk field goal attempt at the end the regulation to stay alive with us we'll take it they won the game I mean this isn't it is five and one to one now in the pack\nAnd the Washington goes down five and two and three and one overall and basically they're finished Washington's finished with the year there'll be some minor little bowl game that there'll be playing and this year\nYeah um I mean it's a redemption for CJ ... he's the running back ooh fumbled at the end regulation against Stanford when they were trying to basically run the clock out\nAnd that led to Stanford beating the ducks just a few weeks ago in the same field and DJ for Dell is the young running back who scored the winning touchdown and overtime and you just heard right there against Washington monster when for Mario crystal ball and you mentioned it Andy is just\nThat physicality Oregon's known for all their bubbles screen you and it's just basketball on grass and their prancing around and having a really nice time but they get after you meant you got Mario crystal ball warmer offensive lineman at Miami\nAnd before the game he was leading these pre game warm up it's all on the line he's just preaching physicality and you could see it on Saturday against washing\nYou're talking about the huskies I mean honestly the head I mean they went down yesterday afternoon to liberate lost that hurt them basically as well so they're finished and now the ducks now you hope they don't ... you know hit a wall novelist next week they play Washington state\nWhich I Believe was off yesterday so that's somewhat rested so they'll be psyched to believe Oregon so we'll see what happens if all of them could continue or they fall on their face again we'll see what happens you know what team was real or not but this\n... All right now just tell you that are you the pack twelve is dead and hundreds of getting a playoff team because Oregon non conference schedule is essentially use the apps schedule [laughter] and how it breaks down and you have Oregon playing Bowling Green Portland State San jose state\nYou're not going to get into the playoffs unless all of these other teams and other major conferences just lose multiple games which good luck with that happening so that's the downside of playing this\nThey're sharman soft non conference schedule if you have a lot like Oregon does in the packed well you're done in terms of the playoff race\nRight and you know what though honestly the pack twelve I'm sure they want that to get a major conference in that bowl championship series and if you run the conference maybe there's a chance to Washington got an last year but now it it's certainly opens the door for the independent your independent Notre Dame I mean Notre Dame should be really running the table they had a\nLittle bit of a hiccup you a stay at home you know the defense came to play the officers butter and a little bit but they did beat it they held on Nineteen fourteen but honestly looking at the schedule like we said it before they should not lose it gained the rest of the way well they shouldn't\nBut that doesn't mean they want [laughter] you know and you look at in book he hasn't been consistent these last couple of weeks to Notre Dame quarterback he's been an accurate that often of line just hasn't been great they don't\nDew I'm Mazie dinners at Los ... hand this mob you'll often\nWhere did you enjoy the huge these um these adverse back bays with wind farm\nTo reverse of the cool rain Ron laser to\nPick up your pumpkins advice huge while I'm getting a mountain and more of a lot of ... is a law\nOverall one hundred dollar value mountain mobile model glasses day\nGoes by six by man says you know I'm I'm a little less cash\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best in the news on the old old Jessie or at least you\nArgue\nWith a lot of ...\nNever walk skinny\nHe's boxer shorts radio driving away that\nBad news for a little while you're talking to the point [noise]\nOr by that fast one on your TV show to Fox Sports dot com or detail tap tap water [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter] [noise]\n\nWe know what the problem a little explain that have just about a minute twenty to past the hour on Sunday with bullets Fox football's Sundays Brian O'Dea the revenue by the way what does it mean guy goes\nThere's just a few minutes to save you Fifteen Percent of moral car insurance will it means you're probably should have gone to the guy go dot com Fifteen minutes ago and you could get was enlisted Fifteen minutes on Twitter after no show an eighty from it up as our will read them full retweet him over eight seven seven I Do not on Fox eight seven seven nine nine six fifty three fifty nine\nAnd I got to go back if I can to Thursday because the scene that was one of the five they look dreadful against the eagles Thursday night the giants lost thirty for Thirteen yet the giants coach pat sure much said\nHe line manning it still is quarterback could you tell me why you need to do the one reason why this guy is still as quote about yet watching that game he still finished the ball game no one else came at the mop up there that they would remove him I don't get it\nWho would be the starter U. U. H. into get Alex tanning under center\nI mean really who exactly who do you want it to be\n... drafted in the fourth round he's been an active the whole season I'd like to if he's ready I'd like to see him get some playing time but he's been an active the whole time you've got someone that you wouldn't take a legitimate look at to get under ...\nWhen they were limited from playoff competition they still stuck with the light matter of fact he didn't look good Thursday night but the coach ... said they wouldn't be that change listen to what he said\nWell we believe in it or\nHow how do you believe in this guy I mean I Know the two Super Bowls I get it I Know he went with twenty four for forty three Thursday night at an interception it was shot four times and his problem is this his problem is is because it's completion percentage is almost that Korea best that she is just the ... percent but at thirty seven years of age he's not mobile\nAnd it can never turned a shock if there were scramble that's the problem that is the ballot\nIn that guy he's never been that guy ever it's like Brett Farr that there's a couple of weeks ago\nHe was like you've got to protect the guy yeah it's like oh dealt that are going to run and not going to get out of the pocket yeah\nThat's what he's always Ben okay so you have to have a legitimate offensive line he lie it stunk it up I'm not trying to re he has he has put to point the finger only at number ten instead of that horrible up and some line inside joke\nIt is a flat out ... joke that you could always look at that our fence of lying to\nHe was shot four times as they are going one step further they talked about the Pittsburgh Steelers the last couple of weeks being dysfunctional\nWith Antonio Brown and Ben Roethlisberger I Would tell you right here and now the New York football giants might be the most dysfunctional team in the world of sports and I'll go one step further you know that we've talked about this ad knows him about the lack of TV ratings which is a joke and people not going to the games which is a joke because every other professional sports league would die to have\nThe the media attention at the national football league has TV ratings maybe down a bit and maybe a crowded down a bit you know why because the ... hotel Beckham junior the fans out there are fed up with more on like this that Davis\nThis had people like me are fed up with it how does that\nLook at you man you're out of the gate with some venom today I like what did you eat this morning what was the breakfast\nRaw meat [laughter] Enron me I don't want to you [laughter] [laughter] than what's out there\nJust had a raw steak and you're like let me add obey J I like it but look bad this the way I look at it\nYou're right he is all about himself\nHe is the I said he's like the beginning of the song crazy train from ... you know that song where it's like I I I I don't like junior he's all about himself it was amazing that interview he did with Joe Siena Anderson from ESPN\nEvery word out of his miles every other sentence was I\nWas like I I've worked too hard I feel like I put it in the work I I just said the ball is just I I I Me me me he is that guy and I think that it's too late for the behavior to be changed because he's been like this not just as easy either like this for years and for it to not be addressed\nIt's literally like a kid whose parents doesn't say no no no can't do that and followed through with the punishment if they misbehave it is far too late for OPEC um junior to turn it around and act right because the bad behavior has gone unpunished for far too long\nOn punish he gets his way Ninety five million dollar contract what are you kidding me I mean come on I mean it's crazy but you know what if the teachers want to do that God Bless you it's not my money it's your money they go oh you said early on the eagles would make the playoffs they may make it by people up across that division of the plane is so bad\nNow that I win against the giants Thursday night maybe fool's gold with the when there's three and three they got Carolina next week so look\nThey may make the playoffs I remember last week you an ... without a little bit Alex said that you were wrong you know I respect you for your opinion and and look they're not the same thing they were a year ago\nConsistent winners these teams you know what\nThere was a fork in the road this morning and youth shows Alex ... says over your guy me also known I decided I didn't mention that have the way that the ... dark side how dare you Andy from it I Do understand thing I get it I understand it\nBut I still look at this eagles team and it's just hilarious to me because\nThey beat the horrible one in five now New York giants and that's all it took for people to be like hey goes back look at what they did to a one in five team who shares it's going to take a lot more than that\nTo not only when the division but gets the playoffs so I still think it's very very possible that they lose\nA the division that they don't make it into the play offs I Am not convinced that this team is going to be able to string together a bunch of wins I'm not and you look at the Washington Redskins team\nGranted they looked terrible against the saints but it's a big game at home against the Carolina Panthers that if they win it gets what Washington Redskins are headed that division they're on top\nSo I did I did show I did like that people have the eagles in Penn\nNot only winning the division but being a playoff team they are in pencil they might get there I'm not saying it's the lack of the century that they don't\nBut to have them written in pan as if there's no way they could possibly screwed this thing up it's silly to me it's the NFL we see these things happen every single year where it seem that you think is going to have a great season doesn't why anyway not be the eagles who everybody's gunning for the defending champion this year\nHere and then what do I got it all I got over and under a plus fifty and a half and I got bangles minus one and a half so I mean you know I'm I'm doing you've taught me well I got attack I gotta I gotta give the right the rise\nAnd amazing thing it's just outstanding yes\nI just learned how to turn it on I just got one ... just got a computer\nIt just got an Internet over there right [laughter] yeah maybe yeah just depends I mean it depends different you know books and different lines but right around there I've got it might as well\nOn that Andy would you go over on that\nI Would go over and you don't want them I I honestly I I I'm not a whole murder but I think the fact that the planes at home with the U.S have a little bit of ... momentum going on this but the injury factor I don't know\nI look at a close game right now like thirty one twenty seven thirty one twenty eight Bengals but I got to hear what you have to say about it I like I have a tough\nOne because I'm torn I never want to take the result of the previous week and apply it too much like over the top with the next week you know race and to watching the bangles they were getting dominated by the Gulf and they were getting shot out by the dolphins\nAnd tannahill but what are the worst throwaways I've ever seen before throws a just a mass of humanity I get knocked around picked off\nInterception for a touchdown another defensive score\nSo the bangles the way they one could like seeing that repeat you know so I'm trying not to overreact to that result last week because the Bengals are completely capable of playing a lot better today against the Steelers defense that's up and down I expected to be a shootout\nAnd I expected to come down to a fourth quarter game and I can't sit here and say I would bet my bottom dollar on the bangles making the play when it comes time for it I Would bet on the Steelers until proven otherwise\nI'll tell you what I'm with you and I think the weather is a factor because uh they predict rain at least in the second half of the program this afternoon which will make a real sloppy and I don't know where the passing situation will happen with the rain and so\nI I just I I think that the Steelers joined the bangles head I know it sounds really stupid but I Know it's a mental game I just think that when there's Bengals team she's that black and gold something happens that they've got a real type but and something will happen something will happen\nIt's perfect back you know and of course the shades of the unnecessary roughness penalty on Antonio Brown and the playoff games like oh gosh yeah I I Do wonder how much of the recent history\nFactors into the bangles mindset today to think of a guy like Joe mixed in just off the top of my head or John Ross one of these young guys that hasn't been there for a long time\nTo experience the Steelers typically getting the better of the bangles at least of recent memory zero you know one sixth straight games so I don't know that enters in their mind set\n... elected in their mind I'll tell you how it's going to do in their mind when when Marvin Louis ... speech and tell us that we're not going to take it anymore and these guys and the John what's to say what are you talking about and then they'll find out that straight so basically they are coaches that put it into their mind that's what they do they really do try and do it from a live\nFrom that guy go Fox Sports radio studios in sometimes yelling and screaming doesn't make any

fine Andy from and doing fine big wins in college football highlighted by L. S. U. how 'bout Edwards run but don't you have liked to have\nBeen at a uh I don't know like a post game celebration with Edwards run that'd be great probably still make it he's probably still celebrating [laughter] but how about that man he went from the hot seat\nTo man up completely secure with his job member that was the big talking point was Edwards run they didn't get fired this year and you fast forward they've got one last and they've been taking down some of the better teams in college football in terms of the rankings right you take down number to Georgia yesterday it was a great when\nSlap them around pretty good thirty six sixteen and here's the question of the day because for top ... teams Georgia West Virginia Washington at Penn State all last you know today right number five they escape by the chin each inch in there\nStill agree with you probably that Alabama will be number one I think Ohio State moves to number two what about three four five I'm going to do with clumps of Notre Dame and LSU\nUm well\nYeah I think Clemson followed by Notre Dame I think that's going to be the top four right what use that I think will be the case then yeah I'd probably have to have goodness you'd think LSU vaults that high asked\nThat question there was thirteenth going into the game yesterday going from thirteenth the five is a big jump so I don't know if that could happen but wells range of things have happened\nYeah and you look at it I mean gosh if you compare\nA schedule is if you compare LSU to UCF for instance people I bang on UCF because they should be banned gone [laughter] they just don't have a good body of work that that was the first team they play that has a winning record this year was yesterday beating Memphis\nIs it one by one thirty one thirty right that this is what you got so should LSU be ranked ahead of UCF abs so Lou ... no doubt about it and then you look at these other teams that have lost\nWhen you talk about um let's see here West Virginia went down Washington goes down Penn State goes out there you go six seven eight are down so essentially LSU would have to they're not going to fall over Michigan where parents are going to do that they could they could with Michigan beat down Wisconsin I could see that\nThere are certainly going to jump Oklahoma who was off they should you were talking to LSU they should jump Oklahoma they should jump UCF\nI should jump Texas they she survives at home against Baylor at LSU has a better better body of work right now than Texas does yeah yeah\nI tell you what I think it also goes now with the most recent gay but how you're trending and you're\nThat they're going to be out of the top temperate short Penn State\nOh yeah they're they're ... they're going to have this week yeah it probably I I'll say a I'll give the ... the lions seventeenth let's make it interesting Hugo Eighteen I go Seventeen how much of what I'm saying\nThat he's going in Oregon was this week Oregon probably most to like fourteenth maybe\nOr are they they go higher than that I think they sneak into a I think they're above the teens how's that I think they get through it leads twelfth\nYou don't want it it's getting very interesting the pictures getting a little clearer right now Michigan I think Michigan lose it to the top ten with that went over what's called\nHim and they literally with everybody else we will I'm sure yeah\nMichigan is good and I'm happy for Michigan right them at Michigan State or\nA big win over Penn State I mean I I didn't expect that in Texas over Baylor but they struggled to beat Baylor so you know there's so many things going on a lot of these I hate to use the term moving parts but there are but it all works out at the end it all it all comes together but I tell you the biggest shock us they had to be a less you\nI mean LSU beating Georgia the way they did\nAnd Georgia made everybody was looking at Georgia now we know they're not for real you know it it's not the same team that was there last year go for the national title their their their phone is their fakes they're frauds that's where they are those are frauds\nCome on man they lost to a tough team on the road Baton Rouge Death Valley it's tough place to play and no I didn't think that they would lose by twenty points but you can't say that they're complete fraud that's a theme that legitimately made it to the national championship game and was a whisker away from winning it\nSo I don't think that there are complete fool's gold or anything like that I think that they have a really really tough road ahead of them and I don't expect them to run the table from here on out that's what it's going to take to get them into the play off\nAgainst Alabama [laughter] I just don't see them running that able to get to the college football playoff\nWell I'm Still behind my national defending national champion UCF because they were ... and they even have the opposite sake flag he just did that for all egg or you just trying to get a rise out of it I was not one dollar route far but at the bottom of the hour they give you a little jab as well a little ... little ... but it's so called\nPaper champs UCF and they're terrible conference and their worst non conference schedule I I just have no love no love for that personal with UCF it's any team who trumpet themselves who pat themselves on the back and you're playing no one\nLike that you play in South Carolina state that's an F. C. S. school\nOr when is it when there's a when no way they know it it just ... yeah that's all I Know you I don't what is this what is\nLike if you're telling me that LSU taking down the number two ranked team in the country at home is the same thing is UCF what taking down in Memphis it's not\nIt's the same garbage we've had two years ago a western Michigan it was it the same thing\nWith them right yeah they ran ... no one they put ... billion Ralph\nExactly right we move on and let's talk a little NFL right now because I said that this team likes to dramatic\nI'm Talking about the Cleveland Browns they loved her dramatic they went into overtime for the third time in five weeks they beat the ravens I was shocked with that twelve nine I didn't watch the game and thank goodness I didn't ... that had to be asleep at twelve to nine are you kidding great Joe civil to thirty seven yard field goal browns though are now too and wants his Baker may feel took over a quarter back\nThere five games have been decided by a total of Thirteen points to today they hosted charges in Cleveland charges three and two they beat Oakland last week and miles Garrett Brown says defense\nLeave that I don't [laughter]\nI'm going to go the other way on this when Andy I liked the chargers you look at the chargers first off we're out of September so that's good for them because they invent ways to lose games in September and you look at the teams that they've lost two they've lost the chiefs\nAnd the rams as as soon as the charges the last two [laughter] and they had a disappointing game against the forty niners because they showed up thinking that they didn't have to face Jimmy ... below\n... CJ bad third who cares well when it was well after the effort but they looked a lot better against they bad raiders team\nAnd that's the weird thing with the chargers they've lost to the best that the league has the offer right now and the chiefs in rams both undefeated but the teams that they've been they'd be the worst yeah they've beaten to build the forty niners and the raiders right so\nOverall one hundred dollar value mountain a lotta glasses day\nGoing by the next five minutes as to how long they'll last I guess\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nThe best\nIn music going all we do ... do we get a thing we could tell that you're ... you're talking to somebody you\nCatch us live far whether you need a podcast we are getting millions of downloads\nThe safest place is right here with us this is a type of place you want to work and some will call you some will protect you well than male or my doctor\nWill tell you everything is All right\nWe're Fox Sports radio\nOn to win seven ... I Wonder if they're going to have an dot com\nBecause the only thing that matters is October\nAnd I'll see continues Kamara one\n\n[noise] well once in a ... well no that today twenty went past the hour there's this box football Sunday he's\nBrian Noah Andy permanent by the way what brought you buy discover card we treat you like you treat you now my guy Brian knows got a tweet I feel offended I feel it's a it's a slap to my ego because I don't have any I don't have a tweet to read but you do\nAndy here we go I don't know what to do is do I think he's a channeling is editor in her Andy ferment how you were trolling me about UCF\nI think this guy actually believes that do the Mike tweets in and says F. Y.\nUCF has to play who's in their conference my guess is every college program except Alabama would take McKenzie Milton as their quarterback think Scott Ross knows that UCF hung forty five ... indeed struggled wouldn't want to play UCF in a bowl game ask\nBegin you know I'm no no we have is began because here's the thing is there's a reason why\nThere's like a a college football playoff and this does he also rans okay I I make fun of it and hopefully maybe he bought into what I\nHad to say maybe unbelievable there's no way of God's green earth that those players could play a major college football because of my mind is not major college football it's not as good football but it's not big time football sorry\nWell I think that I Would disagree with that they have a a decent amount of players that can play a major college football\nSo I I don't agree with that but I'm not going to grade on a curve I hate this logic of hey that's why I used to play within their conference\nBut if they play in a bad conference I'm not going to act as if it's a good one okay but you can't give a team of free pass for playing in a week conference will\nThey have to wait time out the ... conference that's a\nBad thing American athletic conference bad no no I didn't know that hey this is the economics but they've got they've got a break they did get a break and UCF didn't get the break last year really\nTop to bottom the patch twelve stunk last year\nSo what do you go to conferences okay right in\nBig deal who cares what we're obviously going to vote in our hair conference the voters kid was any team in the past twelve will get a break over any team of the AC who emailed and in the\nPlayoffs last year ... Washington was in the in the playoffs during the past twelve\nAnd they had a better body of work than anything that you're seeing from UCF right now\nRight now I don't know made and the point like I don't know why is that your talking conferences okay and I'm Glad that you could you could have a team in it than a big name conference a one or two law says that will get a break head and shoulders\nIt's about the resume that you have if your resume say the two teams of Georgia and Alabama who made it from the SEC last year\nThey had respectable resume they had a better body of work\nThen it seemed like UCF largely because UCF plays in a bad conference so don't give me this hey hey they play who's in their conference so they have to do that yeah great and I'm going to take that into account if I'm a value waiting which team deserves to be in the college football playoff in which team doesn't\nI think the other day and that right and you know you can you give a hand out in a free pass to someone who plays in a week conference\nThere's no doubt but I Would say this I think the conference situation a is a misnomer it should be who you play that's accomplished you rent because you can play schools outside of your coverage to absolutely a schedule that seems like\nYou know like look at the Washington schedule to pack twelve they go out of their coverage of play crap they do like garbage okay they played\nAll I have written this year that's a good this year they did way way better than anything UCF does non conference wise\nThere's no doubt about that way that you use the F could if they wanted to go out of conference in play two or three schools to bolster their conference I had a resume right because this couch do was Alabama will still play chattanooga's southern out of that Congress they couldn't afford to do that because they play in the U.S conference of the country\nAbsolutely and everything about McKenzie Milton in terms of what these other point my guess is every college program except Alabama would take McKenzie Milton as their quarterback I disagree with that but take a guy like will Greer with West Virginia he's fantastic did you see him yesterday\nThrough for a hundred yards at Iowa State sort of thing that just because you have a good quarterback it's like whoa whoa UCF no no no it doesn't work like that okay and it in terms of evaluating what one team does\nAgainst it yesterday that all of a sudden means that Notre Dame wouldn't want to play UCF in a bowl game are you crazy right they would and I want to read the mighty UCF night to get fat off of the week teams\nCurrency these teams are just like how ring in fear because of the UCF mighty unite since China is a mistake that the\nThe Twitter author made tweeting to you about this\nYou talk to any one of those players and they may have a chip on their shoulder and they play a higher level football than they should because they do it that chip on their shoulder because they were overlooked by the schools that they really wanted to go to share and they didn't want to go to U. C. F.\nThey want that they're going to schools like UCLA USC Texas Oklahoma those are the schools that they wanted to go to and they were over look so when you hear these announces saying whoa he's playing with a chip on his shoulder why because he was overlooked that he ended up how to use the F that's why\nWell yeah and it applies to the bowl win over Auburn\nAuburn loses the S. E. C. championship game to Georgia and their consolation prize\nIs facing UCS [laughter] okay\nIt's a completely different mindset\nIt's a completely different motivational factor there for Auburn versus UCF like you're talking about they were overlooked for the big schools there in the sugar bowl they're playing ... let's go let's go time baby that's what use the EPA's thinking Auburn like damn\nWe had a chance for the national championship we had a chance to be in the college football playoff and we blew it by losing the Georgian the SEC championship game you know you have this game against UCF it's totally different so to highlight that and say oh ask Auburn look at what they did you're taking everything\nThat shouldn't be into account and you're not applying it to what factors into that game\nIn the country right now when it comes to the college football playoff it's crazy\nI agree and speaking of ... this is talk about the Chicago Bears the three and one bears or Brian those three and two dolphins today\nAnd why I say if it ... because the last time the bears quarterback which will ... played\nHe had already record setting day in the bears transferring other bucks forty eight ten Hindu for three fifty four and he has six touchdowns can you do it today I don't know but you're Ryan ... as we mentioned early on against the bangles last week turned up all over twice that of Seventy eight point lead in the third quarter they lost twenty seven Seventeen\nI couldn't agree more and I think it's almost a waste of breath to discuss why a team on that level should be I I just put on the same level as Alabama\nOr LSU ... it's just just put it this way put UCF\nAs South Florida and the SEC I put a complete schedule your schedule they if they want to games will be a lot will be a lot has long said right do you agree\nNo way there is no way they would be in contention for a playoff berth if they had an as though that look like Georgia's schedule Andy I imagine\nThey use the ... on the one that's kind of grazing the flight for UCF look I think that's a joke I I make fun of it the fact that the athletic threat that they got a flag and they say that defies shy of it's good for him because you have to do what they are actually this\nIs what they are anti UCF is a poor man's version of Boise State\nThat's what they are member of and Boise State yeah headed cranked up and they were added ... undefeated season ... one last thing you have it's a success law program at the level that they're playing it wasn't that here's the thing here's the thing boys and they played in a week conference at the time the wax week\nProbably better than the a C honestly but so weak conference but what they did they went out of conference and they lead to played a big time team they played someone who is ranked they play they power five team where they got lucky with that at all when I was going on all this yes doesn't do that\nThey are a weak version of Boise State when that\nBrought you a bike oh it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance was Geico got a guy go dot comical eight hundred and four seven or do they only hard part\nFiguring out which way it's easier by the way you mentioned the fact that the Vikings are playing today and they're playing\nArizona hosting by the way hosting Arizona wanted for Vikings two to one and they did break that ... game losing streak last week and there was a a rematch of the NFC championship game\nAnd I guess the highlight of that game last week the thing that I remember that defensive tackle liberal Joseph stole the show and that twenty three Twenty one way to recover the ... and his big monster of a man ranch sixty four year old at the end zone and the Vikings won the ball game I Love that scrape\nGot some agility man it's crazy how guys in the NFL that big can move that well [laughter] ... how about his Madden rating going up by twelve point on now at at this was crazy he had the top in speed\nThat was almost neck and neck with markets may remember Marc has made the jets yeah ... ... who almost had to return for a touchdown they topped out at almost the exact same speed\nWindfall shows is about twice the size of march estimate that is amazing right there but yeah I just don't see how the Vikings drop another one at home I think they're going to be on high alert because they walked in thinking they could just show up and beat the bills and they lost by three touchdowns so I don't think they make that same mistake against the\nArizona Cardinals team with Josh Rosen cleaning Jesus facing that defense I think that defense gets the better of Josh Rosen today I think it's a tough has for that Arizona often when they're thirty first in rushing the ball and also stopping the rush that as a bad combination for Arizona\nWell said their ego Brian away from oil live for the guy go Fox Sports radio studios I Know this is almost as good as a Cleveland Browns when

I had a two point lead\nLate in the fourth quarter last week when they said that his office to convert\nA fourth in one resident pumped up all the way it gets wet it paid off Jared GOP converted the first down they ran out the clock they beat Seattle last week by a hair thirty three thirty one but they won and today there at the two and three Broncos in Denver Denver's lost three straight\nLast week they lose to the wolf will judge thirty for sixteen\nReally and truly a I Would say this team the ...\nYeah and it looks like there's going to be some snow potentially over there in Denver rams off ants has been outstanding there's no doubt and you look at the Denver team there's a reason why John Elway was that the Oregon game yesterday scouting Justin Herbert 'cause the Broncos might have a record bad enough\nWere there in the vicinity of being able to be in position to draft Justin Herbert potentially number one overall the trade up a little bit right\nThe Denver has been bad and you look at what they did last week against the jets they surrendered three hundred and twenty three yards rushing and thirty four points to the jets what are they gonna do today at home against the rams\nThey better hope it's a blizzard his love that team down because I think there's going to be a huge game for Todd girlie he started to get going against the Seahawks about Seventy seven yards rushing didn't quite breakout I expect ... to have a big game today against the Broncos [noise]\nI Will tell you this much though when you look at the Denver team I mean certainly defensively they stink but they could run the football they average a hundred and thirty seven yards against a fourth ...\n... come out would blazing scoring and they stop putting up points because running the football won't do it because you've got to pass the football because one of the football just went out the clock so if they could somehow score or early escort off which I don't think they can and run the football around the class they have a fighting chance but\nReally and truly this game could be overly Kobe over real early\nI don't think so I ... I don't think it will you're right it could be but I don't think it's going to be that type of game you look at Jared golf that small hands or to be in the snow and the elemental does a president want to see what his performance looks like today\n'cause I don't expect him to light up like he has throughout most of the season I think it's going to be a different game today on the road against Denver I Know it's not\nThe great defense that they once had with a no fly zone alec say something about the free frequent flyer miles zone or something I don't know what he said read it was funny last week\nWhere you can throw the ball a lot easier on the Broncos nowadays but I don't think it's going to be a prolific day for Jared ... off I think it's going to be a little bit tougher to pass for yards or throat touchdown passes I think that's going to be more of a Todd girlie grind it out type game but I Want to see this rams defund Sandy\nThis rams defense has just\nRelied on the often carrying the weight\nYou saw last week against the Seahawks they didn't start playing good defense until the game was really on the line on the fourth quarter they're just going through the motions throughout most of the game so I Want to see what their defense of effort is like today because they have not had this great sense of urgency they've just been showing up like that you often says are back\nNow and you know what that that could really do you know play havoc on your defense but they get real complacent on that but I remember years ago I wasn't too too many years ago that one people\nLove your smile\nAll alumni are invited to the ... when we were in high school homecoming game friday October Nineteen Seventy and then when we were in high school where they will be

hour Alex while they're just as she thought sports radio set up inside it that'll be an eight thirty eastern time but right now for free winters daily go to Vegas covers dot com that's Vegas covers\nDot com now perhaps the game of the young ... for sure at least the game of the day Kansas City five and all at the patriots three and ... and I will you be Brian oh\nIn front of the fireplace with a log on to fire with a bottle of wine ... tell me what you'll be\nI Will be in front of the TV on the couch with a lovely Christina\n... says positive things about Patrick my homes and negative things about Tom Brady which is fine that's how she gets down but we'll be watching the game I don't know what I'm going to do for dinner tonight maybe some chicken breast\nMaybe um you know some French Style green beans I'm a big fan of\nWill take out maybe no loyalty I don't think there's going to be taken maybe some homemade type of stuff you know good for you yeah yeah I'd like to sit back and enjoy yeah it would be good and if we learn one thing last week but watching the Kansas City chiefs\nTo what the ... but Kansas City ... fourteen well doing something they don't usually do and that is they play defense last week so we'll see what happens tonight\nYeah we will you look at um the patriots defenses well you know who I Know the headline is more homes versus Brady and all of that but a lot of this game could come back to who plays better defense or at least who get that timely stop\nI think it's going to be a shoot out I just think there are too many great offensive players the cover and those defenses are not not great themselves they're going to score a lot of points but could it be like the super bowl last season or\nIt's just off and it's often it's often but you get that he stop in that forest fumble by the eagles it could come down to something like that tonight against the chiefs of what the chiefs in the patriots right\nWhile Kansas City is tremendous offensive weapons including wide receiver ... tremendous I really do and I looked at the pages I don't think that the defensive speed to stop all of those weapons on kids the city so you've got to ask the question of how the patriots win this game the game is in New England he's very simply keep the Kansas City office on the sideline\nThat means you're going to probably have to run the football if you can run the football against them and as we've seen other teams wanting the football against Kansas City it can be done run the football score off at an early run down the clock cheap that off as on the sideline\nYeah sure you can do some of that and I could see the patriots having success on the ground the chiefs run defense really bad so yeah you could try to\nMake that chiefs off and take them out of their rhythm disjointed a little bit right so yeah I think that you're going to see the patriots making a big time effort to run the ball but also I Would take Travis Kelsey out of it I Would do to achieve what a lot of teams\nKelsey and force ... kill in the outside guys to beat him\nSammy Watkins entire ... kill our plenty capable of beating you but I Would make them be you because Travis Kelsey is so consistent and it seems to open up there often when they get him going I Would focus on him if I'm the patriots defense\nAnd you know one is funny because like you mentioned early on like the game is going to be more home runs against Brady and ... to me at least in this game is almost an afterthought it's all about Patrick my homes in this game and the chiefs are undefeated should they lose I mean should they go down five oh one no big look if the patriots lose\nBoy it's good light the sky is falling and people are going to say it's all over ... run has come to an end this is a big ... I mean every game obviously is a big game every week but to me losing it to a team that's undefeated at home\nI think the storylines could it be could this be the end of the patriots dominance the headlines already written bully me they're just waiting for the final score\nYeah I just don't think it's going to go down that way you're right if the patriots ended up losing this game people love to overreact to the patriots losing\nBut you'd have to look at the rest of the division you think that the Sam Darnell led jets at this stage are good enough to take down the patriots how about the dolphins they still have a winning record but you've got Ryan tannahill with a sprained a sea joint reportedly they've got ten points and their last Twenty one fence of drives\nYou know so if the patriots win that division which they should\nAnd they've got a seat at the playoff table why would you think that they have no shot whatsoever you know what I mean I'm not saying here saying that you're just talking about the general reaction right ... thanks at the patriots would be incapable of going into arrowhead stadium where the chiefs\nCreate ways to lose playoff games\nGoing in there and getting a playoff when of course they would have a great chance\nI Will tell you this much right now should the patriots lose all agree my prediction right after this should they lose I think there's still good enough aid to win that division and be even go deep in the players' salaries on a number two\nNumber three is I think the chiefs to win this game and a close game is going to be one of the most interesting game to the season there should be a lot of points as you say I think the over another in my mind they'll be close to fifty points in this game\nI don't know what you think about that I haven't even looked at the yards anymore I'm finished with all its ... up next week\nBecause I I just did not get the tweet did you check your way I did I got the ... for what a lovely guy a guy for the love of God he's\nGot to Vegas dot com Vegas score\nYou're not you know why why don't you just go to Twitter and read the tweet\n[laughter] though no well you have against the Internet Andy huh what is your friend\nI Know I Know I'll I'll read the ... I got to somewhere where it was it\nUh yeah but not let me pick that up I'm losing my thought process you I don't even want to read I look at the guy said please give me two options to go to to get points I just if it I look I'll get to that later oh I Know is this\nIs going to be a close game I think the chief swim and then they got back to the Internet with the points situation if it's something that that I really truly enjoyed and really thought a lot of you know something I\nI Would go to it to me I\nI rely on you for this I mean you're the gambler and you know what's going on and you're actually looked at it and we have those picks later today you know in our in our in our show\nYou know you mentioned games the tale was another one is the bears the authors of the national right now and they just stay on top of the end of his\nWell interesting story coming out of South Florida this morning the five reasons pod cast network and it's run by credible people ah they're reporting that that actually Ryan tannahill maybe closer to doubtful than questionable to play today because of the shoulder injury and apparently the injury may have suffered a couple of weeks ago against the Oakland\nPast couple of weeks if not we're going to get our share a block off while her baby rock and roll in South Florida I yeah I get a good ... and the Chicago Bears and I think that those are for real I mean look there and sending team with a rookie court\nOr second your quarterback on a rookie contract and Mitchell tribute ski so they've been able to add some really nice pieces around them because of the benefits of having a rookie quarterback and having that that really fun of a salary cap that you get when you're not paying an exorbitant amount for your starter so I mean but this is again the dolphins are three into this is what's so interesting to me is or is there have been such a bad\nVibe or what have the three ... right like nobody believes in the dolphins after the past two weeks and who can blame 'em and if they don't have any hill it's three and three and going nowhere fast and then you've got to start\nTo wonder what is the future of Adam gays what does the future of this dolphins administration three years into his regime are they going anywhere to catch the patriots and the AFC East\nMan rock'n'roll and hard rock stadium feeling it let it wash ... about there's real quickly Alex\nYou're predicting before the seasons looking pretty good job of being the first coach to be fired and do you think that ends up being the cage and how about this mind bender how many NFL head coaches get fired before the regular season and\nBeen interesting with that because you know sometimes it happens where you just want to get started early on the search\nAnd you have someone in mind that you know you want to target and they're going to go you're going to hire and you want to get ahead of the curve because what you want as you want your head coach in place so then you can start hiring quality assistant coaches are let that could build a staff or with the people that that they want it well it's interesting right now I'm not sure who the hot head coaching candidate is\nYou know we don't have anybody so what I say is like okay do we need to fire this guy right now because you know if we're going to be determined in two thousand and Eighteen or Nineteen rather to get blank to get this guy next favorite start coming back to the NFL I think we can all agree with that of course will always\nOut of Oklahoma's he the guy that people make a strong push forward if someone tried to get put a push a boatload of money in front of Bob Stoops and say would come out of retirement\nCommunity NFL so I think though when it when it comes to advance he's the guy that we have to watch I don't think Adam Gates is getting prior during the season when we talk about tracing Garrett I think that that's a fairly going to happen during the season\nI mean remember to Jerry's always had someone that he's sort of lord over work with his head coach that he's known for a long time\nYou know beside Chan Daley and that only lasted for two years before he got thrown out the door and broke ourselves and basically that ended because he didn't want to sit in the background anymore\nSo I think Jason's going to be given as much as many opportunities as possible to get the cowboys back in the postseason then if it doesn't happen then maybe we get that change but I you know I just think teams lately I've been reticent to make that in season coaching change but in Denver they don't show a find a wife soon it's going to happen and John Elway how's it going to have to admit he made a huge mistake\nShe'd be fully say good bye I Do want to announce on this national

was the dolphins and the colds so there's still a bit of a jury left out on New England well everybody is getting healthy but I just you look at the whole landscape of the national football league and we always talked about parity\nI mean it is everywhere in the NFL maybe except outside of Los Angeles and outside of Kansas City right\nNow does it what the NFL always wanted right they wanted parity

V. at half time I don't understand putting on headphones like I I understand it before the game but I think a lot of that energy when you're listening to music and you're getting all\nBe jacked up and ready to go you're doing it in the pre game warm ups to get you through I don't buy it for one second I you're the half times what Fifteen minutes and you can't sit there and listen to your soldiers and take a break without putting on oh my goodness I Need the your kick start my heart again like\nI you know it wasn't ... is your own voice going Josh you can do then you're not as bad as you looked in the first half of it do this you cover people\nWith us from Stuart Smalley tapes for him sure that that's what you've got the Redskins by the way have Carolina coming to town today Greg Olson is back for the Panthers as they uh they take on the Redskins just outside the nation's capital if you're going to clear 'em then\nFor fantasy purposes will skip the aback and number one tag figure we can get them back and five to seven targets a I'm a little nervous that seems a bit short based on the way the injury was characterized but you know they're they're saying he's back for Washington\nYou what are you got left everybody's her Richardson a game time decision right shoulder injury for him in looking at Crowder\nAnkle injury probably not going to go to Evan rules and you add a Gore ugly out Crist house and it's going to miss the game and Adrian Peterson bang up but ... yeah yeah so petersen's a back and number two slash likes to play\nCan't really put a lot of stock in a Carolina defense still getting after it but for Cam Newton or a big spot here with his favorite trusted target back and we know that you can always jumping off the Christian McCaffrey Fifteen times the game and everybody's happy\nChristian McCaffrey by the way leads running backs and the national football league in snaps the season so with ... nor furniture said they're going to be using Christian McCaffrey on all three downs in so many different ways they are doing show Panthers had Redskins one o'clock eastern time today of ...\nThree and a half point favorite over Kansas City for tonight's game but you've got an injury report with the patriots which by the way my ... I never trust no you've got you've got Rob Gronkowski ... you've got somebody was shell out it you've got Chris Hogan on it you've got Jeff Gordon on it I Would expect all of them to be there tonight and if they are we should be for some excitement\nNice happy sixty on the over under year Sony Michel I think when you look at a game script I think the patriotism like nothing more it goes what a few ways\nThey're either gonna air it out fast and say we anything you can do we can do just as well or better or they grounded bound with Sony Michel and just waved to Patrick bombs while he's\nStocking the sidelines waiting for his opportunity to come out and play as well we know the patrons don't get much of a pass rush so that's not going to be an issue and what I thought it interesting as you go through and you look at last week my own with his stats\nWas seventeenth and fantasy scoring for a quarterback\nAnd taking a little bit further for all the mobility talk he's got sixty six rushing guards for the year\n... show as much as he's dancing in and around the pocket he's not taken off and running he's putting the ball and play and keeping his eyes down field which is a bit beyond is yours a staff that you'll hear a lot probably this morning and through all the games as this gets hyped quarterbacks under the age of twenty five\nOh and twenty three against bill [laughter] something to watch your if your regular Greek yeah so there you go you have that but\nYou know this again one of those that you're going to get everybody in your lives and then suddenly it goes against convention and one of these teams play some stout defense then you're just going to have to tip the had\nThe chief secondary we know about Eric Berry being outraged Sorenson who's also been out of the season as well and has played so they've been playing with second string safety is now they're down to the third string so so they ... they're getting guys off the street to play safety\nBrady ranks twenty eighth in the NFL amongst quarterbacks in deep balls the season just thirty six percent completion right so something to at least look you could be could be surgery tonight for Tom Brady dump off the James White has been such a factor early on the season\nBut now with Edelman back we'll see how the patriots attacked the chiefs tonight debt by a thousand paper ... let's also recall that\nWe we barely begun to know Josh Gordon is\n... years you'll be a nice every birthday to Stephen ... and Jim Jackson about ... years yellow yes suppose follow on her own Fox Sports radio no no posters

brown\nThen Gabriel Ridley gets a bomb because of what's expected outta that game Tampa can't stop anybody a and he's still the red zone threat uh I think you'd probably get decent odds on Julio Jones finally\nFinding pager today as well as for the quarterback position you meet her cousin's going up against the new gimme him at home slightly ahead of Andy Dalton\nSlightly and it's not a huge separation\nBut don't and going up against Pittsburgh this one where I Am\nI'm fearful that you see the pitch for sex actually you'll something we haven't seen it much to this this point but Nineteen

when I talk about not having greatness and the national football league\nWhile there often is has been great in spots in the comeback against the Packers in a mean with the rams\nIt's also been lacking at times and so that's what we're talking about what we're looking at the NFL you're maybe three really good teams with the rams with the chiefs and the saints in of course you've got the patriots there as well but every everything else kinda just seems to be their bangles part of that conversation at foreign one to\nAbsolutely you look at Arizona six best against quarterbacks for fantasy purposes uh that's going to be a common theme that we got some of these marquee players and and what had been\nBig games either ... or for this last by we'll get into the bears and Miami a little bit 'cause you'll get some inflated stats are for for both sides off that simply defensively there but you look at Arizona or team point six but they've been run on a bunch that's not the

like you know\nLater in London where the the often raiders of getting the gender the fans are factored into its coming your way on\nBritish slang term like tears at the\nTime the although that's a tennis court records continue to the\nThe the first five weeks the rams are going to\nBy point the game\nSo we can sit in the NFL get\nWrapped up for you right here on one and only go for something fun to see this show\nKnow what would you say I'll get back to the later\nGuys here for another football Sunday we're already having fun and grateful to be here with the reality\nHear what this is the guy\nYou want to give all the national secrets [laughter]\nTell folks don't worry he's got more with I think we've already talked about what an exciting you know it's\nBeen so far a great example is that we've seen an overtime game in each of the first five week that's the first time that ever happened while adding to the excitement today is Patrick my home and the undefeated teams visiting Tom Brady and the patriots it's a thrilling match up that has everyone bursting with excitement well almost everyone\nFeel like you're playing for the top seeds to me and see what this game that the stakes in Kansas City\nI don't you\nGo well we're moving on the Dallas Cowboys coach finds himself on the hot seat up being criticized by everyone including owner Jerry Jones for not doing more than four thousand over time maybe go to the west coast show us because the cowboy\nCoaching legend reveal the surprising numbers are just going forth on\nAnd certainly our friends are more than just about us with a brand spanking new lead dog for me to go to the guy on her shoulder to make the best\nLast Sunday for the first time in five years Michael strain and won the lead dog was not and I'm like they're always wrote about it we called him to his most will break taken a selfie with a stand it\nWent on to not get a single ... losing to Spain and limited out of the first place but that's OK Mike our entire panel got just wondering when out of the game to prove once again with just one given applying for a mother not once in awhile\nI'm In second place I'm happy with that you're\nHappy what you're saying I have to be stuck I Believe that first out of eight and I'm a and he's in first place I\nQuite understand oh it's kind of go with what don't we go back to the question you haven't heard it was a booster said was Wednesday oh America I think it's a bad move I really like arrived fitzpatrick yeah one of the saddest things just happen to me this year is watching\nFitzpatrick against Chicago Bears\nBenson a second happened then lose his job he threw from four hundred yards three straight games nobody's ever done that a lot of the touchdown passes for intercepted he was just fun to\nWatch and I'm going to miss that now my question today is that coach cutter coming into this football game he's gone with Winston once it has to wait he's making nine million this year his fifth year off to the next\nTampa Bay wins football games they sign him otherwise you don't [noise] other side of the ball Atlanta\nYeah there's a team last week that you know ... defense quite poorly which they've they've done pretty much their decimated on defense at every level ... their best defensive lineman best linebacker best safety at all three levels they they've had issues problem was they have to be perfect on office and they weren't last week\nYou know Jones' new Ridley into devout they Freeman now is banged up again\nThat's an issue this team has to be great on often every single week to have the opportunity to when they get Tampa Bay a team that they historically have done well against the New York giants who are their struggles\nAre well documented a bye week than at Washington at Cleveland hopefully they get Jones back soon\nBut the often has to be perfect and the defense has to take something away last week they couldn't take anything away\nAtlanta and Tampa Michael are down at the bottom of the NFC North Carolina at three in one if they can be Washington today they'll move in the first place I was ... it kinda rose\nCaroline's kind of sneak it in there but now they have this week they hope to get Greg Olson back possibly find a foot injury and on top of that you know Thomas Davis is coming back\nFood when he came back to guard leader is back\nFor the defense in Canada and he's still adapted and alternative ... when he doesn't know where to go he just takes off running if he's still going to have to figure out his office and get rid of the ball McCaffrey has been a godsend for the state because the the threat of a running back to the threat of tobacco comic Alvin ... is with the New Orleans saints\nAnd that's what they need not quite well you know what I'm yeah yeah but but that's what they need here because Washington had trouble defending the deep ball they got to get the ball hits credit Samuels he Samuel he didn't get the ball to criticize Samuel to open up a lot of the underneath stuff but Kim and it's often need to get a good head start because Washington's not built to come back from from big league\nIs your what you look big picture here with Dallas and forget\nWell first of all I didn't agree with the the decision to punt the football and fourth down\nBut the key for Jason Garrett is his relationship with the owner Jerry Jones and I think that's very good you say well he's only won one playoff game in ... years well they had a great coach their\nBill parcell he didn't win any playoff games so that's not affected the whole thing is are they going to get better and I think they will you know I Know Prescott can play much better than he played the last couple of weeks you know I Know that they're going to get healthy they're going to\nTry to go out and get 'em a receiver they will be better I look for Jason Garrett to be the coast here for quite a long time Harry likes Jaycee lie and that's the most important that the north of us don't matter he doesn't want to fire him no I didn't get that let's bring\nIn Jay Glazer right now to talk about some other teams around the league and Jay we know that the struggling raiders of course ... Mac and for the season started we'll hear from back a little bit later in the show but I understand you've got some inside info that open might not be done cleaning house yet\nYeah not at all not just that with other first runners well again they tried to ... controversial now there are looking to shop called Josef their first round pick from two years ago calling all around and we're going to have another name they're calling around but not as much how much do their shopping them It's MORNING Cooper the reports from Rome wide receiver so fire sale in Oakland\nAll right let's talk about Texas quarterback and Don Watson you looked at as questionable today against buffalo after taking some big shots and met overtime game last week against the cowboys Abadi\nYeah you know he's listening just questionable to shut syndrome but first serious situation Kurt I'm here at last week at all these things he actually is playing with the cracked room bruise long and then one of his long partially collapsed as well\nI think partially collapsed large you guys are collapse heart [laughter]\nI'm not quite sure what the doctors or at home than [laughter] you know\n\n\n\n\nThe quarterback that's why you draft a quarterback and number two if you're going to do anything in the national football league paint the picture for the giants with Eli Manning the rest of the season he'd be out there and\nJesus man a boxing ring\n\n\nWalk on day one\nAnd I've always\nWhat's your emergency we can stay calm who is it\nRock you Fox's show nine one one income is nine one one event as the only problem once famous Emerson points have they done this before or see the civil\nWar drama and how we do have a quarterback how long has it been arena retire\nWe'll NFL emergencies\nReally oh close to the fans will be tonight is in trying not to wear a groove\nAnd the couches we sit down for the showdown between the longtime face in the NFL Tom Brady and the potential future face of the league Patrick ...

think\nOf a more embarrassing start to the season regime than what the Oakland Raiders\nHave experienced ... we all know how that story when how it all went down look at Jackie grew in smile and that is right now on TV as we're talking about they don't tell the valley murdered yeah he's got that little jockey thing going on is they're doing the national anthem over there in London getting ready to play the sea hawks\nAnd amongst all of the discussion\nBeing shocked by the raiders as they seemed to be dipping their tone of the water of a rebuild\nWell so that doesn't shock me as far as the uh the the trade names that we're hearing because Cooper is under perform for a while this could be one of those reclamation project or projects that a team takes on should they want to uh disperse say pick for him\nAnd then the other thing called Josef brooding himself said we made it we made a couple of hours in the second area of the past couple address he he named Carl Joseph basically by\nName as well as Gary and calmly and said yeah I Would have liked to take in a ... during when James but the chargers got um we we picked ahead of them um but we couldn't because we're already\nWherever that they rounded safety yeah well not and what I Wonder is if you're going to go down this road the lower buys which has not been reported yet\nAs by the way Baker may feel and James Wednesday and among those quarterbacks taking the field right now so keep you up to date on how they look Baker versus the chargers Jamieson making his first started a year and it's a good one it's in Atlanta I guess they're really banged up falcons defense or watching those closely\nUm but you have to wonder how far away from Derek cars name ending up in these rubber\nFar and I'll tell you why it works like a flow chart in my opinion what happened with this ... trade was they chose the wrong one right to little Mac is having a masterful year in Chicago where he landed\nAnd Derek ... is not with the raiders right now he's looking to be high salary low production and so I think it works like a flow chart if we trade coal we'll Mac ... bears and we have dark card if he performs well\nWe stick with him we build around him if not we go into complete rebuild mode and I think that's the reason why you're hearing trade rumors\nA very first lady from scrimmage beautiful pals from Baker Mayfield up in the middle of the David in joke for a first down so bakers out of the gates nice first bout a down throw from James Winston or in Atlanta so they're off and running and so are the Steelers Vance McDonald with a nice cat from Ben Roethlisberger so here we go on week six\nThe thing that's crazy about that when you look at their car and I've been saying since before the year I think Darren car sometimes are not that I don't like him as a quarterback but I Do I think sometimes his name gets a little bit too high up on the list\nBecause you you you you're you're actually looking at a guy that\nUh two years ago had a nice year that was ... a lot of late comebacks in a lot of one point wins and so we went wow this is the guy and then since then\nIt's been middling it's been a lot of injuries and you're seeing that this year a guy who's throwing more interceptions then he has touched down but the truth of the matter is we look at the ... trade why does it even happened why did they go that route\nIs because if you look at every NFL Rosser there's not a one of them that's paying twenty five million or more for a quarterback\nAnd then paying twenty two million or more for another player they don't do that and so they had to pick one of the other they pick their car and a month later they're admitting they made the wrong\nWell and I think that's a that's been ever so clear with what grew to has said to the media he's basically said week after week after week\nUh you can't win without good pass Raj we need to find the pass rush so I don't know if this is sort of shifting responsibility further into Reggie McKenzie slap but that's another change I'm forecasting for the raiders\nI think it is a been reported and probably speculated and will come to fruition that they're going to have change over at GM and John brooding will have full control of this group so whatever happens moving forward\nNot necessarily this year but ... years\nThemself up much nothing but film for what a decade when he's been away from coaching and he's been in the booth learning about all these teams in about all these fliers I think he wants to do a ballot checked did in New England where he completely gentrified this roster to his liking and then he has full control\nAll right that's something to monitor and we will keep an eye on that not only today but through the week sitcom or I Know the cowboys for instance that'd be the first team I think of when I think of them already Cooper\nThat might change their fortunes in a winnable NFC is we have our first touched down to the day and it belongs to the New York jets defend a law X. six right out of the gate\nFor Andrew Luck and the jets\nHave an early seven and nothing advantage on the Indianapolis Colts they're hosting them there today also can tell you things have stalled for the browns they're kicking it away so here come up Philip Rivers and the chargers in a game that to me is really a game that if the chargers can win it rich\nIt solidifies their position we know the chiefs of jumped out to the five and a start\nUp at the chargers just kind of laying in the weeds right now there are three into they've done what they needed to do the two losses have come to the two undefeated teams so there's no shame there but this is the type of road game that charger fans know historically or they have trouble with\nAnd this is the kind of game they're going to need if I think they want to solidify themselves as probably the top wildcard contender in the AFC\nYou know it's interesting everybody points their losses let's point to their wins as well so yeah they lost a two undefeated teams no no a blemish is on the rammed through the cheese yet but they also beat buffalo\nThey beat the raiders the hapless raiders we were just talking about and San Francisco without Jimmy ... points so all of these ... invited games were were fairly close for at least a portion of the games the rare game with standing\nSteve and this is a much improved Brown's defense there there is no no question about it so much improved Brown's often this whole team believes in itself more because Baker may feel that the helm so this is the toughest tests I Believe we're going to see in the early games today\nAlright seven nothing assuming this extra point goes through your eye wherever the heck out of that make it sex nothing they hook that the buccaneers how they six nothing leaders Jamieson Winston opening drive in Atlanta\nGoes very very well for for five forty four yard touchdown throw that ended up in the hands of camera and braid\nA Fifteen yard cash for break for the score and the buccaneers are on the board first this as we mentioned is a good spot for Winston today however that means he needs to go out there and do it today is the START I think of the trial run for tame as Wednesday in are you going to get a contract are you going to be the future of the box or\nOn a bus stop that just went down three winners daily go to Vegas counters dot com Vegas covers dot com first Melvin Gordon\nIf you were to have a fantasy football re drought what number two probably number two behind girlie Melvin Gordon on the board to carries twenty yards one catch for you are\nOne of those Gary goes for a judge or seven rounds that thing and uh I Love it\nI got gardening both of my legs but I'm sitting\nThere asking during the break I I'm I'm having a hard time understanding from a football ... why did he open every ... every single play he goes out for a pass bill throws a job every time and it seemed like defensive coordinators don't really have an answer\nToo many problems if you're a defensive coordinator your scheming for the chargers your thought process is what we have to run zone because they have too many weapons how are we going to run men to men with these guys who beat man coverage\nYeah Mike Williams who wins fifty if not more of a fifty percent or more of a jump ball yup uh yeah I've seen in our new who runs the best routes most queen routes in football he beats man coverage like you mentioned Melvin Gordon the mid ...\nWell then you run zone\nMelvin Gordon finds a soft spot to spot of the zone in these ah angle routes in some of these flat flare outside of the backfield and then he can make a guy miss so that's the problem with Melvin Gordon defensively you can't cover everybody every play and he gets away with a lot because he's surrounded by other weapons\nDo Johnson or are they big third down cats from Baker may feel though in that game as the brown and try to swing it back to the other direction\nThey move in the chargers territory trailing seven announcing but now they're going to have the ball already on the outskirts of field goal range or a couple of other things the cardinals get a field goal we thought the falcons bucks game would be a lot of scoring early returns yeah that one was an easy one to call\nFalcons go right down the other end answer the Kevin break touched down with a Matt Ryan to Mohammed the new touchdown falcons get the extra point so they're up seven to sex and we haven't talked about this one yet\nThe dolphins strike first\nHosting the bears today seven and I think\nNick over area with a touchdown catch from\n... oh yeah as all of a sudden Ryan's Danielle was a surprise inactive today apparently injured himself on Wednesday and things got progressively worse throughout the week so tear the hills not starting we've got a ... while they're citing and remember that the bears defense and the opening drive cars right throw him\nI'll tell you right now and this is gonna sound like a little bit of oh yeah you scored a touchdown so you're going to take his defense broadcast model or better quarterback than people give him credit\nHigh level backup here's the deal are given that when\nBrock stepped in for Peyton Manning at the end of the year when Peyton Manning won his final Super Bowl and retired park on a whole bunch of football games for Denver you understood that our fence as a backup like you just mentioned he executed perfect way and the man and came in and he took the bows anyhow\nAnd he's the guy now he is he the guy I don't know Kenny being franchised quarterback I don't think so but a competent backup a guy you put behind a player to learn the office with a talented off into coordinator offensive system like Adam ... runs that we're all aware of\nYeah he can stick stuff so it's not shocking me what's happening in Miami right now it's not shocking to me that they're not trying out tannahill in an injury situation because they have competency at the backup quarterback position\nYeah you wonder where this is going to go from here if he has a great game today show or a high level defense you know where that conversation goes ah because I tend to heal is it's not that great ah is not that great and and so you want\nAnd injured I mean availability is always the most important have the ability in the NFL if you can't play because you're hurt too often you got to start looking for other options\nParts of seven nothing dolphins in that one also seven nothing sea hawks\nIn London against the uh raiders Russell Wilson a touchdown passage Ron Brown\nSo they've got the ball or or the ... the lead their first the raiders now have the ball going and the other direction\nAnd a very good start for the Houston Texans at home against the bills today to Sean Watson line so far five for five or sixty two yards at a touchdown and that touched down and went to the Andre Hopkins\nAnd so the Texans have a seven nothing lead against the bill and this guy who today is off to a good start as well can we we're we're going to need to as just American football fans\nTo come to a consensus there this is now his third game we got to know how to\nPronounce his name now he said he could say\nI'm going to say ... ... yeah I'll French it up because I'm a I'm an aristocrat is Kiki short cake [laughter]\nI don't play for it you know he's played two games and most of a quarter and a and and I want to throw into them\nFor the guy that come out of nowhere and everybody's confused as to why they're having success\nRemember these guys are getting thrown to I practice a lot because the Andre Hopkins how much does he need to practice probably not that much so when you get into the\nThe you know the the week five weeks six to the NFL season where these guys are taking days off on the the heavy hitting days of practice a guy like ooh today is catching all this ball so I imagine that's what's happened at Houston Texans practice and knowing Billy O'Brian where he came from New England\nIf you play well in practice you get your shots on Sundays\nThat's exactly what's happening we Kiki ...\nAll right and certainly you're telling us this cruelty so are we making it to French it's not good today it's ...\nI've been blamed to be a bit fancier with my binoculars\nAre ... you know you are you are fancy so to ... to to alright alright and on the huge it on the on the ... the yeah very good All right they're taxing laid this wind seven announcing I'm everybody's kicking extra points today we'll see if the Vikings can do it they score on the cardinals to take the early lead\nSix to three is the score there that's going to be a ... Murray\nTwenty six yard touchdown rush a rushing touchdown and let's pass along also we knew that I'm\nUh in the Vikings backfield today Donovan Cook was going to be active but they said it would not be a full complement of carries\nSo far it's been done he was not on the field or so for five thirty three to go first quarter Murray has three carries and stuff on digs has a carry out of the backfield but very very productive forty nine yards and a score already\nOf the most underrated backs in the NFL had a ... year back in twenty fifth team with the Oakland Raiders rush for over a thousand yards that year for yards per carry followed that up in Oakland with a lesser use role still had that for oh mark and then went to Minnesota\nAverage this guy gets you for your hard every time he touches the ball and he's a better than average home run hitter I Love ... Murray I have no idea why hasn't gotten more run in the NFL he's always been paid the bridesmaid never the bride but they're going to have just as much success\nWith Marie coming out of the backfield as they would have with delving cook there isn't a there isn't a huge cliff to drop\nOff up that's interesting I I don't disagree based on where cook is health wise we got such a small sample of delving cook out a full level of health last year at the beginning of the year but it was dynamic I'm I I tell you what if you've got a fully healthy Donovan Cook\nFor my money I'd still do that I just don't know if you're ever going to have that this year\nTruthfully and I think that you know a guy like Maria is a war horse hasn't missed a lot of time due to injury he's available and effective so again if you're leaning on your running back to be a running back and that's what this guy is he is a ball Russian running back\nYou're not going to really failed to hoard one side or the other occur cousins he can deal I imagine you can throw him pitching catch some ah throw balls his way and ah they'll have success they're delving cook really outstanding rookie look\nFor five games but he got injured too soon for us to really make a full a grand or a statement about his skills at this week level\nAll right I I'm I'm struggling because I watch the ball that Andy Dalton just through moments ago in Cincinnati that absolutely one hundred percent should have been picked off\nAnd it was dropped right through the hands of a Steeler defender which sets up a third down in ten for Cincinnati there at the Pittsburgh twenty eight so their infield go arrange it is a little bit of a a dreary day in Cincinnati\nI'm incredibly fascinated to see this game I feel like this one sits right alongside what we already said about the chargers that this is a proven game since ...\nFrom I'm from ... to AJ green that's going to set the bangles up with a first and goal so keep you up to date there but the Steelers still kind of mid linked to do and what are you going to figure it out and be a contender this year Bengals argue for real I think we learn those questions to that\nYeah you know and the bangles offensively have always been grade and I mean this when Andy Dalton and AJ green find each other a lot and that's what's happening in the early going here\nInto green was just dialed up with a wine backer man coverage over the middle ... knows exactly where to put that football you're going to convert every time so that was a well designed play by simply they knew exactly what the Pittsburgh Steelers were going to do and now they're in the low red zone\nEight hundred three o five zero zero zero for the single biggest plane Michael rules\nWeek you get it in ice and you

Russell Wilson thing [noise] pretty good stuff there in London as he drops the shotgun snap [noise]\nCalmly picks it up steps up in the pocket and hits more in the back of the end zone fourteen nothing Seattle\nHe Aaron Rodgers two guys where those moments don't scare him because they they trust their improvisation so much that they can do just about anything as far as throwing angle\nWin win their arm is in in its natural slot when they have to make an adjustment in the pocket outside and this is an underrated performance from mobile quarterback when you are sprinting forward\nAnd then have to store to leap in the air so you can leave enough touch on the ball is that we use your hand Russell Wilson still one of the most amazing athletes on a football field at all five foot eleven\nAnd I thought the raiders actually might have a shot in this game sometimes that London game is just kind of a weird vibe on hold that thought fleet flicker Cleveland Baker Mayfield end zone no good oh\nReceiver could add it would have been an amazing catch\n'em but I was a fun place to watch the browser starting this drive on the chargers thirty three so good feel position they still trails seven nothing Pittsburgh with James Caan or from the one he's going in touch down there an extra point away from time things up in Cincinnati so good football game there but Dr London\nI thought you know the raiders might have a shot today they've been in games\nUh Seattle certainly been nothing to write home about and London is a weird vibe and you don't know how that's going to have an effect on a football game but right now Seattle is absolutely crushing the raiders in every phase of the game and it really feels to me rich like the raiders\nWho do have some talent in spots\nEach passing week they look\nRumors and and basically a coach who's making more than any of the players and seems to be waving a white flag and weeks six\nI look at the one position that matters the most and football and I see a lack of confidence Derek car during the short career and the time that we've gotten to know him as the starter of the Oakland Raiders\nHas never look more uncomfortable at the position in his career I think this guy John ... and has the entire organization walking on\nPins and needles and that may be appropriate I remember feeling that way in New England any day can be your last day show up for work every day and try to shine as bright as you can\nOtherwise you don't know someone might get brought in on a workout to replace you you've seen it so many times where somebody as a blue usurped a Sable starter a New England because\nHe just perform better than hindering camper practice\nSo I think John Bruning is trying to create a culture in Oakland and you're seeing the growing pains and it hasn't changed the continental shipped to Europe they're playing at Wimbledon Stadium\nAnd you can see the same discomfort that you could see stateside and it starts with starting to be Derek car I just don't see a lot of confidence there\nWell so what do you do there I mean we've already heard some people are starts as a jazz that John grew in might actually trade Derek car I don't I don't know if you do that they did straight for a gym McCarron before the season does that mean it's his ball game\nThe rest of the year and you're looking to the future and if you do trade Derek cars you need to have a taker I don't know who that might be the giants Jacksonville I'm not sure exactly how this all plays out uh I I just I I don't know it feels a little soon\nOr as and it's a huge contract to just move on\nYeah ... you have to you have to have them play better I mean Alex Smith the only reason why you're able to move into the Redskins was because he ... he was coming off of color\nBack if you're going to get anything worse what you drafted a matter what you're paying him currently especially in guaranteed that you'll never see back unless he starts performing too too

actually an unintended thing that I like about this though in the NFL or as the chargers get a big play a Phillip river's heading out to route Williams down the field flips the field there in the browns territory will keep you up to date on that but I Do feel like\nThe lack of confidence in kicking it's leading to more to point conversion tries it's leading to more going forward on fourth out\n... the the lack of trust and the kicking game is forcing our fences to stay on the field longer and a lot of people forget\nForce in short is still really advantageous down and distance to try to exploit offensive when I think we're seeing a renaissance because you do it enough your percentages usually you'll do plus fifty\nOr as far as as far as making them versus not making them it's very similar to third insurance if you're not a good thirty in short team you shouldn't attempt it but if you have a bad kicker you might as well rules die\nOut right now the Bengals have the ball back in the seven seven tie or the chargers throughout the ball at the browns\nA forty five yard line with a first intense of a moving around ... and in fact rivers is going deep again is going for it all in the end zone and that one is it caught or is it picked a it's a fight for the ball\nAnd they're going to call it a touchdown that surround Williams again who just got a hundred yards receiving in the last two ways I I mean literally Ninety yards one throw from the ten and then another throw into the end zone touchdown charger\nHim play action almost the same route it was just a poster ... from the far side and you see him building up a far has and then he leans back in\nAnd I will say this ... he ran that thorough Philip Rivers gave that all of his might from my eyes and there were three defenders in the area and if that fell even\nBecause it really came down to two guys coming down with a ball and who is going to yank it out of the other one hand and that's going on around at the end zone Williams did it so that's one where rivers can go by is receiver dinner tonight because ah he turned out interception into a touchdown absolutely\nAbsolutely and and that's what you hope for if you're going to throw a ball the way Philip Rivers Justin and you're going to give you a receiver or shot albeit under through it so not as good of a shot as he'd hoped ah that rewards the quarter back to the point where he's going to be looking up sixteen all day long now question\nSeventeen nothing now for the Redskins as they've added a field goal is to talk about cabinet and for just a second Newton gets his number one or should I say his favorite target back today\nA and that is correct Olsen and also and so far is there a ... a leading target guy right now to catch is twenty three yards a but Newt and so far eight of twelve Ninety five yards no touchdowns he does have a pick that the Redskins turned into three points and so now they've got this big lead we'll see if Newt and get a ... I feel like Newton\nAnd the Panthers all at all\nHow about this kind of odd nondescript season we've talked so much\nAbout all the other teams in that division think about week one a week to everything was about ... oh yeah and then what's been going on since then everything's about Drew Brees hold on a fell out of Drew Brees party all week long\nAnd we we do talk about the falcons a lot too and that it's surprising that they are struggling as much as they are at one and for the Panthers are sitting there there are in at three in one\nOther very much in the mix not hearing a lot about them though\nKnow it's the thing about it is I don't think there's a lot of faith in Cam Newton in a division where he is facing the likes of uh Drew Brees then and facing the likes of a a of a Matt Ryan I don't think and and reasonably so he's looked at as one of the elite even though we\nAll this is in the pocket passer not this league requires almost at the position this is now a passing league Cam Newton is not a passing quarterback Cam Newton actually from inside divert inside the locker room\nDoesn't really understand football that much so when he's task to make some of these high level decisions with where to go with the ball yeah of course Greg Olson is one of his favorite targets the titans usually near the line of scrimmage and the checkout checked out capacity and that's the reason why he gets fed the rock\nOutside of that tremendous athlete can keep drives alive improvisation scramble drills of course\nBut Kim is in ... and a leap pocket passer and that's what this league it's geared towards now\nAll right let's take a look now at the Tampa Bay Atlanta game for a second James Winston just got picked off although that one is under review so we'll watch that one\nUh we've got stabbed Arnold to surround prior touchdown that game is surprisingly been filled with points and the jets are back in front of the cold Seventeen to third team and the Minnesota Vikings are we're now in a spot where we can start to say this is this year's theme\nThat place to the level of its competition it's still early in the game\nBut cousins has now turned it over twice it just fumbled the cardinals turn it into a defensive touchdown they tied the game up at ten here the Vikings you out of high profile lawsuits against the rams nobody blamed them for that they had a beautiful when in Philadelphia last week people can see how high level the Vikings can perform\nBut it's also a team that got blown out at home by buffalo and it's at home again today and letting a rookie quarterback and Josh Rosen and the cardinals steak right with him\nYet well here's the problem with the Vikings and uh I I think it was an underrated story going into the season because everybody was trying to see who they were going to bring in a quarter\nThat our ... to a on the eastern\nAnd that was a great number for sake one Barkley but does it prove that you can have a great running back but you still need a very good quarterback you have to have a quarterback who at least I can\nMake a play extend to keep a play alive somehow some way and he can't do that and do the giants look back on this and say oh you know should have taken a quarterback\nDan Patrick's Day not I am eastern six specific on Fox Sports radio safe to say the NBA is back\nLooks to me the most type season ever sacks shoes for [noise] are you in\nBecause we are\nTo Haiti two ways in Silver Lake [noise] we\nAnd you can keep it here as we cover this new seats on Fox Sports radio host season is here so we're drinks all stars\nBecause the only thing that matters is October\nAn ounce the good news Kamara one one [noise]\nRead about the value could was almost every game\nDoes your eight years old\nAt age forty three learn something new and I'm In the process about good moment because you're just it's just you're just aimed at the jury are lie to Cincinnati was break dancing to enroll getting in dogs we fall down on the back of the Bengal defenders then rolls over like a somersault\nLands on his head at the one and flips over in the end zone ten you'll be down by contact if it is your head\nThat touches the ground I mean my understanding of the down by contact rules are\nYeah right so I assume they're going to call this down at the one yard line or that how you are\nYeah I'm In the hall\nIs that it is\nFor the call stand down at the one yard line so I figured because\nI mean any ... I'm like down by the top of that ad like I've seen claims where if your hand the kind of you if you put your this down on the ground and you roll over onto the top of your wrist\nThey'll call you down by contact because it's not the palm of your hand so I figured your forehead had the same rules but this was in his ... he was sliding loyalty yellow stripe on top of the black Steelers that that was incredible\nThe spot where your son your kids just stop right there in the top and they had that one went in and it's good news regimes Connor fantasy owners because he goes in under an ex wife or his

touchdown throw from James Winston this one the OJ Howard\nThere hanging in there in Atlanta is Twenty one the Thirteen now we walk him in Dick Stockton will be on the call for rams Broncos later today on Fox looking forward to it the great to have you and I know what the first question got to be like what is the weather out there and how do you think it'll affect this game\nWell I Love to be dramatic can tell you that whether it's going to be a big factor the game but I'm going to put a pain in the balloon and tell you\nThat it's not going to be a factor in this game because we had a lot of snow early in the field was covered with our they've taken a top off we have a light light flurries the biggest story I guess is the fact that it\nUsual that it comes at this time of year but whether it should not be a factor today and we don't have when to speak up which really emphasizes that\nOne of the biggest factors today I'm sure you guys are all over it is Cooper cup brand and cooks their health and how that will level the playing field should they not be available today what do we know about these two star receivers were the rams\nThey clear protocol concussion protocol yesterday they are going to play and they probably will play almost every step of the game they will be in the lineup today for the ram\nSo he was just great often continues to roll and they got a chance to look at some other receivers last week so now they now have that position\nThey stocked with us rams Broncos later today the rams going over thirty points in all of their games so far but ... is is there are tough his test so far this season\nI don't think so ah I think what they played Minnesota that was a protest but you know what any game was a test I don't think there's any game you look at look you've got this Denver team that the last three in a row after winning two games they have a great running attack and the rams have not been that great at stopping the run\nThey have some issues in the secondary with the key to leave out of their uh they've given up thirty one points in each of the last two games\nAnd so you know the Broncos it's kind of a desperate game for them they're also oh so are you know that's what they need to do it and I think it's a ramp with a look at the Broncos they'd be making a big mistake but uh so we'll see what transpired that year the rams are undefeated they're looking great and uh we'll see\nYou know I looked at the Denver Broncos defensively and they've taken a great step back or are they going to be looking at opposites on line at their defensive coordinator over there with the rams and saying well I was a should've could've water there\nWell you know it's interesting because they have taken a step back and uh\nThe number five I think I've done anything yet so we really haven't seen that defensive pass rushed do much they're having problems with the secondary\nAnd er and talking to wait fellows last night he has great fond memories of being in Denver is that his wife was here all week long and he says I Love hockey players have it all up some of the Denver players that\nAre always\nLove it well a deck we really appreciate a few minutes time looking forward to this one later today thank you\nFor having me on the uh guys\nOkay Dick Stockton rams Broncos along with ... and Jennifer held later today on Fox bizarre play just took place in Cleveland and it's one that may have a huge effect on the game the chargers I've taken a Twenty one to three lead\nOn the Cleveland Browns than a third down just inside the browns thirty yard line so already in field goal position for sure and so you're thinking if they don't get it on third down to go for the field goal while they snap shot on the left tackle Russell or calling\nAnd I mean clearly his day at full speed when I watched it moved oh good second before the ball was snapped and it wasn't one of those like always ... send the referees missed it like he started walking he started going into his full motion\nThey do not call a false start and Philip Rivers is throughout Williams for a touchdown and the browns are now suddenly down by Eighteen and Gregg Williams is going bananas\nWhile the only thing that could have allowed to play to go and it would be a good call by the referees if they if they saw this from the sideline is if you had a situation where a defender drew him off side and then stop this progress out of the neutral zone\nAnd then continue this rush because it's a free play by the AARP and so if that's what we saw what about the bills that a flag will go down on the end it there was no fly no fled on the play periods so it was very confusing and Greg ...\nI saw a goon a man jumping to his full kicks up to block for the passing point\nWas not even close a jets get a field goal there up uh twenty to Thirteen closing minutes of the of the first half against the Indianapolis Colts a Houston in\nBuffalo rich to half its ten nothing for the taxes and all lies now go to Cincinnati\nWhere the Bengals are trying to put something together and the two minute drive down to twenty three seconds they're down fourteen seven in the game they got it first intent on the Steelers fourteen yard line\nSo this game as we set all day we thought it would be tight we thought it would be a good game these are two teams that are both desperate for this division game and it's been that and Andy Dalton just hit our guy Tyler board for the second time for a touchdown and he was by himself that was too easy\nWell he knew that it was going to be man coverage you saw the blitz coming to his right he knew he had a solo route to the left\nAnd even though it was a it was a one on one coverage without them she was one of their more talented defenders a boy that made a sharp ... comeback route to the front corner of the end zone and don't and through before even came out of his break that was an easy pitching couch for six\nWay too easy so now we're an extra point away from that one being tied going in to the locker rooms are so this has been a really good game and it's living up to the hype right now that extra point with Nineteen seconds on the clock\nJust good why in the right All right\nFor you know by the way you want the best extra point Mrs day so far remember Mr sixty three yards game winner just seven days gram going to miss the first extra point of the day\nOne of his job well good for a change because it hasn't been that way across the league but that's exactly what I was just talking about this matinee ... the incorporation of Trey Burton that tight end he has been one of the key performers in this happens to specially when they're near the goal line they get creative\nJust like the navy when he was in Kansas City with Andy Reid think about how many shovel passes we see to Travis Cal say go for six Trey Burton has been that key to their ... in Chicago\nThird quarter we continue week's National Football league and if you got your fantasy team right about now is a good God to check in and see how you're doing and that's exactly what\nWe're going to help you do coming up next

it's a line of scrimmage game and so far my or I should say Minnesota\nHas rush the ball effectively a yeah Murray who's up there with Seventy one his back Boone has been in the game he's got to carry for twenty so they're able to establish the physicality needed to sort of compliment a passing game that is finally catching its breath at home\nWe also talked about how the chargers out a rookie quarterback in a tough spot coming out in the second half because when you got a veteran group and a ball hawking these ads\nHave a I have a rookie quarterback in a spot where you know what he's got to do they're going to abandon the running game that's what leads to turn off or is it bad right out of the gates the chargers pick off Baker Mayfield take it down to the ten yard line one play Dr talks we Melvin Gordon goes in ... that can touch down to the game from ...\nGoes up three score is now cousins Russia's themselves so in Minnesota starting to get away from the cardinals but back to what you're saying about the brown\nTheir first when at home and lord knows how long Baker Mayfield struggling for the first time in his short careers the starting line or quarterback their here's the deal though how they really seen an elite defense to date no\nThey played against the Steelers the Steelers have a bottom of the week defense right now that seems also really struggling this season defensively it's been shootouts and breezes been winning on\nMember they'll both of those words that rod Taylor though\nThe jets look good that's a good defense they look good week one but that was a that was the turning point game for Cleveland because Baker Mayfield steps in halfway through and as as they noted they're starting defense said we didn't have a game plan for Baker we had a game plan for it to rod\nRaiders was up next they get to win over the ravens that's a real deep end up\nHowever I'll say it's the only one they face in the chargers that's a top five defense and they are humming right now on the road\nAnd I'm I'm expecting to see some good here from Baker but it needs to happen soon because we're already marching close to five minutes into the third and we haven't seen much offensive way out of the brown\nWell let me add if you're going to say that yes they did beat in a a a really good defense the ravens yeah they did it but it did it without a touchdown that's one of the games while they voted off the field yeah see I'm not like they actually ended up doing something and and play well in scoring a whole lot of points\nOr the browns or you know pretty good defense themselves and therefore they're able to grind out a way and so I think this is\nA kind of a landmark moment believe it or not this will sound funny because of what we know Cleveland to be over the last two years\nBut for the chargers to go on the road and blow out the team that nobody is blowing out remember we've heard it a million times the browser two two and one but there are hair away from being five it out if they had a good kicker they're probably five into to or you know but all every game is growing it over time except for\nThey are today are twenty eight points on the board early third quarter\nI thinking establishes the chargers even though they may have trouble catching achieved but at the status as the chargers is a definite playoff favorite in the AFC\nI'm going to give you this data that game the browns have been within the chargers forty six times\nThey've only got to feel goals six points\nSo think about that you're on your with in the field goal fringe range of the chargers side of the field six times and you've gotten six points it's not enough yeah\nAnd so yeah blame it on whatever you want but Baker may fields running on our fence and they've been ineffectual when they've had it in chargers territory you cannot blame feel position on this\nNow so they they went for it on fourth down at one point and did not get it I'm there weren't any turnovers but ah they've they've had some ... that have pushed them out of\nField goal range and had the pond so yes they've they have had\nEverything they needed but they've not been able to do anything with it and on the other side\nThe chargers has taken advantage of absolutely every opportunity to have had a big place it's around Williams who has two scores and Melvin Gordon with two touchdown Russia's as well another field goal for the jets\nThey are back up by two scores on the cold thirty three to twenty is the score there as them Donald continues or inefficient way to move the ball up and down the field is only got five in completion the whole day twenty or twenty five\nTwo hundred and forty three yards to touch down throws you does that one interception but by and large are really good day for say I'm darn old\nAnd the New York media which does not how the short term memory problem is probably going to take note of that ah when ah when the uh the the papers come out in the headlines come out tomorrow morning I I really you know it's easy to jump on the giants\nI still look at this ... and think boy I'm I'm torn\nWonderful shipped to have and let's not act like there might not be a way\nFor the giants to turn that position around quickly by handling quarterback next year instead of this year I think about names that could be available all from ... Taylor huge Amos Winston to Derrick car to Justin Herbert in the draft\nAny origin rival yeah yeah he chooses to come out a look they you know quarterbacks at a rookie level we're seeing it can come out in today's NFL and play right away so it might have taken a couple of years the matter what they did\nYeah speaking on there now instead of their future for a moment you I'm manning is struggling and and mainly with a ... of wind sake why I'm Barkley if you have a poor off in some wine is probably one of the best backs to bring in\nBecause Penn State over the course of his career really didn't provide great run blocking for him or he was tackled for last more than any back or close to more than any back in college football is senior year or its final year at Penn State and he was still able to generate the kind of yard age after contact\n[noise] check out onto\nLeaves de Gaulle and power Dan Patrick ... plane traffic is does the godly Chris Broussard Dr ...

Taylor bringing in Josh down giving him the the reins because they traded away McCarron\nSo the Oakland Raiders and so now you're left with the situation saying okay we built for the future\nAnd you're starting quarterback you took in the first round is on the sidelines and Peter Menzel leading the charge I don't think we're going to have an identity on the bills this year and that's my call\nBig Sur down conversion Andy Dalton the Tyler board on third in free for for yards and that's going to move the stakes into Pittsburgh territory really good catch by Boyd their God I Love that guy\nHe is really turn it into a nice player also Seattle the route continues across the pond Oakland went a long way to not score that's a long flight\nHome they are trailing twenty seven denouncing roster wealth into Tyler Lockett\nThird touchdown throw the day for wells Senate is twenty seven and nothing for Seattle early fourth quarter and the raiders have ah probably now taking the lead as if you want to call it I don't know the worst team the most embarrassing seem\nA okay hey that thought for a second touchdown Chris Gard one for the buccaneers and now they're going for two to tie the game Winston will throw incomplete so ah the bucks we'll still trail only by two plenty of time left on the clock pick pick pick the getting back in that game well in ...\nThings were able to march forty seven yards to kick a forty five yard field goal to make it twenty four Thirteen at half time I'm In the buccaneers on defense up to that point had given up two hundred Seventy five yards mind you\nThis isn't a half of football uh and and were four of our I should say the the Atlanta Falcons were four or five on third down so\nThey are just getting crushed the defensively\nAnd the only chance they have to survive this is if they start converting offensively Jim is Winston at least for now has been able to go toe to toe with ...\nAll right the bears and the red zone trip escape throws to the end zone in earth sat there by the dolphins what a huge play a penalty wiped a touchdown off the board moments ago moves them back to biscuit gets picked dolphins still him again\nMcCain who is a a great secondary member for the dolphins not in there so this is a part of the team that you could have had some success against ... just in a poor decision\nHe was throwing it to the middle of the field he thought he had one on one he did not a safety was waiting or in the end zone and I I mean didn't have to move its feet just out of step forward to grab that falls down for the uh for for the touch back so it'll be dolphins ball on the twenty five in their next possession\nWe've also got a really good game developing in Washington where the Redskins jumped out to a Seventeen to nothing lead but now where they Cam Newton touchdown throw a to Torrey Smith\nA the Panthers I'm sure we'll go for it to their down twenty to Fifteen an opportunity to get it to within three still eight and a half minutes to go in that game so Cam Newton is starting to get the role of going and the role that Alex Smith had going early he has not been able to sustain at all\nAnd if you look at Newt and this is when the Carolina Panthers have six cents okay when they have\nTwenty nine which is nice with those two touchdowns but he's thrown a pack and that's typical of camera you know you did make some errors with the football and makes up for it though and this carries\nHe's guarded eight times for forty yards he's got along a Fifteen on that he's averaging five yards carries the top pressure on the team or look he's dynamic there's no question about it\nBut if they don't have a lead then they can't really operate the often that nor Turner and many others before him have tried to build around Cam Newton so they're doing what Newton does however I Will say this again\nOkay Roth is burger hits if he does a great job the hurdle attack learning is going to get the first down but in the process drops the ball\nJohnny on the spot as you just missed Schuster who recovers the formal after six so it will be forced out however at least they get to now try the field goal and tried to take a six point lead as opposed to it only being three that was a huge recovery from ju ju\n... and Vance McDonald Jesse James or they've had big days for big Ben here\nIn ah in Cincinnati the kick is up and it is good right in since the the score is twenty four teen six point lead as you mentioned three thirty left in this game and I I'll tell ya I originally thought\nThat the NFC Easter it's probably going to be the most compelling division in football and basically all of those teams is full have have fallen apart the eagles don't look the same as they did last year or the giants underwhelming Redskins you see and what they're looking like Alex Smith is in figuring out with them yet\nA Dallas Cowboys underwhelming as well and it is the AFC North that's the most compelling so far by a stretch Steelers good\nBad ravens are good and I am absolutely loving what I'm seeing out of the browns and the Cincinnati Bengals so far storyline\nWas having Coleman a touchdown Atlanta back up by nine six and a half to go on and I can make your day right now if you want me to go on\nTouchdown David Johnson [noise] [noise]\nOh David Young duck got heart cargo hold a are still down by

you're taking measured riskier obviously a but we'll see if this pans out for them you got to Antonio Brown and motion Big Bend snap he's surveying the feel extending play the far side scramble throws document zone caught\nGarbage man but it's not about Jesse James I think one out of bounds and then came back in first man to touch the ball so that's going to the dollar five a to point conversion twenty six Twenty one\nThe Steelers will leave with only ten seconds left to go the Bengals will have a miracle of a shot while also no options did not get that first down but instead decided oil for a long field goal and guess what they got it however\nThis is not in the game by any stretch James Winston will have a little bit over a minute to go and the falcons lead by five\nAnd we're going to have another shot at that point conversion Wally ban was extending play scrambling around Cincinnati holds in the secondary so no Opie I call on the picker upper Antonio Brown but holding call on the way of the Cincinnati defense and we got issues in Atlanta\nDo so aftermath Brian kicked out field goal he was hit\nBy a defender coming through trying to block it the falcon sideline led by Matt Ryan very upset right now as Matt Brian gingerly walks off of the field\nA and that kicker for that team is a big part of their success so not Brian ... hits the field goal of it now appears to be injured and we'll see where Tampa Bay starts looks like it about their own twenty three minute for to go\nThat's how much damage Winston has to try to go get the touchdown here's another look at the falcons play actually I ...\nAnd as he kicks it he nails the field goal but hurt his kicking leg hey we'll bring a shady you could actually see they hamstring kind of is that a pop in the pants yeah right as the as the ball is kicked and if that's the case I mean that's going to be curtains for Brian season\nAnd at five and said this a thousand times it is a copy cat league and so the Steelers have a second chance opportunity on the two point conversion following Cincinnati is holding penalty that gives them another shot at it and go figure you saw it ran by the Kansas City chiefs with Travis Kelsey at the goal line earlier this season\nThey run a quick wide receiver bubble screen\nOut but to to the three receivers side and you have a tomboy in front of juice Smith Schuster\nFor the two point conversion\nIs Pittsburgh up by seven twenty eight Twenty one in since the Pittsburgh kicking off\nAll right we can pass along that Houston did defeat buffalo twenty to thirty team the Colts have just scored again\nAnd now have the ball it's forty two to thirty for the jets they added a cold and again there's no way anybody ever thought there was gonna be this kind of scoring in this game\nIs that so cynical that forty two and a thirty four so it's an eight point game and not done yet charges blown out the brown spinal minute apply thirty four team there and to keep our streak alive rich\nThe bears and dolphins will be going to over time we've had over time every single early session so far this year six weeks in her out on be reasonable\nAnd I and I mean really it comes down to the fact that we're seeing we're seeing so many of these games these pickers come onto the field\nAnd you're not getting those three points that award you win some times or you're not seeing faith in the kicking game the way you used to and so I I Believe full heartedly that's why many of these early season games\nNational Book probably college when they\nWhen they go down on the field\n[laughter] what breaking it all down you know what can happen in your home for the best football coverage on the radio waves right here on Fox Sports radio\nThat will be our season is here so we're trained all stars\nBecause the only thing that matters is October\nAnd I'll see continues model one\nThe bears and jobs and wages are they saying football game\nAnd it over John the Gulf of all first they drive at all of our way down the field\nPerson go\nFrom there they get to do that on second goal from the to to get to the water it all started goal from the half yard line I hand off to Kenya drag it bounces off the line falls to the right and he's got an easy score however\nBumble the ball right before he crosses the goal line the bears recover and the dolphins are going to walk out of here without even getting three\nAnd so now the dolphins or on the parents the bears will get the ball at their own one bought a field goal wins the game Kenyan drank with the formal and right now is getting some teammates to talk to him on the sidelines pretty upset\nYeah he's got the power over his head he knows that these ... like many moments on the football field they're the most they're the most impactful they matter the most you need to play your best in those moments and people lose jobs over these moments and look everybody\nGoes oh well it's not his fault if this happened in the second quarter of that happening in the third than wall would have been a different game for that\nUp late to dinner dates with your girlfriend or your significant other or you're late to your own wedding where you're not there to pick up the kids look there's there's moments in your life that matter more than other moments fair or not that's how football works as well so you need to show up in those moments\nAnd this and the young career is one of those that he won't forget\nWhat year literally looking at a guy a and if you're a spot where you're gonna have to watch the highlight later you're literally talking about some of the balance is often defender and then\nAt the two yard line standing straight up just needs to fall forward correct and that is what he's in the process of doing and the boss works out I mean it's literally all you need to do is just fall down\nAnd somehow the ball based on somebody touching his arm or I don't know if it just slipped the ball squirts out and how about this for a break the bears somehow recovered the ball it moved into the end zone so they won't get the ball but when they get it at the twenty\nThis is just bad after worse because with only needing a field goal to get into the fringe area where you're kicker has the opportunity you just need forty forty five yards\nA this is just bad news after work or I should say worst news after bad for the dolphins it's time for this defense old like I mentioned bottom third in the NFL and through the early going through this game it it looked better\nOr because they shut them out of half time and yet here we\nGo there goes Jordan how it all the way up to the forty five for twenty yards at a first down the clock is ticking down\nUnder four forty as well which also as we talk about every week with this ridiculous ten minute clock if the bears don't do something a nicely here with this next set of downs uh we're moving toward yet another tie\nSo as we see how old she is progressing in this Denver game we had a low\nThese games are getting underway here they've already scored three points so the Denver Broncos trail three nothing at home but now we we've got a pile of yards another long run by joining however another Miami dolphin overtime you're going\nTo go into dolphins territory and had the forty five to the forty four so uh now I actually marked that one down closer to the forty one yard line so they're really only need about five or ten more yards to at least even think about a field goal\nAnd yeah the rams up at three nothing lead and we can also pass along all that talk last night and today about the snow in Denver\nA there is not is back on the field so I there's no it's not only stopped but somehow the plows or whatever are melted away or what I mean the\nThe grasses as green as it could possibly be on the TV screen the rams up three to nothing and they have the ball I'm All right now back to the bears second down coming up second down and ate\nSo right now they're just about the forty ... fifty seven yard field goal from here so Moore is needed on these next you down to really make the bears feel good about that one so that's the only game going\nFrom the early session the jets did hold off the colds they won that one forty due to thirty four by the way the raiders did get on the board with a field goal for some reason before that game ended\nIn London Seattle wins it twenty seven to three Washington holds off Caroline is a comeback effort twenty three Seventeen it was all chargers in Cleveland\nThirty eight fourteen Vikings win by ten over the cardinals yeah how the end of the play call with Atlanta holding off Tampa Bay\nThirty four and a twenty nine Houston beats buffalo twenty two Thirteen and Pittsburgh with the dramatic twenty eight Twenty one when over Cincinnati in Cincinnati alright for yards on the second down play for the bears so now it's thirty four\nOf the dolphins so feel go range yes but it's a long one\nAnd this is the other thing I don't like about this with the clock\nThe bears let it run all the way down to two eleven and call a timeout and I'm not saying it's not smart football based on the rules that said it is but you're getting coaches on a weekly basis that are either having to play for a tie\nOr play for if we don't get the win let's take the steps to try for its high I just think this is a terrible look for the NFL where people Jason Garrett was stuck in this bucket last week against used in where people are having to play for a tie nobody likes that nobody wants to watch\nThat well and it's smarter football if you're a coach and you know that you're setting up\nFor a game winning kick or potentially handing the ball back over to your own defense\nYou want to escape with the highest possible if not the winds so you wind the clock down as much as you can ... from a tactic tactical standpoint it makes sense but you're right if this game is supposed to be about viewership if this game is supposed to be about an entertainment at the legal level\nThey're failing because it is not entertaining to see a time nobody likes it the players included I Know if I was still playing I'd have a lot I player said the most important battle I Would have a lot to say with this many games ending with the time we seem to already to seize\nHeart the third and fourth plane goes for just about nothing joined the Howard get stopped at the thirty five so that's what we're left with as we hit the two minute warning of the overtime period is a bears kicking unit coming out for a fifty two yard attempt\nAnd if it's no good the dolphins are in the two minute drill to try to see if they can prevent this from being yet another tie in the NFL\nAnd I you know even even though you you you give the ball back I like the barest chances in that situation they they definitely have\nBack in the game in ... Wyler a it's a lot to do to come in and fill in as well as Brock has throughout the late part of this game but it's doing an awful lot trying to win an overtime again to pass rush that's going to ... years back and knows you're going to try to throw in them\nRams already at three nothing and have the ball just outside the red zone in Denver Jared golf with a throw on third down that his incomplete so it'll be another feel go try and the opening drive for the jags in Dallas is stopped so quick three it out and punt from the jaguars who today are wearing the shield pants and black jerseys and black helmets\nOn the road in Dallas which is a um an unsettling look uh as I like it when teams do some different south\nOf the jobs are kind of becoming the diamond backs of the NFL hit right no idea what they're going to come out wearing on a daily basis\nAnd they're like the Oregon Ducks of a of the south eastern quadrant of the NFL they'll look I I I never noticed uniforms unless I find them disagreeable and these are particularly Christian disagreeable in Dallas today that Prescott\nTaking the field Dallas has been teetering on obscurity this season from an offensive standpoint I'll say this though if there's a a division in the NFL where you could have a lack of success early on right now it's the end if she is\nSo that gets underway first in ten\nFrom his own Eighteen yard line and throws a strike on first out\nTwenty one year I'm Out of Miami out of a shock I ended up calling\nThe recall and five Jerry's is all thirty one yard touchdown throw in seven catches for Ninety yard and he's up over twenty three vantage points today bears radio network\nOther side of that game Miami a whole meal my Albert Wilson\nSports\nRadio by dig the dolphins radio network and Albert Wilson ma already he went for six reception a hundred fifty five yards heck of an average there to touch down\nNow Albert Wilson has been good but there is only one receiver and the national football league has gone over a hundred yards in every single one of these games and he plays the bowl north Cal Fire [noise]\n\nBarely knew on K fan Adam feeling eleven catches a hundred and twenty three yards and a touchdown and the Viking get a win twenty seven to Seventeen wait is that booming I'm hearing no no no no they're saying ...\nNine leading by white bake riots that got a shooting back out here for the cat and often\nDon't touch down\n...\nAbout ... radio network with issues\nRope a dope ... who\nIs really all died at nine reception Seventy one yard and that touched down on ten charges Ninety percent rate on the game\nAll right some other names to throw out there James Colorado's governor touchdown runs today it's around Williams on just reach out just went for a hundred and Eighteen yards to scores for the chargers Tyler board for the Bengals seven catchy sixty two yards do all of them went for touchdowns are Johns did\nHis normal deal ten catches a hundred and forty three yards that's all ...

I Can't think of the last time that happened for him a but again good game for the chargers they get the victory thirty eight to fourteen over the browsing could afford to the Bronx and I go through two three in\nOne and had it or to almost ... another time river last where you are yeah they they could have had like three times a season already so hey but it was the only game that they were out of it\nTrue this is the only game in spread 'em reason the deepest decided not\nTo show up a and it you know it was just too much for for bigger may feel to to handle\nAnd they didn't go to overtime they probably wish they would ever looked at a chance to win or other than getting smacked up\nA so that was that game and uh of course we'll get we'll get you up there on the games that are happening right now to nothing by the way the cowboys up\nOn the jags and the cowboys eat this gay running hard is it securely it looked like a twenty hour run there I Want to go to another game that was a very it's a really good games are really close games today or one that was with the team speaking of two two and one that will be the Pittsburgh Steelers who were going into this game at two two and\nOne a and\nActually will get to that and just a moment because right now we're joined by Tom Burnham and who was that the bucks at falcons game and he's joining us now Tom thank you how are you\nDoing fog is trying to navigate is Lana airport lock good luck with that\nAnd so we won't hold you along uh the Tampa Bay buccaneers they fall to the falcons damons Winston and the crew they tried to stay in this but this game was so needed by the falcons a steak and if they have any chance of making the playoffs\nOr they get a victory and go to the fore Matt Ryan had a game that you need from a guy's a former MVP a three fifty four three touchdowns what was the key to victory to you\nOr you know really fellow come a stop and think about it and with all the ... and with all the scoring that wound up in this game you know it's a play we all take for granted and the NFL in this day and age the extra point\nYep and Tampa Bay jumped out with the first touchdown to the game this extra points so now they're playing behind on that one point the rest of the game later in the game they have to go for two they fail on the two\nSo now you're basically taken two points off the board which means that final drive of the game rather than having to score it cuts down after the map Brian fifty seven yard field goal which was pardon my language it well no not even gonna say it it was one of the gutsy is caused by head\nCoach I've ever seen we got an ... year old metal out there you know I mean\nIt it was just unbelievable debates they attempted it knowing that if this\nAll Tampa Bay would need was a field goal to win the game\nBut I think that speaks volumes away or you know Dan Quayle probably feels about a deep unsafe interest status Tampa Bay the effects of at the bottom line is the falcons got to win but you but you asked once again if you don't miss that extra point\nYou don't have to try for two later and you have two extra points going into the final drive and they got close enough where if you go with one of the game for\nI mean let's talk about ... Winston are coming back after the suspension or he put a great numbers today comparable to memorize but the two glaring things is the interceptions especially young red zone turned over\nI mean is this has been something that's been hampering him since he's been in the league or you know what are your thoughts on his inability to make smart decisions in the red zone\nThey play down the medical field and you know sometimes those are going to happen to the other one was the one that you know I'm sure if you're Dirk cutter even if you're James when you're saying you know what what did I see yeah he had to open wide receivers uh he had a Humphries it about the five yard line or who's wide open\nHe throws it in a double covered ship the falcons player in the back pops in the air and they end up intercepting the ball in the ... but you know what I mean look you know like you know when since one of those guys where if you got him on your team and let's take all the off the field stuff away for a second but but he's always been going back to his Florida State days he's a gambler\nAnd he will take the shot at the big play a lot like Brett Farr will do back when he played and so far in one sense young career or they've heard it you know the only quote the only player in the league it's turned the ball over more than he has been stepping foot in the NFL is like ... now I Would add\nYou want to know what's funny is this is actually what I was while I was playing around with a bunch of buddies [noise]\nDJ while playing risk what you do yeah I didn't know that yeah that Arizona State last month [noise] oh yeah that\nMakes sense why you have you with some good too that I never heard right so I Do wish that guy DJ reconvene I go by DJ fetch tables [noise] do you really like ... and actually I got it all day I got [laughter]\nYou know like they may not be surprised how many kids in college asked me to describe it as a DJ though the ... well that's because they don't get to turn the tables and they don't get out there they just want an ox court and they didn't want to knock score is actively tired that money back to\nA great new there's a quick way you could say money's what's the guy go go to go to accommodate fussy Michigan State Fifteen Percent or more ...\nIn the Washington ... football Sunday and I want to get through a couple of things that are happening over the last five ten minutes or so they can Tom Burnham and joined us I'm\nCooper cup got a nice sketch got a first down and was brought down by a horse collar was carted off be permitted and it looks pretty bad and you played the game and even the U.S casual people who played in the back yard anybody who's been horse cholera dose\nAre there any casual people getting hoarse colored out there I don't know what your flight back yard football back in the\nDay it was brutal a not a lot of people getting hoarse covered it I didn't mean to some of the oil and condoned Ventura here it's okay you know what you know what I think Ron Barber would fill me on this maybe maybe not I'm not going to ask him though because if he doesn't um your parents [laughter] I'll ask him something else run everybody was on the cover the cardinals the Vikings what's going on right\nThere on let me he did a lot of people going horse color just in the neighborhood I Do ah now could you come into the studio and horse color [laughter] remember where to go okay\nBackyard football's over there do you play your number other nobody played football in the back yard we grew up in the city man and why in a bank or a donor so out of the backyard everybody well Alex play in the back yard just because you grew up playing on concrete\nSorry we were poor ideology grass in your life in film Iran day I mean I I probably got to go on the street to and wait for the cars to move [laughter] that's why you're crazy\nNow round apologize for that rod day Barbara joined us\nAgain Cardoza Vikings on the call there where the Vikings get back on track now get a wind twenty seven Seventeen um and and watching that game a couple of things I noticed there Kirk Cousins didn't look quite as sharp as he did the week before we're even in the last he made some big place\nBut Kirk Cousins you know he finds a way to get to get them would win but really comes from running games in ... like a he always talks about the attempted pitch count are passing out thirty tents from them is that going to be a way to victory for the Vikings\nAll yes Mike Zimmer that coast courses that he's the deepest because that's what he wants to do it to be honest with you you kind of feel there's like a little uh dissension within the ranks because John ... according to pass guy and he knows that he has great talent wanders you Adam dealing it something today with the with this six\nHundred dark catch a game in a row\n... Powell Rudolph guys can catch the ball those clay bakers but this is the team that you really do on running the football 'cause their head coach wonderful bumped claimed great defense ... we saw that today it was interesting because I came into this game thinking about their past first team because of all that skill but in reality\nYour password team because they've been behind and some of the game that they had to do it to chase the football game and they've had success and they just kept doing it that kind of became their identity\nBut today they had a little bit of lead early in the game and the tape just merge just what all I mean obviously it's not just him dealt with the wind was great today was I was trying to highlight a bunch of double team boxing gaping holes that he was running for um but I think that's what they want to be\nUm they can do that more especially as the seasons ... guys won't be able to on the ball with them for December I mean they they they could be that team that gets on a run here and it starts to do some some some nice thing\nYeah and we saw something from her cousin that we hadn't seen in the red zone when he took the read option and he kept the ball and the rebels would not even the way he's going to use these movement in how quick he was hit that whole\nAnd and ... right right I Want you to ... that's that's not his will house but he'd look really good and not only that the dance after yellow swag to write\nA little party how bad it hurts you you you guys know Kirk you talk to them like he's kind of a quirky little awkward kind of guy right that guy is trying to increase shoot himself to his team which is you can tell they love what he is he's the football players throw not demanding on the ... coordinator often than I Need to throw the ball\nFifty sixty times again that's that's not him at all he just wants to win a so so to see that play call first of all than him execute it is is often but when you run into football like they were running today and it gives you\nAnd they were on the role at that point I was there the first touchdown when the second half or will you know it was unexpected but I think the cardinals were caught on the unexpected you don't want to wear a he just kind of he just kind of tumbled in his ...\nHey Ron daylight run it helped me understand and you know obviously you had to watch them feel getting prepared for this game what has been going wrong for the Vikings obviously the defense of side was better today but the last few weeks later elected this ... the secretary that's the answer\nYep secondary when we talk to Mike Zimmer and I did was watching the film\nAs good as they are and as much talent is they have all on the fence they were really struggling and the secretary whether it was very way but it was whoever in coverage\nUm they were losing their match up or you know this team they play some man but there is don't team so teams like Los Angeles we're finding ways to get you know receivers messed up on ebony bar linebackers whatever it just running away from 'em so ... will really happen is\nYou know kind of what we saw today materialize they just went back to basic they didn't try to stop everything you know when you have a team to have that much how I got was line them up clay something simple went on for a second down and then you can create or\nAnything on third down that's that's what this team is a picnic solve return to that today and they are and then they dominated plate so so well of course it was against the rookie quarterback Josh was but um yeah they that this was the model this is a blueprint of what this looks like what\nHow how good is Adam Zealand land I mean ... to be the guy a receiver when when you look at him the land and what not only what he's doing this year but what he did last year how good is skew when we're the hell does he come from all\nThese you know he was a trial guy you know you think you could play football the way I can try out and you know he survived on special things for a couple of years got his opportunity like three years ago and even then I remember seeing him gone man it's it's kinda good but after that\nHow he does it I don't know but he has an understanding smart you please don't you know got to find his way in between you know those holes in in the coverage and he's got the trust of the quarterback I mean it is when they need to make a play\nOn days is that the spark plug right but when they need to make a play it's it's no question that Adam you on a and I think that relationship between those two is just it can't be stated that knock 'em and that's why he's succeeding an officer treated that way it is\nYeah this is crazy and you feel like it came out of the blue for sure Rene will get outta here on this one's going to go to the other side there was another team other than the Vikings and now we are new oh yeah there there was there when they had to please somebody like Josh Rose in a not a horrible game but not a great one either to forty\nOr did you have an interception talk about just rose and ... what did you see the good and bad with this kid\nWell he can make all the throw these big spiritual things look skinny because so call whatever but he he's a confident calm kid I mean I think you'll be really good guys to be honest with you\nI Know he's struggling learning curve Mike McCoys trying to find ways to utilize them um but he can throw the football there's there's no question about it there's some things that he called David probably haven't seen sparse pressure didn't struggle with early um they failed on third down all day long I I think they were overall\nThird out today and it's really kind of been their Achilles' heel 'cause they can't get going on for a second down and you get these long dark situation\nWhen you're playing a team like the Vikings that's what my memory is what's packages just has no chance with so many free runners coming at him that he wasn't going to succeed um but I Love law he'll he has\nUm that ability to be a leader when you sit down and talk to him so like unaffected by every day and I think that's one of the traits that make you know young quarterback good and ... has just gonna have to give them time their team that building with a lot of young players\nAre and they're all plan to get you know they got for playing off that uh\nYou're a victim going on it's still have some good players on the I think there'll be competitive in\nIran day we appreciate your joining us safe travels and I'm ...\nI'm careful in a airport mental good ... good luck over the over here yeah I Can't wait to get but I Know you can't [laughter]\nOr if they're not supposed to go quite yet that they ... they were ... ... are are there are some updates on these games you will get the next you got the rams Broncos you got the cowboys way right now gets jacks a and a ... first cup is trending ILO as a glowing from what's going on a brother\nRunning Fifteen times where you could say well of course you're going to lead you rush Fifteen times there was only like leading with eight Russia's seven Russia so they definitely have to find a way to become more explosive but I Will say this I Will say this about the Panthers\nOne of the reasons why I like them going in was because they're not necessarily sexy but\nThey always find ways to win more they're always in a game right even today they were in the game and they had a chance to win it when a candidate had the ball I mean any kind of over through the ball couple times in the end zone but they were still in it they did have a shot in a chance to win it and that's one of the reasons why I liked them is because typically\nIt seems like they don't get blown out the defense will keep 'em at it\nYou know Bill Bill ... I'll stay in and out fences enough they can score enough to have a chance to win it\nUm a couple of things I Want to get to when we come back just to quickly give you an update on some of the games that are happening are right now cowboys looking really good up Seventeen nothing on the jags unless that was a touchdown right they're alive was that a touchdown I just saw it was Kobe easily was his second touchdown reception nine yards customers stepson for him\nSo we haven't really heard from him much this season he's supposed to be the number one guy with the there's Brian showing it today with a couple of touchdowns a jak Prescott looking good and the jak supposed to be one of the better defensive teams getting lit up right now in the\nFirst [laughter]\nKitten lit up right now for sure lit up a fourteen and nothing or another game that's going on right now you have the ravens and are they are up right now or in and phone Tennessee which Tennessee\nOutside of the state of Tennessee you know talk about that said if you know our our watch them to work for that matter\nLike no one even knows who markets Murray oldies or anything like that they don't even know herbal\nIf their head coach who ... they just don't know you know\nThey it you're right about that man a grant to they're not under three and two they barely won those games but Thirteen it three the rams are up on Denver case gain I'm trying to show the team you should've let me go but it's not looking good right now uh but I have to ask you a question I Want you to answer this when we come back\nThere's a certain player certain quarterback who's been Harold as you've got to be the next great John Elway and it's been about six years and it may be time for us to pump the brakes on how good are how great he can

give what's going on with job growth and he's writers or number one the most glaring things defensively if they're not their inability to put pressure on the quarterback right today they have one sec what their last in the league and sex\nAnd John route and jokingly a couple of weeks ago said oh you know ...\nYou know alluding to to not having\n'em a little Mac anymore and and just trying to find the good pass rush you know he can laugh at often joke all they want the fact that they're in a position to where\nThey can't stop anyone they can't slow anyone down and if you can't do that then how can you expect your secondary to hold up and we're seeing that game after game\nIn all ... they just I meant they don't have it man they're they're so all of their cars taken you know study is looking more like David Carr [noise]\nYou know and I swear are are but I play with that you know drowned straight in the guard you know I I play with David and it is just not clicking for them and the fact that\nNone of this is bothering John Bruton because\nIf\nYou look up the definition of job security in the dictionary ... then there's a picture of John grown in his raiders had was a hundred million dollar check in his hand\nHundred million dollars no matter what that's what I just say no matter what you guys fire me think about this\nThing about this this is the first year of a ten year deal for a hundred million if he goes three years and when three games they still can't fire which is ...\nDon't have no guaranteed contracts except for the guaranteed\nMoney mhm yet a coach who was a good\nCoach for sure I mean he's had a heck of a career and it was a good it was a good coach right it it has had a heck of a career or you know not this season is guaranteed a hundred million dollars\nA guaranteed thirty million dollars if he's another culture guaranteed the ten million dollars if he's another coach wouldn't do do players ever get mad at that did you just it's just part of the games ...\nI'm not you know worried about that the fact that\nI'm I'm ... I Will be more\nWorried about the fact that he didn't want signed clue Matt Bai player if I'm In the locker room that's that those are the things that would bother me because I wouldn't know how much he meant to our team and if you focused on\nThe other things and not putting your best players on the on the field then that's a that's a concern for me as a as a player\nYou know but his money as his money it is what it is it doesn't count against a salary cap so it's not stopping him it's not stopping them from you know paying me or someone else they just decided they wanted to go on a different way other than a little Mac and he wasn't they deemed him not worth it\nWhich is it's crazy to me because we right away and pay dividends for the Chicago Bears although they lost a day you know ... he's revitalize that\nAbsolutely there that's a real team now you've got to go in there and you have to beat the bears to somebody you can say oh that should be an easy victory quickly I Do want to get some love to the sea hawks who do get the victory and I mentioned it Russell Wilson looking like he was a\nComing back last week you asked excess against ... votes to be one of the best defenses in the rams and emboldened to circle back to this week and all of a sudden again three touchdowns again for him and he and he's looking like the Russell Wilson that we know so\nMaybe the sea hawks are getting better and riding the ship as there are five hundred now it's six or three and three and the first six gay well I'll tell you if you look at their their stable\nThey now have the ability to really\nPush the temple and we saw that in London today against Oakland they came out and I believe there first when he plays Fifteen of those were runs ... and they said hey look we're going to rotate running backs we got three good running backs were going to rotate them\nOr we're going to use them in the past and game and what that does is that allows you're off into line that has been a sore spot for them for the last couple of years it allows them to be aggressive\nWhen I started a game I always wanted to start with runs because I didn't want to be passive and backing up I Want it to be aggressive and we saw that from them today so if they adopt that mentality moving forward there'll be much better and it'll take the pressure off of that are much maligned often to them on\nA ... to see how they get a victory again three and three on the season for them another team and this is your guy your fantasy man and somebody I guess that Bucky Brooks always gets frustrating when I talk about his seeing his greatness and that has been robbed his burger who's had a pretty good season I mean out of success as far as the W's at first\nI Know him and Antonio Brown add some you know the people were I think maybe us the media were making it bigger than it really was\nUm you know because we need things to talk about [laughter] but the fact is the last couple of weeks been an a B have gotten the job done and they got a job the job done literally they won the game because of that connection as they got a touchdown are now and went like this\nMy back cut you off guard out oh that was\nBeing robbed his burger talking about the ah the counters the running back okay so I Want to get to that just a minute but real quick with a B a B is starting to get an explosive forty a yard long reception the longest of the season was today he got the game winning touchdown he almost had one earlier he got tackled around the eight yard line\nHe's got to go on but here's what's funny is it even with Antonio Brown doing his thing juice\nTwenty four six sewing extra point is coming up here and that just a quick who gave you by the way in this game that Prescott has fallen out ... touchdowns through the air one on the ground and then end the rams are up twenty three owned the Broncos Broncos on the move trying to put\nSome points on the board odds when he's regained in that game talk girlie a hundred and thirty three Russian you know this is a rushing day he\nFrom I Know you love it for a couple of\nTouchdowns for time girlie in Baltimore I'm Twenty one to nothing on the non talked about what I'm saying it's all day the non talked about Tennessee Titans a house Collins has to rushing touchdowns for the ravens right now we're joined by Alex ... as we are each and every weekend Alex what's going on man how how was the wedding\nAt a wedding in San Francisco was absolutely fantastic of course the barriers other team the Oakland Raiders not so much\nMy goodness this is a bad club in Utah called Miller just could absolutely destroyed today by Frank Clark and listen Seattle it was a slow start for this team it didn't look at a time but they're starting to get some things going in a positive way on the offensive side of the football in particular rushing the ball right now again I Know what's the raiders I Know they are horrendous team\nAt this moment but I tell you I mean watch out for Seattle make it a little bit of a push here at least as far as the wild card race cars not going to say make a big of a challenge on the rams that are headed toward within that NFC West but Iran or the Seahawks appear to finally be headed in the right direction once again\nWe are and what direction or the raiders headed in what what are some of the things that they need to work on to to write this year because the thing is thinking that\nKnow ... I don't know what you can do on defense right now I really do I mean they're they're just they can generate any past rush you know when you boil it then you expose that secondary that isn't very good and it just seems that when you talk about a makeover of a team and the off\nSeason you know what I get it you know look their their players you look what's happening in Buffalo they got fifty three million dollars and and and that money on their salary cap right\nPoor job this off season putting the types of people in place\nTo to run the types of things that John crude and wants to run on both offense\nAnd defense it's pretty darn clear I don't know if there's any salvage ing where they're at right now the injuries of hits U.S team a little bit on the offensive side of the football you know losing both a mark Cooper today and suffer offers to concussions that was a rough go of it for them but it's going nowhere fast I guess the good news is if you're a raiders fan well if they pick high in this draft\nComing up we can finally get that pass Russia or could this team in the right direction but defense again\nIt may not be can Lomax though that's for sure Alex Marvin Marvin as on Twitter Syria's next ... minutes no radio where you hear him and of course you hear him all the time with us Alex and I mean we we had a debate before the break um the guys in the studio and the other side here was saying that hey you know maybe I'm Bill is probably going to come back and get all the carries and take all the ...\nYou know say hey man James is on a heck of a season so far especially for guys kind of came out of the blue\nAh what do you think that they're going to do this lady on bill is to come back this week\nI was thinking of what was the effectively I don't know I won't say split the carries for a bit and ... it's hard to keep them off the field but you know you feel good now after the spill is knowing we can take levy on bail out\nAnd maybe the third series of the game and that's a James Caan or series we can rotate these guys a little bit you know what lazy onto can provide a little bit more of an the passing game but where the ... but the weird part about it for Pittsburgh is\nAnd it's a good problem to have but they have to be careful humble ab on bell returns\nTo not disrupt the flow of this off and and and I say that because right now they're starting to hit on some things and they have found their their ... the guy that they had been missing since he'd Miller a tight and Vance McDonald he killed the Cincinnati Bengals today he was such a big reason as to why they won that contest he is really becoming a difference maker for them\nThat they haven't had an Jesse James ... is a is a good player not a great one prevents from Donald has served him as far as getting the targets in that office but the question is it brings back how you're going to distribute the football can you get back in that flow again\nYeah they're they're not a good secondary ... bin ... burger the ability to spread the ball around them is\nTo do one of the best in league at doing that he hid eleven different received very drew the ball ... eleven different receivers including himself today you know just having that ability to\nTo not only you know hand the ball off to a to a counter now live you know bill moving forward but his ability to get the ball to the right guy in the passing game how important is that\nAll I mean he's fantastic and and look he's got it from everybody right Antonio Brown I mean he was quiet throughout the game\nThen he comes on strongly you got it you know Judy Smith Schuster has been one of the great additions to the team as a second round pick I mentioned Vance McDonalds you know James Connor had his today and look we never talk about the stores are offensive line right they just quietly go out there a week after week generally protect office burger do their job and pave the way\nFor one hundred yard Russia I mean that and you know you get in for the Bengals today it's devastating you know it's the same old same old for you at your seven straight loss of the Pittsburgh Steelers they haven't beating them at home and since two thousand and Thirteen\nAnd the question is well here we go again is at Cincinnati that is going to get maybe maybe there are nine and seven ten and sixteen but when it comes to winning the division when it comes to getting past distillers they just can't get it done\nA lot more of as our guests Alex I Want to go to a game and the AFC ah with the jets and the colds you got two quarterbacks one who are we talking about a little bit earlier and Andrew Luck where everybody knows each towns and everyone knows how good he is but it just hasn't been the success with the costs that you would hope for and then on the other side you have this young rookie quarterback\nWho was able to have a good game today he throws twenty four thirty two eighty couple a touchdown when pigs\nUm how good as Sam Donaldson and just kind of gave me or you know through six games\nYou're ah how you feel about him and going forward to maybe a grade\nOn the jets up in my mind I'm given the jets today because I thought they were the worst even football coming into the sea\nSide of the football and defensively they they have their issues but they've played a lot better than I thought defensively Todd Bowles now having to take an active role in the defense let's not forget because Casey Rogers or defensive coordinators are battling a serious illness oh Todd really you know the reason he's the head coach in this league it's largely because of his success\nAs a defensive coordinator so we've done some real positive work there but you know what's benefited Donald ... is the fact that they've stayed relatively healthy at the wide receiver position Robbie Anderson is a truly great deep threat\nAnd what what he said a couple of weeks ago I thought was interesting as well and by the way I don't forget the emergence of ours their ... running back with Sam Donald told the media look I got to stop hesitating I've got to pull the trigger I've got to make sure that that what I'm\nSeeing on film and then when I see it in the game I have to trust my instincts and you can just tell that he's playing a lot more loosely right now isn't as you know hesitant to maybe throw the football as he was in the past and he's not making big mistake and I look\nThe jets haven't played world beating teams by any means here in the culture just absolutely disastrous on defense giving up thirty something plus points again that being said though the stress team has been impressive for what they've done and maybe just maybe can stick around in this postseason race to about December\nWhen what's going on over here in in in Indianapolis with Andrew Luck I mean is it is it too much to ask you to have him throwing the ball this many times you just can't get anything going into the lack of weapons the lack of ingenuity in the play calling what can we do please ...\n... C ... there's a this is the fortieth different starting off into line that he's played behind today NFL career\nForty ... okay\nI think they realized that maybe with some of these guys it's just better to just pass because they can't field a credible running game but but they they don't have a marquee guy in that backfield Marlon Mac you know I Believe he played today but he's been battling a hamstring injury all season and even with Marlon ... sort of a you know he's not at that march ... type level I don't think anyone can expect that type of production\nSteven give you a chance every week I don't put this on Andrew Luck I really I put it on a roster that you know of course followed inherited that he's still trying to make right I think the coaching his outstanding I think they're going to be good in time but they simply don't have enough pieces in place\nAt this point to be a credible contender and the AFC South and by the way the Houston Texans better be sending a nice group basket or you know over two or any sort of a gratitude over\nTo the Indianapolis Colts a by the way at the end of the year because of the courts just gone for not going forward in overtime a couple of weeks ago played for the tie you're looking at a Texans team that has cooled off considerably rather than one that has now won three straight games\nAnd it's pushing Indianapolis to oblivion and the division race\n... that's a great point right there but they get it it was an ugly victory as I think Jay Jay watch we did like basically it's ugly but hey we'll take the wind or they'll definitely do that Alex we appreciate it thank you man I Know I'm sure you're still in the enjoying some ah some wedding desserts and what not\nThis is sick and San Francisco such a great place where I got about six hours to kill before uh before my flight takes off I didn't want to miss the games today I think I'll find some stuff to do here in fact\nI think you'll be fine up in the bay area that's for sure thank you talk to you next week go to a voter Mitchell brothers mature but I don't know what that is but the way you laughed I'm nervous what does Mr brothers I had to family no family place right now I'm gonna take your word for that\nNow here's the thing what am I literally take your word that the next time I go to San Francisco he's got a million of joy and I'm with the wife your oh shoot I should have a ball and Mitchell brothers should have a ball I got to do some Googling I have a coup in my mind what that is\nAnd in in Michael Jordan work\nMyriad that's and that's how I like my basketball players that just the fact\nThat we didn't get everything else that Ronda is not that way they look right we would go to the break I'm not I'm not I'm not doubting\nHis greatness he's the second graders bass\nYou said many through euro Kobe's twenty two on the run of the question but when you say wait a second best player I'll be right with that strategy took an X. box or the radio [noise]\nLady MLD can't be in theory goes off [noise]\nYour social media home they always say [noise]\nFollow us on Twitter during the October Matt this is an easy anymore when that\nSports radio\nA sports fans football season's here and it's time to get in on the action with my ...

have this team ready to go a ready to play up in the elements the altitudes usually wears down on you but they are you know they definitely have their boots on on\nYou know the Broncos neck right now and they're headed into the score now it's a fourth and go inside the five sort of settle for the feel go boy that's an accomplishment to come up to Denver\nOr who's in the door is Lee had the best home record\nOr in the lead them in Green Bay in to to to just dominate like they are\nIt credit the Broncos were hanging around you know staying around me I mean there are only down seven obviously this this bill go looks like because he is that you mentioned that like the five yard line they should be good I Would have some reason he was the miss this I mean they they got a chance during this game but I mean how would you approach\nBeing there as a what I mean I Know it's virtually impossible\nWell you know if you can do this we're taking the\nQuarterback they given up five sex a so far so if if it's anything but guess what when they can hold up in the past and game they have the luxury of the beast to hand the ball off to the takes the pressure\nOff of that often to the line now you can play action you can do all sorts of things so\nIt's it's really like hey we can't protect the quarterback too bad\nWell we don't want them throwing the ball a bunch anyway so it it's kinda like\nYou know if you want to stack the box if you had to stop the run then of course you're going to have you know Brennan cooks and um the rest of those weapons that they have in woods in\n... it's just it's Cooper cup is just too many weapons\nAre speaking of too many weapons my goodness the score has gotten out of line that Dallas Cowboys up forty seven over Jacksonville I mean there's been turnovers galore\nMe that this has been a dominating game for doubts and by the way all of a sudden they go to three to three after this game get a victory I mean and you look the Redskins are leading the division three into but then fill a stranger in Dallas all of a sudden is right back in this thing and they want it on the division so\nUh the cowboys it's not been a great season it hasn't been a season at you you you know look forward to but all of a sudden they're five hundred and and kind of can maybe shake it off and reset and say All right let's let's go there the next ten weeks here and finish the seasons strong\nThe problem with the ... they just don't have any talent on the outside so don't disrespect called I'm not into fantasy ticker okay oh no you got a couple of tests do that so that's one guy [laughter] yeah but uh I don't even know how that below average a receiver or in terms of height in stature\nGreat in the slot as a bubble sitting up here to there and ... and into my\nAnd receiver I'm white and\nYou go away for a while [laughter]\nAs a cowboys fan I can actually say you're going to wait for a while\nI mean think about this Kobe easy has nine reception no other person has more than two ... there's not going to work it's not going to work right now big jumped on Jacksonville so Jacksonville is kind of ... but if you're in a fight in you're in a match up and they take Coby easily away from you\n... what are we doing what what are you going to do\nWell for the seven game a few more minutes left in that game and Broncos is trying to score by the way I feel it was good to that put the rams up twenty three to Thirteen again but under just under three minutes left\nOr the Broncos and this is what they just showed him on the uh on the television and dynamic ensue and this is when Aaron Donald endemic is ... years back and get busy and as I say that\nYou almost got their nice flip from K. skiing but this is where they do what they do rockers sue Donald they get after the quarterback and then they take care of business and it's usually make a game winning play or expect to see that from them\nAnd that again is going right now Twenty one and nothing ravens just dominating the titans not a great game for the ... when I look at this or what to talk about passing\nA hundred and Seventeen years for Mario that but if you take away the sixty two from sex I mean and the fifty five and the sex you only have sixty two yards passing\nWhich by the way you feel like that should be taken away from the rush\nNo sex no because you you can't get a sec if someone's running the board or in the garage running backwards and you know now that doesn't work like that and then\nLook at the ... the rushing as well they only have forty nine yards so if you take away the ... fifty five yards from the sex that's sixty two passing forty nine rushing\nThat's a horrible game\nIs not going to get it done is is not going to get it done and you know the titans are three into and they're Scrabble\nYou get behind it's hard for them to catch up 'cause they don't have the type of off in a or a personnel to where they can air the ball out and you know get large chunks of yard is through the air\nSo at that being said Marquez Mario to ... he's been injured but he's had some success and the league he's had some games where you go okay is kicking play and then he's got some games where again he's not effective like today where do you come out on markets Mario to a few season you know three four seasons and now\nI'm I I think is inconsistent some game last week he had a tremendous game came out through the ball around\nBut then you look at this week and it's just like the whole cage so which guy are we there are two weeks ago or against Philly which they want an overtime he uh was thirty or forty three attempts three hundred and forty four yards and then you look at this game and it's just like okay well you\nAt it a shot at he skirted on the ground that you help in the air then you have a chance at a ... a recovering team to run the underneath it\nSo ah just to kind of give it to you how it's just I played out the kicker did a little move switch sides a little ... little dance and then a kicked it but Robert Woods almost caught with any ... so the game is essentially\nOver now uh as the rams well hold on the representing some I don't know what he's saying\nAnybody noticed that I Know it is cold out here a value of running a law on your own out so we were just they weren't going to play the game because you don't want nobody here\nSo I don't know what they called a\nOh it's over it's over ... formation for the rams great game by the Broncos they hung around but they're going to follow the two and four and the ... will go to six you know as they want twenty three to twenty over the Broncos and I'm telling you as you mentioned this team as I say you don't have to tell you that they remind me of I mentioned this a couple of weeks ago when they were playing was the\nUh ... there was a Ninety eight Minnesota Vikings remember that team yeah of course you remember that you know of course\nYou know they they were a powerful often you know but they just ran into a better total team did I say about a month for that day I don't know if I agree with better team I think you're going to better that day I mean ... we had a bit of the [laughter]\nThe better team okay well we had two thousand yard receivers we also had\nA ... Eighteen hundred and forty six yard running back ... your dirty birds got down so we also had the number two defense in the league there was a lot going on though when I say we had a better team\nYeah Randy Moss was the best young white out on the planet that was special when he ... he had one catching the\nSecond half for seven yards so like I said we had a better team [laughter]\nYou got down to the lady like that you don't try to play me guys got down there I expected to run to last a little longer\nIt will fell off literally live Jamal Anderson's wheel fell off\nI mean he was ...\nWho are better come out of the blue tie or like a emergence him or nature on means we're out of the blue you're like whoa this is special\nTeam gets going on was pretty good in Germany it was pretty good but your mall because we all had personality to go where they started a crazed the dirty birds so we had shirts and dances and all kinds of stuff that was a that was a movement\nThat was a move it it it wasn't along movement\nBut it was a move sometimes movements don't have to be alone you know for them to be impactful\nAre like they're they're showing it right now Josh Alan I'm left with an elbow injury when it's throwing arm and answer Nathan how am I in the NFL Peter my hope you had a stats that we were going over during the ... it's hard to lease share with the people ... and Peter ...\nSo is he and his two year career\nThey saw here the average pass of four point one yard they suck he has two touchdowns in seven interceptions they suck\nSo I ask you and I don't want to make this a big you know collusion case and they're trying to keep my beliefs but there is no way by now somebody doesn't Cook County right not only making about the driving and I was\nThere you you can't put this kid out there again if if something happened the judge telling you can't he can't\nGo out there's quarterback no 'cause they're all bill fans will be riding in right shouldn't all bills fans be like saying this is not an option but this is ridiculous but he can't do it you know he he's proven that he can't do it\nRight so it's not a knock on him personally\nI'm just saying like it's just too big for him\nBecause he doesn't have back against what he was ... he was in ... going\nTo win this game like he ... the one thing you couldn't do was turned the ball over what he did it twice back to back not only the first time we turned it over for just down the what I was like what\nHe does that though as you mentioned that that's what he does he can't go he so I just actually\nAgain I don't want to make it a long conversation about it it just boggles me there's no way that you're saying\nI Need a quarterback I Need it back we see things happen guys get injured guy guys get hurt if you're in San Francisco as we are talking about earlier I think that was lead I mentioned that the San Francisco or give common cabernet because a man that we need a backup quarterback or maybe even a potential started but are there even if you took\n... there has to be some other quarterback options out there are other than they\nI just look at it like this when you look at it as just the last two years at that\nThe speed in the NFL as especially defensive wise is so much greater than in college so those roles as a quarterback\nIn college that you made and you made him look easy and they were terrific\nThey'll never work in the NFL guys are way too smart\nAnd way too fast and I think that's the whole he's in he's trying to guide the ball into places where defensive backs in line beggars can see it a mile away you can't do that you can't\nThrow someone open in a small\nWindow if you don't have that type of velocity on the ball\nWhich he doesn't he does not we we definitely have seen that so I mean I just figured out to be somebody else out there um hey do you I I mean I could throw an alley to the other teams and they all live and just say hey here you all you want this goes Gore six he's had\nA total of\nSix who let me see sixty one uh let me see how many passing attempts he's had in his\nHis brief history for his brief NFL career\nAnd think sixty seven passing attempts you can do that you you can you can be better\n[laughter] I feel like I almost got out or maybe just a bunch of ... but I feel like there would\nBe a chance for me to do that yeah he's twenty nine for sixty seven for two hundred and Seventy six yards you can probably\nMore than forty three percent of your past and scanned as his off but I don't want ... I don't want to talk about him like that I just you know from a professional standpoint he's not the quarterback for you buffalo no matter what's going on with\nWith um I was just watching it that was all they ever got in there yeah\nIt was pretty decent better than most of the tips that you see hey again when it gets real quickly before we get to a trendy a and that is the charges man and for those who are just not listening are just joining show first off we appreciate it thank you\nUm but the Cleveland Browns we had been saying that this is a team that can be five in August the team that had a you know some fluke plays\nThat result in last we had that ... that would have won the game they had even the NFL admitting that a play was they had the wrong call it a play so you felt confident about the browns going into it that maybe they had a chance against the high pulled an office of Los Angeles chargers and that's not the case man the chargers\nI think if you did like some similar to have a power ranking I mean they are to be top five right I mean they are now at four and two thirty eight fourteen victory of the browns are and they didn't have to be all on the right arm of Philip Rivers you only through\nTwenty attempts Gordon it was all Melvin Gordon a day for you to be a hundred and thirty two yards three touchdowns and not to mention Melvin Gordon coming out of backfill catching as well a couple of catches for Eighteen yard so they they had they had a game offensively became offensive that is and all of a sudden now may start to look at the chargers who's the better team in the AFC\nWho it was a good question um I mean the the patriots ... radio they're going to need to read what talked to will in a moment of course you have the Kansas City chiefs yep outside of them but we know are better than that they that that's the one team that is the ... and ... so and I'm Better than\nJust a year but nobody's believing in the dolphins even though they're four and nobody's moon was on the other ones but you know what I Will say this the return to broadcast Wyler\nThis could be this could be something different now as as bad as broadcasts ... he is you see but all of it was did you see he threw three are past their hair or eighty are doing in Iraq I swallowed airing it it didn't matter\nI'm the retailers and like two hundred and something other yards were just little dogs that were turned up field doesn't matter but they are for to be our foreign to I'll give them credit for that but I took charge do with the dolphins yes I Will any day I'm going to trust the rivers over many day here we did was still lives there he mentioned this deal as we\nAre of course as soon as others do it but I mean the charges right now I'm at its it's difficult to stop them and you mentioned it I think the key ingredient is Melvin Gordon yes you do that I mean they had\nA couple of guys being back over the last few years what else he was gone you know they had a daddy would had a couple of hours at a multi layered running backs bill but now ... Gordon as you're going to your your belt cow is definitely been beneficial for them for sure I right now is get the training with Ilo Ilo talked to his brother\nYou know 'cause everybody we were talking about the other quarterbacks within that people were not bringing up patch homes Kagan throw the ball man when they got rid of the Alex Smith ... I was like wait whoa they want\nTo go down with him in the game last year but Alex is having a phenomenal year so the decision had already been made\nLike they were going to get this kid on the field and rightly so we're seeing everything that they saw in practice when they brought him in so I mean this kid is is phenomenal\nHe must be when you were talking about earlier the tears of quarterbacks mhm and you said Alex Smith is like that that chair below the you know there are Rogers breeze in in branch here so for him to get rid of the thing about that they got rid of a top second tier guy for a twenty two at the time now twenty three year old that's\nGreat and it's paying dividends for sure they're one of the only two undefeated teams in the league and this is gonna be a great game I Can't wait I Can't wait\nShe'll be a bunch of fun and I got to start going the cheesecake factory's menu because you know how big it is it'll take me to next week to actually know what I Want\n... who I mean there is there a bigger menu maybe our house Yon also has a\nBig one is ... has a bigger ...
