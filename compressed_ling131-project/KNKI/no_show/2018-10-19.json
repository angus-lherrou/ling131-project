it with how how all of them ... and it's their right to do with their business\nIt is but when you can control the narrative and the narrative inside of this business is only one sided and the fear of

sick and tired of it and there is the intellectual dark Web that's out there if people that are talking about the people that are on the left in the right who are\nSick and tired of of seeing the way that these things are being handled\nAnd just looking at the way the hate speech policy is implemented like on on the platform you know you can't even have conversations about that policy inside of

point seven\nI'm Jon Benet Jon Benet show\nMy colleagues Sebastian Gorka Fox News and the author of the new why we fight\nTo comment on a ...\nA gossipy anecdote that we had late this afternoon from Bloomberg News and others repeated it that there were strong words exchanged in the White House and it leaked earshot of journalists around the oval office between the national security adviser John Bolton\nA longtime friend of the show and John Kelly the chief of staff a and a former marine general strong words and the subject was\nThe question of the onslaught that's the president's words of migrants headed to the border you've seen the photographs or you've seen the video we have this report from the wall Street Journal late in the day after all of this anecdote about both ... and Kelly exchanging strong words\nPresident Trump is elevating the issue of immigration rights Alex leery of the journal which drove is twenty sixteen campaign with the aim of animating Republican voters in a midterm election that threatens to direct\nA lot in quotes of migrants reaching the southern us border with Mexico and threatened to deploy the military did Mr Trump if the caravan isn't stopped except this is certainly national security and John Bolton is the national security adviser John Kelly was homeland security secretary before the president asked him to be chief of staff\nI can I can imagine the real story here is much more fun than just strong words but we'll leave it at that\nThe demonstration on the border right now looks like a provocation\nThese people marching from well a hundred and sixty of them started out in Central America and they picked up a they've picked up fellow travelers along the way it looks like a provocation and if I were to get to this benefits it's some version of the Democratic party's idea of open borders\nThe question I have for you because you were on the campaign and sixteen is this\nA motivator for Republican votes in twenty eight teams because it certainly wasn't sixteen\nNot only is it that motivated drawn this was the platform on which the the man who won the election for the presidency built his whole campaign let let's you know wind the video tape back a little bit the first senator\nTo endorse candidates from was none other than the current attorney general Jeff Sessions and that that event when he put on the red hat\nWhat was the what was the subject of rally\nThe wool illegal immigration that's where it all began people always gravitate to the moment when he came down the escalator and Trump Tower but substantively when it comes to policy it is immigration reform and securing our borders which began the whole Trump effects of course this\nThis comes at a very good time for the Republican policy you know the videos that are not going viral on social media of uh\nWell I wasn't sure what they were being handed but it certainly was a clear that they were eager to get whatever they were handing out\nRight so this this you know that this will be used by some Packwood superPAC as we get that they count down from what is it the Nineteen or Eighteen we have left so again this is you are absolutely correct a national security issue and it should be couch this such an let's not\nForget also the speech\nThat the other presidential candidates have\nTrade group of bankers that was leaked to the press and anybody that listen to your show John can download the transcript which Hillary Clinton\nTold the audience my dream my objective is to have a water this hemisphere meaning from Canada to South America no national borders at that point you know as well as anybody else\nAmerica as a concept ceases to exist and this is a policy platform issue that will be used by the joke ... and to the president's benefit\nIs a nice details on the wall to Wall Street journal\nSome vulnerable Democrats are using the issue as well Senator Joe Donnelly who's running for reelection in Indiana has run advertisements promoting his support for Mr Trump on immigration including building a border wall while taking a shot at quote radical left over calls to abolish ice so\nIf a vulnerable Democrat in Indiana is worried about the as I can imagine the vulnerable Democrats in other red states are worried about this time but I'm ... this is the Senate but that would also mean that vulnerable Republicans\nIn suburban districts that Democrats have targeted would cut can use this issue to bolster themselves\nI think it's incredibly effective irrespective of geography or who's running\nDo you lock your front door if you do is it because you hate everybody outside\nNo because you wish to protect everything that you love inside your and America is the home\nAnd its border is its front door and the idea that we will not controlled who enters our hope is of course on these ethical counter intuitive to most Americans at all so it is a very simple\n... matter of old a matter of fact that the individual who has the leak rights to decide on who comes into this country and by which y'all to measure is the incumbent president\nThis is not a hot argument to make for any politics should in any district of the United states\nSebastian Gorka the national security strategist for Fox News he's the author of the new book gestation why we fight I'm John bachelor this is the John bachelor show\n\n\n\nSons and I'm

the case or people's passions persuading them that there there are these other issues to key on\nIt's a it's complex but I think it's still you know four percent economic growth and record near record on them a little warm climate but the only danger and that is that when people are doing very well they have the leisure the complacency\nThat to to look at hot button social cultural issue and that's what the Democrats are counting on that this can be a referendum on the cruelty of Donald Trump but I think you're seeing with Mexico that\nFor all of Obama's I'm Melissa ... of a ... and international is when people didn't have any respect for them and people are starting to sense that Obama would have never gotten Mexico to even do anything on on its own border but whatever they think of Trump\nPeople abroad tend to listen to him more than Obama not starting to get clear in these last two years and I think that helps Trump and he's considered\nA strong leader and people when I mean there is no alternative John when you see these people coming forward and they're saying I'm going to be in the United states and six or seven days and you can't stop me and if we can't stop and then we don't have a country anymore so most people are saying to themselves\nWell I don't like to separate families but if they're coming and they're so or ... days just to say that we don't have the guts or the willpower the spiritual confidence to stop them\nMore than ... and if they are right then we don't have a country anymore\nScratching on the doors of the Supreme Court or people crashing the border it's law versus law all of us\nAnd I'm here to for that's always favored the party in power the question here is are the polls are telling us that the house\nIs not is not an overwhelming success for the Democrats but it is to excess and the Democrats and it all the polls are also telling us that the Republicans will enjoy the majority in the Senate and will increase the majority in the Senate is that enough Victor to hold the Senate for the presidential election and twenty Twenty one Trump can go and ...\nIt's hard to know but I I'm not convinced shut the ... they're going to lose the house I Know that historically the in party loses seats\nBut that but the law for the seat is often the ... on whether that's going to lose the entire house when you actually asked the question rephrase it does the ... party lose control of the house rather than just lose a lot of seats\n'em and change the the the the political nature of the house then that's not as common it's only three or four times\nSo I think they can lose twenty seats and that would be historically in line with what usually happens but not necessarily lose the house because things are changing and usually when you see an abrupt change it doesn't rode it gets more intensive and I think that Kavanaugh and the aftermath of the\nAnd ... lives with Warren and the caravan they all have a force multiplying effect the saying this is not the Democratic party your representative whether you like him or not is now\nA you know ... in service to the\nThis new Neal socialist progressive movement and he won't have a choice and you better understand if you vote for a Democrat evil and keeps the president they get control the house they will investigate Republican House members they'll call off these investigations and that just the way it is and I think a lot of people either not vote\nBut in the sixty six I Believe it's sixty six battleground districts\nWhere the Republican representative ... is in a district one by Mrs Clinton and the twenty sixteen and those sixty six districts the generic is nowhere near as a separated as it is generally in the country\nYeah I agree with that and and I think that again these trends are starting to attempt I live on a conjunction of three districts\nAnd they're all to Republican one Democrat and the two Republicans won ... going to get

is ...\nYou can't get away with a with a slap on the rats I think it would be a mistake or a grave mistake if the United states kind of a participated in a Saturday cover up um if it's true as there

sinister nature of the bad actors is that they hide in front of large nation states in this case we're looking at it has a law and Brazil Malcolm us to question it's yours\n[noise] yes first book good to talk to chose to begin a what do you think about the arrest of a sudden Barakat who is a key come because well I've been in fear and what do you think the likelihood that we can actually affect the way to extradition to the United states\nWell that that's actually the second question that you really really in a poor woman to get to that but\nIf we can actually get into the United states to be very important as well I think honestly the most important for Argentina\nBecause the Barakat clan in in South America it's an old Lebanese clan that's tied to Hezbollah that's been financing not just a elicit narcotics and things like that but the middle and finding the terrorist operation including the army attack in Nineteen Ninety four which is why the Argentine government\nShould talk to them first um so yeah what are the chances that they're going to extradite him to the United states\nA lot of us persons that we'd have to charge him with something you hear in the United states them you know if it's money laundering or something but I'm pretty sure there's there's something that we can charge him with but I think that you're not going to see anything like that happened after the election in Brazil or because I think we're going to see how the political makeup his in Brazil and then see if there's\nA time the opportunity to do to do so uh so I'm not sure that's going to happen but I think this is a great kind of a a symptom of the successes that we've been having a more recently because they think you know the Trump diminishes trope administration taking a complete it\nTo be much stronger on that even though it's not very vocal about it they'd been very strong about looking at the tear finance networks all throughout the world and particularly in South America would they've they they've looked at ... very strongly in and try to work with a regional governments to go after him\nLet's say in Brazil I'm reading the economist about Brazil there's an exciting election there in which a man who's described as a far right populist\nWho managed to I was stabbed in the ... the stomach during a rally is now leading contenders are he seems to be from the column of none of the above I don't know how to say his name correctly in Portuguese all said Bolsa narrow you know he is he is he going to be a help\nDisrupting the protection of bad actors or a hindrance because he's a ... you\nKnow I think he's going to be a tremendous help he he comes from that an establishment\nTrump he he would that non establishment candidate he has a bit of a military background but not much of a political background\nYeah he was that X factor no nobody really expected him to do much in the presidential race at the beginning of the ... of the election season but now he became the front runner\nAny any looking like he may may win on October twenty fifth when they when they go to the polls ... it'll be a close election and the first round which was more candidates now is just him and a guy named Daniel had that and and so I I Do expect him to win I think he went and if he does\nAh he's very close to two religious communities including the image eloquent Jewish community he's close to the military and he goes to other elements I think they have direction only correct\nOn who's the bad actors in South America particularly Brazil and I I I think he will be a tremendous ally if he gets elected\nMalcolm a designated this week the ... as a top transnational criminal organizations\nGiving more resources to targeting the ... and the drug cranking activities racketeering et cetera and what was little notice is that this apartment of justice created a subcommittee\nOn Lebanese Hezbollah and now has Ninety Days to get specific recommendations how to disrupt and dismantle ... allows transnational organized networks so what do you believe are the most pressing items that they can do how do they prioritizes and how will the administration back this\nThis is I'm Glad you mentioned it's not what this is a a you know with all the things are happening in the world and and here in the U.S as well this is very and use that and that really didn't get a lot of attention but very quietly tests that she's announce something that's a major move for those there in the ... community\nHe put one of the biggest terrorist groups in the world has bullet Lebanese Hezbollah he put it in the category of a transnational criminal organizations\nAnd he would among the most important national organization that this country's facing because they're tied right next to the three biggest cartels in Mexico that set the the\nTomorrow's Asian now what does that do in Latin America that gives Latin America much more authority much more priorities to put has blend in different categories that they still struggling Latin America understand terrorism particularly Islamic terrorism but they understand transnational criminal organized crime because they deal with it every day\nSo this allows has led to get a more of a priority among a regional governments what do I think they should do I think this sub committee this on his blood in foreign within the department of justice led by a bedroom prosecutor named ...\nI think that they should focus a lot of cases that currently exist\nThat are already on the docket of Hezbollah members whether involved in trafficking money laundering counterfeiting or even some terror related cases like the one I'm involved with in Peru of with Mohammed della palm dark and put all the way the department of justice to prosecute these cases and get successful conviction because they can get a quick when there's a lot of things are already on the docket\nIn in different courts in Latin American power lie in Peru in uh in Panama and Colombia and and so I think this is where the priority needs to be a right now\nI Know John Venezuela 'cause we just have a minute justice stir Venezuela increasingly under the boot of the Cuban security services does that enhanced Iran's presidents that Cuba is a is to strengthen the of the dictatorship does I Do have an in Tehran work together\nYeah Cuba is part of the alliance in just like the United states has defied by England and New Zealand in Australia and Canada they are they have their own five I which is you know Iran Russia Syria China North Korea and they communicate a quite a bit including with Cuba human intelligence is very much involved in that and that intelligence alliance\nBut ah yeah they're very much so like you're talking about Venezuela to one of the there's an important case headed back to ... as well in Colombia there's a gentleman named Alex ... who is a front man for a president Nicolas Maduro who the Lebanese Colombian who works with

[noise]\nI ... it's very controversial in Egypt to have foreign forces have an actual permanent basing our basing\nA arrangements in in Egypt but there is after you know thirty five almost forty years of relations with the United states there is a kind of wistful romanticize Asian of the Soviet period in Egypt\nAnd there is a natural place for the Egyptians to want to play the great powers off of each other to extract as much as possible from these great powers so [laughter] um I there is a there's a genuine interest in developing a relationship with the with the with the Russian Federation at the expense of the relationship with the United states we've seen that the problem\nThat many of our allies or so called allies in the middle east today face our economic problems you cited it before seem in Saudi Arabia\nAnd imprison people taking their uh their goods their their assets um in Egypt where the economic problems are are chronic but also in Turkey and we saw hundreds of thousands of

purge that has effects\nEh included with those who have been purged or detained or a jail pending trial we're talking about large numbers of people\nWhat it says done has sent a chilling effect through the business community which has now um moved assets outside the country but also kept their heads down\nSo uh I think that everyone has has cowed and intimidated the business community\nTo the extent that um they will told his line but protect their assets all at the same time it's extremely difficult to imagine the kind of dynamism that you had in the Turkish economy in the mid to thousands for example under a ... a under circumstances where\nEveryone is essentially leads a a an elected autocracy and the and the kind of repression that continues but the business community says that do will continue to Seoul drawn but it's it's not it's not the same as it was when things were more open in in Turkey\nIn the province it has not been in the news because of the Saudi Arabia

war in this country between the left and right\nI used to say I'm not a violent civil war but I have to what's been happening the last year or so I'm I'm not sure that's true and uh I I think it's going to get worse especially if we talked about this last night especially if the Republicans keep the house\nBecause the Democrats left the liberal media almost all the same thing they're convinced that going to win the house and at least take back ... one part of Congress and if they don't I I Can't imagine what the reaction is going to be\nOn Tuesday Morning I talked about the great job that President Trump is doing and of course the unbelievable anger towards him by the resistance right they even around that coined that phrase right away the resistance like yours is the Nazi Germany or something or fascism and of course that's what they believe\nAnd I also asked you who would be your favorite choice to get the Democratic nomination for president and who would you agree to have coffee with on the other side side by the way that was a sign that many of us ... uh troubles choosing someone that's pretty bad at it wasn't always that case\nI chose personally I chose Bernie Sanders because I thought he seems to me like he might be a pleasant fellow\nActually I'm ahead of what's her name of ... see I always say the wrong and what's her name\nOr ... something Cortez yeah Cortez she doesn't even ... and the latest news says that they asked her about whether they would support whether she would support the Bernie for the presidential nomination and said oh we'll have to

tonight 'cause that's becoming a this morning much more of a problem we ah we have a guest thought about that uh you know they're coming from Honduras to talk about\nUm ... you know that as they travel through the different countries there's some news tonight that Mexico's made some arrangements with the United states to if they don't have a passport or whatever they're going to stop them or send them back or something ah and of course President Trump has threatened to close the border\nI Do you think for a second I Would tell them about my other career life I Would have been the end of

what's happening in this country\nAnd that's why I said the first nice I I think we're entering a civil war and this is so strong this is so big for some\nPeople that the they don't want to accept it let's go to David in let's see if I can see that now ... New Jersey yeah I Can't see that\nYou and your you might call and really the People's Republic of New Jersey my uh brother in law is a political he does not vote and my sister does and my brother in law my sister or at a family function with my very left wing and\nAnd she mentioned it for my brother in law essentially said um how do you think about the Trump tax cuts because she's the numbers guy and my aunt just who is very well to do is one absolutely bonkers ... try to intervene in essentially\nDown but it's I I Will say this I felt as seriously as the left does back when as far as I'm concerned the miniature and candidate Bill Clinton\nWas elected in Ninety two and when Obama got elected I said you know I I did my tongue that I didn't say to my aunts and my bleeding heart cause in the semi as far as I'm concerned communist article I didn't say I'm not going to talk to anymore I just\nI think they know how I feel as I Know they do but\nThe reality is we are as the last caller just said we are American citizens we ought to be grateful I've seen the real world is a former navy guy and it ain't pretty the real world is a very dangerous place in America is the only batch and a free and I'm\nDavid ... thanks for your service or you know among jumble but that kind of yeah thank you very much\nBut it is amazing that the other side oh here's a thought I don't want to lose you better never knew what a Thanksgiving or any place we're getting together because I Am a strong feeling that's the end of Thanksgiving right you never want to do that and family functions so I think\nOn our side we we have to accept them for who they are going\nWell ...

my my answer that we're going to talk to you guys I mean that to me to me I Hope most Americans and most of the American people view that as being a mature than stupid\nAnd there is going to be a long term repercussions for it and I I wanted to ask you a question if I could I Know you get\nYour time is pretty sure the well in the\nPeople's Republic of New Jersey as in other states like the left coast when there are candidates that are running for federal or state office you don't see\nDemocrats or Republicans giving a lukewarm endorsement to pro choice or pro life there either are they're not whereas on the second amendment\nThere are a lot of Republicans who do not even remotely even answer even the simplest questions and we are just some eyes this voters that\nDon't worry once this candidate gets in\nHe or she will support the second amendment I I don't see the left\nDoing that on a faith basis for pro choice Democrats and yet some Republicans like Utah\nMittens Romney are we really to believe that heaven forbid mittens Romney as a U.S senator he's going to support the second amendment that I mean given his track record I mean come on\nI voted for for president but they I mean just the idea of having another left wing gun grabbing the U.S Senate on the Republican side doesn't appeal to me any more than the Democratic party candidates\nI think we rambled\nI just I I wouldn't ... there is some accountability I mean there are Senate races Florida's Governor Scott he just signed into law you got to be Twenty one to buy a rifle for Pete's sake you know most people don't even know active duty active duty between the ages of Eighteen Inches\nThat are guarding our nuclear arsenal I mean it's it's totally disgusting\nThat are right that in our constitution is constantly snow up and I predict the all the senators in the east coast and left both states get elected as Republican scientists they they're not even going to do anything for the second amendment that I'm not saying that's all a monkey wrench she'll just totally disgusting\nHow I mean you are going to get a question mark next to the name of the candidate on the line when you look him up I mean they can answer yes you know yeah yeah and I but I don't want to around ... you say if you didn't make a call\n... absolutely but David you made a big mistake I think he used the word monkey wrench which got the candidate for governor in Florida in trouble right we're not supposed to just use that normal talk you must be a racist even bring that up\nOne of the things I was going to say to you that uh it's amazing that the other side doesn't imagine that people on our side we're just is upset when President Obama got into office as they are with President Trump\nI Know you have to stay in for President Obama but I Would never think of starting resistance nor saying and doing the things that people do about President Trump and I certainly didn't go around and letting ruined my life if I met someone and I do I play tennis with people who are Democrats some of them\nI just it's so amazing on the other side how how they view the world how angry and how self righteous and how arrogant they are\nThat in their case you know they have truth it's all on their side and ... you know you don't agree with them you're gone as a friend you've gone as a family member and they'll never talk to you again\nAnd that's what I'm asking what experiences have you had with family a friend when they find out your conservative or Republican and if you're a Democrat or liberal out there let me know if

this ... is a new time in ...\nNever knew my point of view if uh my uh friends ever really ... or the when they found out what my views were I was in big trouble I've been to a friend did I mean is this the McCarthy Era of memory McCarthy who is you know calling everybody communist and with whatever you thought of him it was unfortunately ruined a lot of careers\nIs that what it's come through and let me talk about myself you've probably heard me say this I Am a part time teacher and they don't know\nThat I'm a talk show host let alone on national radio if they did they could figure out that I was probably conservatives talk shows are some liberals and most of them are not\nAmong many good you know what jeopardize being what what kind of America to we have in twenty Eighteen when you

seven\nYour national forecast from red eye radio I'm meteorologist John trout\nI'm Mark ... I Want to take your calls an eight six six Ninety red eye\nMary in two thousand [noise]\n\nWhat I've started to go in your direction first of all I got to say my older brother has never signed on in more than one way obviously and was always afraid about privacy issues and that kind of stuff he winds up being right\nOr if I wasn't on the radio I probably wouldn't use faced with that much although I got to be fair it is good you can reconnect with people when I was a teacher years ago they find me or you find out about someone's life is they just use it for that but I've learned to like you kind of indicated\nI've learned not to say much about politics or the ... when they know I'm a talk show host and if they know me already good luck they'll never leave you alone it's their chance to you know try to say all kinds of things that they can say if they can't get through on radio so people have no limitations there so I just about I kind of control myself sometimes something gets me so sad\nAnd I think I I'm going to comment on this but in general uh I Try to stay away from it I think social media you're right\nAnd that does some good but the I like I said I don't even use Twitter hardly ever use Twitter anymore if I wasn't on the radio there are a lot of things I wouldn't do including like I said Facebook\nSo I I think people should be cautious with the social media special we're finding out that they're you know so many things were hacked and they're finding out a lot of your information so I think it's smart you said you have ... five years and I admire that\nTom in Port Angeles a Washington You're on with mark\nHello mark a a I Want to do a shout out to your Canadian color helps you still listening I ah I I Do a lot of community radio up here where I'm at and she's right it was a it was pretty horrific the way that they you know all the duct tape you she CBS NBC or just\nRegurgitate it everything\nThat the U.S electorate was going to do it fast to not get the candidate that the media was trying to and us\nAnd that worked out in the end so all that horrific stuff that came off of a a Paul Kennedy and I'm a\nAt a Charles Adler and uh and right and uh and and green or all of that\nProbably helped a get out Obama or get a Trump was elected because it was kind of hurt for when we were coming down from Canada like that\nAnd uh but the reason I called was so we had already been told\nA for Twenty years Thirty years that uh you know nobody was going to be able to fix the inner cities and you know the racial issues that we had to confront\nAnd a lot of people a lot of white people voted for President Obama and then when he got elected he ignored his mandate and he went\nClear off on another change and things got worse so we were very very disappointed a you know the people that voted for the white people that voted for Obama were review review disappointed and it damaged the Democratic party for a long long time [noise] ...\nI think if they voted for him because\nThey want to show they weren't prejudice that was a mistake you know color should never be an issue but I'm sure some people did\nBut the fact is then he was a didn't disappoint me I knew he was I knew we was when he first came out I Am not to mention his personality in terms of dropping a bill ... who is the ... river in ... and ... you pretended that you know\nAnd many people can pick on Trump that for the things he says and does so it's not foolproof but I knew he was far left he he really that's got closer and closer he's in high def for half a second I'm no disappointment to me I I never expected much from him and and that's what I'm saying the other side the left doesn't understand that we dislike him\nProbably as much as people dislike trouble then it's a high bar I got to admit that ah people who hate Trump really Trump let's go to Dave in gurney Illinois you're on with mark\nHey mark a I've got to average ... observations and then a point to make a first of all you notice\nAll the calls that you have coming in [noise] it's always\nThe liberals\nAnd Democrats that shut off the lines of to communication when it comes to personal relationships that's well that's the observation and then also you had a caller who said was touting that she was highly educated yeah she was highly educated but she was not\nHighly indoctrinated that was the problem the winter liberal friends and then also when this country was founded almost two hundred and fifty years ago it was founded with the premise\nIn the power of the individual not the state and isn't it funny how the left can sit there in tout\nFreak individual liberties but they don't like the founding of the country which specifically states that we have powers are as individuals and not not the state over us as individuals but\nThey are fighting for their own demise\nWhen they fight against the founding of this country\nBoy you said that very very well and by the way I don't I don't believe that\nExample with antifa but they're fascist themselves and they you know when it's convenient there on the side of individual liberty but don't mistake that these people care about what is this group think what does that group think\nOr they want more power for the federal government whereas we thinking as you said we want limited government and the government to stay out of our lives\nSo I I don't think that's who they are although they pretend right to pretend to be the little guy and\nThey they care about my minorities and they cared about the basically for no they didn't\nThey just care about getting in power and most of them many of them are really far left for the old Democrats that you can count on to be moderate to scoop Jackson's of the world of course John Kennedy a lot of people say when the tax cut that he gave he'd be Republican today\nThe Democratic party that I as a kid supportive and someone said one of our caller said then they left

mark\nHi I just wanted to cover for items would prove about the Democrats the first one is one Obama went up people didn't listen to what you get get his number right away when he made a speech in Egypt in March of two thousand nine\nBasically what he said in that speech was\nThe U.S was to blame for a lot of things instead of saying the U.S made that ... some mistakes and ah we we we uh men dwell but we didn't do it he was knocking to us and knocking it down like he was the enemy of the u._s. people and then he he uh\nHe uh didn't invite ... the head of Egypt invited his enemy there so he got to get him overthrown and then Chuck Schumer in two thousand eleven locally said that we got to do something about the first amendment\nOr here in New York you know because of that one but two thousand or less and it didn't carry much weight because we weren't that liberal at that time we have to control it because people are saying bad things about a candidate's then the the third thing was\nWas back in ... when a when he went off and he went to a after the four people got killed the next day he went he was scheduled to go to raise money on the coast and he still went and blame that on that disk you know the thing and the and the one that he really should have gotten impeached for definitely\nWas when the when the insurance companies here one or two and a half billion dollars more for Obamacare now maybe they needed it and maybe they didn't that someone at that point the Congress wouldn't give it to them\nAnd he took the two and a half billion out of the treasury when she has no authority to do it all and gave it to them and eating they did nothing about it and that's a\nMinor stuff 'cause what he used to do Obama is every hour on the second he was lied to you\nPerson

we do we do spend some time on illegal immigration as well\nDo you ah support legal immigration or have certain numbers of that you'd like to see\nWe do we support legal immigration or what would you support is is ... ...\nOr so that means that we support ending chain migration which is\nWhich are the ... family reunification immigration ... um we support ending\nWhere we would like to see the visa lottery ended as well we'd like to see 'em read I like to see that that uh employment based green cards are given out to highly skilled workers where there is truly unique in the American workforce for those kinds of workers that are coming at\nIt sounds a lot like the administration's position right away the ending chain migration in a supporting these is with high end talent we're with the president\nAnd I support sending the visa lottery um it uh\nSupports some tighter restrictions on refugee admissions we believe that we should be taking in our fair share of internationally recognized refugees but at the same time uh we want to make sure that that process is is\nThat that future for Jews are thoroughly vetted and and are not going to cause harm or a threat to the United states public safety national security or or to deliver a wage earners yet in the United states I'm so there are some similarities similarities there obviously the administration is\nIs a big fan of

couldn't agree with you more and that and that's the reason why we take the position that we take on immigration world we want to reduce legal immigration levels as well because\nWe have our own issues here in the United states that that we need to take care of now when we're dealing with foreign aid\nAnd what what what money do we give to other countries to think there's a there's a number of different things that we could do like the first that plays a little bit more into a while for a policy type ... so there are strategic reasons why we provide foreign aid to some of these countries that we we provide we provide aid to I think just as as as the world leader\nYou know the United states is the biggest strongest nation on earth we do have to take a little bit of responsibility to make sure that there is you\nKnow that that that there are human rights violations and governments are oppressing their people things like that around the world and uh we we've always done that throughout our at\nYou know throughout our two hundred years two hundred and fifty year history [noise] um so when it comes to that but I think there are also other things that the government can do I think the government can encourage business to go down at best some of these countries maybe give them some sort of a tax break for investing in some of these more needy countries\nIn helping to rebuild those countries so there are other ways besides just foreign aid\nBut but I think going back to your original point couldn't\nAgree with you more I think that's why we can't take on that\nEvery single person in in every other country that happened to be living below the poverty level because we have a million of Americans who are struggling in the United states today that we also need to take care of we need to put them first and that's what we need to do we need to start putting Americans as far as the head of the rest of the world's problems\nNow I Want you to clarify this for me see if I understood it so someone just gets their leg over on our side of the border they can then legally request asylum\nYou have to have your persecution back your home country from your government because of their race religion political views or a social group that you belong to that's not just federal law but that also ... however what we've seen over the last decade or so is that they're very very purse pap\nReclaiming silent you're in the United states is that you have what's called a credible fear interview and in that interview you say that I have a fear of returning back to my country\nBecause of X Y and Z well what happened was we've lowered the credible your standard so that somebody could clean\nCriminal gang violence or domestic abuse or something like that\nBut it got hooked on to the actual definition of a one and I finally is so because of that we allow people to claim asylum who don't actually qualify for asylum by the time they get for asylum judge they teach rejected and they're and they're sent back home\nSo what the what the administration led by attorney general Jeff Sessions and it's been an act by the department of homeland security they try bits like that that credible your standard but that doesn't cause that why does that all your interview that's why I think it's so important for us\nThis caravan that that may be heading our way as as for the United states to prevent them from entering the country that they want to claim asylum to that credible you're outside of the United states once they get in they're not getting out so we can't let them all [noise]\nYeah but they can they can pretend that need their advisors lawyers whenever I can tell them what to say I don't know how you prove a negative you prove that they don't have fear the harm or persecution that have you back to their country and how do you do and anybody I'm just trying to think in claiming if they're trained to say the right words\nWell usually I mean usually the the that that the state department at the federal\nBy country basis so what\nWe haven't seen much of this you know out of Cleveland logo violations rates and showing I in in in in other countries you know we know that we know that if if\nIf you're ... Korea for example and she believes you're you're not a communist state you're going to be persecuted within that country we know that ... the middle east are often\nPersecuted by the government because of their religious beliefs or individuals in the middle east a persecuted by their government because of their sexual orientation things like that so we do those things are\nHappening and the government either is aware of them or came quickly investigate\nInto them but when they you know again in the old process uh before ... when they were able to just say well I have a fear of criminal violence while ya authors terminal pilots there will be allowed them to enter into the system that that was bad uh so now so they can\nThey can still make a false claim on the other side of the border but at least we can and that's the gate whether or not that claim as likeable likely to be true or not but while they're outside of the country like I said once they get ... it's added states\nIt's

know anybody that is a liberal that that is like the ones we see portrayed on TV you know maybe that's because of the circles by running but I don't know where\nThose people are here in Florida right you're saying that uh the people that support Gillum you don't know them at all\nSo that I live in a neighborhood they are they're all Republican\nRight so that'll do it right in the end up here we

entertaining\nOh my goodness to not have Chris Wallace in my corner is is really just consider him like a\nCop man for a fighter to like what George Foreman for Frazier a you know I'm like the

goes\nHere is my ... at the White House cut twenty seven\nYear old President Trump this morning that we ought to give them a few more days to complete that we do have a complete understanding of the facts surrounding that were born we can make decisions about how the United states should respond to surrounding this show\nSo do you have a problem with the president's pace in this investigation and do you agree the secretary of state and vice of the president to give the Saudis some time\nThink asking Saudi Arabia to do a transparent and complete investigation of what happened to Jim ...\nIs like asking OJ Simpson to do an investigation of who killed Nicole Brown ... clearly the Saudis were involved in this clearly it was a Saudi hit squad that killed this guy\n... where there are direct orders from uh the the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman NBS I don't know but I think that whoever did it knew that he would\nHe would like it and it wasn't a upset with my guest says he wouldn't do it without his approval\nAnd I you know we do have a real dilemma here because it was a horrible attack it was a ... barbaric\nAction on their part how they ever thought they were going to get away with it I I don't know but having said that we do have a relationship with Saudi Arabia or that you can't just blow up we depend on them for cheap oil we depend on them as a as a counterweight to Iran and the sources stability in the middle east but\nA ... you can't let this thing go unpunished and even if he wanted to\nThere are a lot of top members of Congress including a lot of top Republicans like Lindsey Graham like Bob Corker like our guest on Sunday Rand Paul who were saying I don't care what our relationship was was with Saudi Arabia you can't just let this pass and act as if nothing happened here\nYou can't blow up the relationship the president thinks out loud you don't have to get a source within the White House that says the president's mindset is he actually tells you he said uh this is bad if this is true if you knew about it it's real bad All right uh what do we don't know but if there is a tape or if they show it's real bad what is enough\nI don't know that I I mean I I'll be honest I don't know but I think you have to do something that hurts that says to the world that we\nDon't countenance that that that is not the way the U.S and us allies act and uh you know I don't you know people say well we need to get a A N be outside of their last time I checked I don't think we have control over the royal family but I but I Will say does somebody said that that\nThat

find out it show all the Paso or chair you're sitting in\nHow you come across\nWell thanks a lot of Bob would happen is of course the Vietnam War there was a draft there's a lot of resentment for that war and they started getting mad at our airmen a air force members as well as a our army they say well you're killing kids because a lot of the video and images brought back with that but that wasn't the reality on the ground things that happened were casualties of war\nAnd hopefully we got past that period but they work of talking about air force pilots as doing that\nBut no one ever thought um is is that I cannot justify what happened Saudi Arabia that's not going to be okay they will receive ramifications for this and on top of that the president's already made it\nClear um that he's died they know it so now we've got to figure out how the Saudis are going to own up to it when we come back\nWe're going to be joined by Katie woman or the the spokesperson for the department of homeland security she knows the loopholes in the catch and release other reasons behind this caravan in so many problems that are ...\nPercent challenge dog was seven million chaotic find off the stage [noise]\nRight now you know we're seeing a caravan coming towards the United states\nOf about four thousand people right that's what the news is reporting we're apprehending about two thousand on the border each and every single day that's where you know the men and women have CBP and border patrol or apprehending them but there's not much recourse they can do once they apprehend than were forced to release because not\nDays is too short period to be able to adjudicate and removed from our country the best attorneys removal and we don't have that ability right\nNow do you think the word is out on these loopholes in central and South America\nOh these smugglers traffickers no our laws better than members of Congress\nI mean it is the most shocking that I've seen recently\nUm is that you know from two thousand sixteen to now more men are coming across the border with children than ever before you know in twenty sixteen it was about six thousand men came across the border with children today it's up to sixteen thousand which says that people know that if they bring a child you will be released into the United states\nAnd there's little or no chance for removal\nSo I Want you to you David to forge did on TALK or the other night uh he's a former President Obama's State Department official\nWe're talking about illegal migrant immigration and illegal immigration has gone down for Mexico and it couldn't go down for Honduras and Guatemala and other countries in Central America we improve those economies we only give a little bit of money so let's help improve the economy you know they really are going fully employed employed there and we need to pay more\nSo you heard talkers sarcasm but that is the feeling that if we just gave these people more aid they stay home\n[laughter] you know the number one and number two reasons that you know border patrol has found when they interview folks at the border to come to the United states you know what's driving them number one is reunification and number two is economic opportunity\nThat is not because they feel unsafe but it's not because the economy is not great they really want to come to the United states\nYou know if if you're truly seeking you know ... if you are fleeing persecution and you're leading no reason why you cannot remain in your home country\nWhy not stop and Mexico but they don't stop and Mexico they continue on to the United states you know I was just at the border couple of weeks ago had a chance when we apprehended a family unit you ask why\nWow so working that's what you're seeing so drawn um oh good good year is is um he he is Mexico's investments in the United states he was on our general yesterday I Want you hear what he said about the Caribbean ... to\nWe have evidence that or this carbon is also very much for the ukulele motivated so we're not we obviously are sensitive to the humanitarian situation that we encounter\nAnd we're acting precisely but we we have also made very clear that there is no legal ground on which Mexico can issue a Berman by which people can just go through Mexico towards the United states\nSo but they do they let him through and the care of in some of that has been sponsored by some enemies of our state but on both those issues first off who put this carbon together\nI mean this campaign is being put together by NGOs and others um mainly for media attention I mean are they just said we're seeing caravan side every day at the border you know we've heard reports of these folks getting on buses and then getting off and walking for the cameras you know they are getting a ton of media attention and it is\nAt least putting a spotlight on the loopholes the serious loopholes in us immigration law that once again is you know at least being slashed on everyone's TV screen to know just what a crisis in it at the border day in and day out\nCan Mexico do more\n[noise] you know Mexican ... Mexico's definitely taking steps to address the humanitarian issue but yet you know these Mexican cartels control the entire U.S Mexico border I feel comfortable saying that you know predominantly\nYou have to pay a smuggler or traffic or about five thousand dollars is the going rate right now to get across the U.S border so there is a two point five billion dollar industry for these traffickers they smuggler these cartels to get people across the border illegally that it's happening in Mexico right now\n\nAnd Feinstein does not only does she not regret the two thousand eight law that's pushing for central and south Americans to come here and stay she says if she if she gets her party gets empower the she put on fixing the law or or and bring it up\n[noise] you know I'd have to say that we really do need Congress to access close these loopholes because if not if you just continue to see more of the same that is four hundred thousand you know I just said that a hundred thousand people apprehended at the border last year there are all here today run and continue to see this influx of\nFamily unit an influx of unaccompanied alien children because if you keep screaming we're exempting you from the law where exempting you from any consequences you're gonna continue to see people come in and it's up to Congress now to close loopholes\nDuty I just don't understand if the if the Democrats see this happening they it's not good not a good issue for them to let people think that people can fought our borders and get into our country so why don't they want to fix this I understand that they have the same for the wall didn't want to get the president a victory but why don't they want to fix catch and release\nThis seems like common sense to me but maybe it's just a fundamental misunderstanding of the way US law works I mean to me it makes perfect sense that if you have a you know a crisis going on at the southern border you'd want to fix it but that's a great question for Dianne Feinstein\nWhich she says that you would like to even make it easier for people to come here illegally right\nI think so yeah\nWell and you feel as though this has been defined well in this in this political process in this election season\n[noise] I think we need to as as much as you can and much as your listeners can\nReally get out there and educate on what actually is happening at the border because it's not just four thousand people today it's two thousand people every single day and it's people we can't remove and then it's ice going out you know into communities and putting themselves at risk of they strap a gun to their head everyday and go out there\nAt the border and why we really do any Congress\nAnd three there were three border patrol soul

I find I'm going to teach me the gas station [noise]\nWell I'm I Know it's not going to wash with Republicans and Democrats in the house listen to what Lindsey Graham told us how\nDo I engage Saudi Arabia when NBS the de facto leader of the country is this brazen district disrespectful for the international norms that we fight for he is toxic there's no way we can move forward uh I don't I Would suspend arms sales as long as he's in charge\nSo go ahead and we all heard we all heard that when Lindsey said those words on Fox and and they went viral in the world I have ... friends who called me said\nEvery year is listen to what Lindsey Graham said and we didn't we [laughter] we hear him saying you know that this there must be accountability I I think you're right in the house and Senate um that people are angry about this I think President Trump understands that there's a lot of anger out there [noise]\nUh but but again it's it's it's not that this was a A R R guy at the Washington Post it would it's that he was living here as a as a resident and as such was entitled to certain protections\nAnd uh we need to take that seriously and get to the bottom of what happened what was the breakdown why didn't we know more as as he is he walked toward that conflict or from which he would never merge why don't we know more\nAnd you in your column today go over some of the questions you want answered for example did you know you want to know if our intelligence agencies\nLike he was you up some patients don't you\n[noise] well I Do ah the ... there are two possibilities one is that we knew and people didn't act in a timely way and what they know and that really bothers me but the second is equally worrying and and that is that we just don't have visibility into Saudi Arabia here's this\nGuy was power president loves them and and the president's son in law loves them but we don't know much about how he's operating so we we don't have that visibility so that's got to be fixed that that's just not that's not a good situation\nFor us to to walk blind into something that was as disastrous as us so I think this is what the congressional oversight committees were were were created for his moments just like this they should they should this it's a very secret\nI wouldn't expect that I or anybody else in the media would hear about it but I think they should review everything that was produced as ... you know take the psychological profile of NBS which\nCertainly is a CIA responsibility\nYou know it should be reviewed that that would that was a straight up what was the reaction of of people in the White House when they when they were told us where they caution this is a volatile personality I could go down the list of Brian of all the questions I think should be\nShould be asked again that should be asked in private and asked in a bipartisan away but this is one where we got to get it right\nYeah I don't don't people became is not enjoy it's the prince and you say that if the print is going to be removed NBS he's going to be removed you say in your last point your column that they are that the people are rallying around prince ... bin ... these the last remaining son of the founding king a king Saud\nSo who is he and do you think they might actually be a change in leadership because of that\nThink it's way too early to say that ah I just\nThis is a moment we're in truth ... it is king Solomon not MPs who's running the show he has in under the Saudis system absolute power and he can make decisions as he sees fit and if he decides that the kingdom\nIts future are in jeopardy or with the current leadership under him he's going to act I mean the one thing I've seen of the studies over many many years watching them\nIs that they know how to play the politics of survival and you know sometimes I make pretty cold blooded decisions so um you know king Solomon is the person to focus on principle I met a I have missed it there are other uh surviving sons of three of them including some on\nBut the prince I'm at is the one who um all the Saturdays I've been talking to us two weeks or you know he's a person and we think represents the values that can come on [laughter] yeah so there's there's no don't get me wrong abroad is not a big movement people ... are being very\nCareful there were just watching and waited David but they're waiting for us\nThat's interesting and we're waiting for them to do their own investigation even though we probably have all the answers already\nWe have a lot of answers but they need they as they need to own it you know for it to go forward as a country that's going to work they need to own it\nDavid if you put thought into the type of thing that would actually a sweat the type of thing the come out of this investigation is actually a ... wage Democrats and Republicans in the house I mean in Congress\nSo so I I think this is a rare moment you know we've had these very partisan into intelligence specifications in the house of Russia [noise]\nYou know let's just put that on the side for the moment and let's say agree that we have we have a big national interests are efforts to challenge Iran which I think are good depend on Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia strength\nMy point is to have a solid foundation of intelligence about about the place that people [noise] and the policies and everybody I think can agree on that and I ... I Hope I Hope the White House would support it and say yeah we agree with this this is the right that writes starting point [noise] you know the Saudis after their investigation but this one we have to do\nAs a as a not a partisan issue shouldn't be a partisan issue\nI lastly I think the listeners need to know how well this administration has been working with Saudi Arabia to achieve mutual goals on like the previous administration they're all in\nSo we're helping them with the who the rebels supported by Iran where we are the Saudis are helping us to help bring Iran to the table by hurting their economy the best they can and the end result would be starving Hezbollah Hamas\nUh and and maybe settling things down in Syria and the Israelis and Saudis are working together under the wire like they never had before so there is a lot at stake if I miss dated anything\nNo use everything you said is correct or we have a lot of interests in common with with Saudi Arabia and as you says scientists are beginning to help us see a world where Israel is part of the region that set a rabid lives and that's really important [noise]\nBut this one has to be solved for all those good things are going to begin to crumble I fear\nAnd data that's why we need to take this seriously\nAnd that's why we have to read your columns because your contacts you as good as anybody in America overseas in in the middle east because we've had so much conflict over there in the past David thanks so much ... as you say\nGot a best selling author to a lot of his books become movies one eight six six for all eight seven six six nine when we come back we're going to finish up your calls were thrilled to be the beautiful studios of WAMC J.

through today or as we move closer and closer to the to the mid term elections [noise] and I I Want to say something I I was I was watching the president's\nAddress yesterday [noise]\nAnd I'm feeling a lot better about the mid term elections\nAs a matter of fact based on based on what I'm hearing and I've been reading a lot of the messages you folks have been leaving on a on our Facebook page and and I do read as many of those as possible I mean we're talking about hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of messages and I I Try to go through those in the evening time\nAnd I really do believe that there is there is a movement afoot in this country and I believe that you folks out there the listeners of this radio program are leading the charge\nIt is quite remarkable when you think about what's happening across the country right now where Democrats are going out there and they're beating and bullying and badgering and they're attacking Republicans and conservatives\nThey're trying to silence you they're trying to run you out of the public marketplace\nBut he but something is happening instead of running away instead of capitulate instead of being quiet inside your house you folks are starting to speak out you're starting to stand up you're starting to hold the line\nAnd many of you are saying you know what an ounce of this we're tired of we're tired of the hatred were tired of the Democrats trying to bully us into submission were absolutely tired of it\nAnd so I Want to say something here and um [noise] I don't think this was going to come back and bite me on the day after the

in this you know the police officers did not engage a these ... these are domestic terrorists Maryland\nAnd they are intent in going out there and and terrorizing law abiding citizens they actually they actually confronted people on the streets in one instance there was a poor guy elderly man driving a Lexus and they took a baseball bat and they beat up one of the windows of his car\nAnd and no one was arrested no one was charged\nAll right so let me ask you one more question and I'll get off the phone and let other people talk\nWhy why just because the mayor he's the mayor\nHe gets away with letting letting this\nHappen in his city and nobody no police no nothing could stop him why just because they're politicians if they are crooked if they're corrupt if there are letting innocent people's homes getting burned or their cars are being disrupted and and\nThe people are getting beat up by these people why in the world are not the police stepping\nIn and saying look to the politicians if you don't put a stop to this stop this craziness we're going to hold a police state here and you're going to jail you're going to go to jail if this happens 'cause you're the one that's supposed to be in charge of this you're responsible for it\nNow Marilyn ...

were able to escape because she gave them a heads up\nHonestly Maryland I think at that moment the the mayor of Portland Ore of Oakland, California should have been a whole lot of city hall in handcuffs and thrown in jail\nI agree with you and I think there's so many of us out that you could see the people that are showing up at all the Israelis thousands and I've been watching almost every

or at least the conservatives have not been well represented on Capitol Hill\nNo sure we have not you think about the Mississippi is a conservative state if you can't find a conservative to send to

even gonna make any money you make a little bit it'll be fine pay some taxes on it and if you wanna funds a Roth IRA for her or something the point here in this situation is when you have a kid running a business the point is not the business the point is and what the kid is learning\nThey're learning work\nThey're learning interface with customers and how to treat people ah they're learning that they have to deliver on time they have to deliver quality they're learning how to put prices on something or they're learning that it's a good thing to make a profit the capitalism is not evil ... these are the lessons are what is important\nI understand the accurate or if she makes some money that's just a bonus right\nAbout what ... what are you what you've identified as you've identified the way this kid is wired\nAnd a lot of us that are entrepreneurial are are a lot or at least a little bit ADD [laughter] right right I mean how much of a pass anything the shiny I run towards it you know science\nI'm sure you know but I ... if you start may start to make a hundred thousand dollars a year or something you may want to do it in all asleep but if you if you're making under a hundred grand where the profit\nI mean that's not you know unless you just hit some bizarre ... or something like home depot wants to buy or out or something I don't know but you know what you're trying to do is teach her the lessons of how to set up operate a business\nDeliver on time follow through responsibility the character of work ethic those kinds of things that you have to have to run a business initiative\nAnd it's a wonderful thing to teach a team\nOr a pre teen like that is absolutely fabulous so much though that Anthony O'Neill here\nOn our team put together the teen entrepreneurial

curriculum and the high schools and in the car\nThis common sense stuff of staying out of that and being on a budget and learning to save money and all of that kind of thing\nThen what happens from time to time is the schools can't afford the basic resources and so someone will come along side and the community of business or an entity of some kind\nAnd we'll pay for that high school to have\nFoundations in personal finance curriculum from the Ramsey organization is that we've got about four million students go through one of the coolest things has happened lately is the University of Wyoming\nHas decided that every high school in the entire state of Wyoming needs to have this curriculum and they're sponsoring it in paying for it\nDang dang touchdown baby that's how that happens the\nCollege university says we're going to take care of these high schoolers\nIn our state and make sure they learn about money and of course University of Wyoming is the best cost alternative in the Wyoming area to go to college so this all works out really really good not Tyler Moore is with me on the line and\nKyle is from the University of Wyoming he's the associate vice provost of enrollment Kyle Wyatt go man thank you for doing that\nWell it's a pleasure to visit with you David ... thanks for that we are certainly Saturday here and the state of Wyoming to be able to partner with a Ramsey education and provide some practical\nApplicable being for students to be able to apply that college search and uh and and be a real fatty consumer of higher education\nYeah because you guys do have low tuition I mean you're you're you're you're the best deal round I wasn't getting right\nYes there we are we have the lower resident tuition\nOf all the rights of all the rooms are like so like your cheaper than my University of Tennessee or your cheaper than the University of dot dot dot that's correct wow very cool very cool and I got to tell you when I heard what your whole promotion was\nBehind this I immediately wanted to steal it and bring it and use it somewhere in like in the University of Tennessee and I'll tell you were doing a few minutes but I Will get them to do it yeah you guys are creative I Love this tell everybody about this uh about this campaign and the the motto for the campaign is hands down the best thing I've heard\nSo that our our campaign is called the world needs more cowboys we're we're not talking about guys and cowboy hats that ride off into the sunset but we're talking about a state with a long heritage and a university mascot\nA cowboy that can be\nAnyone from any gender any background but we're talking about that enters here we're talking about a curiosity independence of boldness\nAt pursuit that adventure and we're talking about someone who changes landscapes and and look for opportunities to make differences in the world we are talking about trailblazers and people exemplify the spirit of the underdog you know it's not a cowboy isn't\nWhat you are but it's who you are\nWell and you guys are the cowboys\nI mean so it's a play on words obviously I mean if you're a mascot right\nThat's correct your football team your basketball team whatever's the cowboys I mean like my University of Tennessee Volunteers I think they ought to steal it inside of the world needs more volunteers that makes it just as much sense right and so as good I play on words but you you guys got though that you got to the table first with this way to go man I Love it\nIt's a great motto or does it says so much in unjust are so few words very very cool well we're really grateful to all of our sponsors around the country that\nAs of coming up soon the the high school curriculum because the cowboys paid for it [laughter]\nThat's pretty cool Kyle thank you ma'am\nWe're happy to be happy to be a partner we uh we are we are a state that is very practical where state that very much um applicable in terms of being smart with our money and we wanted to make sure that we were not leaving out our opportunity to educate the future generations\nAnd know that there are opportunities in higher education to be smart with your money to be smart about that investment in your future and the University of Wyoming is a way to do that and we're we're helping helping our students in our future generation and the state of Wyoming through the rains the education product\nWell it's one of those when when when things as far as I'm concerned because you're you know you're you're helping them by sponsoring this ... going in there we're blessed because you're doing it with us and we appreciate that\nI'm In the winter is is that you get to put the University of Wyoming cowboys right in front of every high school student and remind them that's where they ought to go to college\nBecause sometimes people do silly things like wander across the state line\nI've talked to a lot of Provo is around the country a mile and chancellor and vice chancellor numerous doesn't Tennessee and it's a constant thing the ... the state is trying to woo their own residence to their own university and it's become a thing you gotta you gotta go after it don't you\nSir absolutely and we have a lot of great students here in the state of Wyoming and there are a lot of great students across the country who need to know that there are opportunities even out of state that you have to be\nSmart and you have to do your due diligence in that process of searching for higher education in addition to being the lowest cost per resident tuition of doctor are renting institution we are near the very lowest for non residents\nCan be a solution\nThat provide students and incredible opportunity for education and we're going to be very very good at making sure that we are helping a student be successful not just students success and part of that is not racking up a lot of debt at the end of their degree completion\nI meant so how many students on your campus\nWe have we had a little over or twelve thousand so twelve thousand a little over twelve thousand four hundred students here that are called himself the cowboys\nYeah that's a good size school that's not too big and not too small that's a that's a that's just right as a Goldilocks deal just right very\nCool very cool ... it's an honor to talk to you again rather thank you for coming on with us\nThank you very much a best wishes to you and your team there in uh in Tennessee and uh we appreciate the opportunity to say the world needs more cowboys\nI Love it I Love the motto and I think the world doesn't even more cowboys in so many ways [laughter] good stuff I got a little picture John Wayne going in my head I can't help but it's just the way it is but a bottom line is lesser mascot and so now it's uh\nThat's very cool stuff I Love it\nAnd want a neat thing that the College of the University of the state is buying it for every single high school now if you're a business or a university and you'd like to do something like that maybe you don't have to maybe don't have the money to buy the whole state or something every high school in the states some states have more high schools and others can you imagine you know but um\nYou know maybe you just want to do it would be to the hospital used to go to um I went over spoke to at them in the building where I used to go to high school the other day it's now a middle school\nSo I had all the forty really bright and shiny little eighth graders looking at me that's the hardest speaking you'll ever have I'll just tell you

Christian in Florida Dave took out a lease on a vehicle about four months ago but for enrolling in financial ... feel like I made one of the worst mistake some a lot of [laughter] I was wondering if you could give me some advice on how it would affect me if I were to return a leash car\nTo the dealership or at this point do just keep the vehicle or none of the above\nWe take her car back that you own money on our son to lease on that's effectively a voluntary repossession and that that would be dumb because they're going to sell the car after they've repossessed it and are there and on repossession lot and then they're going to sue you for the difference\nIf you don't pay them the difference of media and you don't have the different she goes you're broke so\nInformation one is called the car free ... company that you are paying the ... to ... and find out what the early buyout on the car is\nNow the early buyout is different than the total of your lease payments pleasure residual value at the end it should be less because you're these leases are very new and there should be it's kind of like an early pay off on the line when it doesn't include all the interest from\nThe time that you know from keeping alone the whole time\nShow the early buyout as your hourly pay off now now that what it's what's fake by the car off and get the title in your hand then you compare that to\nK. Bebe dot com Kelley Blue book dot com private sale what the car is actually worse\nAnd I'll just make up some numbers let's pretend that the early buyout is twenty thousand and then you look it up in the car is actually worse sixteen thousand that would leave you four thousand dollars in the whole probably not far off of what you're going to find\nSo four thousand dollars in the home and you sell the car for sixteen you've got to put four thousand dollars cash with the sixteen in order to get the title for the buyer\nAnd so um\nYou have to have that other four thousand dollars you have to be able to cover the whole that you're in the amount that you are upside down\nIn the way you would do that is obviously alone and so you start working with your local credit union with your local bank and you get a loan lined up for the amount that you're upside down and you put the car up for sale and you sell the car\nFor as much as you can possibly get for which is more than they will show at four in the report lot so the bottom line is you're going to be responsible for this difference either way but the difference is greater\nYou cover the difference cover the amount that you're upside down with another loan and I'd rather you'll be four thousand dollars in debt than twenty four thousand dollars in debt or whatever the numbers are so um they ribs utility to borrow money no diver and

my husband and I just started I'm really getting serious about the debt snowball we have approximately Seventy thousand dollars in debt mainly from my student loans and um we have fifty six hundred dollars in savings\nAnd my question is um we have a baby coverings\nAnd yeah you wouldn't be a um April nineteenth the duty right\nYeah for excited so with that I was initially going to use you know get the thousand dollar emergency fund and he was forty six hundred to pay off bills but now with the baby I didn't ... that's what I was wondering what how we should kind of attack that\nI Would suggest you do is push pause on the total moneymaker over okay and pile up a big pile as you can probably do between now and the term by becomes okay and um\nFor all that event is within behind us in any worries are threats or anything we would have had about that is behind us right\nUm well I mean there's the whole thing of raising the baby but I have a baby or yeah there is now but I but basically the you know we want to make sure labor and delivery and everything goes and we don't have any hiccups and when we got money okay so let's say you save up what what's your household income\nRight now like about a Seventy seven thousand okay\nSo let's say you save up twenty five thousand dollars between now and then okay you're twenty four thousand after you come home from the hospital and push play on your told him when he make over and take your account down to a thousand dollars and throw it at the at the ... a student loan you will have lost no ground\nOkay unless you go baby spending crazy during the next few months\nWe had a lot of stuff like this is our second child ... you had a lot of stuff the only thing that would be a little bit different and the other day the boy because I have a lot of girls close yeah\nWell there's no but I mean you don't you know what I'm Talking about by baby crazy events from friends do that or they just they go drop twenty grand to get ready for\nYou know an eight pound human being I mean they just go nuts and so if you'll just calm down and just you know manager budget like you were trying to get out of debt but instead of throwing it at the debt you keep everything tight you throw it in a pile of cash and then we don't spend it on baby a than is necessary for my survival\nAnd we uh throw it at the debt won by being mommy come home we push play again\nThe pause comes off and we\nGet out of debt as fast as we can but in the meantime we just created all your loses a little bit of interest on that money between now and the time the babies delivered that's all you lose it's not a big deal\nTim is with us in West Palm Beach Florida Hi Tim welcome to the day Ramsey show I said how you doing\nAnd he said Dave Ramsey is talking about oh la permanent insurance not portfolio ... permanent insurance which is what you do is it still bad\nOkay Dave Ramsey does not ever invest sounds real clearing the lesson you heard me\nYeah when you are never tell you under any circumstances to use life insurance as an investment vehicle one hundred percent of the time it sucks\nSo would you say because what we told him we wanted to do it\nWhy would you say you need a new financial advisor that's what I Would show you you don't have a financial adviser you\nHave a dull life insurance salesman\nOkay the shelling you insurance\nSo what we were thinking we should do is put into four hundred thousand just the term H. and then the money we were 'cause it was like three hundred dollars a month which I'll do a lot yeah um and just go ahead and open up our Ross Ross are IRA and start getting money into that\nAnd the embed mutual funds okay that's exactly what you learn in class wasn't yeah so you already knew what they room she said yeah he just like which tells me one of those things either this guy's a liar or he's ignorant\nRight [laughter]\nHe's a family friend isn't T I'm actually one of our friends did apparently gave them our number ... than for as well\nYeah yeah okay so I I don't know which it is I mean I I don't know I don't know but but I Do know that I have never in my life told someone to buy life insurance as an investment under any brand heading\nName or description ever\nRight and the last thing it on our term policy um on your class he said you know Twenty years Thirty years whatever was on ... and the art term policy was until we were eighty with hand\n[laughter] okay\nAnd how much is guys over charge you for everything he sold you\n\nKnow guard and you're probably going to end up just canceling everything with him so this kind of really needs a good firing\nHey that sounds like well Oregon that down and and and that they might\nCall right thank you for calling in and when you compare the prices you'll see what I'm Talking about and you understood the lesson when we were talking about using life insurance as an investment vehicle and the reason is folks for those of you that I haven't seen the financial ... never for some reason I heard a Ramsey talk about this\nCase someone else ever brings this up because it does come up periodically [noise] um the people who sell\nInvestment based or\nWhole life or permanent life or portfolio or universal or anything where there's an investment going into insurance are not happy with me they don't like me\nAnd so they generally try to ignore me or lie about me or something else but those are pretty much cost them all a bunch of business because they sell crap\nCrap in a bag that's what it is okay it's pretty simple so here's the thing\nWhen you use life insurance as an investment vehicle hey you get a bad right of return regardless of what they quote you after they take all of their fees which usually in the first two years is one hundred per cent\n\nSometimes up to forty years is one hundred percent of what should have gone to the investment goes out and fees even after that you're going to make three four five percent on your money and you should have been in a good mutual fund making ten eleven twelve percent on your money and that's where you should be when you die\nIt's universal life insurance they pay\nOnly the face amount of the policy not the extra money that you put into the investment that money is gone\nSo you have a savings account that\nFor the first several years I keep all your money after that they give you a bad right of return and when you die they keep it all\nSo bad savings account bad investment program the pay the the\nLife insurance products that give you the opportunity to pay twenty times more than you would pay for term insurance in order that you create an investment inside of the policy\nAre basically the payday lender the middle class their crap\nAnd that's what Dave Ramsey has always had for twenty five years here on the air upset it for twenty five years is alive owned myself I have never owned while this show was operating any kind of whole life or\nInvestment based life insurance of any kind ever now I did get a horrible northwestern mutual\nWhole life grotesque old school one of the worst of the worst of the whole lives when I was in my early twenties and it was the same way Brittany it was a guy my wife knew from college came around selling right after we got married and we bought this crap from him\nI had it for about nine months until I finally sat down with some guys who unpacked the numbers for me and I about kicked my own but when I saw how bad it was and got rid of it and since then I have never owned it and since then I've never told anyone to buy\nAnything other than\nCome on you the best way to buy life insurance is through a broker the shops several companies the best way to buy insurance of any connoisseur a broker that shop several companies and get you the best possible deal whether it's your\nCar insurance your homeowner's insurance your long term care insurance your life insurance or insurance of any kind\nLetter broke her shop among several companies and get you the best kinds of deals and that's why we've endorsed for about Twenty years ... insurance\nJeff sander has become a personal friend of mine during that time and I buy my personal life insurance from slander and I don't own Zander insurance on around any of it that show that a lot is always told me\nI Would I Would have a whole lot more money if I did um Zander insurance goes Jeff has done rather well due to the Dave Ramsey endorsement but the reason he done well is he he's got a very very good system for getting you the best possible price on term life insurance and it takes about like Thirteen seconds\nAnd they don't sell your name the list of people when you go on there either so that's why I've endorsed it's real simple it takes care of you guys you the listener and you need to get term life insurance has been cost that much\nSo just jump in there and do it so Brittany thank you for calling with that question given me the opportunity to clarify on that yet again yet again yet again yet again and again\nYes you need life insurance out by the way a broker you know you know like even with your car insurance jump on the air with could get with the help they usually indoors local providers for your ... what we call PNC property and casual you got your\nAnd your homeowner's insurance you can shop most people saved three to eight hundred dollars a year on their car and homeowners when you're shopping among several companies instead of using what we call a captive agent in the business cats\nPeyton Manning and Brad Paisley can sing to you agent was it nationwide that's nationwide and you know but um and they're both good guys I like both of them there's nothing to do with that but you're paying for those guys\nWhen you when you use that insurance it's ... it's built in and neither one of those guys worked cheap I'll just tell you\nThis is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nFocus is one of my

what's up\nHey I've got a good problem that I'm hoping he can give me some advice on I'm forty eight years old would that free uh recently at our house off yeah the way to go yeah we're happy about that a decided to you know sell off some investments just to do that people kind of\nSaid well why would you do that although it might not people's money you're low interest that's right and I tell you what the peace of mind is great\nDollar suit that I'm trying to figure out what to do with a few that about the same amount in four one K. which I have to be in the market\nUm I'm a little nervous about possibly also investing the amount of money in the market and I'm [noise]\nMy foot homes we for about ten home in the past and I'm thinking about using that money to buy a rental properties no outright mhm and ah and do that and maybe diversify a little more than I Want to hear what your thoughts were on that\nOkay um I think it's excellent if you've got the stomach for real estate real estate gives you a better return than the stock market will give you but it's a higher hassle factor yeah it is you know you put money mutual fund they don't bother you you know but you you put put a renter in a house they go out on ya [laughter]\nAnd so there was a ... you know you got the hassle of buying it you gotta pay the taxes you got to pay the insurance I mean they're dealing with managing real estate all the aspects of it is a national fact I've got a bunch of it I'm not by far I have more in real estate than I Do in the stock market I've got a lot in both\nBut a real estate will give you a better rate of return but it requires management by you or someone else and even if you have somebody else to what you've got to manage the manager you cannot ignore it and so my real estate with an internal right of return which is the tax benefit the the you know that appreciation schedule in other words\nThe actual cash on cash return the ... minus expenses as a return on investment and the growth in value you put those three things together and real estate you get the actual return which is called the interim right of return the IRR okay which you would compare to a mutual fund right of return to do apples to apples\nHigher hassle factor but most of my real estate is Seventeen to twenty percent right of return\nI are are not casual cash is about ten okay or a little less and some of it okay but uh I our our total with them\nMutual fund but I've got a lot more hassle with it I mean ... you know even though I don't management and my son in law runs our our real estate company and he manages all of it and I don't I don't put up I don't personally\nDeal with a renter or something like that or anything or vacancy are broken air conditioner all that he deals with all that stuff but but you know I went over all the ... this morning with him and to see how the properties are doing we check on him and he's telling me the stories of the drama he gets to deal with and such is real estate but I Love real estate do\nYou have to ask if our question I'm sure\nThey might play point was a hundred thousand dollar house so at five hundred thousand I have I

sense stuff of staying out of that and being on a budget and learning to save money and all of that kind of thing\nAnd what happens from time to time is the schools can't afford the basic resources and so someone will come along side and the community of business or an entity of some kind and we'll pay for that high school to have\nFoundations in personal finance curriculum from the Ramsey organization is that we've had about four million students go through it one of the coolest things has happened lately is the University of Wyoming\nHas decided that every high school in the entire state of Wyoming needs to have this curriculum and they're sponsoring it in paying for it dang dang touchdown baby that's how that happens the college the units\nAnd of course the University of Wyoming is the best cost alternative in the Wyoming area to go to college so this all works out really really good now Tyler Moore is with me on the line and\nTile is from the University of Wyoming he's the associate vice provost of enrollment Kyle way to go man thank you for doing that\nWell it's a it's a pleasure to visit with you David ... thanks for that we are certainly Saturday here and

people exemplify the spirit of the underdog you know it's not a cowboy isn't\nWhat you are but it's who you are\nYeah well and you guys are the cowboys\nI mean so it's a play on words obviously I mean if you're a mascot right that's correct\nYour football team your basketball team whatever's the cowboys I mean like my University of Tennessee Volunteers I think they ought to steal it inside of the world needs more volunteers that makes it just as much sense right and so it's good I play on words but you you guys got you got to the table first with this way to go man I Love it\nIt's a great

and chancellor and vice chancellor numerous Tennessee and it's a constant thing\nThen ... the state is trying to woo their own residence to their own university and it's become a thing you gotta you gotta go after it don't you\nYes sir absolutely and we have a lot of great students here in the state of Wyoming and there are a lot of great students across the country who need to know that there are opportunities even out of state that you have to be\nSmart and you have to do your due diligence in that process of searching for higher education in addition to being the the lowest cost per resident tuition of doctor are renting institution\nWe are near the very lowest spurt non residents to come to Wyoming so we have a lot to offer not just here in the great state of Wyoming but from coast to coast north and south we can be a solution that provide students an incredible opportunity for education and\nWe're going to be very very good at making sure that we are helping a student be

hidden bird uh like yeah I'd buy a ticket that again and it's crazy 'cause they're still they're trying to figure it out and you know so there's Joe with me go there on cold they're not like on cold there but that would be funny\nThat anybody would step up and challenge President Trump and twenty twenty I think so but I Will say that again I don't think that they're going to have to step up to challenge Donald Trump because I don't think Donald Trump can run for reelection he didn't want to be elected president\nHe didn't he was going to be elected president he didn't even think he was going to get the Republican nomination he's going to cash out\nYeah you'd think that except for one thing this is the guy who doesn't like to quit\nAbout all this 'cause I think I think a lot of what Joe said is absolutely true\nI don't think Trump really thought he was I think Trump thought he was\nA he was running he wanted to to upset the apple cart but then at some point in time and even Chris Christie and talked about the fact that he felt you know by October he would be done and dusted and he would have had in his support to somebody like Chris Christie and the and in the race would beyond\nAnd I think he really wanted to get in there and block a few of the you know the bushes and things like that and the next thing you know he looks up and he's torn through it all then he's president\nAnd he can say joke and say all that but remember what Trump said the other day\nIt takes a president in a while to find that the like I think so I mean I felt comfortable at the beginning other than it was a little surreal to say I'm the president of the United states but I think that's true with everybody ... now I very much for like ...\nI Do I feel like the president you know for a little while it's like a rooster presidents or and even my friends they called me that they don't call me on a limb and they call me Mr President I said well you please loosen up and I've learned on the job I have when you feel comfortable I feel very comfortable yeah\nI think he has grown into like a lot of people do it is a surreal thing mean wake up like I'll tell ya surreal is somebody's going to win the Powerball and the mega millions they are going to wake up and it is going to take them a while to understand what is taking place in the\nSame thing even though it's Donald had all of these trappings in life that that people aspire to have\nThe reality is being president is different thing\nIt's a whole another animal so they can say he's not going to run I think he's liking it now I think you and I also think something else he lost a lot of money his name for a lot of people is is no more the brand that he spent years crafting is done\nDidn't go five to six by nine seven two mountain mobile ... cash best\nWhen done PC ran for governor he promised to\nThe mental resource and essential to Arizona's economy Arizona has always been a national leader in water management today governor do see it's working to secure our water rights for future generations juicy understands\nArizona must speak with one voice when it comes to this vital resource he's promoting responsible conservation and groundwater management\nWell protecting consumers to keep our border security and our family safe do the deployed the national guard to our southern border and created the borders strike force to crack down on human trafficking and stop the flow of drugs and weapons\nAnd do the uh safeguarding are gun rights\nEnsuring responsible gun owners have their Second Amendment rights

people\nPeople up and coming in and out all day long buying their lottery ticket and we even have the man behind the counter yelling out that he's machine is the lucky machine so who knows maybe the winning mega millions ticket will be sold right here in New York City\nSo do you have a lottery fever that is a very good question because it's now over a billion dollars cash values about five hundred and sixty five men in dollars you're probably gonna walk with about\nThree eighty to four hundred million depending on what state you went in and whether or not they take taxes some stage attacks in each in said now I\nI Love you guys you love me we have this this thing going on right we're we're we we talk we ... we have a good time or listen to this 'cause there's advice for winters I think you need advice for winners because\nSomebody potentially this weekend and potentially to people that we can have several people as we can are gonna wanna\nTune his money we're also getting some very important tips for these potential new millionaires Ryan and Mary ... twenty twelve they won two hundred two million dollars and when it comes to spending they say winners should pace themselves\nIt's great to have a second home but then great to have car in a boat and things like that but there\nAre a lot of other costs that come with that property taxes insurance gas money that goes along with that purchase\nGood advice there when combined more than one point three billion dollars are up for grabs right now so good luck to oh\nYeah huge money this weekend so here's the thing and this is what I don't think people realize people win the lottery or somebody wins five million dollars and after everything\nAnd what they don't realize for a lot of times people that when these have never had money\nThey've never made six figures let alone getting this massive when will they get the money and\nThey don't know how to replicate the money meaning they don't get the money to work for them and they go out and they spend it and then they can't replenish it so you've got to realize if you laugh you know a twelve thousand square foot home you got to heat that\nYou got to cool that you've got to pay for the property tax you buy a hundred thousand dollar car it's not a thirty nine dollar\nYou know oil change right you buy a two hundred thousand dollars a million dollar car it costs money it's like a ... it's like thirty thousand dollars just the oil change or something ridiculous like that these are the insanity things that go into the so when you have to think about how much\nDo you want to just go hey look this is that we're going to take X amount of dollars you know a million dollars to a million dollars were this'll be are fun money are play money will get the gadgets we're going to get the rest of them were going to invest and do smart things with a lot of people don't do that and they don't know how to replicate it winds up happening they give a bunch of

potential of what may come from this separation standing army all of those kinds of things and what does Mexico going to do it's being stopped as of this moment by Mexico so we appreciate very much\nHow much that is really going to happen that's been in the end it always feel like they're going to stop that they're going to stop it but you know Mexico's been complicit in allowing people to come here\nAnd uh some of that out of spite some of that out of a you know it look you can go you can either go there you can go back from when she came those those are your choices right here and as we know with Trump eighties about\nEnough is enough\nA percentage of big fairly big percentage of those people are criminals and they want to come into our country and they're criminals and it's not happening on my watch that could have happened\nYeah and I know what he's saying look is it a huge you know there are some people that come here that are bad we can all admit that is a is a large percentage now I Do not believe so I'm going to go out on a limb and say that's a negative ghost writer I don't think it is I think it's a lot now\nInside of the mass\nOf people that are that are coming here or there are people that are bad probably right with any large group\nThere are going to be some people you go you go in round up you know a thousand or two thousand people doesn't matter where you are what part of the world there's a good chance within that group there are some people that are probably not good people if you have a random group of people to the tune up to four three by whatever it is\nHow many of them probably small but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't stop everybody\nI mean at some point in time we have\nTo make a stand when it comes to immigration don't we I mean do do we owe that aid to to to the American citizens to the people who've come here and done it right to the taxpayers\nOf this country to our concerts\nWe are deeply aware or that the the way that Mexico will handle this the way you will handle this is your sovereign decision or Mexico will make its decision it's leaders and its people will decide the best way to achieve what I Believe our our shared objective\nYeah and as far pale right there because they're all trying to figure out what to do in one of the big things that is potential he and and this is the thing right here\n\nOne of the big things is sending the military\nWe've seen it the fight them sending it were militarized sing or you know the border and we're doing all these kinds of things well what have you done Republicans what have you done Democrats to sold any of this nothing\nYou play a game you ignore\nYou kicked the can down the road you use it when it benefits you politically and the rest of the time you just ignore it from comes along for better or worse he says I'm going to take this is the mantle I'm taking up when it comes to certain situations\nBut border the wall symbolic that's the way I feel it is but the reality is is for a lot of people they want something done there's a bigger question here and if you don't want that wall didn't fix the immigration issue\nIf not given as damn wall\nAs you know I'm willing to send the military to defend our southern border is that [noise]\nAnd ah tonight I have a feeling and this is just me I have a feeling that tonight when he's speaking\nHere in Mesa that he is going to say he's going to send\nThe military but he can make some sort of an announcement that he is going to to\nBecause he's when he comes to these things and this is one of those things you like do you think's going to say anything crazy isn't well first of all Trump is he is a person that is\nHe feeds\nOff whatever they give him the energy tonight will be huge the crowds already lining up to see him or massive it's incredible to see what's going on\n\nHe's going to feed off that and if they're feeling and he's feeling it yeah I think I think the reality is he he's definitely thinking about it he wants to put in it I think sometimes other countries don't take him serious until they taken serious because they've paid a price for it\nWe got to figure it out and Mexico was the one right now that is either going to put a stop to it or I think that they're gonna look if there's if those people are allowed to come through there is going to be some issues not only with the new trade agreement but also with the fact that you're going to be sending people\nLike the military to the more we have many challenges but as we have just proven with our trade agreement we can with mutual respect for the sovereignty and writes each of our two nations tackle these problems and I'm confident that we will resolve them together\nConfident\nWe shall see we shall see this as Mexico's foreign minister minister uh Lewis a v the gallery\nSomething that we agree fully with the government of President Trump and secretary from there and then moved to serve the ... the root causes of the Central American migrations particularly to create a development opportunities\nYeah yeah that's essentially what it is\nSo corrupt and there's such a mess and while we well I have every right to blame the Republicans and Democrats for the failure to fix immigration here when it comes to the continual immigration you have to\nAnd that is not good for us and that sure in the

and integrity Bob Mueller investigation already\nSaid even though that's not done that you would do to impeach him so according to the constitution that means that the president has committed the crime of treason primer bribery or a high crime and misdemeanor which one of those do you think the president had committed\nYou were just like with Kevin uh he was already in trouble the minute they announced him they're already going against him having never talk to them uh it it's a game that they are going to play and this is what's gonna happen\nAnd ah he's still going to go after him and this is this is what you're going to see moving forward I don't know [laughter]\nWe'll see you know posters and people who who look it absentee ballots and ballots that are mailed and they look at certain things are there are differing on how close this race is going to be in fact in some areas they think the Republicans are much better shape holding the house off oh it's interesting to find out but better still\nFor all intents and purposes with all the money he's got trailing cruised by about ten points and I don't see that changing three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... shows your Twitter tweet at us yes kids\nHe's the sheriff David Clarke judge ... [noise]\n... mentioned show [noise]\n\nAs far as we become a nightmare for you do you dream of getting a full night's rest boy am I going to have those days are long behind me\nThey said to my pillow I'm sleeping like a baby these days and so can you my pillow adjusted the shape you want and need tossed those flat worn out pillows and letting my pillow changed the way you sleep wherever they're the one and only solution to your sleepless nights my pillows are made right here in the usa with a hundred percent machine washable and Dr ...

[noise] I talk to one of those points a TNT I find off the stage [laughter] [noise]\nIn what I think needs to happen is and that's after November because we have to win\nIn November the GOP has to maintain control both chambers of Congress\nAnd then we can um you know hold her feet to the fire after that because they've had two years the G O P Congress they squandered two years to finally fix this thing they had the numbers than any Democrats support although they probably did because you've got some weak need a GOP members on\nOn immigration but it's going to take leadership and I think the leadership\nKids start in the White House I think the four pillars that the president\nProposed on his state of the union address was a great start the Congress didn't act on it but he has some leverage to\nThere's certain things that the Congress once we have some spending bills coming up I think one comes up after 'em or the November election and the president a previously has threatened to veto that and shut the government down because there's no wall funding in there and that's a highlight of his um his uh fixing immigration\nSo you know he could towards some arms some backdoor negotiations and a lot of this can go on a in the you know in the in the back rooms of the halls of Congress the negotiating doesn't have to be done out in front but\nThis president has done a great job of messaging and he knows how to tweak these these are individuals in Congress including the GOP or to get something done because he's not doing the president's not doing this for political purposes he's doing this because he made a promise to the American people and he was going to secure the southern border\nAnd that he was going to um keep these are illegal immigrants from flooding into the country there were a drain on our public resources\nComing into the language barrier shipped to set up new bilingual\nPrograms that stuff costs money that that the American people have to pay for I found them interesting in the New York times column and that's the New York times pointed out they're fleeing Honduras because of crime\nOf gangs or poverty and no jobs for a minute I thought they were talking about the city of Chicago or maybe Baltimore and I'm thinking if people in Baltimore American citizens and in the American ghetto who living gang infested neighborhoods climate for high crime like Chicago Baltimore and other serious cities\nAre very few jobs although that's being improved by this president in high poverty where do they migrate to side suggested in a tweet tongue in cheek to form a chair a van and migrate out of the city of Chicago in and out of the city of Baltimore these Democrats strongholds and or go find some other areas some other city\nOr whether prospects are going to be better safe for neighborhoods better schools so on and so forth\nYeah I mean look I mean to get out of Cabrini Green and some of the areas out there that are in Chicago that are that that are that are dangerous and and if you really trying to escape the violence\nOr talking to a a share of ah David Clarke America First action senior vice are over there are so you know we've got the the midterms with about Eighteen days away and the thought is you know the enthusiasm really picked up because of Kavanaugh but like anything ... there's got to be somewhat of a perfect storm happening\nAnd the facts are that the perfect storm may be happening with this caravan the likelihood of the house I mean that's that's the big thing because I think a lot of ... I think even up to a month ago\nThe Republicans were essentially in a position where they said you know what I I don't think we're going to hold the house we might pick up as a a Senate seat or do they have too many defend over there especially in in in red states but the house look dead are now their stock that they may save the house what would that do for\nAllusions that this this two nominees coming out this blue wave\nSure there's been a renewed sense of urgency on the ah with the the the ... Republican voters I've sensed that I travel the country continually and ah I talked to Republican voters there's been renewed sense of urgency\n... because of cabin on because I think people are seeing what could happen if if the Democrats get control of things one of the things that China id\nThe RMC about\nThere was NO PLAN to to uh increase the number of seats they were just willing to see this over and say well we're ... we're probably going to lose a few we're probably gonna lose um uh some in the house there was NO PLAN to increase the number the number so you have to go on off it's you can't defend in elections\nYou have to have a plan to increase turnout to increase your margin set you old already and I've never seen one from the are and see like you mentioned is talk about well we might hang on to this we might go there's no hanging on so\nUm you know that's why the president's out there doing everything that he can but look you've got to have good candidates\nAnd and and the president can't waste of time going to try to prop up some bad candidate\nWas running a bad campaign and thinking you know where the candidate thinks well I'll just called jump in and everything will be okay that's not how elections work and look I'm a veteran of elections I had to run a four times for elected sheriff in Milwaukee County to county ... million people I had to get people to vote for me I was the largest vote getter\nDemocrat or Republican\nOr in my uh in my county and there's a reason for that okay I Know how to get people out you got to have a good message you have to energize people and that's what I'm doing right now on behalf of I'm I'm the president to America First action rallying the base so\nI tell people forget about the polls forget about all these blow hards on TV these talking heads he's pugnacious dictators forget about what you\nHis turnout turnout turnout whatever side can get\nTheir base energized enough to actually participate whether it be early voting on election day\nThat's who's gonna win it's that simple this is not rocket science like pollsters tried to make it talking about\nA registered voters or likely older no it's the people who are actually going to show up were fill out a ballot and send it in if the early vote and if our side does that and here's what I tell people that I I Can't just count on you I Know you're going to pull you gotta find two or three people\nWho have a lackadaisical attitude about mid terms and they may not vote\nAnd you have to inspire an energize them take them to the polls with two or three you can probably do that within your family you got a nephew or niece that just turned Eighteen or Nineteen twenty and and hasn't voted yet because that that that demographic uh tend not to get them out there because if we do that\nIf we do like we didn't twenty sixteen\nWe can maintain we meaning the conservatives you know GOP I think the two different things\nBut we can maintain control of this house because that's what the president's going to need to continue his vision of making America great again if the dams ... uh when the house\nI'll tell you right now the the the Trump vision is going to be dead and the water skit about wall funding forget about fixing the immigration\nAt least that's going to be a palatable to to us on the right uh you know you can and they're going to threaten the tax cuts they're gonna you all you're going to hear about the next two years impeachment investigation\nThat's what's at stake your gun rights are at stake I mean up you know white to likes that says a lot at stake here\nAnd remind people Trump's on on the ballot or so for people who are ...
