Shabaab which is linked to the cup throats and al ...\nAl Shabaab struck at an Italian unit in Mogadishu and I looked for the follow up to that I was a suicide bombing attack al Shabaab is a an indigenous\nUprising but it has trends national reach so therefore I was I was puzzled by the U.S strike ... an airstrike on the southern Somali coast in these last days and bill reports on it bill you keep a\nVery careful map of the U.S airstrikes in Somalia for this year this is the southern Somalia co south of Mogadishu what do we know about what was the point of it these look like pinprick San a map and I don't see the overall strategy for the U.S to participate\nSo you a strategy for us\nAli national army in their operations against ah the problem is that in the end it's small and smiley national are which is really any\nBut it looks more like a a a clan militias are ripping Clinton was so in this particular strike um they hit an area that was very close to where the smiley national army was trying to clear ...\nThey're the defense ministry called a a safe haven um is is an area that out the twenty thirty miles ... ... um which was run by Shabaab several years ago\nSo this was a you know a lot of\nThe interesting thing we're tracking these strikes in Mali in Yemen and Libya and places like that they try to\nUse military in these government tries to call them out of earth strikes but really they're they're military operations off in a sometimes they are ours cells and their their networks but they're all off ...\nMilitary operations to fight these insurgent groups and you have to keep in mind that these terrorist groups in the in the third group the one in the team that out tighter and their finances are affiliates or whatever you want to call them their primary goal is to\nEstablish Emirates in in the furthering the goal of this global\nShow the insurgency is a key part of it the terrorism or not you know bombs suicide bombings gets western targets in his I think that's just a tactic ...\nLet me see if I understand this bill so the U.S military and I'm presuming these are\nDrone strikes not I'm not warplanes the U.S military is an air wing of the African Union forces fighting in Somalia and\nUh the African Union forces are fighting indigenous uprisings nothing to do with\nA you know indigenous insurgency but he's also is Titus branch in Somalia so you know it's it's not one or the other it's both Shabaab is you know local insurgent group that is an Islamic shirts group that pledge allegiance to al ... who has out titled eaters\nUm and it's you know in its commands and its\nLeaders and fighters abroad to gain experience\n... al Shabaab is part of al ... network is part of out tighter and but yes you're correct US military is often operating in support of the African Union holiday army that's where she writes like this particular strike was they like to call them ... that's not the case\nRight right now it's sort of this is a remnant of your mom and try and say we are not\nYes we appeal to Congress because you pay for this at least be articulate when we use drones knees are not counterterrorism strikes these are\nThese are police operations I think that was the polite way to talk about in the twentieth century Tom the Taliban is looking to an Afghan election or to say that the Taliban is going to disrupt it is an understatement a you also mentioned that the Islamic state is involved how so\nWell you know both the call by the Islamic state of course uh you know denied the legitimacy of Afghanistan's elections and what's the key thing here is that the U.S government has been quite delusional about what they think the Taliban is willing to do with the Taliban leaders are willing to do\nYou know early this year the state department actually called on a tall bond to turn to turn over their bullets for about ... and to get out and vote and become part of the political process Afghanistan\nThis is completely inconsistent with every piece of public rhetoric you'll see come out of the call bond there is no evidence that\nI'm tall bunch theme in that came out just to de emphasize the fact that they reject the Afghan Afghan elections which are coming up on October twentieth I Believe the parliamentary elections they reject among numerous grounds they claim that the elections are basically just a sort of a ... at least on for the foreign forces meaning us us\nThey will reject the legitimacy of the Afghan government and they claim that basically it's their religious duty to disrupt or prevent the elections from going off\nNow that Taleb on uh like the Islamic state is very careful in the statement anyway rhetorically to say that they're going to try and be careful not to kill Afghan civilians indiscriminately and they're going to try and target security forces that are in charge of preserving the elections are safeguarding the elections\nWhat's different about that now of course they will if they do strike out they will end up killing civilians but what's different about that at least in terms of their rhetoric is Islamic state doesn't care Islamic state says we're going to go after if you're participating in the elections as your your civilian or otherwise\nThen you have the right to kill you and so the Islamic state has absolutely no compunction about going out and killing whoever is taking part in the elections where's the tall blond because they're a little more sensitive toured\nSort of how they're they're perceived publicly and in terms of popular appeal at least want to put a little bit of a shrine on their sort of the violence\nBut the Taliban is again the election not correct they're not they're not in no way in ... ... after\nCouldn't be any clear that they are against the elections and here's the point John ... the whole us strategy in Afghanistan is about right now we we call the strategy is about trying to get the Taliban lay down its arms and ... and recognize the legitimacy of the Afghan government and participate in the political process\nYet they couldn't tell us anymore or any more often than they already are that they reject the Afghan government and the political process and it's against the sugary laws against the religious obligations\nAnd that they basically need to undermine the Afghan political process because all it is for them is basically just a sort of a a puppet of of the foreign invaders\nUp to be a failure or at least considerably diminished considering how much in the old days you remember when we used to make a big deal about an election Afghanistan now it looks like they're going to hold it in in in a small club in capital and call it an election\nYeah that's absolutely right after an official is there a lot of places are not going to be open right\nThat these elections are largely going to be held in the in the major cities and the more constantly breaks that most of the Afghans are not going to be a represented in this election and now that is a major failures seven years\nAfter the U.S invasion that you know it's\nThe ... in it which is worse than a than at any point\nAnd that polling centers camp in Afghanistan to represent the will of the Afghan people that the Taliban are very clear that the government is it legitimate that aid you view elections is illegitimate and

if I followed this reporting\n[noise] yes well you know the Chinese are blaming us for the cancellation of the security dialogue but we canceled only because the Chinese said that their top the

Chinese and they will reciprocate\nWell you know President Trump explicitly try that last year he said look I'm going to go easy on the Chinese on trade if they help on North Korea well they didn't help on North Korea they took that as a big green light to violate sanctions we've got to do something different and you know I'm not saying that pressure is going to absolutely work\nBut it can't do any worse than the cooperation path I think what President Trump needs to do is to start sanctioning Chinese banks\nReally imposing costs on Beijing for transferring ballistic missile and nuclear weapons technology to the north Koreans for violating sanctions for doing all the rest of it you know we have all these disagreements with China we've got to have it out with the Chinese because as

if you read the rest of what Moon Jae in said when he spoke to a hundred and fifty thousand North Korea is in the stadium\nYou know essentially it was written by North Korean propaganda is um and so essentially we've got a South Korean president who I I don't know what's in his head John but what he's doing is sort of hurting his own freedom his own democracy his own society his nation he's

Democrats in the Senate butter saying let's not must not be so hasty about this David\nOh look I think what you're going to hear from those Democrats is that they're going to use the the oversight power of the Congress and\nYou know what we know they will do is hall of everybody they can have testified before a a house committee and somehow get 'em up there and the subpoenas role in by the truckload at the White House from the Democratic a house committee chairman but that's what they take the house they're trying\nTo shove this idea of impeachment of the Republican a fantasy that's been made up\nAnd the only question is does that lasts for ten days from now we're we revert to what had been the meaning of this election cycle Mr fund\n[noise] well I agree with David the Democratic officials and consultants don't want to talk about impeachment but their base can't help itself\nAs a message that is going getting through a lot of the grass roots is we have to impeach Trump and not just trumpet Kavanaugh and that's what this election is about\nSo the the the overall thirty thousand foot message is responsible and prudent as David says but what was the message a lot of activists who sending an individual districts are uh we're going to get them and we're going to impeach them and that's one of the media are signal is you\nDavid I saw a news item in saying that some group and the Democratic party was not going to spend money or ... pulling money back from the the the Democratic race in in Tennessee did you see that wins that substantive or just a quick reaction\nWell look I mean it's a it's a major democratic group I'm part of the I got the one Democrat who speculated they might have done that it just broke bread is a solid or because you know you could give them something to crow about I mean he doesn't need any money so if they're going to pick Brett ascended to disown\nThan you know that's fine as far as the Democrats are concerned but but it's true that the base has John Fund mentioned\nThe base on the left was all ginned up about this I don't know how much Senate Democrats wanted is is that just like the Obamacare shut down in twenty Thirteen that the Republican base demand it or at least a portion of it\nThat are sort of had to take this all the way and this is what happens when you don't have a leader of the party and the base thinks that you're a minority should be able to do a lot more than I can actually do\nSo you do not believe that President at Bradenton was hurt by that remark because he's already on the TV if anything he'd be help\nI mean I run an ad and say the liberals or disown him right now got Dave\nThat is McCotter W.

polls yes and so massive massive numbers the difference was the organization that's what happened in twenty sixteen\nThey are and she had been working in the the DNC didn't see this because they were busy with you know the whole fusion GPS and you know Christopher Steele Russians and all that\nAh but the orange the where they were putting their efforts was much like they in fact uh some state that is they designed it\nAh after that model of getting people to the polls that's what it's all about you can call it what you want but at the end of the day it is getting people to get out and vote and\nThat's what happened with those states that that Trump ended up winning that nobody saw and it was that you know boots on the ground type you know community organizing the organization you know that she's trying to speak on\nIt it really doesn't apply internally I mean\nWhipping the votes is one thing\nThe Democrats do have had a playbook for a long long time and will long after a Casio Cortez is gone you and I kind of touched on the other day of kind of dismissing things being able to turn their head on a a Joe mansion\nWorry about things like that when they can they know they can use Joe mansion for other things so\nThe\nThe entire equation is not going to change in fact I don't think the Democrats are the party would want it\nTo change because on many issues ah they'll do what they have done in the past which includes the kind of behavior we saw with Obamacare we need to pass it so you can see what's in it which include lying to the American people about what's what it's going to do well\nAnd she was saying that uh we need to organize the pressure's not within a you know the the the body which would mean the pressure doesn't come from you know well whipping up votes at the pressure comes from the outside electorate will that happens all the time that that that ... that that stadium are nothing new the other thing is when\nNow you have the excuses no she's not a leader of the party she's not a leader of the party you well you may not believe that she is and she isn't right now but the mainstream media believes that she is\nThat's why she gets on President did television time from the mainstream media\nAs a a candidate for Congress ... who has one nothing yet who was a bartender a year ago\nThey had they said you know they basically are still leader yeah the DNC is basically said she's ... she's the future right I mean she may not she's not the leader of the party right now but if she's the future that's what that's what the media is going to turn to the reason the media turns to that is because\nThey see what's going on with the left by the way uh you know from the outside in\nWho who's leading the Democrats right now and has been leading the Democrats what force what movement is leading the Democrats well it's ... it's overall\nWhat's the problem with that is that how many different protests are they're\nThe reason right now that they can dismiss someone tomorrow and they are a Beto O'Rourke does not need a a former president Brock Obama to campaign for I'm In Texas is because\nThey're so over you and it doesn't matter who you are\nWait a minute though you know it's going to happen ... if\nIf overwork loses Obama's going to come out and say he should have used my endorsement well that's what does he go party will say he reached shy he rejected my endorsement shouldn't be rejecting right Obama's a endorsement but really I mean I'm I'm Glad you brought that up because that's something else from last week\nThat we really didn't get a chance to talk about but really that's unbelievable it shows you\nKnow you and I you and I started working together Thirteen Years ago so you know we were we were together or three years when Obama first got elected right and and we remember every single moment of it and we remember the the political I dollar tree for\nPresident or an Obama remember his you know the the DNC speech remember when they when they did it from the stadium with Greek columns and everything else and people were falling over him and it was\nAnd now look at it today now out of it now I ... yeah our our goal is to have the liberal takeover of a of a of Texas A M ... or ... nah we don't want writer years after he's out now we don't want him white made\nBecause and and that's it what what a Casio courthouse doesn't include here is internally externally\nThe political pressure by the way it always comes from the outside a that's a course it and and it's always the people on it like we said yesterday about Republicans if if the Republicans were jailed last year or as the president\nThen we probably would be if they were jailed on the issue of health care we would see Obamacare gone completely but that wasn't the case and so that that there is one example of political pressure being\nA president in in in one year and then gone and the next well with the left the problem is is your political pressures coming from every different splinter group right it which moves in multiple directions tell me which direction you go in are you going to be with the feminists are the transgender Z\nBecause you can't on their boat right now they're fighting with each other ... as we predicted\nRight three or four years and and so that's the problem that they created they they basically over a couple of generations they were out a ... and indoctrinate in children and and and young people\nTo believe that it was that it's right to wake up today and find a new oppressor find a new reason to be a victim and that might include somebody with that was with you and part of your group yesterday\n[noise]\nPresident Obama or just not really into you anymore\nYeah I mean I Would have wanted was speaking engagements and that but that Iran take our but think about it shows you\nHow the political wins yes Ken Ken just blow\nThe one of the probably the biggest political idol of my lifetime\nAnd make it so he's not even relevant two years after he's out of office ... years are running right from him saying that don't need an don't need his endorsement here and that's because and and you and I've talked about we thought this might happen because we saw some of the signs\nBecause the left believes he truly what's into liberal right that he truly he was he wasn't in it really for the cause\nHe was in it just because of the gang\nAs far left as they thought maybe they weren't really his own party as closely as as many thought he was going to eight six six Ninety run

I guess I guess the point that I'm asking\nIs is in ... is\nThe Republicans are the majority Washington the Democrats you that's that's my point why is that there was a ... gone I mean that's what I mean it's bad for Democrats or what is their issue that they can use their point\nThere is well what would there be how do you spend a good economy because what else matters to people what else matters if you're going to work every day you got a solid job and possibly even offers on the table\nImmigration is not an issue they could use they still believe that they can illegal immigration they can't\nRight it's not an issue right it's not it's not\nYou know the whole thing or what what was going on at the borders you know months ago earlier this year\nThat didn't even resonate with the American people because they looked at the facts surrounding that and so how do you what do you spend here you cannot stand the good economies there's no way to spin it into a negative the borders\n[noise] well even if that situation we're in right now if we ... that would help Republicans [noise] they say illegal immigration is\n\nRight and ... year round well I think you're probably going to see pushback ... first of all I guess we'd have to see what the participation rate is\nWell once I was ... the the wife cities like Houston in LA\nThey don't want more smog what gas stations going to be the first to put want to put a Fifteen in when you know as well as I Do on the Internet is going to be flying you can damage your car you know of of a faster you could damage your lawn mower faster if you use e Fifteen mhm\nRight that it should just be ten percent should be the max and putting Fifteen Percent is is just ridiculous\nIt's trying to appease the farmers but you can't get there from here because\nThere is no great motivator there really is no incentive even with changing how the credits work even with changing because changing it to sell it year round\nHow does that ... benefit those that are blending at well okay you could blend it year round and you wouldn't have to change up at the refinery level as often that is not that's not promising to them because ultimately it automatically comes back down to the consumer right\nSo the mandate is on the blend here's my question\nIf the mandate is on the blend right at ten percent but the mandate isn't there for Fifteen Percent but those companies the the the the oil companies that are putting it out let's say they responded to the incentive of of changing the credits\nAnd we went to I don't know it was sixty Seventy percent of the ethanol or the gasoline sold would would have a Fifteen Percent or ethanol content\nOn the market what what happened with the consumer many of the consumers will be driven to look for the ten percent seek out the temp right when that happens and you have a glut of the ...

a a coming in we had a discussion on on on Hurricane Florence ... you and I talked to briefly not we didn't spend a lot of time on it about\nThe Washington Post piece remembered that said the Trump Administration was complicit ... I mean that in right in a in Hurricane Florence and uh you know we talked about you know the the president\nAnd all was supposed to be about reducing global warming until they found out from farm to tank it actually produces more global warming gases\nBecause of what you have to do to actually make up and all and we just mentioned that the president doesn't bring up a global warming is just oh the government needs to uh get involved in this in order to help the farm right um and then we have the United nations\nComing out and saying we're doomed\n\nBecause of global warming that we are uh you have a Al Gore traveling the United nations as well that we have twelve more years\nYes we'd twelve years now I I Know I Know you're we're already passed the first twelve years aren't we yeah yeah you never was there but this twelve years they made it\nAnd so so how do we solve it ... well the United nations special climate reports suggest a tax\nOn carbon dioxide emissions would be need to be as high as twenty seven thousand dollars per ton at the\nEnd of the century to effectively limit global warming ... that means you would have to have a two hundred and forty dollar\nPer gallon tax on gasoline in that year huh now should such a recommendation be adopted yeah in twenty thirty the report says a carbon tax would need to be as high as\nFifty five hundred dollars that's the equivalent of forty nine dollars per gallon\nGas tax by twenty thirty well then the experts\nWe'll be right cars won't be on the road to what he thirty day won't be anywhere I won't be able to get it on my desk but his little centrally be a paper weight\nOr ... you know and so all of a sudden we're back to you know global warming again as we said\nI'm just ... we're we're waiting for the race card to be played a because the global warming card now is being played and as we talked about in all seriousness we talked about the the Obama administration the one thing that they brought up more than anything was the biggest problems were raised\nAnd climate change and then it all the studies that were done and we went over this I don't know dozens of times during the Obama administration under I go right where they would lift the top twenty five or the top thirty problems the things always on the bottom of the list was raised and climate change him from the perspective of people looking at it

you're on TALK radio we talked about the president is not the up and all plan earlier you're on red eye Hi\nGood morning guys how are very good at All right well one of the reasons they start incorporating up an all or allow all into the fuel was that\nYeah it turns out it was a carcinogen being put out into the air so they started replacing out with at all alcohol\nYou can't have two hundred prove alcohol it Tigris GOP it absorbs moisture from the air so those are going to get it's like maybe one Ninety five one Ninety something like that so it's great for the farmers to increase the percentage of alcohol and the fuel bland\nHowever alcohol doesn't hold the same amount of energy right for him as gasoline does your do your mileage fuel mileage so it's screwing that consumers what that's doing\nYeah well look we we had no problem with the ... we we had no problem when we talked about this before with ... for uh the anti knocking capabilities that's not what a temper sent exists\nNo ... percent mandate existed initially for global warming right\nYeah we ... we have not our problem is the fact that yeah it's great for the farmers will anything would be great if the government mandates that you must make something and the consumer must buy it it's always great for that industry to that kind of monopoly the great government dictates\nAll right you need to do this for the what's the reason well for global warming well what's the reason now to make sure you have a job mhm for video robot here's your forecast\nMichael is a category one hurricane slashing Cuba and is now for tests to be a dangerous major hurricane when it smacks the U.S Gulf Coast tomorrow according to the national Hurricane Center\nThe forecast indicates Michael May be a category three hurricane with wins from between one hundred eleven to one hundred twenty nine miles an hour when it strikes life threatening storm surge is almost imminent\nAlong most portions of the Florida coast in the Big Bend area we'd be looking at two well built framed homes incurring major damage trees can be snapped in these kind of wins we're looking at uprooted trees and electricity being out potentially for several days the water on availability we've seen it all before\nAnd there are so lucky are tracking hurricane Michael on right on the radio on meteorologist John trout thanks so much John eight six six Ninety\n\nThose are the people you would go to to to decide at least in my opinion whether you should declassify it or not and I say you're a secretary of state former CIA director because they claimed that some allies or didn't want some things to be released and our initial thing was well wait a minute what are their allies no they don't know what's in their right how how do they know that the\nAnd we were initially puzzled when he said he was going to give it to uh the inspector General Michael Horowitz until we realize\nThey were they ... that it went whoa look at\nThis but yeah the conclusion we came to was that if you were looking if you're looking to give this to the inspector general the department of justice then you're basically asking him to do an investigation\nTo issue a report they said they X but they asked for an expedited process here from Mr Horwitz\nAnd the only reason you do that is because of the role of Michael Horowitz the inspector general's office in in the overall is to do what to look at possible fraud or misdeeds done within the ... of justice\nFraud ah around during the election and\nOf that would be and if you think about it because I I'm thinking of a a a John Bolton in the room with the president and also or his chief of staff or Kelly is well looking at that and saying\nIf you come out and make a conclusion or draw conclusions from this information by ...\nSolution well first of all the executive branch is not really that there is no prosecutorial power there you would have to go through a the the department of justice itself but where would you start at the department of justice if you believe that people that are either they're in place or were there before\nCommitted a you know a crime possibly or there was fraud or corruption or any of those items that would be on the plate of the inspector general's office you would start with Michael Horowitz it's the only way because beyond that you're looking at just a political move that's all the way it would be played\nIt would be well the president saying that's and that's not what we think if you take that off the out of the political arena\nAnd that's exactly what you do you\nThink about the fact that you're not sending it to the attorney general even that could be seen as a political move because he's an appointee by the president right while our mayor is supposed to be a ton of us and you know ... and ...\nIs someone that's been in place since before he was appointed by Obama he was appointed by Obama but more importantly ... that's that's a key to opening the door and ending the discussion about whether it's politically motivated more importantly\nOn top of that you add the fact of what the inspector general is designed to do and the kind of report you might see\nFrom the inspector general's office when we went through the inspector general's report\nAh on the FBI\nThere were a number of things in the uh the Hillary email investigation a number of things there that we found now\nIt you're taking this I guess otherwise mundane report and you're trying to basically build the narrative as to what was going on in this case of the other report of at the FBI under the direction\n... ah was handled into and then part late into the Russian investigation and all of that now you have here by the way I think that's part of it to\nYou already have an existing report that covers part of the timeline in fact uh the most important part of the timeline that would be outlined in potentially in this classified are now de classified information\nSo now ... having already done the investigation\nOn the FBI and how they handled the Hillary email investigation and then the Russia investigation\nNow has all of that work done the legwork done there to possibly lends support to this new investigation um and it's I think interesting and I think very key that the president\nTurned it over to Horwitz and basically washed his hands up and for now\nI think it's important to remember Giuliani has been saying that he believes it perjury happen that right you had somebody in the FBI verify because that's his charge okay and and again we're this is going on speculation by what\nPeople who claimed are familiar with the matter a bully even and he is a former prosecutor what he believes his that\nHe believes there is

it doesn't work over and over but Britain's about just the\nAdvertising and the genesis communications network Google smart way to reach his potential customers would be most affordable national advertising rates period distorted today was here in the news this communications network just email ... a GCE mom don't go\nFor\nTony three minutes after the our home reading the official latest\nWarning on hurricane Michael comes from the national weather service dated twelve midnight eastern time and so we we will take a listen to what National Weather service meteorologist Nick PA crow had\nOn hurricane Michael at that time\nBut it's been upgraded to a hurricane as of the eleven o'clock advisory and uh you'll notice that are now been now is forecasts become a major hurricane before making landfall in the Florida Panhandle they're so I'm so certainly um that's that's a a sort of the\nBig change and and what we've seen from the last advisory from the hurricane center\nBut notice how uh you know the remnants are expected to come up across the Carolinas or later in the week so um we are going to have to deal with that with those remnants um the good news like I said it seems to be at least according to the forecast according to the official forecast\nIt's moving it will be moving very quickly so that should help to limit 'em that rain when we're looking at the a summary of greatest\nWatches warnings um you know a system like this would would leftovers would tend to give us a few wind gusts up around thirty maybe thirty five\nOr or slightly higher I'm In a certainly you know any trees that are half leaning over already or weaken from Florence there could be a few down trees and then subsequent power outages and that's why we have the wind and the power outages limited\nUm but but probably the biggest concern of course will be um how much rain we get out of it you know how hard it comes down initially for the flash flooding risk and then the subsequent river flooding which is kind of already alluded to wear expecting mainly across the eastern Piedmont and coastal plain\nThey're very smart they are the national weather service losing his grown very very quickly a that was\nA six and a half hours ago that was actually declare it as a hurricane which would be kept one mhm now it's gotten to the middle of the Gulf of Mexico and it is gone from a cat one storm to a cat three store\nNow when it makes landfall they always sold out there is no question about that that's the way it works the wind speeds go down and the speed that travels goes down but it is now a hurricane a category three if it gets to for\nYou're talking about very very dangerous and you're talking about sixteen to twenty four inches of rain in the strike area I Am seeing about twenty five models and I have never seen such a narrow with a probability\nFor hurricane in many a year this thing the\nEuropean model has a tendency always to lean more to the west than the American model stone and why it is something in there in the program it's\nSimilar all within about a Fifteen mile radius who that is the type of this striking in Panama City Florida near Tallahassee which of course is think capital if that happens\nThat means that will probably spare areas like New Orleans it'll be fringe in areas like Biloxi, Mississippi\nBut if it comes on shore ass off for not us three it's now predict the come onshore as the three if it comes on as the three this won't happen but if it comes on as a poor\nIt could still be at hurricane strength when would reach the outer outer reaches of Atlanta ga cheese which is about three hundred mile drawn and at that time it would dissipate turn to the right and probably exit North America\nVia the Caroline Caroline this in the as actually are a little area where we saw Florence coming onshore it might leave but we're talking about storm surge in that Panama City Tallahassee\nArea of maybe eight to twelve feet which means two or three days after the storm it could be as much as Fifteen feet but for storms this time of year to get all the way to the you know Lance of Atlanta you're talking about a lot of territory\nAnd the Syrians are on usual conditions all the way down to Tampa Bay Orlando um\nPanama City Pensacola Mobile Alabama Albany, Georgia even up into Jacksonville, Florida\nVery unusual and Jacksonville basically a city built on water if the water\nOr or as you were saying when this makes landfall it could be as strong as a cat three that means winds will be between a hundred and eleven to a hundred and twenty\nNose or ALS is for our main wins that means gusts aboard of a hundred and fifty miles [noise]\nLife threatening storm surge is possible along portions of the Florida Gulf Coast regardless of the stars exact track or intensity this is according to the uh again the national Hurricane Center well built framed homes may incur major damage or remove all of roof deck ing and cable and\nMany trees will be snapped or an rooted blocking numerous roads electricity and water will be unavailable for several days two weeks after the storm passes\nYou may see power outages overweight for Mobile Alabama to Jacksonville, Florida\nThat could have a quite a large swath there once again this enters and makes landfall as a cat three and a cat too you're talking about multiplying that not adding on adding ten times as powerful\nAs they ... or ... or back to it so it's important bottom of the hour means it's time for either how apropos with me in a whole lot more

President Trump does uh he turns the cap rallies in charge of the reality shows\nAnd that's what he knows how to produce\nA the problem though for Joe and people like yourself is it's successful\nFears somehow articulated what a lot of people feel which has boy I guess everybody gang up too much on this guy it was unfair and I think it was a time and sharing that Donald Trump\nAlmost with the help the Democrats and then made or something that should have played very strongly into the Democrats hands and it's something that is going to on ballads help Republicans especially running for the Senate because by painting it as a notion of mobs of people who try to destroy just nice\nBarry an extraordinary story and to do at the Benjamin Franklin you might know did was ask personally by Steve Jobs to do his biography will while he was still alive and to be as brutal as you want to be\nBut uh the the he's analyzing this is as a way in which he's not taking sides used to run CNN by the way\nSo he's not taking sides you know where he stands he's probably outraged by dropping can recoil but the notion of him being president I imagine but for him to say that it's just that's called accurate analysis accurate analysis and why the guy we spoke about yesterday Michael ... cut sixteen\nRight under Donald Trump's hands whether what is often the way Michael Gerson writes about it that way understandably a passionate Democrats self had to show the same fashion\nThat some Republicans have but they play then to the hands of those who thought this was a mob rule\nAnd that people want listening to both sides and it was a shame that the Democrats in my opinion so overplay their hand because up until then whichever way the vote when he was going to help the Democrats now if the Democrats lose the mid term election\nI think the Democratic politicians in there that really ought to go into another line of work they're not you know you can't win the midterms you ought to get a different type of job\nLet me just tell you the big story in the Democratic strategist who's paying all these protesters one thing is to be outraged the other one is doing it as a job\nSo you go there and you have a strategy of how to head off a senator you have a strategy about how to interrupt the dinner you have a strategy about how to get on camera and they're all getting paid they're all getting paid and yeah it does take a grade the authenticity if you're protesting something I think you should be there I don't think it should be a profit oriented adventure deal\nI mean maybe for the travel agent if they want to build in some travel incentives for hotel and buses but once you get the\nFor a point of view by other people who have a lot of money and they want you to go ahead and do the legwork unbelievable but that's what we're seeing any of these a hundred percent right the guy that I Am so glad is lost the prestige and glow is Michael ...\nAnd his sweating the person who came forward and said\nYou know that a judge Kavanaugh then Brett Kavanaugh was out there might have been spiking the punch probably never saw him might have been involved with groups expos never there might have been part of my sexual assault but I don't remember really those are the allegations Michael ... brought forward and almost everybody to a person said that\nHis allegations were so out of left field and an substantiated it ruined the entire cause it made forward seem less credible and Ramirez as you know\nThe freshman at Yale could not remember originally what happened took care of herself a week Democrats crawling over campus trying to find somebody that saw something about something that Kavanaugh did\nAnd the New York times that I can write this the New Yorker said I'd love to write this\nSo that's what he's talking about they have thoroughly overplay their hand them for the most part the president to events that you like to take back all the U.S and I my mind should take back over the last twenty days besides that\nHe's been perfect he's been perfect and we'll see if it translates because we know that George Bush could not bring along anybody in his mid term elections and we know that you're up rock Obama had the worst mid term elections of any modern president gradually he lost his party almost everything\nAnd now this president says oh yeah I'm going out\nNow they told I think it was Joe Lockhart a will say no excuse me George Stephanopoulos so that you know when Bill Clinton won the presidency you want to make sure the wind is Margie prevent big losses in the mid term so we went out and they check the POWs after he started helping out congressmen and women and they went down and almost everywhere he appear to have stayed home\nThis is another thing different about President Trump the approval rating might be forty one\nThey're always going crazy and then he creates news down by the other people run maybe Britain disdain because of the things he said well maybe it was a news were newsworthy because of who showed up\nSo this guy is different in every way and by the way he is taking on the number one enemy of America China in every way he died but I'm In South American\nCountries [noise] I talk to one of those points on TNT I find I'm going to teach me the gas station [noise]\nThat he was going to redistribute wealth and give people more or something and make it free and there are folks that tend to believe that that is never been a successful economic model anywhere in the world and that's what a socialist or economic model\nIs and that's what we have to try to educate these voters are to include what we see with these threats coercion intimidation and the violence emanating from the progressive socialist left\nToday so what's at stake I mean right now there's a seven point difference in the generic ballot or in between the Republicans and Democrats were not voting for people how do you feel about the party seven points is doable for the party in power doesn't mean it's an obtainable board asked what do you expect to happen in the next four weeks\nI think in the next four weeks there has to be a clear delineation about uh the path that\nThe United states of America is on right now would you look at all of our economic success and the path that an opposition party wants to take it tours and again just look at the images of people climbing on statues there at the Supreme Court banging on the walls is this what we're really what do we really want to move away from the rule of law towards\nA rule of the mob and that's\nThat's really the the question we have to ask ourselves and what you have people like Tom Perriello leadership in the Democratic party that\nAre not denounce in this day are truly encouraging or of it that's not what we want to be an American\nI didn't think so so we're we at right now Greg Valerie he's a a political columnist\nI think that the Republicans have a file in jars sorrows and Maxine Waters and Michael Abernathy knock on the air and the entire Democratic Party but they do have a child and I think that in rent that threats or purple districts where the Republican days we're kind of indifferent\nThey're motivated now so it makes a difference but today is what October ... who knows what's gonna happen between now and election day there can be more wild cards\nThere could be and you see that now all of a sudden CNN is reaching for some type of twenty sixteen issue Israelis might help Rick Gates with some type of

if they don't want to be a part of the civilized society if they want to continue down their path that they have chosen as a communist country or they're not going to be welcome and we're not going to couch with them that this is no longer the Obama foreign policy of strategic patience\nRemember how President Obama left off\nHis last visit to China the American media was stuck into one small room away from the event and he has praised the United states was forced to leave leave off the cargo entrance and enter a and enter the event ah I mean you know and into the event and then of course me

Lindsey Graham and Joe Lieberman thinks the world ... John McCain she did a lot of that work and go into battlefields in two years after Lieberman left\nSo that might make sense I don't know if she'd be willing to do it but clearly if she wants to run for the Senate again didn't work why wouldn't she except a position like this again\nYeah to ... and the important even making Haley had ah some early yesterday was where President Trump and even in this role as the ambassador to the U.S who was never afraid to speak your mind or the push back\nAgainst the White House printing thought maybe there was a different uh so so all of this in mind a and considering how how\nPenn or we are in a certain relationships particularly with the with China but also North Korea or Iran and they're even our allies on certain things isn't really going to be critical isn't an ...\nI think so either the secretary of state overwhelms the position or works with the position now she was their first upon pale and they did they respect each other but that's why you got to pick the right person to go in there that she did that he or she has to have the respect of Bolton\nAnd the secretary of defense as well as secretary of state therefore if they do have that the seat doesn't shrink\nThe sheet didn't shrink within bachelor Haley it grew but there are a lot of investors United Nations I just think twice and we do this every day who are they\nI mean Susan Rice was there she was invisible Samantha Power was on masking people more than she was actually sticking up for America internationally if you ask me and then you have Nikki Haley came in there and every ... states\nDo you have in this position unless you believe what he believes what about governor Mike Huckabee in that spot if you talk about the uh the synthesis of thought that would make sense\nYeah what I mean there's a lot of great things out there\nAre some really helping your show Charles yeah we're we're always books you know even at the president's press conference ... right now we were finished it wouldn't you\nThe segment but unfortunately we've run out of time and you were cramped up and cry and thank you very much writing great stuff you see Mali nice to Charles [laughter] open up at odds are good or if I ever meter [laughter] more lively all coming out or they think you have anything\nAll right one eight six six eight seven six six side I got some calls to make who just able to go on at the end and do some wild speculation oh I I Know Charles was reading something I don't want to look down on camera Alison could you read to me with this early read out or are you getting the full report is\nNot going to pour it part of what I see here is Trump apparently said something along the lines that she told me not to do that maybe at the end of the year she wanted to take a break he was governor that perhaps even more intense\nOr be installed a promise to gather North Korea is moving along ... thinks the roads Nikki Haley I think they get the heat them overall attack um but yeah from seeing so far\nWell All right when we come back I Want to be able to bring it to use so maybe if I take a break now we'll have a a long enough to do it also get aboard one eight six six for all eight seven six six nine it ends the best way possible but with Nikki Haley steps aside that's a big loss for the Trump Administration your thoughts next spring kill me ...\nPolitics [noise] current events and use that up facts you Brian got a lot more than ... thing with Brian fuel made [noise]\nHave you ever looked as your credit card statement\nFixed interest rate light stream offers credit card consolidation loans from five point eight nine percent a PR with auto pay lower than average credit card interest rate of over Eighteen percent a PR get a loan from five thousand to a hundred thousand dollars\nAnd you can even get your fund as soon as the day you apply white stream plant a tree by the way with every loan they fun I feel great recommending to my friends and my family because it's life's dream\nMy listeners can also get a special discount on top of ice creams already low rates the only way to get the discount is go to light stream dot com slash kill made\nThat L.

somebody else a to a to a ...\nYeah I mean you've got a few weeks a you know you have a few weeks you get everything is going to cool down for a while you know some people are speculating there's a story about flights back and forth to South Carolina I don't think there's a chance of that but it just goes to show you the scrutiny of these cabinet members run by the way this is that should not

if you're the most powerful nation in the world it is a fight it is a battle every day and she has done a phenomenal job in the last two years representing our country to the un\nSo I'm used to have to get your take on the brake cabinet struggled to get his confirmation through and to see how the president has managed by sitting back through most of it\nI really gain an advantage you remember the number one story in America was about Paul Manafort cutting a deal and about Rick Gates testifying against him and now we you know Papadopoulos a gets his sentence in ... coming up in December and everything looks so grim\nAnd now that's a lifetime ago because now everybody's talking about cabinet\nAnd Brian you know there's some that the news cycle move so quickly so fast this president's accomplishing so many things people can't keep up the fight with Brett Kavanaugh lasted\nTwo to three weeks and what we're going to know in two to three weeks from now is that people say boy that seemed like forever ago but what this fight has done I mean this is unified the Republican Party from the establishment wing\nTo the to the outskirts and everywhere in between that their unify because now they see the playbook of the Democrats what the Democrats are talking about is not only if they take over the house will they impeach the president of the United states or attempt to they will trying to teach justice Kavanaugh now this is what's on their agenda and the Republicans are waking up\nWe're so happy with the three point seven percent unemployment rate and the economy doing so well in our national security homeland security all doing better than it's ever done and so they were complacent and now they see it as a reminder of what these what the Democrats want to do\nWhich is not just impeach Donald Trump and remove him from office but now they're talking about potentially impeaching justice Kavanaugh\nFor nothing and this is now motivated the Republicans and we've got four weeks ago early voting starch a very very soon and there are some key battleground states where this president is on the road reminding people to success tonight he'll be an Iowa\nOkay I Want you to hear how this played out ... and he used to run CNN a big town biographer of Steve Jobs Benjamin Franklin major projects this is how he sees this thing how the president played a cut sixteen\nThat's what President Trump does he turns the cap rallies in terms of the reality shows and that's what he knows how to produce or the problem though for Joe and people like\nYourself is successful is somehow articulated what a lot of people single which is boy I guess everybody gang up too much on this guy it was unfair and I think it was a time and sharing that Donald Trump\nAlmost with the help of the Democrats had been made a made something that should have played very strongly and some of the Democrats hands and it's something that is going to on ballads help Republicans especially running for the Senate because by painting it as a notion of mobs of people who try to destroy this nice man\nUh somehow or another he changed the narrative\nAnd I think that some students ... then I probably pain ... shouldn't just say that\n... you write what this president did is he allowed the Democrats to ...\nPeople at a time being arrested at the Capitol the screaming during the confirmation process look\nRepublicans don't do that whether you want it you know can't get on the court or you want and whoever it was you didn't see that with the conservative they let the process play out the Democrats attacked demand is merged his reputation went after his family this is a man who in his spare time unbeknownst to anybody else for the last dozen years\nGoes down and feed the homeless services the poor he\nDoesn't do that so he thought someday could get them onto the bank she did it because at the character that he is and no one wants to talk about that and everything that they threw at him he returned fire and I mean that in a positive sense when he made a very impassioned statement his opening remark on a second confirmation process at at that second hearing\nBut what was most stunning to me of everything that judge Kavanaugh said\nWas that his ten year old daughter\nSaid dad we need to pray for this woman who said these things and we need to make sure that we're praying for her that the type of value that he has distilled on his children and that talks about the character of the man and I think the turning point in his confirmation process\nIs when Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said you know what this is not right and he made such\nA moving argument between him and senator Collins and ultimately Mitch McConnell those three individuals helped to change the public opinion of what Brett Kavanaugh did and the fight that Donald Trump put behind him because I Believe Brian\nNot any other president if it wasn't Donald Trump would have stood behind that nominee in the way that he did and far from the way did and Donald Trump has proven to be successful because of it\nUse with the president said do judge Kavanaugh daughters cutbacks Margaret analyze your father was a great man he's a man of decency character kindness encourage who is devoted his life\nFor your father will defend the journal rights and freedoms of all Americans\nThat you right back at the kids you must have heard some of the negativity the horrible allegation from Michael I've been out of you know there's and I thought that was a great part of the speech\nHe'll Brian I I've seen this in my own life where I was attacked mercilessly during the campaign and my children are old enough to watch the news and go on the Internet and see what happens and I remember\nThen candidate Trump and ultimately President Trump calling my kids and you're saying your dad as doing great work and that goes so far you know and and saying nice things about me and it wasn't just me he's done it so many times to other people because he\nKnows that the media attacks individuals who are associated with Trump in a different manner then if they weren't and we've seen the double standard time and time again we seen it with\nMedia reporters who say one thing if they're liberals and get away with it and if they're conservative they are chastised\nTill the end of the earth we saw just this week with a CNN reporter who use some discussing language on Twitter and all of a sudden all of those people on the left to fend her use of that language and say well it was a a childish mistake but at the same one to chastise Brett Kavanaugh for drinking beer when he was in high school thirty five years ago the double standard\nIs out of control and the American people are tired of it\nRight Leslie What do you think of a idiot were just chances in New Hampshire in the ... district you know New Hampshire well a he's a navy veteran gradually the FBI National Academy

try to do it through you enter your son\nOr your daughter by the way because I suspect that had been Amy berets up there and the hearing room I suspect they would have gone after her to\nYou\nHogwash folks [noise] all you need to\nDo is go back to Amy berets confirmation hearing just a few was the last year Amy berets confirmation hearing on the federal bench when Dianne Feinstein stamp there and pronounce judgment on Amy Barrett because she's a good and decent Catholic woman\nBut dog relatives loudly and yo and that concerns me that's what that's what Senator Feinstein said it was an inquisition an anti Catholic inquisition right there on Capitol Hill nobody nobody cared\n[noise] not a single person care [noise]\nWe've got a big problem in this country close and and I want to talk about this in depth because we've got to be on guard right parts got an interesting story if they um analyzed a Political Report about how the Democrats are now considering\nRamping up the rhetoric and the violence the violence\nIn other words if you didn't think it you know again if you thought what was happening over Kavanaugh was nothing wait until the midterms we've got a lot of time between now and election day and this was the headline from ah from Breitbart Democrats consider becoming more ruthless after losing Brett Kavanaugh battle more ruthless\nI mean we all saw what happened inside that Senate chamber and let me tell you something I called everybody out on it and what happened the mainstream media turned their attack dogs on\nMe I was just stating the obvious you had\nLiterally clawing their way into the into the Supreme Court building they were trying to call through the giant door we we had the video evidence of it ladies and gentlemen were talking about some very very unhinged people these are stark raving mad\nYou stay Todd stop being such a worry wart you're a member of the national Rifle Association for for goodness sakes I point you to another story from Breitbart Kelly Paul the life of Senator Rand Paul's\nDescribing her increasing concerns for the safety of herself and her family has Democrats and the left amplify politically motivated hostility towards Republicans I'm reading here from Breitbart\nShe said quote we updated all of our security systems at home I sleep with a loaded gun by my bed I'm home alone a lot obviously when Rand does in Washington and so I've got deadbolt all around my house\nSo that if someone's in my house when I go to bed I'm dead bolstered them three different levels\nTicketing ladies and gentleman Rand Paul's wife sleeps with a loaded gun by her bedside while their husbands away\nAt the dead bolt all the doors in our house\nIs this really the new normal is this the new normal that we want in America\nAnd I know look I Know conservatives I Know how you think because I'm a conservative and I understand you don't wanna you don't want to fight\nWe just want to be left alone we want the government to be left out of all of our all of our affairs I get that\nLadies and gentleman there comes a time in America where we have to stand\nThe males piling up we don't know what happened from Missouri is RPG that's what they call it\nBut you know Michael doesn't have a point and that point is leads to jump on that we've got to step up and and we're going to have to take care of business on election day or the Democrats are going to take back the house and that is a big big reality\nAnd the Republicans are getting nervous they think they're going to be able to not only hold on to the Senate ... pick up a few seats which is great but they still won't have the sixty [noise]\nI blame Republican leadership in Congress for being in the place they're at right now\n[noise] so look this again though going back to to what they what they did to to judge Kavanaugh and I I just thought the president was trying to make make a a giant wrong writes on national TV [noise]\nHe had to level the playing field one more time because it's ugly out there I Want to reach this was a [noise] and this is from the uh the Charlotte Observer\nCharlotte Mecklenburg schools there's a um there's a photograph and were were posting this at ... dot com a middle school I had a big sign out front south Charlotte middle school\nAnd there was a sign out there I'm In front of the school and it had a profanity directed at justice capital blank cabin off so the school district sent out\nA pie Dylan who's a great person do follow on Twitter she sent me a a photograph of this of this time and the school district to initially said oh that's fake that fake news\nWell it turned out it was a fake news it turned out somebody did go down to the school and somebody did put that message that propane message directed at justice have it all\nOn the side and now the school district is apologizing to our bad [noise]\nThen there's a story out of it semi pile of stuff here there's a story out of Minnesota where a where a teacher has been has apparently been placed on leave or is being investigated because they threatened\nJustice Kavanaugh it's unbelievable what's happening out there unbelievable\nJust a couple of weeks ago we did a story about it\nHere we go I found the story\nMinnesota teacher resigns overkill Kevin all post\nThis was from the television station pay him as speed this is our Fox affiliate there in Minnesota Minneapolis, Minnesota teacher who was placed on leave while the district investigated complaints over a Twitter post that allegedly references killing justice Brett Kavanaugh has resigned\nAnd this is what the teacher wrote\nSo who's going to take one for the team until cabin on\nTwitter account has now been suspended\n\nOn Tuesday independent school district nine one seven superintendent mark ... said the teacher voluntarily resigned and there's no longer employed by the district [noise]\nOkay well here's the problem that teachers should have been fired on the spot because now that that left wing lunatic is going to be able to go someplace else to get a job and we'll be able to poison the minds of other little children around the the fruits of plane\nIt's outrageous let's go to bars to California Ryan welcome to the program Ryan\n... thanks for taking my call how are you I'm well thank you\nI just I just wanted to say I don't want to get you off track and when you were just speaking on but I I find I find their playbook and that's exactly what it is a lot of people are looking at this sports now I find that the Democrats play book extremely weak and I have a hard time not ... not understanding why Democrats don't see the same thing\nWe had the antifa anti putting fell through that was one of their little their little plays in their book that bill through they moved on to the next day they had this big woman's uprising and I love my women in my life and I love and respect women period so I'm not going off on that and we had the huge ordeal about the border and the security\nHe's in the crosshairs now I just don't see Democrats can't see this\nWill look it's it's it's a fair thing and and I have I have um [noise]\nI I own several times I have illustrated at this point by saying be the Democrats are Wylie coyote to the Republicans road runner and that they try all of these things are and at the at the end of the day they do not work\nThe challenge with us though is that Republicans are going to have to fight the good fight there they're going to have to see this through on election day in and Ryan I think I think Republicans have a big challenge in in the follow through\nBut you mentioned antifa I mean they're already back at it uh there's a story over on the lives that\nI'm In Portland I'm just a couple of days ago or antifa literally took over St literally took over streets downtown ended they threaten people who did not ... we're talking motorist they were threatening motorists tear so\nThis is a a still a clear and present danger and and I understand what you're saying here but the Democrats I Believe are going to be are going to embrace violence more when they realized your politics isn't working\n...

everybody together and the best way you can without you know sounding ridiculous\nLike that to me I think that's going to happen do you think that could happen Kelly do you think that the mainstream media would be willing to put down their microphones and declare a truce with the president do you think that's possible\nI don't think they will but uh if he does a press conference to the nation than everyone will hear it and well you make the overture because all those bashing back and forth it's like we treat them like the enemy they treat us like the enemy\nAnd if he makes the first big huge overture with open arms they look come on and we're going to treat you well I don't know what happened in the party I used to love but Democrats deserve better let's stop the insanity with everybody come together and keep control and stay the course of ... the overture\nWell well that's a that's a good and a noble thing Kelly I'm I don't know if that's going to happen but I Can't say

agree with both statements and show your wind down by releasing some of it a different times\nUm we had our set up a before our kids you know became adults are trying to serve the same situation so\nWe put it together we both get hit by a bus with millions of dollars in a trust to be good used only for their good uh we did not leave the money to the guardian we left it into a trust which is the proper thing to do the trust is formed only at your death\nWe put in that trust exactly how the money was to be invested the four types of mutual funds for instance that I recommend we put in that trust that the income off of the investments could be used for the care and feeding of the kids and the use of the guardian that there will beyond that if they needed money out of that trust\nDigit

recommend it should be around a force of your income that's a little more than a forest but it's not it shouldn't be killing you\nUm that are asking you how it should handle that and he told me how to go slow and take my time and be patient with it and it was very helpful but now I'm having another problem whereas\nI'm so basically since then I bought a house remodel the airplane be making a lot of money about fifty thousand dollars a month on gross I'm about yeah about Fifteen thousand dollars a month and I'm just blowing through that crazy\nProstitutes in strip clubs and I'm from therapy all

buying a house in ... now and I'm doing well with that um I've done that since then\nIt's been a long project I finished but I don't know what to do about this how it should handle it ... ... anything else that you would try that I have [laughter]\nHow old are you I'm twenty two and um\nThe inheritance came from who passed away\nSo my dad passed away about two years ago I'm a huge missing plane and

to her I'm right and she says she down at the picture\nI ... as you know job and I'm not a therapist I'm not a trained councilor\nUm I have worked with addicts for Thirty years but goes one hundred percent of the addicts end up broke if if they don't feel their addiction and so you are going to destroy\nYour legacy your dad's legacy with the money that was left to you and you're going to destroy all your future dreams that this money represents if we don't if you don't get the help and he'd the help and\nSite to win against the addiction um sex addictions and pornography addictions are the fastest growing addictions in America today\nAny other addiction\nWe see we still see cocaine we still see 'em and we don't treat for that but we ended up helping them with their finances we still see alcohol\nAnd uh but gambling and sex are both just ... the the\nPornography is a is a is gone crazy because of the Internet access and um uh it's affecting every part of our lives and the good ways in bad ways but the access in this case is causing\nExcess and gets people in real trouble with gambling and porn sex addictions um\nSo you're you you know you named off a couple of the right things and that's getting an essay getting in a um a an anonymous group I'm getting in a with a therapist is the second thing I Would do um the third thing I Would do\nIs um [noise] it it sounds to me like just a guy talking to a young guy an old guy talking to a young guy that all of your family structure has gone it's just you didn't have it with your mom and then your dad died\nAnd so you're you're just left without any authority structure is a twenty year old young guy there's nobody in your life kind of standing over your shoulder is going to stump you when you grew up your life\nYeah I I I Do have a family on my dad's side I'm actually a good way\nBut they know what's going on now so I Know\nThere were I had some problems going on like over a year ago a like a fact and that's just a and I never and whenever I tried it with them they kind of they were like a cheesy oh you're just being effect on this and I never kind of trust again okay with them so I just kind of put off the illusion that\nYou know K. everyone's okay but that's fine so that there are no help is what you're saying yeah OK\nOr no help but they they ... they're they're good but I just I\nUm as a person of faith as a Christian I also believe behaviors or spiritual and show to treat something like this only as a psychological thing is usually a half treatment\nTo treated only like it's a spiritual thing might very well be half treatment but um there there's something that you're obviously searching for and there's something that you're missing 'em that's causing you too I'm literally go crazy in this part of your life right\n[noise] yeah I I I think it's like I'm just beyond lonely I don't know if it's that um but um [noise] I I I don't know honestly\nI think that's probably right that doesn't sound wrong\nHow can I can resonate with that I can imagine you being there in that situation\nAnd it's amazing you can be in one of the largest cities in the world and be lonely\nYou know but you can be it's very very real um the the last component I Would add to it um\nAnd you're asking me so you always get my opinion when you're asking me in that I'm an expert on my opinion [laughter] so ah what I Would tell you do is find a great church and will help you do that and and sit down and get\nPast store oh counseling to go with your other counseling get with some young guys in that church and become friends with some people who have some character\nHave some integrity and that are walking a straight line not perfect there isn't any perfect people over there are at that church ... churches got people in them so you can find that out pretty quick but you will find a book\nThat or synagogue or no you're Jewish okay cool that's more effect then let's get one of the rabbi dude let's get the spiritual element of those going because there's a there's an aspect of that that\nGoes with this and if that's your heritage and that's your your your face and wonderful\nAnd um so yeah I that's the only thing I Know how to tell you though because I Can't just yell at you stop it or you would have already stopped it I mean you're smart guy you've already realizes just ruining your life\nAnd um you know that I Know that um but the nature of an addiction is and you're finding this from the twelve steps is that one of the thing is you realize you're powerless and you know God has to step in\nAnd I've got to put your structures in my life and I've got a you know figure out uh do do some careful psych self analysis and say\nWell loneliness is the issue so how do I fix loneliness well obviously I'm fixing it inappropriately and so how do I fix it was more wisdom and that would be hanging out with good people are that are lifting you up I'm\nObviously not hanging out with paid friends which doesn't work for anybody whatever version of paid to friends\nYou have and yours is one of the more gross\nShow um but that's you know that's the only thing I don't know how to tell you I I I Would make sure I'd really lean into getting a group of people around me that I can trust and if there's\nA group of people that um are are working on a social project that is worthy and you got to get with a bunch of young men doing that and you had some good guys around you um then that's very important I've got a group of guys I get with once a month those were the last night as a matter of fact I'm fifty eight\nUm that group of guys got all our son's together that are in their twenties or the other day and we all encouraged them and they all agreed that they need a group of guys you

I would start as a Jew hair and and I would have\nTwo year work to finish but I Would have to do it a lot for worse than you know I've got a husband and five kids and I have two jobs trying to get through\nAre just through the spraying the budgeting stuff I'm trying to put that in\nRome which I don't know how much does it have you gone much owning your home\nUm we don't even own a home sometime

hostess thanks for joining us opens owns this hour\nA AAA eight to five five two to five\nThat's AAA eight to five five two to five\nJordan is in Indianapolis Hi Jordan welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHey Dave how's it going better than I deserve what's up\nSo as of last week I completed my debt free journey by over forty years panels over eighty four thousand a hundred and Seventy five dollars\nAnd uh well I'm trying to figure out now in terms of buying a house what is the best way to kind of shame and go about it because I've been thinking about just talking the money but also investing some to maybe get a better rate of return by doing that way what what are your thoughts on that\nRight job for a job so I'm not sure you're going to say\nWell at the right now my monthly expenses are only about eleven hundred show out of my salary try to say about twenty two twenty three hundred and if I really buckle down about twenty six hundred\nOkay a month\nCorrect for how long will depend on the type of house I'm looking at like a twenty percent on a down payment on a hundred and fifty probably about at least\nMonths bare minimum that play around fifty percent but by the year should be able to get that if you include bonuses impacts returning\nWhat you don't have today but if you were to invest thirty thousand dollars and it made ten percent in one year you would make three thousand dollars\nCorrect okay\nI'm now we don't have the thirty thousand dollars so it's like over the course of that year you'd have more like an average of Fifteen thousand dollars invested and so if you made ten percent you'd make about Fifteen hundred dollars\n[noise] okay and so\nIf you have thirty thousand dollars at the end of one year to put down on a house or you have thirty one thousand five hundred dollars to put\nDown on a house doesn't matter much without um Iraq\nThe point as as huge saving money on the short term as aggressively as you have the ability to save money um is the secret sauce not the investment\nOkay during this year Jordan is worth thirty grand mutual fund Fifteen hundred in Jordan is the answer to our equation\nOkay that makes sense\nOther words if you just did your budget saved an extra hundred bucks a month you would have made more doing that than you would have on the investment\nYeah so you are the secret sauce do\nYou figure that out now when you start investing over the long term we're talking about twenty or investment uh thirty or investment whether you're Roth IRA or your mutual funds for your kid's college or something like that where you got Twenty years that's when the right of return starts to be very very important but where are you a short window like this\nIt's not worth the risk\nBecause you can put thirty thousand dollars in their can end up being were Fifteen\nIt could go and a half I mean I don't think it will but it could and I I just wouldn't do that I wouldn't do it\nFor a future reference thirty thousand people have no applied for the a loan for the federal loan service for given that ... service forgiveness Ninety six have been granted it\nOut of thirty to out of thirty thousand it's a complete scam it's not happening the government is screwed you show good I'm Glad you're not signed up for that so what is your income please God told me it's large\nIt all my combining I'm married so with my wife ah about two hundred and thirty\nGood [laughter]\nOkay so you're gonna ... you don't get to live like a doctor because you're a broke Dr yeah you're going to live like a college student okay help you out and start buying crap\nCan't answer that have you started buying crap bought bought one thing if one what the car what'd you buy\nA car I got yeah yeah yeah now do you\nYeah what'd you pay for it about fifty thousand okay you're a three hundred and eighty thousand dollars in debt you can never do that again I don't plan to\nCan never do anything like that again you're not only on vacation you're not buying a house you're a broke doctor\nHere's the thing you have this absolutely fabulous income and you are going to destroy your wealth building ability with that income if you don't clear this data and treat it like it's cancer and we're going to hit it with chemo and everything we got\nAnd show that I Am not a band aid off slowly guy that crap does not work and so what I Would do is I woke up in your shoes\nOkay and then I Would start my life the great news is you have the ability to delay pleasure for a greater outcome we know that because you've gone to school your whole freaking life ... and you're very smart academically\nOr you wouldn't be where you are okay and you have the ability to delay pleasure which is a sign of emotional maturity and you have a great intellect let you use those two things and apply them to this mess that you are in called deeply in debt now you can do what the other way but I'll tell you this\nYour colleagues\nAre walking around out there with three hundred four hundred two hundred thousand dollars worth of medical school debt for a decade because they play with it and they never kill the disease the only way you kill it is extreme treatment\nRadical and that's the only way it goes away it's going to stay with you forever otherwise\nSo that's what I Would do if I woke up in your shoes I Would treat it like I Am my broke doctor because I'm a broke doctor and broke doctors don't by fifty thousand dollar cars are going to develop a lotta vacations\nSo you're not doing that crap anymore you get on a tight budget beans and rice rice and beans and clean up this mess because if you take the three year old older than you are now you and go forward with a three or four hundred thousand dollar income and no debt urine it'd be so wealthy it's going to be blinding\nIf you watch what you're doing\nBut if you just ... around with this thing and keep it like it's a pet it's going to be a problem for you Laurie is with us in Boise idaho Hi Laurie how are you\nI have taken my calm sure what's up I'm at this plant where I could be giving and give like now laughter and my mom has been in ...\nOne man and I was wondering what that is considered giving to help get her ... her semi private ram and help pay for her cost of living\nTrue unless somebody giving 'em would it be typing no but it would be giving yes um I don't ... I mean I don't know what you mean by giving but um you have the money to do this or you broke or what\nNo I have the money to gas okay and you're you're out of debt\nYes okay and you have or how much money in your nest egg\nThree hundred thousand and how old are you having good very good okay what's your income about Ninety thousand cool you single or single and what are you talking about spending here\nIt will cost me about a thousand dollars a month\nOkay the twelve ran out of Ninety and you can keep saving doing that 'cause you don't have any that you can keep investing so you retire with dignity\nAnd you can take care of yourself when you're in the exact same situation later right that's what I Want to ... where you don't put yourself exposed\nTo the elements so to speak by helping someone else but I think it's wonderful you have the money you've done a great job you're out of debt and you're in a position and you want to give twelve thousand dollars a year towards your mom's sure no problem with that OK absolutely what do they\nWant to do the right thing and it ... like you said about giving this I just wanted to make sure I live in the right thing I found\nI think you are it's a wonderful gift and uh your your time to her and you know what a wonderful you know act of love towards your mom and and and again you put yourself in a position you have the money to do that without bringing harm to yourself and that's that's what we're talking about live like no one else so later you can live\nIn a Washington Hi Tony how are you I Am well good I'm going to help\nI was curious why you advocate a money market accounts are low yield accounts for like are murky coupon\nCause your emergency fund is not an investment it's insurance\nOkay it's there the principal has to be there and accessible and liquid\nBecause if you're transmission goes out or you lose your job you get your hands on it\nThe right of return is irrelevant it's insurance the protects the things that does make you money to see what happens is people don't have an emergency fund act accessible and they got to set up in something where they get penalized if it comes out is not liquid and then they they have an emergency you know what they do\nThe bar owner four one K. long like a four one K. loan to borrow against or for winter that cash it outwards yet\nAnd they create a mess because they got to do that to save their house 'cause they didn't have money that was liquid they got stuck because there were all worried about trying to make an extra point or two on the money instead of Kurt treating it like it's insurance insurance is ... is an expense\nMoney tied up at one percent you would agree is an expense because it sucks it's horrible right of return\nIt could be invested in be making more\nBut in that portion that five or ten or twenty thousand dollars or whatever it is is just sitting there just as a barrier\nBetween you and life\nAnd that's all it's for it's not an investment it's insurance investments make money insurance costs you money to protect the things that make you money and this is insurance so good question though that that's the whole reasoning behind that thanks for calling him open phones at triple eight\nEight to five five two to five yeah when you find you know why because it's gone on\nIn your bed or having an umbrella\nLet me tell you a story about two families that are very much alike and a lot of ways both families have two working parents and a couple of young kids each is dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family has the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't\nBig difference if one of the parents die\nAnd that does happen their wellbeing would be destroyed\nPaying for the mortgage utilities food and other bills would be impossible let alone saving for education or retirement that's why every day I talk relentlessly about getting term life insurance just go to Sandra insurance dot com or called eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two and\nSee how inexpensive it really is the the family that takes those deliberate steps to be different\nAnd responsible it really does make you the hero of your story and they put you on course for better things ahead\nThat people will be unreal and there are so many people out there trying to act like they got all their crap together and they don't\nWe all stay home and load

this trust when the kid gum comes of age don't necessarily want to give them millions of dollars on a team but in order to wanna hold that over him until he was like thirty five either\nGood good balance I like that I agree with both statements and so you wind down by releasing some of it at different times\nUm we had our set up a before our kids you know became adults are trying to serve the same situation so we put it together we both get hit by a bus or millions of dollars in a trust to beat good used only for the good\nThe money to the guardian we left it into a trust which is the proper thing to do that trust is formed only at your death\nWe put in that trust exactly how the money was to be invested the four types of mutual funds for instance that I record that we put in that trust that the income off of investments can be used for their care and feeding of the kids and the use of the guardian at their will beyond that if they needed money out of that trust\nIn a debate

don't want to hold a too long but also don't want an Eighteen year old to hit the lottery\nAnd they'd be like what we were thinking about doing too so\nYeah so you lay all of that that way and um you know we put hours and nobody gets it until after college age uh and so you might as well go to college\n[laughter]\n... yeah they are just trying to kind of trying to direct a few things from the

how\nWell I Know that all behaviors obviously have a psychology involved um as a person of faith as a Christian I also believe behaviors or spiritual\nAnd show to treat or something like this only as a psychological thing is usually a half treatment to treated only like it's a spiritual thing might very well be a half treatment but um there there's something that you're obviously searching for and there's something that you're missing\n'em that's causing you too I'm literally go crazy in this part of your life right\n[noise] yeah I I I think it's like I'm just beyond lonely I don't know if it's

and become friends with some people who have some character\nHave some integrity and that are walking a straight line not perfect there isn't any perfect people over there are at that church ... in

you would have already stopped it I mean you're smart guy you've already realizes just ruining your life\nAnd um you know that I Know that um but the nature of an addiction is and you're finding this from the twelve steps is that one of the thing is you realize you're powerless\nAnd you know God has to step in and I've got to put some structures in my life and I've got a you know figure out a due to some careful psych self analysis and say well loneliness is the issue so how do I fix loneliness well obviously I'm fixing it inappropriately\nAnd you up I'm obviously not hanging out with paid friends which doesn't work for anybody whatever version of paid to friends you have and yours is one of the more gross\nShow um but that's you know that's the only thing I Know how to tell you I I I

books sold in those states now are critical of him\nYou know I look Trump has made politics\nPopular right\nHe adds so that's why I've said he should get a he should get a little something some residuals\nFor\nPopularity that he has made you look at fear and you'll go much that sold\nOr Michael Wolfe's book or whatever the amount of books being sold because the Trump you know and and not

afraid to say anything and again this is part of why Trump is where he is\nThis is absolutely why Trump is where he is because he is a reaction to the weird wacky politically correct climate where people just got sick and tired of being sick and tired of being sick and tired of told how horrible they are and how bad they are and all of these things that Trump just goes out and he says stuff\nRight or wrong he says stuff and for a lot of people out there they're fine with that they're over this crap there over feeling bad and now we have to believe everybody right of a woman says it's got to be true no truth is\nAnd if the truth comes out that that person did something horrible then you'd go after them in the right way but if the truth stops\nBeing searched for the minute we

Spartacus was out there in Iowa many more heading out there doing their\nThing it's that time of year and I look out there and I said to myself I don't see anybody on the horizon that for me on the left side that that puts fear that the people that are rolling out there seem to be the same old same ... and and there's a question to me ...\nI like her I find her to be interesting I think she was the only one of the Democrats and met with the transition team for Trump and she gets pushed to the side because of this political machine that the Democrats continue to do to throw out there and it makes me laugh because ... they're not they don't have a winning formula to have an identity\nAnd it makes me laugh because I'm thinking to myself well what's to be worried about this\nYou know solutions that the Democratic party and so you know where we're going right now for weeks from today is a bit it's truly an inflection point and the people of this great country have the opportunity to go back and say do we want\nJarring Adler to me the chairman\nCommittee Adam Schiff to be the chairman of the\nPermanent select committee on intelligence Maxine Waters to be the chairman of the financial services committee if that's what you want and you want to have your tax cuts rescinded that's what the Democrats are running on and it's the complete one hundred and eighty degree opposite of what the Republicans are saying the Republicans are looking at more tax cuts to release\nMore economic prosperity to get the burden of government off of people's backed by cutting more regulations look when no one even talks about is the fact that the president said for every one new government regulation in place I'm going to delete to he didn't do that he deleted twenty two so for every one new regulation twenty two have been cut and that is unleash\nMassive amounts of economic prosperity and small businesses giving them the confidence to grow and expand which is something that hasn't happened in this country in decades\nIf you look out though in the future who would you say is going to give Trump or a a crazy run you know I saw a band and out there he likes to have an ... and he thinks somebody to take on from has to be fearless has to be able to\nTo to push back a little if you looked out there in the landscape 'cause it's never too early start talking they're going to them they're out there campaigning already who do you think you know it's you know this person this person right here\nThey have their their their stuff together they can make them\nLook here let me give you who the potential options are Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts okay not a real candidate a Camilla Harris from California Cory Booker from New Jersey\nAnd then a couple of other wannabe senators maybe a governor maybe the mayor of a South Bend Indiana the guy the only guy that I think is a real potential Kennedy and it's because of his financial wherewithal is Michael Bloomberg but he's\nTo write a check he could write a two hundred and fifty million dollar check tomorrow and it's a rounding error in his bank account right and anybody who has that type of access to capital becomes a serious candidate he's a he's a man who has demonstrated\nThat he's put a hundred million to all of his own money to run for mayor of New York into the race and I want to see a guy like Michael Bloomberg because\nI Want to go on remind all the people in this country of how leftist policies are are they exactly how he destroyed New York city after inheriting it from Mayor Giuliani and all of the things that went badly and under his leadership so\nLook I think what you're going to find as you gonna find a a free for all maybe Joe Biden gets into the race maybe Hillary Clinton gets back in the race and not talking about recycling John Kerry into this thing look if that's the case that tells you the Democratic party has\nNo future whatsoever and their four or five leading candidates are all recycled whether it's John Kerry and Joe Biden Hillary Clinton or someone like that these are all failures\nAnd it's time to move in a different direction and I think they're going to try and a balanced this ticket by having a Michael Bloomberg and then you know some ultra progressive ultra liberal on the ticket and that is going to do them which is perfect for us because the American people love with Donald Trump is doing\nThat so I you know what I I again the the Bloomberg thing would be interesting like I said I'm a fan of ... I think she would give everybody runs for money but she's out of sight outta mind she's in Hawaii and I don't think\nIt's to the to the radical left she's not far enough left and she makes too she's when I called the the the the ... the logical left and they don't want any part of that anymore you either you have to be a billionaire with was the name cache or you have to be you know ... or ... warned you have to go off the reservation\nTalking [laughter] I don't think of the ah what'd you think of the the cabinet and stuff I mean it it it was ...\nAn absolute political you know gamesmanship by by the left\nIt was and you have to remember this if it was anybody other than Donald Trump as the ... states\nThey would have folded under the pressure of the left\nUnder the paid protesters onto the fake news\nYou know attacking Kevin uh everyday attacking his family going after his credibility right some other Republican president would have pulled Brett Kavanaugh's nomination but not Donald Trump he stood fast he doubled down and he was ultimately proven to be right and if you saw last night what he said he had to apologize\nTo Brett Kavanaugh for the way that he was treated by the media and that's a sad state of affairs because it wasn't that long ago when Supreme Court justices would be confirmed in a widely bipartisan manner whether a sixty Seventy or eighty votes\nNot this one anymore because Washington is so broken that now we're fighting over something that potentially you know Brett Kavanaugh had a beer thirty five years ago when he was Eighteen years old is a senior in high school and that's what we're arguing over and it's just insanity and I think what this what this nomination process has done\nIs unified the Republican Party and it reminded them that complacency is not an option and if they want to stay home because their economy is better their homeland security's better their national security for the economic security is better than there are consequences for staying home and the cabin I'll Fight is a clear reminder of that\nIt's crazy crazy last question appreciates criminal court Lewandowski rock and Roll Hall of fame has made the announcement of their ... nominees this year ... you know no ... got nominated ...
